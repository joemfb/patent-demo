<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">When a handover request for performing a handover of a terminal (<b>70</b>) from a macro cell C<b>1</b> to a CSG cell C<b>2</b> is received from an SeNB <b>10</b> (S<b>8</b>), a base station (TeNB) (<b>40</b>) of the CSG cell C<b>2</b> transmits a handover response in accordance with a handover enabled/disabled state (S<b>12</b>). The handover response includes an identifier of the terminal (<b>70</b>) in the CSG cell C<b>2</b>. Upon receiving the response, the SeNB (<b>10</b>) notifies the identifier to the terminal (<b>70</b>) (S<b>14</b>). The TeNB (<b>40</b>) repeatedly transmits a dedicated signal containing a handover command via a dedicated channel set using the identifier at an interval shorter than a gap period (S<b>18</b>). Accordingly, whether or not access is permitted can be judged promptly and a smooth handover can be realized.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is based upon and claims the benefit of priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-023207, filed on Feb. 1, 2008, and from Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-118558, filed on Apr. 30, 2008, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a handover technique, and particularly, to a technique for performing a handover by judging whether or not access by a terminal to a cell that is a handover destination is permitted or not.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Techniques for performing a handover of a terminal engaged in communication between different cells have been conventionally known. For example, Section 10.1.2.1.1 of &#x201c;3GPP TS 36.300 V8.3.0&#x201d; prescribes a procedure of a handover between macro cells. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a flow chart of a handover described in &#x201c;3GPP TS 36.300 V8.3.0&#x201d;. Hereinafter, a conventional handover procedure will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">First, a terminal (UE: User Equipment) receives a signal from a neighboring base station and measures propagation path quality. The terminal notifies a measurement result to a currently-connected base station (Source eNB, hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;SeNB&#x201d;) by means of a measurement report (&#x201c;2. MEASUREMENT REPORTS&#x201d; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). The measurement report includes a cell identifier (cell ID) of a base station having good propagation path quality as seen from the terminal, access information of the terminal (Tracking Area ID, hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;TAID&#x201d;), and the like. The SeNB determines a base station with a good propagation path status as a handover destination base station (Target eNB, hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;TeNB&#x201d;) of the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The SeNB has a list of neighbor cells (Neighbor Cell List, hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;NCL&#x201d;). An NCL is a list of cell IDs of base stations neighboring the SeNB, access information (TAID), and the like. The SeNB uses the NCL to transmit a handover request signal (&#x201c;4. HANDOVER REQUEST&#x201d; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) to a base station (TeNB) corresponding to a cell ID notified by the measurement report.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Upon receiving the handover request signal, the TeNB determines whether or not a handover can be performed based on the status of remaining resources and the like. When the TeNB determines that a handover can be performed, the TeNB transmits a handover response signal (&#x201c;6. HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE&#x201d; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) to the SeNB.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Upon receiving the handover response signal, the SeNB transmits a handover execution instruction signal (&#x201c;7. HANDOVER COMMAND&#x201d; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) to the terminal. The handover execution instruction includes information necessary for the terminal for subsequent uplink synchronization such as a terminal identification ID (C-RNTI) in the TeNB.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Upon receiving the handover execution instruction, the terminal transmits a Random Access Preamble to the handover destination base station (TeNB) and starts the uplink synchronization (&#x201c;9. SYNCHRONIZATION&#x201d; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). Upon receiving the Random Access Preamble, the TeNB performs an uplink allocation for the terminal and notifies allocation information to the terminal (&#x201c;10. UL ALLOCATION+TA FOR UE&#x201d; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). When connection with the TeNB is successful, the terminal transmits a handover confirmation signal (&#x201c;11. HANDOVER CONFIRM&#x201d; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>) to the TeNB and notifies that handover processing by the terminal has been completed. This concludes a basic outline of handover processing between macro cells.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The 3GPP LTE project is evaluating installing an indoor base station (Home eNB) in a home to construct a CSG (Closed Subscriber Group) cell. A plurality of CSG cells are provided in a single macro cell. Unlike a base station of a macro cell, a base station of a CSG cell is subjected to access restriction as seen in a table in Section 6.3.1a.3 in &#x201c;3GPP TS 36.311 V8.0.0&#x201d;. Therefore, a terminal is only able to connect to an access-permitted base station. Even if the terminal detects a base station with exceptional propagation path quality, the terminal is unable to connect to the base station without access permission.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Problems To Be Solved By the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to confirm whether or not access to a base station of a CSG cell is permitted, the terminal must confirm a TAID contained in a Scheduling Unit (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;SU-1&#x201d;) that is a system information transmitted from the base station. The terminal collates its own TAID and the TAID of the base station, and if the two TAIDs match, determines that access to the base station is permitted.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A signal transmitted from the base station of a CSG cell may sometimes be communicated over a different frequency from a signal transmitted from the base station of a macro cell. In this case, in order to receive an SU-1 transmitted from the base station and confirm whether or not access is permitted, the terminal must temporarily suspend communication with the base station of the macro cell. In the present specification, a period during which communication with the base station of the macro cell is temporarily suspended shall be referred to as a &#x201c;gap period&#x201d;. Even during a gap period, the terminal is capable of detecting a radio wave from a cell being communicated over a different frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Since a CSG cell has the characteristics described above, the terminal must conceivably receive an SU-1 transmitted from the handover destination during the gap period and determine whether or not access to the CSG cell that is the handover destination is permitted.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a diagram illustrating, based on specifications currently being formulated, operations during a handover from a base station of a macro cell to a base station of a CSG cell. Note that the flow depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a virtual flow that attempts to describe improvements in the flow currently being formulated in an easily comprehensible manner, and is not heretofore known. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, UE denotes a terminal, SeNB denotes a base station of a macro cell that is a handover source, and TeNB denotes a base station of a CSG cell that is a handover destination. The TeNB periodically transmits an SU-1 to the terminal. Due to time sharing that switches between a period where a signal transmitted from the SeNB is received and a period where a signal transmitted from the TeNB is received (gap period), the terminal receives signals from both base stations having different frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The terminal detects radio waves of the SeNB and the TeNB, and transmits a report on the reception qualities of the radio waves to the SeNB that is in communication with the terminal. The SeNB judges whether a handover should be performed or not based on the reception qualities of the SeNB and the TeNB. For example, the SeNB compares the reception qualities of the SeNB and the TeNB and judges that a handover to the TeNB should be performed when the reception quality of the TeNB is better than the reception quality of the SeNB. When a handover should be performed, a handover request is transmitted to the TeNB. Having received the handover request, the TeNB judges a handover enabled/disabled state based on whether there are resources for connecting a new terminal and the like, and transmits a handover response to the SeNB. In this case, let us assume that the TeNB sends a handover OK response.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Next, based on the report from the terminal, the SeNB determines whether access from the terminal to the TeNB is permitted or not. More specifically, upon receiving the SU-1, the terminal detects a TAID in the SU-1, compares the terminal TAID with the SeNB TAID, and judges whether access is possible or not. The terminal includes access permission information in the measurement report and transmits the same to the SeNB. When access from the terminal to the base station is permitted, the SeNB transmits a handover command to the terminal. Upon receiving the handover command, the terminal transmits a RACH preamble to the SeNB and performs an operation to connect to the TeNB. The following operations have been omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, in order to judge whether or not access to an SeNB that is the handover destination is permitted, the terminal must receive an SU-1 transmitted from the SeNB. Unless an SU-1 is transmitted during a gap period, there will be no more opportunities to receive an SU-1 until the next gap period. In addition, there is no guarantee that an SU-1 will be transmitted at a timing that coincides with the next gap period. For example, according to the specifications currently being formulated, a gap period exists every several 10 ms and only has a length of 6 ms. Unless an SU-1 is transmitted during a 6-ms gap period, there will be no more opportunities to receive an SU-1 until the next gap period. In addition, there is no guarantee that an SU-1 will be transmitted at a timing that coincides with the next gap period. Therefore, a judgment of whether or not access is permitted may take time and may result in a time-consuming handover operation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Accordingly, in consideration of the background described above, it is an object of the present invention to provide a base station and a radio communication system capable of promptly judging whether access is permitted or not and realizing a handover in a smooth manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Means For Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A radio communication system according to the present invention comprises a first base station that controls communication with a terminal in a first cell and a second base station that controls communication with a terminal in a second cell contained in the first cell, wherein: the first base station transmits a handover request for performing a handover of the terminal from the first cell to the second cell to the second base station; the second base station transmits a handover response that is a response to the handover request and which includes an identifier of the terminal in the second cell to the base station of the first cell; the first base station notifies the identifier contained in the handover response to the terminal; and the second base station repeatedly transmits a dedicated signal containing a handover command via a dedicated channel set using the identifier at an interval shorter than a period during which the terminal is able to receive data from the base station of the second cell.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A radio communication system according to another aspect of the present invention comprises a first base station that controls communication with a terminal in a first cell and a second base station that controls communication with a terminal in a second cell contained in the first cell, wherein: the first base station transmits a handover request for performing a handover of the terminal from the first cell to the second cell to the second base station; the second base station transmits a handover response that is a response to the handover request to the base station of the first cell; and the second base station shortens a transmission interval of a system information containing access information to be transmitted through a common channel in comparison to before receiving the handover request when performing a handover in response to the handover request.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As will be described below, the present invention also includes other aspects. As such, the disclosure of the present invention is intended to provide a part of the present invention and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention as described and claimed herein.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A base station according to an embodiment controls, in a network including a first cell and a second cell contained in the first cell, communication with a terminal in the second cell, the base station comprising: a handover request receiver that receives a handover request for performing a handover of the terminal from the first cell to the second cell from a base station of the first cell; a handover response transmitter that transmits a handover response that is a response to the handover request and which includes an identifier of the terminal in the second cell to the base station of the first cell, and causes the base station of the first cell to notify the identifier to the terminal; and a dedicated signal transmitter that repeatedly transmits a dedicated signal containing a handover command to the terminal via a dedicated channel set using the identifier at an interval shorter than a period during which the terminal is able to receive data from the base station of the second cell.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As described above, the base station of the second cell transmits a handover response including an identifier in response to a handover request to the base station of the first cell, and causes the base station of the first cell to notify the identifier to the terminal. Accordingly, a dedicated signal can be transmitted to the terminal using a dedicated channel by merely performing a process of returning a handover response to the base station of the first cell. In addition, since a transmission interval of the dedicated signal is set shorter than a period during which the terminal is able to receive data from the base station of the second cell, the terminal is able to receive the dedicated signal during a first receivable period after the start of transmission of the dedicated signal and a handover can be performed in a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The base station may further comprise a RACH preamble command receiver that receives a RACH preamble command transmitted from the terminal in accordance with the dedicated signal, wherein the dedicated signal transmitter may stop transmission of the dedicated signal when the RACH preamble command is received or when a predetermined period of time has lapsed from the start of transmission of the dedicated signal.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">By stopping transmission of the dedicated signal when a predetermined period of time has lapsed as described above, in the event that a handover of the terminal to the second cell is not performed, the base station of the second cell can release resources of the dedicated channel at an appropriate timing.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">A base station according to another embodiment controls, in a network including a first cell and a second cell contained in the first cell, communication with a terminal in the second cell, the base station comprising: a handover request receiver that receives a handover request for performing a handover of the terminal from the first cell to the second cell from a base station of the first cell; a handover response transmitter that transmits a response to the handover request to the base station of the first cell; and a system information transmitter that transmits a system information containing access information through a common channel, wherein the system information transmitter shortens a transmission interval of the system information as compared to before receiving the handover request when performing a handover in accordance with the handover request.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As described above, the base station of the second cell shortens a transmission interval of a system information as compared to before receiving a handover request when performing a handover in accordance with the handover request. Accordingly, the probability of the terminal failing to receive the system information can be lowered and a handover can be performed in a short period of time. Moreover, by setting the transmission interval of the system information shorter than a period during which data is receivable from the base station of the second cell, the system information can be received during a first receivable period.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The base station may further comprise a RACH preamble command receiver that receives a RACH preamble command transmitted from the terminal in accordance with the dedicated signal, wherein the system information transmitter may restore the transmission interval of the system information to an original transmission interval when the RACH preamble command is received or when a predetermined period of time has lapsed after shortening the transmission interval of the system information.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">By stopping transmission of the dedicated signal when a predetermined period of time has lapsed as described above, the base station of the second cell can restore resources of the common channel to an original usage state.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A base station according to another embodiment controls, in a network including a first cell and a second cell contained in the first cell, communication with a terminal in the first cell, the base station comprising: a measurement report receiver that receives, from the terminal, a measurement report including a cell identifier of the second cell whose radio wave has been detected by the terminal and quality information of the radio wave; a handover request transmitter that transmits a handover request to a base station to which access from the terminal is permitted among base stations of the second cell having a cell identifier judged to be a handover destination when it is judged, based on the measurement report, that a handover of the terminal from the first cell to the second cell should be performed; a handover response receiver that receives a handover response that is a response to the handover request and which includes an identifier of the terminal in the second cell from the second cell; and an identifier transmitter that notifies the identifier contained in the handover response to the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">By notifying the identifier included in a response to a handover request to the terminal, a dedicated signal can be transmitted using a dedicated channel from the base station of the second cell to the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A base station according to another embodiment controls, in a network including a first cell and a second cell contained in the first cell, communication with a terminal in the first cell, the base station comprising: a measurement report receiver that receives, from the terminal, a measurement report including a cell identifier of the second cell whose radio wave has been detected by the terminal and quality information of the radio wave; a handover request transmitter that transmits a handover request to a base station of the second cell having a cell identifier judged to be a handover destination when it is judged, based on the measurement report, that a handover of the terminal from the first cell to the second cell should be performed; a handover response receiver that receives a handover response to the handover request from the second cell; an access permission state notification receiver that receives information on an access permission state of the second cell from the terminal; and a handover command transmitter that transmits a handover command to the terminal when access to the base station of the second cell is permitted.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As described above, the base station of the first cell transmits a handover request to all base stations having a cell identifier judged to be a handover destination regardless of whether access from the terminal is permitted or not. Accordingly, the base station of the second cell can transmit information regarding access permission to the terminal. For example, by having the base station of the second cell transmit a system information containing access information at an interval that is shorter than an ordinary system information transmission interval, the terminal can promptly comprehend whether access to the base station of the second cell is permitted or not.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the base station described above, the handover request transmitter may transmit the handover request to a base station to which access from the terminal is permitted among base stations of the second cell having a cell identifier to which it is judged that a handover should be performed based on the measurement report.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As described above, the base station of the first cell transmits a handover request to a base station accessible by the terminal among base stations of the second cell having a cell identifier judged to be a handover destination. Accordingly, since resources for transmitting a handover request can be saved and the number of base stations of the second cell receiving the handover request can be reduced, the processing load on base stations of the second cell can be alleviated.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A base station according to another embodiment comprises: a receiver that receives a measurement report from a terminal; a judging unit that judges whether a handover of the terminal should be performed or not based on the received measurement report; and a transmitter that transmits, when it is judged that a handover of the terminal should be performed, an instruction for changing a transmission frequency of a system information to a base station device that is a handover destination.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As described above, by shortening the transmission interval of a system information to be transmitted by the base station of the handover destination as compared to before the judgment to perform a handover is made, the probability of the terminal failing to receive the system information can be lowered and a handover can be performed in a short period of time. Moreover, by setting the transmission interval of the system information shorter than a period during which data is receivable from the base station of the second cell, the system information can be received during a first receivable period.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The base station according to the present invention may further comprise a handover command transmitter that transmits a handover command including a reception instruction of a system information to be transmitted from a base station that is a handover destination to the terminal when a handover-permitted response is received from the base station that is the handover destination.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Accordingly, the terminal may switch to processing for receiving a system information to be transmitted from the base station of the handover destination so as to reliably receive the system information.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A radio communication system according to the present invention comprises a first base station that controls communication with a terminal in a first cell and a second base station that controls communication with a terminal in a second cell contained in the first cell, wherein: the first base station transmits a handover request for performing a handover of the terminal from the first cell to the second cell to the second base station; the second base station transmits a handover response that is a response to the handover request and which includes an identifier of the terminal in the second cell to the base station of the first cell; the first base station notifies the identifier contained in the handover response to the terminal; and the second base station repeatedly transmits a dedicated signal containing a handover command to the terminal via a dedicated channel set using the identifier at an interval shorter than a period during which the terminal is able to receive data from the base station of the second cell.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As described above, since the first base station notifies an identifier of the terminal in the second cell to the terminal, the second base station can transmit a dedicated signal to the terminal using a dedicated channel by merely performing a process of returning a handover response to the base station of the first cell. In addition, since a transmission interval of a dedicated signal including a handover command is set shorter than a period during which data can be received from the base station of the second cell, the terminal is able to receive the dedicated signal during a first receivable period after the start of transmission of the dedicated signal and a handover can be performed in a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A radio communication system according to another embodiment comprises a first base station that controls communication with a terminal in a first cell and a second base station that controls communication with a terminal in a second cell contained in the first cell, wherein: the first base station transmits a handover request for performing a handover of the terminal from the first cell to the second cell to the second base station; the second base station transmits a handover response that is a response to the handover request to the base station of the first cell; and the second base station shortens a transmission interval of a system information containing access information to be transmitted through a common channel in comparison to before receiving the handover request when performing a handover in response to the handover request.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As described above, when the second base station receives a handover request, by shortening the transmission interval of a system information to be transmitted as compared to before receiving the handover request, the probability of the terminal failing to receive the system information can be lowered and a handover can be performed in a short period of time. Moreover, by setting the transmission interval of the system information shorter than a period during which data is receivable from the base station of the second cell, the system information can be received during a first receivable period.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A handover method according to the present invention is to be performed by a base station that controls, in a network including a first cell and a second cell contained in the first cell, communication with a terminal in the second cell, the handover method comprising the steps of: receiving a handover request for performing a handover of the terminal from the first cell to the second cell from a base station of the first cell; transmitting a handover response that is a response to the handover request and which includes an identifier of the terminal in the second cell to the base station of the first cell, and causing the base station of the first cell to notify the identifier to the terminal; and repeatedly transmitting a dedicated signal containing a handover command to the terminal via a dedicated channel set using the identifier at an interval shorter than a period during which the terminal is able to receive data from the base station of the second cell.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As described above, the base station of the second cell transmits a handover response including an identifier in response to a handover request and causes the base station of the first cell to notify the identifier to the terminal. Accordingly, the base station of the second cell can transmit a dedicated signal to the terminal using a dedicated channel by merely performing a process of returning a handover response to the base station of the first cell. In addition, since a transmission interval of the dedicated signal is set shorter than a period during which the terminal is able to receive data from the base station of the second cell, the terminal is able to receive the dedicated signal during a first receivable period after the start of transmission of the dedicated signal and a handover can be performed in a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A handover method according to another embodiment is to be performed by a base station that controls, in a network including a first cell and a second cell contained in the first cell, communication with a terminal in the second cell, the handover method comprising the steps of: receiving a handover request for performing a handover of the terminal from the first cell to the second cell from a base station of the first cell; transmitting a response to the handover request to the base station of the first cell; and shortening a transmission interval of a system information containing access information to be transmitted through a common channel in comparison to before receiving the handover request when performing a handover in response to the handover request.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">As described above, by shortening the transmission interval of a system information as compared to before receiving the handover request when a handover request is received, the probability of the terminal failing to receive the system information can be lowered and a handover can be performed in a short period of time. Moreover, by setting the transmission interval of the system information shorter than a period during which data is receivable from the base station of the second cell, the system information can be received during a first receivable period.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Hereinafter, a radio communication system and a base station according to embodiments of the present invention will be described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow chart illustrating operations of a handover performed by a radio communication system according to a first embodiment. Configurations of the radio communication system and a base station will now be described before presenting a description of a handover operation.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram illustrating an overall configuration of a radio communication system <b>1</b>. The radio communication system <b>1</b> comprises a base station <b>10</b> of a macro cell C<b>1</b>, base stations <b>40</b> of a plurality of CSG cells C<b>2</b> contained in the macro cell C<b>1</b>, and a terminal <b>70</b>. Since a handover from a base station of the macro cell C<b>1</b> to a base station of the CSG cell C<b>2</b> will be described in the present embodiment, a base station <b>10</b> of the macro cell C<b>1</b> shall be denoted as &#x201c;SeNB <b>10</b>&#x201d; and base stations <b>40</b> of the CSG cell C<b>2</b> as &#x201c;TeNB <b>40</b>&#x201d;. Note that the macro cell C<b>1</b> corresponds to the &#x201c;first cell&#x201d; and the CSG cell C<b>2</b> to the &#x201c;second cell&#x201d; as respectively set forth in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The CSG cell C<b>2</b> is given a cell ID. Although a cell ID is an identifier of the cell, there may be cases where cells having the same ID exist in the macro cell C<b>1</b>. The CSG cell C<b>2</b> has a TAID as access information. The base station of the CSG cell C<b>2</b> permits access from a terminal <b>70</b> having the same TAID.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of the base station (SeNB) <b>10</b> that is a handover source. The SeNB <b>10</b> comprises a base station communication interface (eNB Communication IF) <b>12</b> that is a communication interface with the TeNB <b>40</b> of the CSG cell C<b>2</b>, a terminal communication interface (US Communication IF) <b>14</b> that is a communication interface with the terminal <b>70</b>, a NCL <b>16</b> storing information on neighbor cells, and a controller <b>18</b> that controls communication with the TeNB <b>40</b> and the terminal <b>70</b>. The NCL <b>16</b> contains cell IDs, access information (TAID), and the like of base stations neighboring the SeNB.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The controller <b>18</b> comprises a measurement report receiver <b>20</b>, a handover judging unit <b>22</b>, a handover request transmitter <b>24</b>, a handover response receiver <b>26</b>, and an identifier transmitter <b>28</b>. Moreover, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a configuration necessary for performing a handover, the SeNB <b>10</b> has configurations necessary for communication control and the like in addition to the configuration described above.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The measurement report receiver <b>20</b> receives a measurement report transmitted from the terminal <b>70</b>. The measurement report contains a cell ID of a base station whose radio wave is detected by the terminal <b>70</b> and information on the reception quality of the radio wave. The handover judging unit <b>22</b> judges whether or not a handover should be performed based on the measurement report. For example, the handover judging unit <b>22</b> compares the reception qualities of the SeNB <b>10</b> and the TeNB <b>40</b>, and judges that a handover to the TeNB <b>40</b> should be performed when the reception quality of the TeNB <b>40</b> is better than that of the SeNB <b>10</b>. When the HO judging unit <b>22</b> judges that a handover should be performed, the handover request transmitter <b>24</b> transmits a handover request (HO request) to the base station of the handover destination. The handover request transmitter <b>24</b> determines a cell ID and a TAID of the CSG cell C<b>2</b> using data in the NCL <b>16</b>. Subsequently, the handover request transmitter <b>24</b> transmits a handover request to CSG cells C<b>2</b> having the same TAID as the TAID of the terminal <b>70</b> that is the transmission source of the measurement report among the CSG cells C<b>2</b> having the cell ID notified in the measurement report from the terminal <b>70</b>. The handover response receiver <b>26</b> receives a handover response (HO response) transmitted from the TeNB <b>40</b> in response to the handover request. The identifier transmitter <b>28</b> transmits an identifier contained in the handover response to the terminal <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of the base station (TeNB) <b>40</b> that is the handover destination. The TeNB <b>40</b> comprises a base station communication interface (eNB Communication IF) <b>42</b> that is a communication interface with the SeNB <b>10</b> of the macro cell C<b>1</b>, a terminal communication interface (DE Communication IF) <b>44</b> that is a communication interface with the terminal <b>70</b>, and a controller <b>46</b> that controls communication with the SeNB <b>10</b> and the terminal <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The controller <b>46</b> comprises a handover request receiver <b>48</b>, a handover enabled/disabled state judging unit <b>50</b>, a handover response transmitter <b>52</b>, a dedicated signal transmitter <b>54</b>, and a RACH preamble receiver <b>56</b>. Moreover, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a configuration necessary for performing a handover, the TeNB <b>40</b> has configurations necessary for communication control and the like in addition to the configuration described above.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The handover request receiver <b>48</b> receives a handover request transmitted from the SeNB <b>10</b>. The handover enabled/disabled state judging unit <b>50</b> judges whether a handover is enabled or disabled based on whether there are new resources that can be allocated to the terminal <b>70</b>, and the like. The handover response transmitter <b>52</b> transmits a handover response in response to the handover request. In this case, the handover response contains an identifier to be used by the TeNB <b>40</b> to identify the terminal <b>70</b> in the second cell. When it is judged that a handover can be performed, the dedicated signal transmitter <b>54</b> transmits a dedicated signal containing a handover command to the terminal <b>70</b> using a dedicated channel. The RACE preamble receiver <b>56</b> receives a RACE preamble transmitted from the terminal <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Next, operations of the radio communication system according to the first embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates operations during a handover of the terminal <b>70</b>, in communication with the SeNB <b>10</b>, to the TeNB <b>40</b>. The terminal <b>70</b> periodically transmits a measurement report to the SeNB <b>10</b> (S<b>2</b>). The SeNB <b>10</b> compares the reception quality of a radio wave from the SeNB <b>10</b> with the reception quality of a radio wave from the TeNB <b>40</b> to judge whether or not a handover should be performed (S<b>4</b>). For example, when the reception quality of a radio wave from the TeNB <b>40</b> is better than the reception quality of a radio wave from the SeNB <b>10</b> by a predetermined threshold or more, the SeNB <b>10</b> judges that a handover should be performed. When the reception quality of the radio wave from the SeNB <b>10</b> is better than that of the TeNB <b>40</b>, the SeNB <b>10</b> judges that a handover should not be performed. When it is judged that a handover should not be performed (NO in S<b>4</b>), the SeNB <b>10</b> awaits the reception of a next measurement report.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">When it is judged that a handover should be performed (YES in S<b>4</b>), the SeNB <b>10</b> extracts TeNBs <b>40</b> having an identifier corresponding to the cell ID notified in the measurement report from the NCL <b>16</b>. Subsequently, the SeNB <b>10</b> determines a TeNB <b>40</b> having the same TAID as the TAID of the terminal <b>70</b> among the extracted TeNBs <b>40</b> of the CSG cell C<b>2</b> (S<b>6</b>), and judges whether or not the TeNB is a base station of a CSG cell (S<b>8</b>). When the TeNB is a CSG cell (YES in S<b>8</b>), a handover request is transmitted to the determined TeNB <b>40</b> (S<b>10</b>). When the TeNB is not a CSG cell (NO in S<b>8</b>), a handover of the macro cell is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The TeNB <b>40</b> having received the handover request judges whether a handover can be performed or not (S<b>12</b>). When a handover can be performed (YES in S<b>12</b>), the TeNB <b>40</b> transmits a handover response to the SeNB <b>10</b> (S<b>14</b>). Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a case where a handover can be performed. When a handover cannot be performed (NO in S<b>12</b>), the radio communication system <b>1</b> does not perform operations of step S<b>14</b> and thereafter and terminates the flow. When a handover can be performed, an identifier of the terminal <b>70</b> with respect to the TeNB <b>40</b> is to be included in the handover response. In the present embodiment, a C-RNTI is used as the identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Upon receiving the handover response from the TeNB <b>40</b> (S<b>14</b>), the SeNB <b>10</b> transmits the C-RNTI contained in the handover response to the terminal <b>70</b> (S<b>16</b>). By receiving the C-RNTI transmitted from the SeNB <b>10</b>, the terminal <b>70</b> can now receive the dedicated signal addressed to the terminal <b>70</b> to be transmitted from the TeNB <b>40</b> via a dedicated channel.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">When it is judged in S<b>12</b> that a handover can be performed, the TeNB <b>40</b> starts transmission of the dedicated signal to the terminal <b>70</b> via the dedicated channel (S<b>18</b>). In this case, the dedicated signal includes access information and information contained in a handover command such as information necessary for uplink synchronization. The TeNB <b>40</b> repeatedly transmits the dedicated signal until the terminal <b>70</b> receives the dedicated signal and a RACH preamble is transmitted to the TeNB <b>40</b> (S<b>20</b>). The interval of repetitive transmission of the dedicated signal from the TeNB <b>40</b> to the terminal <b>70</b> is to be set shorter than a gap period of the terminal <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The terminal <b>70</b> judges whether the dedicated signal has been received or not (S<b>22</b>). The terminal <b>70</b> can receive the dedicated signal if the dedicated signal is transmitted during the gap period of the terminal <b>70</b>. Upon receiving the dedicated signal (YES in S<b>22</b>), the terminal <b>70</b> confirms whether access to the TeNB <b>40</b> has been permitted or not. In the present embodiment, in step S<b>6</b>, since the SeNB <b>10</b> only transmits a handover request to a TeNB <b>40</b> that can be accessed from the terminal <b>70</b>, the terminal <b>70</b> has been permitted access to the TeNB <b>40</b> transmitting the dedicated signal. Therefore, a reception of the dedicated signal signifies that access to the TeNB <b>40</b> that is the transmission source of the dedicated signal has been permitted. If unable to receive the dedicated signal over a certain period of time (NO in S<b>22</b>), a judgment of handover failure is made and transmitted to the SeNB (S<b>24</b>). In this case, &#x201c;a certain period of time&#x201d; signifies a period of time corresponding to an interval between gap periods.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Upon receiving the dedicated signal, the terminal <b>70</b> starts processing for a handover based on the handover command contained in the dedicated signal. Specifically, the terminal <b>70</b> transmits a RACH preamble for starting uplink synchronization to the TeNB <b>40</b> (S<b>26</b>), and starts processing to connect to the TeNB <b>40</b>. Upon receiving the RACH preamble, the TeNB <b>40</b> stops transmission of the dedicated signal (S<b>28</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">When the terminal <b>70</b> does not receive the dedicated signal over a certain period of time, the terminal <b>70</b> is conceivably approaching a CSG cell C<b>2</b> to which access is not permitted. In this case, &#x201c;a certain period of time&#x201d; signifies a period of time corresponding to an interval between gap periods. When a certain period of time lapses from the start of transmission of the dedicated signal, the TeNB <b>40</b> stops transmission of the dedicated signal. This concludes the description of the radio communication system <b>1</b> and the base stations <b>10</b> and <b>40</b> according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The TeNB <b>40</b> according to the first embodiment adopts a configuration that transmits a handover response containing a C-RNTI and causes the SeNB <b>10</b> to notify the C-RNTI to the terminal <b>70</b>. Accordingly, a dedicated channel of the TeNB <b>40</b> can be allocated to the terminal <b>70</b> before receiving an handover command instruction and a handover process can be performed in a smooth manner.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Next, an advantageous effect gained by transmitting the dedicated signal at a transmission interval that is shorter than the gap period will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of a flow of signals transmitted and received during a handover by the radio communication system <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, since the TeNB <b>40</b> according to the first embodiment repeatedly transmits the dedicated signal at a shorter interval than the gap period, at least one transmission of the individual will occur within a gap period. Therefore, the terminal <b>70</b> is able to reliably receive the dedicated signal during the first gap period and a handover can be performed in a short period of time.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Next, a radio communication system according to a second embodiment will be described. In the same manner as the first embodiment, a radio communication system according to the second embodiment comprises a base station (SeNB) <b>10</b> of a macro cell C<b>1</b>, base stations (TeNBs) <b>40</b> of a plurality of CSG cells C<b>2</b> contained in the macro cell C<b>1</b>, and a terminal <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of the base station (SeNB) <b>10</b> that is a handover source.

<p id="p-0148" num="0147">When it is judged that a handover should be performed (YES in S<b>32</b>), the SeNB <b>10</b> extracts a TeNB <b>40</b> having an identifier corresponding to the cell ID notified in the measurement report from the NCL <b>16</b> (S<b>34</b>). Subsequently, the SeNB <b>10</b> judges whether or not the TeNB is a base station of a CSG cell (S<b>36</b>). When the TeNB is a CSG cell (YES in S<b>36</b>), the SeNB <b>10</b> transmits a handover request to the extracted TeNB <b>40</b> of the CSG cell C<b>2</b> (S<b>36</b>). When the TeNB is not a CSG cell (NO in S<b>36</b>), a handover of the macro cell is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The TeNB <b>40</b> having received the handover request judges whether a handover can be performed or not (S<b>40</b>), and when a handover can be performed, the TeNB <b>40</b> transmits a handover response to the SeNB <b>10</b> (S<b>42</b>). When a handover cannot be performed (NO in S<b>38</b>), the radio communication system does not perform operations of step S<b>40</b> and thereafter and terminates the flow.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Upon receiving the handover response, the SeNB <b>10</b> transmits a handover command to the terminal <b>70</b> (S<b>54</b>). The handover command contains an instruction to the terminal to receive an SU-1 signal. Having received the handover command, the terminal <b>70</b> starts reception processing for the SU-1 signal and receives the SU-1 signal. Since the terminal <b>70</b> can receive the SU-1 signal at a transmission frequency band of the TeNB <b>40</b> after receiving the handover command, a gap period need not be set to receive a signal from the TeNB <b>40</b>. Therefore, the terminal <b>70</b> is capable of receiving the SU-1 signal from the TeNB by normal reception processing that does not involve providing a gap period. The terminal <b>70</b> reads out an TAID of the TeNB <b>40</b> from the SU-1 signal. The terminal <b>70</b> compares the TAID of the TeNB <b>40</b> with its own TAID and judges whether access to the TeNB <b>40</b> is permitted or not (S<b>62</b>). If access to the TeNB <b>40</b> has been permitted (YES in S<b>62</b>), a RACH preamble for starting uplink synchronization is transmitted to the TeNB <b>40</b> (S<b>66</b>). On the other hand, if access to the TeNB <b>40</b> is not permitted (NO in S<b>64</b>), a judgment of handover failure is made and transmitted to the SeNB <b>10</b> (S<b>47</b>). This concludes the description of the radio communication system according to the fourth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In the fourth embodiment, since the terminal <b>70</b> switches reception frequency bands by having the SeNB <b>10</b> instruct the terminal <b>70</b> with a handover command to receive an SU-1 signal, the SU-1 signal can be received without using a gap period. Accordingly, the terminal <b>70</b> can now reliably perform access confirmation without having the TeNB <b>40</b> change the transmission interval of an SU-1 signal, thereby enabling a reduction in handover time.</p>

<p id="p-0155" num="0154">While a detailed description of a base station, a radio communication system, and a handover method according to the present invention has been given by citing embodiments thereof, the present invention is not limited to the embodiments described above. While examples in which access information is notified to a terminal using a dedicated signal or an SU-1 signal have been described in the embodiments presented above, access information may also be notified to the terminal by other signals. In this case, the period to time required by a handover can be reduced by shortening a transmission interval of a signal for notifying access information as compared to before receiving a handover request or, preferably, by setting the transmission interval so as to be shorter than a gap period.</p>

<heading id="h-0014" level="1">Sixth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">First, a background of a radio communication system according to a sixth embodiment will be described. In addition to access information of cells contained in an SU-1 signal, a system information of a base station includes an access-prohibited cell list (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;APCL&#x201d;) as a list of cells that prohibit access by a terminal. The APCL is notified to the terminal from a core network via the base station. A terminal having received the APCL cannot be handed over to a cell included in the list.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">At present, a system where CSG cells and macro cells use different frequencies (hereunder, referred to as system <b>1</b>) is being considered. In the system <b>1</b>, a terminal is able to distinguish between a CSG cell and a macro cell solely by differences in frequency. On the other hand, as a future system (hereunder, referred to as system <b>2</b>), a system is conceivable in which a CSG cell can be distinguished from a macro cell by cell IDs instead of frequencies. In the system <b>2</b>, a terminal is able to distinguish between a CSG cell and a macro cell by cell IDs. In the system <b>2</b>, a cell ID list of neighboring CSG cells is defined as a CSG cell list and notified in the form of a system information to the terminal from a core network via the base station</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">If such a system should materialize, in order to maintain compatibility of system informations between systems, a terminal used in the system <b>1</b> that is an existing system must be usable in the system <b>2</b> that is a future network.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">As described above, since a terminal of the system <b>1</b> is not capable of distinguishing between a CSG cell and a macro cell by cell IDs, there is a possibility that the terminal may erroneously judge a CSG cell of the system <b>2</b> to be a macro cell. Generally, since the number of CSG cells having access restrictions is significantly large, attempts to access a CSG cell often result in not being able to connect to the CSG cell due to access restrictions, causing wasting of communication resources. The sixth embodiment provides a radio communication system designed to prevent wasting of communication resources when a terminal of the system <b>1</b> is used in the system <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Next, a radio base station and a terminal according to the sixth embodiment will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of a base station (an SeNB and a TeNB will be collectively referred to as an eNB) <b>100</b>. The eNB <b>100</b> comprises a core NW communication interface <b>102</b> that is a communication interface with a core network, a terminal communication interface <b>104</b> that is a communication interface with a terminal <b>120</b>, and a controller <b>106</b> that controls communication with the core NW and the terminal <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The controller <b>106</b> comprises an access-prohibited cell list receiver (hereinafter referred to as an &#x201c;APCL receiver&#x201d;) <b>108</b>, a CSG cell list receiver <b>110</b>, a new access-prohibited cell list generator (hereinafter referred to as an &#x201c;new APCL generator&#x201d;) <b>112</b>, and a system information transmitter <b>114</b>. Moreover, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates a configuration necessary for system information transmission, the eNB <b>100</b> has configurations necessary for communication control and the like in addition to the configuration described above.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The APCL receiver <b>108</b> receives an APCL from the core network and transmits the APCL to the new APCL generator <b>112</b>. The CSG cell list receiver <b>110</b> receives a CSL cell list from the core network and transmits the CSL cell list to the new APCL generator <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref> is a diagram illustrating an example of an APCL, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref> is a diagram illustrating a CSG cell list. An APCL is a list of cell IDs identifying cells that do not permit access. A CSG cell list is a list indicating a range of cell IDs usable to identify a CSG cell. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref>, cell IDs <b>300</b> to <b>350</b> and <b>450</b> to <b>500</b> are used as CSG cell IDs. A terminal of the system <b>2</b> can identify whether a cell identified by a cell ID is a macro cell or a CSG cell based on whether the cell ID is included in these ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">The new APCL generator <b>112</b> loads an APCL from the APCL receiver <b>108</b> and a CSG cell list from the CSG cell list receiver <b>110</b> and generates a new APCL.

In this example, whether a cell ID in a new APCL indicates an access-prohibited cell or a neighbor CSG cell is determined based on whether the cell ID is included in a cell ID range defined in the CSG cell list.</p>

<p id="p-0180" num="0179">When a CSG cell list from the CSG cell list receiver <b>110</b> and a new APCL from the new APCL generator <b>112</b> are inputted, the system information transmitter <b>114</b> transmits the inputted new APCL as a system information to a terminal <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> is a diagram illustrating a configuration of the terminal (<b>0</b>E) <b>120</b>.

<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The controller <b>124</b> comprises a new access-prohibited cell list receiver (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;new APCL receiver&#x201d;) <b>126</b>, a CSG cell list receiver <b>128</b>, and a cell list extractor <b>130</b>. The new APCL receiver <b>126</b> receives a new APCL from a system information transmitted from the base station. The CSG cell list receiver <b>128</b> receives a CSG cell list from the system information transmitted from the base station. Based on the inputted new APCL and CSG cell list, the cell list extractor <b>130</b> extracts an APCL and a neighbor CSG cell list. In this case, the APCL is extracted by excluding cells included in the CSG cell list from the new APCL. The neighbor CSG cell list is generated from the excluded CSG cells.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Moreover, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, when flags are introduced into a new APCL, an APCL and a neighbor CSG cell list can be extracted using the flags.

<p id="p-0184" num="0183"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> is a flow chart illustrating operations of APCL extraction of the terminal <b>120</b> in the radio communication system according to the sixth embodiment. The core network <b>140</b> transmits an APCL and a CSG cell list to the base station (eNB) <b>100</b> (S<b>90</b>, S<b>92</b>). The base station <b>100</b> generates a new APCL from the APCL and the CSG cell list (S<b>94</b>). The base station <b>100</b> transmits the generated new APCL as a system information to the terminal <b>120</b> (S<b>96</b>). The terminal <b>120</b> extracts an APCL and a neighbor CSG cell list based on the new APCL transmitted as the system information (S<b>98</b>). Accordingly, based on the APCL and the neighbor CSG cell list, the terminal <b>120</b> can distinguish cells to which access is permitted from cells to which access is not permitted and perform appropriate radio communication processing.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In the sixth embodiment, since a new APCL that integrates an APCL and a neighbor CSG cell list is used, an entire new APCL may appear to indicate access-prohibited cells from the perspective of a terminal of the system <b>1</b> that is incapable of identifying CSG cells and macro cells by cell IDs (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</figref>). In other words, a terminal of the system <b>1</b> can treat a new APCL as an ordinary APCL. Accordingly, since a neighbor CSG cell of the system <b>2</b> will also be determined as an access-prohibited cell, the terminal of the system <b>1</b> can generally apply an access restriction to perform control so as not to access CSG cells that are highly likely to deny access from the terminal, thereby preventing wasting of communication resources.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">As described in the above embodiment, since a terminal of the system <b>2</b> can extract an APCL and a neighbor CSG cell list from a new APCL, the terminal can perform appropriate radio communication processing using these lists.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">From the above, with the sixth embodiment, a terminal of the system <b>1</b> can operate without incident in the system <b>2</b>, and a terminal of the system <b>2</b> can receive an APCL and a neighbor CSG cell list without incident.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">While an example in which a new APCL is transmitted to the terminal <b>120</b> as a system information has been described in the present embodiment, information for transmitting a new APCL, is not limited to a system information and a new APCL may be transmitted in the form of other information.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">While there has been described what is at present considered to be the preferred embodiments of the present invention, it will be understood that various modifications may be made therein, and it is intended to cover in the appended claims all such modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
