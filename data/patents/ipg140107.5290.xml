<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, as vehicles have become intelligent, various control technologies are applied to vehicles. Those control technologies involve a technology for sensing a lane using a camera to control a vehicle not to depart from the lane, or to control the vehicle to follow the center of the lane on the basis of the lane sensing results.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with the conventional lane-keeping control technologies, until lane-keeping control is practically conducted after a lane departure situation is sensed for a vehicle, a time delay may be caused due to various reasons, which may lead to failure in preventing the lane departure of the vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present invention is to calculate a look-ahead distance in accordance with a vehicle condition so as to conduct lane-keeping control efficiently on the basis of the calculated look-ahead distance.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Another object of the present invention is to previously estimate a vehicle condition at a distance ahead of the vehicle so as to conduct lane-keeping control for the vehicle stably and efficiently on the basis of the estimated results.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of the present invention is to set a look-ahead distance which makes it possible to acquire lane information for allowing lane-keeping control to be correctly conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also, another object of the present invention is to adaptively set a look-ahead distance on the basis of at least one of a road condition and a vehicle condition to acquire lane information so as to conduct more correct lane-keeping control.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In order to accomplish these objects, there is provided a lane-keeping control system which calculates a look-ahead distance on the basis of a vehicle condition, and conducts lane-keeping control on the basis of the calculated look-ahead distance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, the inventive lane-keeping control system includes: an estimated control entry boundary arrival time setting unit for setting an estimated control entry boundary arrival time to be taken by a vehicle to arrive at a control entry boundary, wherein the control entry boundary is set for entering lane-keeping control for the vehicle; a look-ahead distance calculating unit for calculating a look-ahead distance on the basis of the estimated control entry boundary arrival time and the vehicle's velocity; a crosswise error calculating unit for calculating a crosswise error of the vehicle estimated ahead of the look-ahead distance; a lane-keeping control entry determining unit for determining whether to enter the lane-keeping control on the basis of the crosswise error and the control entry boundary; a lane-keeping control torque producing unit for producing lane-keeping control torque in a direction opposite to the lane-departure direction when it is determined that it is necessary to enter lane-keeping control as the result of the determination by the lane-keeping control entry determining unit, wherein the lane-keeping control torque urges the vehicle to return to the inside of the control entry boundary; and a torque release unit for releasing the lane-keeping control torque when it is determined that the vehicle has returned to the inside of a control release boundary, after the lane-keeping control torque was produced, wherein the control release boundary is set for releasing the lane-keeping control for the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, the lane-keeping control system includes: a look-ahead distance setting unit for setting a look-ahead distance on the basis of at least one information item of a vehicle condition and a road condition; a lane information acquiring unit for acquiring lane information in accordance with the set look-ahead distance; an auxiliary steering torque calculating unit for calculating auxiliary steering torque for lane-keeping control on the basis of the acquired lane information; and a lane-keeping control unit for conducting lane-keeping control by producing the calculated auxiliary steering torque at a steering control apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In order to achieve the above-mentioned objects, there is also provided a lane-keeping control method provided by the inventive lane-keeping control system, wherein the method includes the steps of: calculating an estimated control entry boundary arrival time to be taken by a vehicle to arrive at a control entry boundary, wherein the control entry boundary is set for entering lane-keeping control for the vehicle; calculating a look-ahead distance on the basis of the estimated control entry boundary arrival time and the vehicle's velocity; calculating a crosswise error of the vehicle estimated ahead of the look-ahead distance; determining whether to enter the lane-keeping control on the basis of the crosswise error and the control entry boundary; producing lane-keeping control torque in a direction opposite to the lane-departure direction when it is determined that it is necessary to enter lane-keeping control as the result of the determination by the lane-keeping control entry determining unit, wherein the lane-keeping control torque urges the vehicle to return to the inside of the control entry boundary; and releasing the lane-keeping control torque when it is determined that the vehicle has returned to the inside of a control release boundary after the lane-keeping control torque was produced, wherein the control release boundary is set for releasing the lane-keeping control for the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As described above, in accordance with the present invention, it is possible to conduct lane-keeping control efficiently on the basis of a look-ahead distance calculated in accordance with the vehicle condition.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Also, in accordance with the present invention, it is possible to estimate in advance a vehicle condition at a distance ahead of the vehicle, and to conduct stable and efficient lane-keeping control in accordance with the estimated result.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Consequently, it is possible to solve a problem that has prevented lane-keeping control from being conducted when the line-keeping control is required, due to a time delay in a system.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, in accordance with the present invention, lane-keeping control can be conducted more precisely, so that the entry and release of lane-keeping control can be prevented from being frequently caused.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In addition, in accordance with the present invention, it is possible to set a look-ahead distance which enables acquisition of lane information adapted to allow lane-keeping control to be correctly conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Moreover, in accordance with the present invention, lane information can be obtained by adaptively setting a look-ahead distance in accordance with at least one of a vehicle condition and a road condition, whereby lane-keeping control can be conducted more precisely.</p>

In the following description, the same elements will be designated by the same reference numerals although they are shown in different drawings. Further, in the following description of the present invention, a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted when it may make the subject matter of the present invention rather unclear.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In addition, terms, such as first, second, A, B, (a), (b) or the like may be used herein when describing components of the present invention. Each of these terminologies is not used to define an essence, order or sequence of a corresponding component but used merely to distinguish the corresponding component from other component(s). It should be noted that if it is described in the specification that one component is &#x201c;connected,&#x201d; &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; or &#x201c;joined&#x201d; to another component, a third component may be &#x201c;connected,&#x201d; &#x201c;coupled,&#x201d; and &#x201c;joined&#x201d; between the first and second components, although the first component may be directly connected, coupled or joined to the second component.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram for a lane-keeping control system <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The inventive lane-keeping control system <b>100</b> exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> determines whether to enter lane-keeping control with reference to a vehicle condition estimated at a predetermined distance ahead of the vehicle in consideration of a time delay and a time required for increasing torque (hereinafter, to be referred to as &#x201c;torque increasing time&#x201d;), which are entailed in the system, and if it is determined that lane-keeping control should be entered, the inventive lane-keeping control system <b>100</b> produces lane-keeping control torque required for the line-keeping control.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the inventive lane-keeping control system <b>100</b> calculates a look-ahead distance on the basis of an estimated control entry boundary arrival time, which has been previously set, and the current vehicle's velocity, and if the calculated look-ahead distance is d<b>1</b>, the inventive lane-keeping control system <b>100</b> estimates that a crosswise error (which may be also referred to as &#x201c;crosswise position value&#x201d;) of the vehicle <b>200</b> estimated ahead of the look-ahead distance d<b>1</b> would not arrive at the previously set control entry boundary, and hence prevents lane-keeping control from being entered.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The estimated control entry boundary arrival time setting unit <b>110</b> may set an estimated control entry boundary arrival time to meet a system transfer characteristic condition as expressed by Equation 1 below, in which the system transfer characteristic condition is determined by a camera data operation period, a vehicle network transmission period, and a torque increasing time.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In Equation 1, T<sub>entry </sub>is an estimated control entry boundary arrival time, t<b>1</b> is a camera data operation period, and t<b>2</b> is a vehicle network transmission period.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The look-ahead distance calculating unit <b>120</b> may calculate a look-ahead distance by multiplying the estimated control entry boundary arrival time (T<sub>entry</sub>) and the current vehicle's velocity as in Equation 2 below, wherein the estimated control entry boundary arrival time is set by the estimated control entry boundary arrival time setting unit <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The crosswise error calculating unit <b>130</b> may calculate the crosswise error of the vehicle estimated ahead of the look-ahead distance, which is calculated by the look-ahead distance calculating unit <b>120</b>, on the basis of the lane information acquired from the camera (for example, the lane information may include the position information of the center of the corresponding road), and the vehicle's current yaw rate. Here, the crosswise error may mean a distance of a certain point from a reference point (e.g. the center of the road), wherein the crosswise error may be referred to as a crosswise position value since if it is assumed that the position value of the reference point is zero, the distance equal to the crosswise error may be the position value as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, when calculating the crosswise error, the crosswise error calculating unit <b>130</b> may reflect the vehicle's current behavior condition so as to more precisely calculate the vehicle's crosswise error estimated ahead of the look-ahead distance.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The above-mentioned crosswise error calculating method will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> by way of an example.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a view for describing a method for calculating a crosswise error of a vehicle estimated ahead of the look-ahead distance of the vehicle by reflecting the vehicle's current behavior condition.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if it is assumed that the reference point is the center of the road, the crosswise error calculating unit <b>130</b> may obtain x(0), that is the crosswise error of the center of the road, from lane information, or may grasp the crosswise error by receiving an input from the lane information acquiring unit.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The crosswise error calculating unit <b>130</b> calculates the crosswise error at the look-ahead distance d from a camera on a straight line (i.e. the crosswise distance between a point away from the camera by the look-ahead distance d on a straight line and the center of the road). At this time, the crosswise error at the look-ahead distance d from the sensor (e.g., camera) on a straight line is referred to as x(c).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thereafter, the crosswise error calculating unit <b>130</b> estimates the crosswise movement extent x(v) estimated ahead of the look-ahead distance d by reflecting the behavior condition. The crosswise movement extent x(v) estimated ahead of the look-ahead distance d may be calculated using Equation 3 below.
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>x</i>(<i>v</i>)=<i>d*YR/v</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;Equation 3<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In Equation 3, d is a look-ahead distance, YR is a vehicle's yaw rate, and v is a vehicle's velocity.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, the crosswise error calculating unit <b>130</b> may finally calculate the vehicle's crosswise error X(d) estimated ahead of the look-ahead distance d by subtracting the estimated vehicle's crosswise movement extent x(v) from the calculated x(c) (that is, X(d)=x(c)&#x2212;x(v)).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the inventive lane-keeping control system <b>100</b> may further include a boundary setting unit <b>170</b>, wherein the boundary setting unit <b>170</b> determines a virtual line by connecting first points positioned inside of a road at a first distance from a lane indication line and sets the virtual line as a control entry boundary, and the boundary setting unit <b>170</b> determines a virtual line by connecting second points positioned inside of the road at a second distance from the control entry boundary and sets the virtual line as a torque release boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Depending on how the entry boundary is set by the boundary setting unit <b>170</b>, the lane-keeping control entry may be too frequently conducted. In particular, if a road's width is narrow, a vehicle's crosswise error may arrive at the control entry boundary too easily, which may cause the lane-keeping control to be frequently conducted. Therefore, the boundary setting unit <b>170</b> should set the control entry boundary more carefully according to lane information, such as a road's width and curvature (which may be lane information acquired through a camera).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, the boundary setting unit <b>170</b> may set the control entry boundary on the basis of a road's width, wherein as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, if a road's width is within a predetermined road's width range, it is possible to set the control entry boundary in such a manner that the first distance from a lane indication line to the inside of the road (that is, the distance between the lane indication line and the control entry boundary) is proportional to the road's width. That is, if the road's width is narrow, the control entry boundary may be set to be close to the lane indication line, and if the road's width is wide, the first distance may be set longer so as to set the control entry boundary to be remote from the lane indication line.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In addition, in setting the control entry boundary and the control release boundary, the boundary setting unit <b>170</b> should adjust and set the distance between the control entry boundary and the control release boundary more carefully in order to prevent the entry and release of the lane-keeping control from being unnecessarily repeated. For example, if the distance between the control entry boundary and the control release boundary is set to be excessively narrow, the lane-keeping control may be released too easily after the lane-keeping control entry is conducted, and then the lane-keeping control entry may be conducted too easily.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Such frequent repetition of lane-keeping control entry and release may easily occur on a road with a large curvature but may rarely occur on a road with a small curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Considering the fact that the frequency of repetition of lane-keeping control entry and release is varied depending on a road's curvature, the boundary setting unit <b>170</b> may set the control entry boundary to coincide with the control release boundary on a straight road (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>), but not to coincide with the control release boundary on a curved road (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">If it is generalized to set the control entry boundary and the control release boundary in consideration of the fact that the frequency of repetition of lane-keeping control entry and release is varied depending on a road's curvature, the boundary setting unit <b>170</b> may adjust the distance between the control entry boundary and the control release boundary depending on the road's curvature, wherein if the road's curvature is within a predetermined road's curvature range, the boundary setting unit <b>170</b> may adjust the distance between the control entry boundary and the control release boundary by setting the distance between the control entry boundary and the control release boundary to be proportional to the road's curvature (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">After the lane-keeping control entry was conducted as a vehicle arrived at or passed over the control entry boundary, if the vehicle is positioned between the control entry boundary and the control release boundary as the vehicle's crosswise error enters into the inside of the control entry boundary, and if the road is curved, the lane-keeping control torque producing unit <b>150</b> produces torque for urging the vehicle to follow the curved road so as to maintain the lane-keeping control without releasing the control.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a lane-keeping control system <b>700</b> in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention,</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the inventive lane-keeping control system <b>700</b> includes: a look-ahead distance setting unit <b>710</b> for setting a look-ahead distance on the basis of one or more information items of a vehicle condition and a road condition; a lane information acquiring unit <b>720</b> for acquiring lane information depending on the set look-ahead distance; an auxiliary steering torque calculating unit <b>730</b> for calculating auxiliary steering torque for controlling lane-keeping on the basis of the acquired lane information; and a lane-keeping control unit <b>740</b> for conducting lane-keeping control by producing the calculated auxiliary steering torque at a steering control apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The vehicle condition may include a vehicle's velocity, and the road condition may include at least one of a road's curvature and width.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The look-ahead distance setting unit <b>710</b> may sum a first look-ahead distance corresponding to the vehicle's velocity, a second look-ahead distance corresponding to the road's curvature, and a third look-head distance corresponding to the road's width, and set the value obtained thereby as the look-ahead distance.</p>

<claim-text>calculating an estimated control entry boundary arrival time to be taken by a vehicle to arrive at a control entry boundary, wherein the control entry boundary is set for entering lane-keeping control for the vehicle;</claim-text>
<claim-text>calculating a look-ahead distance on the basis of the estimated control entry boundary arrival time and a vehicle velocity;</claim-text>
<claim-text>calculating a crosswise error of the vehicle estimated ahead of the look-ahead distance;</claim-text>
<claim-text>determining whether to enter the lane-keeping control on the basis of the crosswise error and the control entry boundary;</claim-text>
<claim-text>applying to the vehicle a lane-keeping control torque in a direction opposite to a lane-departure direction when it is necessary to enter the lane-keeping control as a result of the step of determining, such that the lane-keeping control torque urges the vehicle to return to the inside of the control entry boundary; and</claim-text>
<claim-text>releasing the lane-keeping control torque when the vehicle has returned to the inside of the control release boundary after the lane-keeping control torque was applied.</claim-text>
