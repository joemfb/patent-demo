<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A blood glucose level information processing apparatus, method and program provide blood glucose values and blood glucose value information within a period or range desired by a user without imposing cumbersome operation on the user. The apparatus, method and program provide blood glucose values and blood glucose value information within a period or desired range by acquiring blood glucose levels measured by a blood glucose level measuring device and date/time of measurement at which the blood glucose levels are measured, displaying a line graph obtained by plotting the blood glucose values within a predetermined period. A slide bar can also be provided, for example on a graph display screen image, whereupon if the slide bar is moved, only the blood glucose values corresponding to a preceding period backdating in response to the amount of movement of the slide bar are plotted on a line graph along a time series.</p>

The apparatus, method and program can be used, for example, in a situation in which the transition of the blood glucose level measured periodically by an external blood glucose level measuring instrument is represented by and provided as a graph.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND DISCUSSION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Nowadays, it is reported that the number of diabetics all over Japan amounts to approximately 6,000,000. Among them, approximately 2,000,000 diabetics go to hospital regularly as outpatients while the others are potential patients. Therapy for such diabetics includes alimentary therapy, ergotherapy, pharmacotherapy, insulin therapy and so forth. Whichever therapy is applied, daily blood glucose level management of each patient is very significant.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, even in the case where a patient himself/herself uses a blood glucose level measuring instrument to periodically measure the blood glucose level, it may not be easy to grasp the transition of the blood glucose level with respect to time and blood glucose level information such as a maximum value, a minimum value and a mean value of the blood glucose level. Many patients feel happy and anxious in turn with a variation of the measured blood glucose level, but cannot necessarily recognize accurately in what manner the variation of the blood glucose level is associated with the patient's way of living, the amount of a food ingested, the time zone and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, while the number of doctors as specialists for diabetes is approximately 10,000 over Japan, the number of diabetics is approximately 6,000,000 as described above. Therefore, one doctor must examine 600 patients. Further, since it is estimated that there is a tendency that diabetics increase in the future, a blood glucose level information processing apparatus is demanded which allows the blood glucose level to be periodically measured by the patient to be managed readily and allows a doctor to relatively easily handle the transition of the blood glucose level with respect to time and the blood glucose level information and make a diagnosis appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one of such blood glucose level information processing apparatus as just described, a blood glucose level measured by a blood glucose level measuring instrument and the date/time of the measurement at which the blood glucose level is measured are acquired, and the blood glucose level is classified based on the date/time of the measurement into one of several time slots, namely &#x201c;before breakfast,&#x201d; &#x201c;after breakfast,&#x201d; &#x201c;before lunch,&#x201d; &#x201c;after lunch,&#x201d; &#x201c;before supper,&#x201d; &#x201c;after supper,&#x201d; &#x201c;before going to bed,&#x201d; &#x201c;late at night&#x201d; and so forth. An example of such an apparatus is described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-60803.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Consequently, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus can provide blood glucose levels and blood glucose level information based on the blood glucose levels statistically to a doctor and so forth for the individual time slots. Further, by displaying the blood glucose levels and the blood glucose level information based on the blood glucose levels as a graph along a time series based on the date/time of the measurement, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus allows a doctor or the like to easily grasp a tendency of the blood glucose levels and the blood glucose level information.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The conventional blood glucose level information processing apparatus has a problem in that, when blood glucose levels and blood glucose level information are displayed as a graph along a time series based on the date/time of measurement, the time axis cannot be varied readily, and therefore, cumbersome operation is imposed on a user when blood glucose levels and blood glucose level information within a period or range desired by the user are to be provided readily.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, in a conventional blood glucose level information processing apparatus, when a blood glucose value is to be sorted into one of time slots, it is sorted based on the date/time of measurement. Therefore, when actual meal time is different from the set time, the blood glucose level cannot be sorted appropriately. Accordingly, there is a problem that an accurate blood glucose value and accurate blood glucose value information for each time slot cannot be provided.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to one aspect, a blood glucose level information processing apparatus comprises acquisition means for acquiring blood glucose levels measured by an external blood glucose level measuring instrument and for acquiring a measurement date and a measurement time at which each of the blood glucose levels is measured; and display control means for controlling a display to display a blood glucose level graph which plots the acquired blood glucose levels measured during a first range of measurement dates and at least during one of the measurement times, and to also display a bar which is operable to select a second range of measurement dates different from the first range of measurement dates. The display control means controls the display to display a different blood glucose level graph, plotting the acquired blood glucose levels measured during the second range of measurement dates and at least during the one measurement time, if the bar is operated, wherein the first range of measurement dates and the second range of measurement dates contain a common number of the measurement dates so that the blood glucose level graph which plots the acquired blood glucose levels measured during the first range of measurement dates and the different blood glucose level graph which plots the acquired blood glucose levels measured during the second range of measurement dates both plot the acquired blood glucose levels measured during the same number of days.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">By simply operating the bar (e.g., moving a slide bar according to the embodiment disclosed as an example), a blood glucose level graph obtained by plotting the blood glucose levels corresponding to the preceding period in response to the amount of movement of the slide bar can be displayed. Thus, the blood glucose levels and the blood glucose level information within the period or range desired by a user can be provided readily without imposing cumbersome operation on the user.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also disclosed is a blood glucose level information processing program stored in a non-transitory computer readable medium to cause a computer to: acquire measured blood glucose levels, together with measurement dates and measurement times at which each of the blood glucose levels is measured; and display a first blood glucose level graph plotting the acquired blood glucose levels measured during a first range of measurement dates and at least during one of the measurement times, while also displaying a bar which is operable to select a second range of measurement dates different from the first range of measurement dates. The program also causes the computer to change the display upon operation of the bar to display a second blood glucose level graph plotting the acquired blood glucose levels measured during the second range of measurement dates and at least during the one measurement time, the first and second blood glucose level graphs plotting the acquired blood glucose levels over the same number of measurement dates.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another aspect of the disclosure here involves a blood glucose level information processing apparatus comprising: acquisition means for acquiring blood glucose levels measured by an external blood glucose level measuring instrument and to acquire measurement dates and measurement times at which the blood glucose levels are measured; sorting means for sorting the measured blood glucose levels acquired by the acquisition means into a plurality of time slots based on the acquired measurement dates and measurement times, each time slot encompassing a predetermined time period; and display control means for controlling a display unit to display at least some of the acquired blood glucose levels in a table having one axis representing dates and another axis representing the plural time slots and to display, upon selecting one of the blood glucose values in a current time slot within the table, a popup menu having one button selectable to direct the selected blood glucose value to be moved from the current time slot to a different time slot preceding the current time slot and an other button selectable to direct the selected blood glucose value to be moved a different time slot succeeding the current time slot. A changing means changes the selected blood glucose level to the preceding time slot when the one button of the pop-up menu is selected and for changing the selected blood glucose level to the succeeding time slot when the other button of the pop-up menu is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">If an arbitrary blood glucose level is selected from among the blood glucose levels displayed in a table, the popup menu is displayed, and by simply selecting the forward button or the rearward button of the popup menu, the time slot of the arbitrary blood glucose level can be changed. Thus, a more accurate blood glucose level and more accurate blood glucose level information than ever can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A blood glucose level information processing method includes: acquiring blood glucose levels as well as a measurement date and a measurement time at which each blood glucose level was measured; sorting the acquired blood glucose levels into a plurality of respective time slots which each include a respective period of time so that acquired blood glucose levels measured during each respective time period are sorted into the respective time slot; displaying at least some of the acquired blood glucose levels in a table which has one axis representing dates and another axis representing the plural time slots; and displaying a popup menu when one of the blood glucose values displayed in the table in a current time slot is selected, the popup menu including one button selectable to direct the selected blood glucose value to be moved from the current time slot to a different time slot preceding the current time slot and an other button to direct the selected blood glucose value to be moved a different time slot succeeding the current time slot. The method additionally includes moving the selected blood glucose level to the preceding time slot when the one button of the pop-up menu is selected and moving the selected blood glucose level to the succeeding time slot when the other button of the pop-up menu is selected.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">(1) Configuration of the Blood Glucose Level Information Processing System</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a blood glucose level information processing system <b>1</b> according to one embodiment disclosed here by way of example. The blood glucose level information processing system <b>1</b> includes a blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b>, a printer <b>3</b> and a blood glucose level measuring unit <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> is comprised of, for example, from a personal computer and is connected to the printer <b>3</b>, for example, by a USB (Universal Serial bus) cable. Further, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> is configured such that it can carry out optical communication with the blood glucose level measuring unit <b>4</b> through an optical communication module (not shown) connected by an RS232C cable.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The blood glucose level measuring unit <b>4</b> includes a blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> for allowing a patient to measure the blood glucose level, and a communication module <b>6</b> for communicating with the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> and the printer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> samples the blood of a patient by means of an exchangeable measuring tip <b>7</b> provided at an end thereof, causes the sampled blood and a reagent enclosed in the measuring tip <b>7</b> to react with each other and optically reads the color of the blood after the reaction to measure the concentration of glucose in the blood to obtain a blood glucose level as a result of the measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> has a clock function in the inside thereof and counts the time based on the date/time inputted by a user, for example, upon initialization. The blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> stores a blood glucose level measured thereby as measurement data, for example, into a nonvolatile memory provided in the inside of the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> itself together with the date/time of the measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Here, since the blood glucose level varies when the patient east (e.g., at the time of a mea) and depending upon the time of day (time slot) and the way of living, in order to grasp the variation, a patient will carry out measurement of the blood glucose level plural times each day such as, for example, before breakfast, after breakfast, before lunch, after lunch, before supper, after supper, before going to bed and late at night using the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> is configured such that it can store measurement data, for example, for 150 times of measurement. If the patient measures blood glucose level, for example, four times a day, then the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> can store measurement data for approximately 36 days.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> includes an optical communication transmission/reception unit at a position opposing an optical communication transmission/reception unit <b>9</b>A of the communication module <b>6</b> and can optically communicate with the communication module <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">If an optical communication button <b>8</b>A on the blood glucose level measuring unit <b>4</b> is operated or depressed by the user in a state in which the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> is placed on the communication module <b>6</b>, the communication module <b>6</b> causes the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> to transmit measurement data stored in the memory of the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> through the optical communication transmission/reception unit. The communication module <b>6</b> then receives the measurement data by optical communication through the optical communication transmission/reception unit <b>9</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The communication module <b>6</b> then transmits the measurement data received from the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> to the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> through another optical communication transmission/reception unit <b>9</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If a print button <b>8</b>B is operated or depressed by the user in the state in which the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> is placed on the communication module <b>6</b>, the communication module <b>6</b> receives measurement data from the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> similarly as in the case in which the optical communication button <b>8</b>A is operated or depressed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Then, the communication module <b>6</b> transmits the measurement data to the printer <b>3</b> to which the communication module <b>6</b> is connected by a cable so that the blood glucose levels and the date/time of the measurements of the measurement data can be printed in an order beginning with the older date of time of measurement by the printer <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">(2) Circuit Configuration of the Blood Glucose Level Information Processing Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> includes a CPU (Central Processing Unit) <b>11</b>, a ROM (Read Only Memory) <b>12</b>, a RAM (Random Access Memory) <b>13</b>, a hard disk drive <b>14</b>, a display unit <b>15</b> in the form of an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) unit or the like, an operation unit <b>16</b> including a mouse, a keyboard and so forth, an external connection interface unit <b>17</b> and a clock unit <b>18</b> for counting the time, all connected to each other by a bus <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b>, the CPU <b>11</b> reads out a basic program stored in the ROM <b>12</b> and develops the basic program into the RAM <b>13</b>, and supervisorily controls the entire blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> in accordance with the basic program. Further, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> develops various application programs stored in the ROM <b>12</b> or the hard disk drive <b>14</b> into the RAM <b>13</b> and executes various processes in accordance with the various application programs.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> is connected to an optical communication module (not shown) through an RS232C cable connected to the external connection interface unit <b>17</b> and connected to the printer <b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) through a USB cable connected to the external connection interface unit <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Accordingly, if the optical communication button <b>8</b>A of the communication module <b>6</b> is operated or depressed by the user and measurement data are transmitted from the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> to the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> through the communication module <b>6</b>, then the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> receives the measurement data through the external connection interface unit <b>17</b> and stores the measurement data into the hard disk drive <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">At this time, since it is expected that the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> receives measurement data from a large number of blood glucose level measuring devices <b>5</b>, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> stores measurement data into folders provided, for example, in the hard disk drive <b>14</b> and individually associated with different patient names.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">(3) Blood Glucose Level Information Process</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">If the blood glucose level information processing program is selected in response to an operation of the operation unit <b>16</b> by a user (in this instance, for example, a doctor), then the CPU <b>11</b> reads out the blood glucose level information processing program from the hard disk drive <b>14</b> and develops the blood glucose level information processing program into the RAM <b>13</b>. Then, the CPU <b>11</b> executes the blood glucose level information process in accordance with the blood glucose level information processing program.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the CPU <b>11</b> executes the blood glucose level information process, it causes the display unit <b>15</b> to display a start screen image <b>20</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The start screen image <b>20</b> displays blood glucose level measuring device guide illustrations <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> for guiding transmission methods, for example, for transmission of measurement data from the blood glucose level measuring devices <b>5</b> of two different types, and a login button <b>23</b> for allowing login of a doctor.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">If the login button <b>23</b> of the start screen image <b>20</b> is selected, for example, by a cursor in response to an operation of the operation unit <b>16</b> by the doctor, then the CPU <b>11</b> controls the display unit <b>15</b> to display a login screen image <b>30</b> for requesting the doctor to login as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. This login screen image <b>30</b> displays a user name input field <b>31</b> and a password input field <b>32</b> into which a user name and a password are to be inputted, respectively, a login button <b>33</b> for allowing the user to carry out login, and a cancel button <b>34</b> for canceling the login procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If a user name and a password are inputted to the user name input field <b>31</b> and the password input field <b>32</b>, respectively, in response to an operation of the operation unit <b>16</b> by the doctor and then the login button <b>33</b> is selected, then the CPU <b>11</b> decides whether or not they coincide with a user name and a password registered in advance, respectively. If they coincide with each other, then the CPU <b>11</b> controls the display unit <b>15</b> to display a patient search screen image <b>40</b> as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The patient search screen image <b>40</b> displays a patient search button <b>41</b> for selecting a mode (hereinafter referred to as search mode) in which a patient database registered, for example, in advance in the hard disk drive <b>14</b> is searched for a particular patient, a patient registration button <b>42</b> for selecting another mode (hereinafter referred to as registration mode) in which a new patient is registered into the patient database, and a by-mode display region <b>43</b>. In the patient database, the name, kana, sex, patient ID and so forth of patients are registered in an associated relationship with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">When the patient search screen image <b>40</b> is displayed on the display unit <b>15</b>, the patient search button <b>41</b> is selected by default. The CPU <b>11</b> causes the display unit <b>15</b> to display the patient search screen image <b>40</b> such that a patient name input field <b>44</b> and a patient ID input field <b>45</b> into which a patient name and a patient ID are to be inputted, respectively, a search button <b>46</b> for executing a search, a patient list display field <b>47</b> for displaying a search result in a list, a print button <b>48</b>, and a graph display button <b>49</b> are displayed in the by-mode display region <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Then, at least one of a patient name and a patient ID would be inputted to the patient name input field <b>44</b> or the patient ID input field <b>45</b> in response to an operation of the operation unit <b>16</b> by the doctor, and then the search button <b>46</b> would be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">At this time, the CPU <b>11</b> searches the patient database stored in the hard disk drive <b>14</b> for the patient name and the patient ID inputted to the patient name input field <b>44</b> and the patient ID input field <b>45</b>, respectively.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Together with this, the CPU <b>11</b> reads out the blood glucose level database corresponding to the patient name displayed in the patient name display field <b>72</b>A from the hard disk drive <b>14</b> and extracts only the blood glucose levels of the time slots with regard to which a check is placed in the time slot selection check box <b>84</b> (in this instance, &#x201c;before breakfast,&#x201d; &#x201c;after breakfast,&#x201d; &#x201c;after supper&#x201d; and &#x201c;late at night&#x201d;) within the range from the start date to the end date displayed in the start date display field <b>82</b>B and the end date display field <b>82</b>C based on the date/time of measurement, respectively, from the blood glucose level database.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Then, the CPU <b>11</b> plots the extracted blood glucose levels with a symbol for each time slot along the time series and then interconnects the mutually adjacent symbols with a straight line to produce the line graph <b>81</b>.

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Here in the line graph <b>81</b>, the axis of abscissa indicates the date and the axis of ordinate indicates the blood glucose level (mg/dl). Further, the line graph <b>81</b> is divided into a plurality of regions (which may be visually distinguishable, such as for example by color) in response to the blood glucose level. For example, a region within which the blood glucose level is 0 to 59 [mg/dl] and is determined to be that of hypoglycemia is determined as a hypoglycemia region <b>81</b>A, for example, of green; another region within which the blood glucose level is 60 to 109 [mg/dl] and is determined normal is determined as a normal region <b>81</b>B, for example, of white; a further region within which the blood glucose level is 110 to 125 [mg/dl] and is determined intermediate between a normal level and a level of hyperglycemia is determined as a pseudopositive region <b>81</b>C, for example, of yellow; and a still further region within which the blood glucose level is 126 to 400 [mg/dl] and is determined to be that of hyperglycemia is determined as a hyperglycemia region <b>81</b>D, for example, of pink.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Further, in the line graph <b>81</b>, a so-called gradation display form is used wherein the coloring in the proximity of a boundary of each of the hypoglycemia region <b>81</b>A, normal region <b>81</b>B, pseudopositive region <b>81</b>C and hyperglycemia region <b>81</b>D is gradually changed from one color to the other color.</p>

<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In this manner, with the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b>, a time slot, measurement date and measurement time of a blood glucose level measured by the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> can be changed by causing the doctor to carry out a predetermined operation for the time slot changing popup menu <b>300</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Consequently, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> can change the time slot, measurement date and measurement time of the blood glucose level to such a time slot, measurement date and measurement time as are considered to be appropriate, for example, by a decision of the doctor.

<p id="p-0199" num="0198">The blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> having the configuration described above acquires measurement data, including the blood glucose level measured by the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> and the measurement date/time at which the blood glucose level is measured, through the external connection interface unit <b>17</b> and stores such measurement data in the hard disk drive <b>14</b> for each patient. The CPU <b>11</b> forming a part of the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> thus include acquisition means for acquiring the measurement data (e.g., measured blood glucose level and the date/time at which the blood glucose level is measured) and storing such measurement data in the hard disk drive <b>14</b> for each patient.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Further, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> sorts each blood glucose level of the measurement data into one of a plurality of time slots based on the date/time of measurement at which the blood glucose level is measured and the time slot table <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Then, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> produces a blood glucose level database wherein the blood glucose level and date/time of measurement of the measurement data and the sorted time slot are associated with each other. The CPU <b>11</b> of the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> thus operates as a sorting means for sorting the blood glucose level measurement data into different time slots based on the date/time of the blood glucose level measurement and a time slot table which sets forth various time slots. The CPU uses this information to produce a blood glucose level database in which the measured blood glucose level, the date/time of measurement, and the sorted time slot are associated with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">If the blood glucose level note button <b>75</b>F of the graph kind selection button display region <b>75</b> on the graph display screen image <b>70</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) is selectively operated through the operation unit <b>16</b>, then the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> causes the blood glucose level table <b>271</b>, in which blood glucose levels recorded in the blood glucose level database are displayed in a table together with the measurement time, to be displayed on the blood glucose level note display screen image <b>270</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">At this time, if it is recognized that an arbitrary blood glucose level of the blood glucose level table <b>271</b> is selectively determined, then the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> displays the blood glucose level in a reverse image, and displays the time slot changing popup menu <b>300</b> immediately below the blood glucose level. Then, if the left button <b>304</b> or the right button <b>305</b> is selected, the selected blood glucose level is moved to and displayed at an immediately preceding or immediately succeeding time slot and updates the blood glucose level database so that the blood glucose level is re-sorted into an immediately preceding or immediately succeeding time slot.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Accordingly, since the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> can change the time slot of the blood glucose level to that which is considered appropriate, for example, depending upon a decision of the doctor, such various graph displays as described hereinabove can be carried out using the changed time slot. Consequently, a more appropriate decision material can be provided to the doctor.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Further, since the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> does not change the measurement time of an arbitrary blood glucose level when the time slot of the blood glucose level is changed, for example, when the graph display screen images <b>150</b>, <b>160</b>, <b>170</b> and <b>180</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 to 19</figref>) in which a blood glucose level for each one hour is used are to be displayed, graph display which reflects the measurement time accurately can be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">Furthermore, even if the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> is set to wrong time, by changing the measurement date and the measurement time of an arbitrary blood glucose level in response to an operation for the time slot changing popup menu <b>300</b>, such various graph displays as described above can be carried out using the changed measurement date and measurement time.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Further, in the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b>, the slide bar <b>88</b> is provided below the line graph <b>81</b> obtained by plotting blood glucose levels, for example, for one month along the time series, for example, on the graph display screen image <b>70</b> such that, if the slide bar <b>88</b> is moved in parallel, then only the blood glucose levels for one month backdating in response to the amount of movement of the slide bar <b>88</b> are plotted on the line graph <b>81</b> along the time series.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Accordingly, by changing the period of the blood glucose levels to be plotted on the line graph <b>81</b> in response to the amount of movement of the slide bar <b>88</b> without changing the range of the blood glucose level, the period of those blood glucose levels to be plotted on the line graph <b>81</b> can be changed readily.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">Consequently, only by moving the slide bar <b>88</b> in parallel, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> can change the period of those blood glucose levels to be plotted at any time in response to the movement of the slide bar <b>88</b>.

<p id="p-0209" num="0208">Further, if the slide bar <b>88</b> is moved in parallel, then the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> calculates the average value, standard deviation value, maximum value, minimum value and data number of the calculated blood glucose levels plotted on the line graph <b>81</b> again backdating in response to the amount of movement of the slide bar <b>88</b>.

<p id="p-0210" num="0209">Consequently, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> can display the average value, standard deviation value, maximum value, minimum value and data number only of the blood glucose levels plotted on the line graph <b>81</b> at present in response to the movement of the slide bar <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">Meanwhile, for example, if the comparison button <b>86</b> of the graph display screen image <b>70</b> is selectively operated, then the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> displays the line graph <b>81</b> in a scaled reduced in the vertical direction on the upper side of the graph display region <b>77</b> and displays the line graph <b>92</b> within the same range as that of the line graph <b>81</b> but within an immediately preceding period on the lower side of the graph display region <b>77</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Accordingly, by only causing the doctor to carry out a simple operation of selecting the comparison button <b>86</b>, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> can provide, for example, line graphs within the same range but within two successive periods.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Further, by displaying, for example, line graphs within the same range and within two successive periods, it is possible to allow transitions of blood glucose levels within two successive periods to be compared with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">With the configuration described above, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> acquires a blood glucose level measured by the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> and date/time at which the blood glucose level is measured, sorts such blood glucose levels into a plurality of time slots based on the date/time of measurement, displays, if it recognizes that an arbitrary blood glucose level of the blood glucose level table <b>271</b> whose axes are the time slot and the date/time of measurement is selectively determined, the time slot changing popup menu <b>300</b>, and then moves, if the left button <b>304</b> or the right button <b>305</b> is selected, the selected blood glucose level to an immediately preceding or immediately succeeding time slot. Consequently, a blood glucose level and blood glucose level information of time slots which are more accurate than ever can be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Further, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> acquires a blood glucose level measured by the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> and date/time at which the blood glucose level is measured, provides the slide bar <b>88</b> below the line graph <b>81</b> formed by plotting blood glucose levels, for example, for one month along the time series, for example, on the graph display screen image <b>70</b>, and plots, if the slide bar <b>88</b> is moved in parallel, only the blood glucose levels, for example, for one month backdating in response to the amount of movement of the slide bar <b>88</b> on the line graph <b>81</b> along the time series. Consequently, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> can easily provide blood glucose levels and blood glucose level information within a period or range desired by the user without imposing cumbersome operation on the user.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">In the embodiment described above, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> and the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> are connected by wire connection to each other through the communication module <b>6</b> and the optical communication unit.

Or, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> and the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> may be connected by wire connection through a predetermined cable or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The embodiment of the apparatus and method described above involves the single blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> which stores and manages measurement data supplied from the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b>. The apparatus and method are not limited in this regard. It is possible, for example, that a plurality of blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> connected to each other, for example, by an intranet or the like may store and manage measurement data supplied from the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b>. Or, one of a plurality of blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> may serve as a master apparatus which stores and manages measurement data while the remaining one or ones of the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> may temporarily use measurement data by accessing the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> which serves as the master apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Though in the embodiment described above, measurement data supplied from the blood glucose level measuring device <b>5</b> is stored in folders for individual patients, the apparatus and method are not limited in that regard. In particular, in such a case that a plurality of blood glucose level measuring devices <b>5</b> have individually unique identification numbers set thereto, measurement data may be stored for each of the identification numbers of the blood glucose level measuring devices <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">In this instance, if the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> associates the identification numbers of the blood glucose level measuring devices <b>5</b> and the patient names with each other in advance, then if a patient name is selected on the patient search screen image <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the blood glucose level information process described hereinabove can be executed by reading out the measurement data from a folder of the identification number associated with the patient name.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Also, while in the embodiment described above, the CPU <b>11</b> carries out the blood glucose level information process described above in accordance with the blood glucose level information processing program stored in the hard disk drive <b>14</b> in advance, the apparatus and method are not limited in this regard.

The disclosed blood glucose level information processing program preferably involves a non-transitory computer readable medium storing a blood glucose level information processing program which causes a computer to do that described here.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">In the embodiment described above, the information processing apparatus <b>2</b> as the blood glucose level information processing apparatus is configured from the external connection interface unit <b>17</b> serving as an acquisition unit and the CPU <b>11</b> serving as a display control means. However, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus may be configured from an acquisition unit and a display control unit having any of various other configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">The embodiment described above involves the blood glucose level information processing apparatus <b>2</b> serving as an example of the blood glucose level processing apparatus being configured from the external connection interface unit <b>17</b> serving as an acquisition means, the CPU <b>11</b> serving as an example of a sorting means which sorts the acquired blood glucose levels into a plurality of respective time slots as described above, the CPU <b>11</b> serving as an example of the display control means for controlling the display unit to display blood glucose level graphs as described above, the CPU <b>11</b> serving as an example of the changing means for changing a selected blood glucose level to a preceding time slot when a button in the pop-up menu is selected and for changing the selected blood glucose level to the succeeding time slot when another button of the pop-up menu is selected as described above. The CPU <b>11</b> also is an example of a calculation means for calculating blood glucose level information relating to the blood glucose levels measured in different ranges of measurement dates as described above, as well as a re-calculation means which re-calculates the blood glucose level information when the date range displayed on the graph changes. But the apparatus is not limited to this as other configurations or arrangements are possible. For example, the blood glucose level information processing apparatus may be configured from an acquisition unit, a sorting unit, a display control unit and a changing unit having any of other various configurations.</p>
