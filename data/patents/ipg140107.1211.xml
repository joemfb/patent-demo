<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A video poker machine configured to allow a player to play a card game includes at least one display device, at least one input device, and at least one computer configured to display at least a first hand and a second hand of at least five cards all face up, each hand including the same five cards. A player is provided an option to play a hand by selecting none, one or more than one of the face up cards from the first hand and the second hand and any additional hands as cards to be held. Each of the cards not selected to be held are discarded from each hand and replaced with a face up card. The player is provided a pre-established amount based on the amount of a wager made on the hand if the resulting cards of the hand comprise a predetermined poker hand ranking.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates primarily to electronic video poker games, and more particularly to electronic video poker games that are based on poker hand rankings and that allow the player to discard and replace unwanted cards with replacement cards. The present invention has many versions with the common thread being that cards are duplicated from an initial hand of cards into one or more additional hands to allow the player the opportunity to play one or more cards from the starting hand of cards multiple times. The invention also involves features which may apply to casino table games as well.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The method of the present invention involves a card game in which the player plays multiple hands of cards. The player makes a wager for each row of cards and each row of cards becomes a separate hand to be played by the player. One hand of two, three, four or five cards are dealt all face up. The player selects none, one or more of the face up cards from the first hand as cards to be held. The cards that are held are duplicated from the first hand into all of the other hands. Replacement cards for the non-selected cards are dealt into the first hand and additional cards are then dealt to the first hand, if needed, so that the first hand has five cards. Additional cards are also dealt to all of the other hands so that each hand is a five card hand. The poker hand ranking of each five card hand is determined row by row. The player is then paid for any winning poker hands based on a pay table and the amount of the player's wager</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Alternatively, the method of the present invention can also be applied to three card poker or four card poker.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Additional features and advantages are described herein, and will be apparent from the following Detailed Description and the figures.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention includes a variety of electronic video poker games each having multiple hands in which the player selects zero, one or more cards from a first hand and the selected cards are duplicated into each of the other hands. Each of the hands receives additional cards so that each hand is a complete poker hand. Each electronic video poker game is designed to be played by having the hands displayed on a video screen to a player. By manipulating the buttons on the button panel of the gaming device or by using conventional touch screen technology, the player selects which cards he wishes to play, which cards he wishes to duplicate into other hands and which cards he wishes to discard. The player activates a draw button and replacement cards are then displayed for the discarded cards. The resulting competed hands are analyzed for poker hand ranking and the outcome of the play of each hand is determined. The player wins awards based on the poker hand rankings of the completed hands and the amount wagered by the player on each hand using a pay table that is displayed to the player.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Version #A</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the layout for the initial deal of one version of the present invention. Three rows of cards are initially dealt. The center row <b>310</b> is dealt face up; the bottom row <b>320</b> and the top row <b>330</b> are dealt face down. Also, a face down card <b>311</b>A, <b>312</b>A, <b>313</b>A, <b>314</b>A and <b>315</b>A is dealt underneath each of the respective face up cards <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>, <b>313</b>, <b>314</b> and <b>315</b> in the center row <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The player makes one, two or three wagers: the first wager is on row <b>310</b>, the second wager is on row <b>320</b> and the third wager is on row <b>330</b>. Thus, the player is playing one, two or three hands at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The player selects those cards in the center row <b>310</b> that he wishes to hold. The player effects this selection by pressing buttons or, using touch screen technology, by simply pressing the cards on the screen that the player wishes to hold. Each card that is held by the player from the center row <b>310</b> is duplicated in the corresponding vertically aligned position in both the bottom row <b>320</b> and the top row <b>330</b>. Therefore, three copies of the held card are now displayed on the screen. The player may hold from zero to five cards from the center row <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an example of the play of the hand when the player has held card <b>311</b>, card <b>312</b> and card <b>313</b> from the center row <b>310</b>. Card <b>311</b>, the Ace of Spades, is duplicated in the same aligned position in top row <b>330</b> and in bottom row <b>320</b>. Likewise, card <b>312</b>, the Jack of Spades, and card <b>313</b>, the Ten of Spades, are both duplicated in the same aligned positions in top row <b>330</b> and bottom row <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">After the player is satisfied with his selection of replacement cards, the player presses the &#x201c;deal&#x201d; button and the two face down cards <b>324</b> and <b>325</b> in bottom row <b>320</b> are revealed. Similarly, the two face down cards <b>334</b> and <b>335</b> in top row <b>330</b> are revealed. The two unheld cards <b>314</b> and <b>315</b> in the center row <b>310</b> are replaced with the face down cards underneath them, cards <b>314</b>A and <b>315</b>A, and these two cards <b>314</b>A and <b>315</b>A are also revealed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Each row is treated as a separate hand for payout purposes. Each row is evaluated for poker hand ranking and the player is paid based on the amount of his wager on each row depending on the poker hand ranking achieved for that row.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus, the player has effectively played three hands at once. The player could win on all three hands, could lose on all three hands, could win on two hands and lose on one hand or could lose on two hands and win on one hand.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In one of the preferred embodiments of this invention, the method of play uses a separate decks of cards for each hand (or row) of cards that the player wishes to play. For example, in a game in which the player is playing three hands or rows-the first hand is dealt using a first standard fifty-two card deck while the second hand is dealt using a second deck of forty-seven cards which comprises a standard fifty-two card deck having the players five initial face up cards shown in the first hand omitted therefrom and the third hand is dealt using a third deck of forty-seven cards which comprises a standard fifty-two card deck having the players five initial face up cards shown in the first hand omitted therefrom. This would allow the player, for example, to theoretically make three Royal Rushes at the same time in each of the three separate hands. This is accomplished using the computer controls that operate the gaming machine with the software being written so that the second and third decks used to deal the second and third hands, respectively, have removed therefrom the five cards initially dealt.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In each of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, a standard fifty-two card deck of playing cards is used for each deck. One or more cards may also be designated as wild cards and, alternatively, one or more Jokers may be added to the deck of cards and the Jokers are used as wild cards.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In each of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, the amount of the players wager on each hand would be the same. Alternatively, the player could be allowed to make wagers of different amounts on each hand.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Version #B</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">This version is played similarly to Version #A in that the player can play three hands at once, except for a modification to the manner in which the cards are dealt to the display screen. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the layout for the initial deal of this version. Three rows of cards are initially dealt representing the player's three hands. The top row <b>410</b> is dealt face up; the center row <b>420</b> and the bottom row <b>430</b> are dealt face down. Alternatively, any one of the three rows can be the face up cards with the other two rows being the face down cards.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In one embodiment of the present invention, the player has the option to make one, two or three wagers: the first wager is on row <b>410</b>, the second wager is on row <b>420</b> and the third wager is on row <b>430</b>. Thus, the player is playing one, two or three hands at a time. Alternatively, it could be mandatory that the player must wager on all three hands.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the cards dealt to the top row <b>410</b> are the Four of Diamonds <b>411</b>, the Six of Spades <b>412</b>, the Six of Hearts <b>413</b>, the Queen of Spades <b>414</b> and the Queen of Clubs <b>415</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The player selects those cards in the top row <b>410</b> that he wishes to hold. The player effects this selection by pressing buttons or, using touch screen technology, by simply pressing the cards on the screen that the player wishes to hold. Each card that is held by the player from the top row <b>410</b> is duplicated in the corresponding vertically aligned position in both the center row <b>420</b> and the bottom row <b>430</b>. Therefore, three copies of each of the held cards are now displayed on the screen. The player may hold from zero to five cards from the top row <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of the play of the hand when the player has held card <b>412</b>, card <b>413</b>, card <b>414</b> and card <b>415</b> from the top row <b>410</b>. Card <b>412</b>, the Six of Spades, is duplicated in the same aligned position in center row <b>420</b> and in bottom row <b>430</b>. Likewise, card <b>413</b>, the Six of Hearts; card <b>414</b>, the Queen of Spades; and card <b>415</b>, the Queen of Clubs are also duplicated in the same aligned positions in center row <b>420</b> and bottom row <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After the player is satisfied with his selection of the held cards for each of the three hands, the player presses the &#x201c;draw&#x201d; button, the cards to be discarded are removed from the screen display and replacement cards are dealt for the discarded cards to complete each of the three hands. With regard to the hand in the top row <b>410</b>, a replacement card is dealt for card <b>411</b> which was discarded by the player. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the new card is the Jack of Clubs <b>416</b> which does not improve the player's hand in the top row <b>410</b> which has a final hand ranking of Two Pair.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With regard to the hand in the center row <b>420</b>, the last card <b>421</b> added to this hand is the Six of Diamonds giving the hand in the center row <b>420</b> a final hand ranking of a Full House. With regard to the hand in the bottom row <b>430</b>, the last card <b>431</b> added to this hand is the Ace of Spades giving the hand in the bottom row a final hand ranking of Two Pair.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each row is treated as a separate hand for payout purposes. Each row is evaluated for poker hand ranking and the player is paid based on the amount of his wager on each row depending on the poker hand ranking achieved for that row. A suitable pay table is provided as is conventional for electronic video poker games with the amount of the player's winnings being based on the poker hand ranking achieved and the amount wagered by the player on each hand.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus, the player has effectively played three hands at once. The player could win on all three hands, could lose on all three hands, could win on two hands and lose on one hand or could lose on two hands and win on one hand.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Another alternative to Version #B would be to reduce the three rows shown to only two rows and otherwise practice the method of this version as described. The player would make two wagers to play the two rows and select the cards initially dealt that would be used in each of the two rows. Replacement cards would be provided to complete the hands in each of the two rows and winning and losing hands would be determined in the same manner as described above with reference to the three rows.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Likewise, the method of play described in Version #B could also be modified by increasing the number of rows to four or more, with five rows being the preferred number of rows for this alternative embodiment. Again if four or more rows are used, the method of play would be the same as that described above with reference to the three rows version. In order to show four or more rows of cards at the same time on a video screen display, a larger video monitor may be required.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a screen display with five rows. The player makes appropriate wagers on one or more rows. The lowermost row is displayed first with all five cards face up. The player selects which cards he wishes to hold from the lowermost row and these cards are duplicated into all of the other rows on which the player has wagered. Replacement cards are dealt for the unselected cards in the lowermost row and additional cards are provided to complete each five card hand in the other rows.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">However, the preferred embodiment of this version uses five separate decks of cards&#x2014;the first row being dealt using a first standard fifty-two card deck while the second, third, fourth and fifth rows are dealt using separate decks of forty-seven cards which comprises a standard fifty-two card deck having the player's five initial face up cards shown in the first row omitted therefrom. This would allow the player, for example, to theoretically make five Royal Flushes (or any other five card hands of the same rank) at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows another initial row display in which ten rows of cards are displayed to the player. The player makes appropriate wagers on one or more rows up to a total of ten rows to play all ten rows. Again, the lowermost row is displayed first with all five cards face up. The player selects which cards he wishes to hold from the lowermost row and these cards are duplicated into all of the other rows on which the player has wagered. Replacement cards are dealt for the unselected cards in the lowermost row and additional cards are provided to complete each five card hand in the other rows. In one embodiment of this ten row version, a single deck of cards can be used for all of the rows.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">However, the preferred embodiment of this version uses ten separate decks of cards&#x2014;the first row being dealt using a first standard fifty-two card deck while the second through tenth rows are dealt using separate decks of forty-seven cards which comprises a standard fifty-two card deck having the player's five initial face up cards shown in the first row omitted therefrom. This would allow the player, for example, to theoretically make ten Royal Flushes (or any other five card hands of the same rank) at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a different way of displaying the ten rows. When the initial lowermost row is dealt, all five of the face up cards from this initial row are also displayed in the other nine rows. The player selects which cards he wishes to hold from the lowermost row and these cards are automatically held in all of the other rows on which the player has wagered. Replacement cards are dealt for the unselected cards in the lowermost row and all of the other rows. The game otherwise proceeds as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Either a single deck of cards or ten separate decks of cards are used. This modified method of displaying the cards dealt in each row can also be applied to the other embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In order to adopt any of the various embodiments of the present invention to the smaller video monitors often used in video poker gaming machines, the display of the play of the method of play can be modified. This modified display method can be a seriatim method in which the player plays a plurality of hands one after another. In this seriatim method, the player would initially make a multiple coin, token or credit wager representing the number of hands that the player wishes to play during that round of the game. The minimum number of coins or credits wagered would be two representing two hands that the player wishes to play with the maximum being any number desired. The player can also wager multiple coins per each hand.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">After the player has decided on the number of hands and the number of coins to be wagered on each hand, the first hand of five cards would initially be dealt to the player. The player would select which of the initial five cards, if any, the player wishes to hold and then replacement cards would be dealt for the discarded cards. The winning or losing outcome of this first hand would then be determined. The results of this first hand can be displayed in a portion such as the corner of the video display screen as a smaller hand display similar in size to the smaller hands shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For the second hand, the cards held by the player from the first hand would then be redisplayed on the video screen and additional cards would be dealt to complete the player's second hand. Again, the winning or losing outcome of this second hand would be determined. The steps of redisplaying the held cards from the first hand and the dealing of cards to complete the hand would be repeated for each wager made by the player until the total number of hands originally wagered by the player is completed. After each hand is played, the results of each hand can be displayed in a portion such as the corner of the video display screen as a smaller hand display similar in size to the smaller hands shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. This seriatim method of play can be applied whenever two or more rows are desired to be played.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this seriatim alternative method of play, each hand is completed by using a separate deck of cards (which have the first five cards removed therefrom so as to eliminate the possibility of duplicated cards being dealt as replacement cards) or by reshuffling the remaining forty-seven cards before each new row is played. Alternatively, a single deck of cards can be used as the source for both the initial five cards and the additional cards used to complete each of the multiple hands.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Version #C</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Another alternative method of play of the present invention would have two or more rows of five or more cards all dealt face up with each row having the same cards shown face up. In the preferred embodiment of this version #C, three rows are displayed face up with each row having the same five cards shown in each hand. As shown in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, row <b>510</b> is dealt with five cards&#x2014;the Four of Diamonds <b>511</b>, the Six of Spades <b>512</b>, the Six of Hearts <b>513</b>, the Queen of Spades <b>514</b> and the Queen of Clubs <b>515</b>; row <b>520</b> is dealt with five cards&#x2014;the Four of Diamonds <b>521</b>, the Six of Spades <b>522</b>, the Six of Hearts <b>523</b>, the Queen of Spades <b>524</b> and the Queen of Clubs <b>525</b>; and row <b>530</b> is dealt with five cards&#x2014;the Four of Diamonds <b>531</b>, the Six of Spades <b>532</b>, the Six of Hearts <b>533</b>, the Queen of Spades <b>534</b> and the Queen of Clubs <b>535</b>. The player can then select which cards to hold from any one of the rows and these cards selected by the player are automatically held in the other two rows. Again with reference to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the player would most likely hold the Six of Spades, the Six of Hearts, the Queen of Spades and the Queen of Clubs. Whichever cards are selected by the player will automatically be held in each of the rows.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Each row then receives replacement cards for the cards that are discarded, preferably from separate decks for each row. The player has three final five card hands and wins or loses on each hand separately based on a pay table which shows the winning hand combinations. If the player has a winning hand, the amount won by the player is based on the amount wagered by the player on that particular row and the poker hand ranking of the cards in that row. This Version #C may also be applied to methods of play that use only two rows or that use four or more rows,</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Version #D</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Another alternative method of play of the present invention would have two or more rows of less than a complete five card hand be dealt face up. Then after the player has selected the cards to be duplicated from the first row into the other rows, each row is completed to have five cards. In the preferred embodiment of this version #D, the player wagers on the number of hands the player wishes to play, for example the three rows shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The first hand <b>610</b> is dealt with one, two, three or four of the cards dealt face up and the remaining cards face down, such as the four face up cards and the one face down card shown in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Hand <b>610</b> is dealt with five cards&#x2014;the Ace of Hearts <b>611</b>, the Ace of Spades <b>612</b>, the King of Clubs <b>613</b>, the Six of Spades <b>614</b> and the face down card <b>615</b>. The player can then select which cards to hold from the first row <b>610</b> and these cards selected by the player are automatically duplicated in the other two rows <b>620</b> and <b>630</b>. Again with reference to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the player would most likely hold the Ace of Hearts <b>611</b> and the Ace of Clubs <b>612</b> as the cards to be duplicated into the other hands.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The first hand <b>610</b> then receives replacement cards for the cards that are discarded and the face down card <b>615</b> is turned face up. In this example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the first hand has a final hand of the Ace of Hearts <b>611</b>, the Ace of Clubs <b>612</b>, the Four of Diamonds <b>616</b>, the Four of Spades <b>617</b> and the Four of Hearts <b>615</b>. The second hand and the third hand have their face down cards turned face up. The second hand <b>620</b> has a final hand of the Ace of Hearts <b>611</b>, the Ace of Clubs <b>612</b>, the Ace of Spades <b>623</b>, the Seven of Diamonds <b>624</b> and the Eight of Hearts <b>625</b>. The third hand <b>620</b> has a final hand of the Ace of Hearts <b>611</b>, the Ace of Clubs <b>612</b>, the Ace of Diamonds <b>633</b>, the Four of Hearts <b>634</b> and the Ace of Spades <b>635</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The player now has three final five card hands and wins or loses on each hand separately based on a pay table which shows the winning hand combinations. If the player has a winning hand, the amount won by the player is based on the amount wagered by the player on that particular row and the poker hand ranking of the cards in that row. For example, again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in hand <b>610</b> the player has a Full House, in hand <b>620</b> the player has a Three-of-a-Kind and in hand <b>630</b> the player has a Four-of-a-Kind which would all most likely be winning hands based on the pay table.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">This Version #D may also be applied to methods of play that use only two rows or that use four or more rows.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Version #E</heading>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In another version of the present invention, the method of play can be applied to poker-type games that use less than a five card hand. For example, three card poker and four card poker can be adapted to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows an initial deal of a three card poker game which allows the player to play multiple hands. In the preferred embodiment of this version #E, the player wagers on the number of hands the player wishes to play, for example the three rows shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The first hand <b>710</b> is dealt with all three cards face up. Hand <b>710</b> is dealt with the Ace of Hearts <b>711</b>, the King of Hearts <b>712</b> and the Two of Clubs <b>713</b>. The player can then select which cards to hold from the first row <b>710</b> and these cards selected by the player are automatically duplicated in the other two rows <b>720</b> and <b>730</b>. Again with reference to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the player would most likely hold the Ace of Hearts <b>711</b> and the King of Hearts <b>712</b> as the cards to be duplicated into the other hands.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The first hand <b>710</b> then receives a replacement card for the card that is discarded. In this example as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the first hand has a final hand of the Ace of Hearts <b>711</b>, the King of Hearts <b>712</b> and the Six of Clubs <b>714</b>. The second hand <b>720</b> has a final hand of the Ace of Hearts <b>711</b>, the King of Hearts <b>712</b> and the Queen of Hearts <b>723</b>. The third hand <b>730</b> has a final hand of the Ace of Hearts <b>711</b>, the King of Hearts <b>712</b> and the Ace of Clubs <b>733</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The player now has three final three card hands and wins or loses on each hand separately based on a pay table which shows the winning hand combinations. If the player has a winning hand, the amount won by the player is based on the amount wagered by the player on that particular row and the poker hand ranking of the cards in that row. For example, again with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in hand <b>710</b> the player has a three card Ace High which would probably be a losing hand based on a preferred pay table. In hand <b>720</b> the player has a three card Straight Flush and in hand <b>730</b> the player has a Pair of Aces which would all most likely be winning hands based on the preferred pay table.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Any suitable pay table may be used for this multiple hand version of a three card poker game. For illustration purposes, a representative pay table is shown in Table 1.</p>

<p id="p-0073" num="0072">This Version #E may also be applied to methods of play that use only two rows or that use four or more rows.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In addition to three, four or five card rows, the method of the present invention can also be applied to six, seven or more card rows. Winning hand combinations can be based on six card poker hand, seven card poker hands or even more card poker hands. Alternatively, the winning hand combinations can be based on the best five card poker hand out of the six, seven or even more cards in the row.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Alternatively, the method of play of any of the embodiments of the present invention can also use only one standard fifty-two card deck. In this alternative, each of the player's hands will receive different replacement cards from the single deck for those cards that are discarded. For example with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, if a player holds less than five cards from the top row <b>410</b>, each hand will receive different replacement cards so that player has the possibility of achieving various whining combinations.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In either the multiple deck embodiment or the single deck embodiment, one or more cards may alternatively be designated as wild cards or one or more Jokers may be added to the deck or decks and designated as wild cards. This allows the methods of the present invention to be applied to any of the various wild card video poker games that are known in the art, such as Deuces Wild or Joker's Wild.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Special bonus payouts can be added if the player achieves, either on the deal or after the draw, three hands of the same rank at the same time. These bonus payouts could be fixed amounts or progressive payouts. For example, the player could win a progressive payout for achieving three Full Houses at the same time. As another example when three decks are used, the player can receive a large fixed or progressive payout if the player achieves the same poker hand in each of the three rows&#x2014;such as a Royal Flush in Spades in all three rows.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The various embodiments of the present invention have been described in connection with a video display screen similar to conventional video poker in which each hand of cards is shown horizontally across the display screen. It is also possible to display the cards in other suitable formats. For example, a video slot machine reel format can be used in which the cards appear to spin in a vertical plane on the video display screen. The player would initiate the simulated spinning of reels after the player has made his wager on the number of pay lines which the player wishes to play. Each pay line would be the equivalent of a separate hand of cards.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">When the reels stop spinning, a first hand of cards would be displayed on the video screen display along a first pay line. The player would select which of the initial cards from this first hand that the player wishes to hold. The held cards would be duplicated into the other pay lines upon which the player has wagered.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">After the cards have been duplicated into the other pay lines, the player would activate a &#x201c;DRAW&#x201d; button which would cause the vertical columns that still need cards to simulate a spinning mode. When these columns stop spinning, each pay line would then have a complete poker hand. Each pay line is then analyzed to determine the poker hand ranking of the pay line and winning and losing card combinations are then determined. The award to the player is based on any winning combination on a pay line and the amount wagered by the player as shown in a pay table. One advantage of using spinning reel representations of the cards in each hand is that the pay lines do not have to be horizontal rows. The pay lines may also be diagonal lines or even W-shaped or M-shaped pay lines such as are used in other conventional slot machines having video reels.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">While the various methods of play of the present invention have been described in the context of electronic video gaming machines, each method of play can also be carried on a live gaming table using a live dealer with the players arranged around the gaming table, in the manner in which other live table games such a Twenty-One or card room poker is conducted.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">While the invention has been illustrated with respect to several specific embodiments thereof, these embodiments should be considered as illustrative rather than limiting. Various modifications and additions may be made and will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, the invention should not be limited by the foregoing description, but rather should be defined only by the following claims.</p>
