<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The embodiments will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding or identical elements throughout the various drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the following embodiments, a tandem color digital printer (hereinafter referred to as a printer) will be described for exemplary purposes. In the following description, terms indicating specific directions and positions (for example, &#x201c;left and right&#x201d; and &#x201c;upper and lower&#x201d;) are used where necessary. In this respect, the direction perpendicular to the paper plane of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is defined as front view. The terms are used for the sake of description and will not limit the technical scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">1.1 Overview of Printer</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An overview of a printer <b>1</b> is first described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the printer <b>1</b> includes, in a casing <b>2</b>, an image processor <b>3</b>, a sheet feeder <b>4</b>, and a fixing device <b>5</b>. The printer <b>1</b> is coupled to a network such as a LAN so that upon receipt of a print command from an external terminal (not shown), the printer <b>1</b> executes printing based on the command, which is not elaborated in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The sheet feeder <b>4</b> is positioned at a lower portion of the casing <b>2</b> and includes a sheet feed cassette <b>21</b>, a pickup roller <b>22</b>, a pair of separation rollers <b>23</b>, and a pair of timing rollers <b>24</b>. The sheet feed cassette <b>21</b> accommodates recording media P. The pickup roller <b>22</b> picks up an uppermost part of the recording media P in the sheet feed cassette <b>21</b>. The pair of separation rollers <b>23</b> separate the picked part of recording media P into individual sheets. The pair of timing rollers <b>24</b> transfer the individual sheets of recording medium P, one by one, to the image processor <b>3</b> at a predetermined timing. The recording media P in the sheet feed cassette <b>21</b> are sent to a conveyance path <b>30</b> one at a time from the top by the rotation of the pickup roller <b>22</b> and the separation rollers <b>23</b>. The conveyance path <b>30</b> extends from the sheet feed cassette <b>21</b> of the sheet feeder <b>4</b> though a nip portion between the pair of timing rollers <b>24</b>, a secondary transfer nip portion <b>11</b> of the image processor <b>3</b>, and a fixing nip portion of the fixing device <b>5</b>, to reach discharging rollers <b>26</b> at an upper portion of the casing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In the sheet feed cassette <b>21</b>, the recording media P are at a center reference on the sheet feed cassette <b>21</b> for conveyance toward the conveyance path <b>30</b> in the direction of arrow S. In this respect, the center of each recording medium P in its width direction (which is orthogonal to the transfer direction S) is used as a reference relative to the center reference. In this embodiment, the sheet feed cassette <b>21</b> includes a pair of side regulation plates <b>25</b> to hold unpicked recording media P across the width thereof so as to align the recording media P with the center reference. The pair of side regulation plates <b>25</b> simultaneously move close to or away from one another in the sheet width direction (which is orthogonal to the transfer direction S). In the sheet feed cassette <b>21</b>, the pair of side regulation plates <b>25</b> hold both sides of the recording medium P in the sheet width direction. This ensures that recording media P of any standard are set at the center reference in the sheet feed cassette <b>21</b>. Accordingly, the transfer process at the image processor <b>3</b> and the fixing process at the fixing device <b>5</b> are executed based on the center reference.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The image processor <b>3</b> is above the sheet feeder <b>4</b> and transfers toner images on photoreceptors <b>13</b>, which are exemplary image carriers, to a recording medium P. The image processor <b>3</b> includes an intermediate transfer belt <b>6</b> and a total of four image forming units <b>7</b> respectively corresponding to colors of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (K). The intermediate transfer belt <b>6</b>, which is another exemplary image carrier, is wound across a driving roller <b>8</b> and a driven roller <b>9</b> respectively disposed on right and left sides at a vertically central position of the casing <b>2</b>. A secondary transfer roller <b>10</b> is disposed on the outer peripheral side of a portion of the intermediate transfer belt <b>6</b> wound around the driving roller <b>8</b>. The intermediate transfer belt <b>6</b> and the secondary transfer roller <b>10</b> define, at the portion of their contact, a secondary transfer nip portion <b>11</b> as a secondary transfer region. A transfer belt cleaner <b>12</b> is disposed on the outer peripheral side of a portion of the intermediate transfer belt <b>6</b> wound around the driven roller <b>9</b>. The transfer belt cleaner <b>12</b> removes un-transferred toner remaining on the intermediate transfer belt <b>6</b>. The casing <b>2</b> includes a controller <b>28</b> in charge of overall control of the printer <b>1</b> between the image processor <b>3</b> and the sheet feed device <b>4</b>. The controller <b>28</b> incorporates another controller (not shown) in charge of various arithmetic operations, storing, and control.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Below and along the intermediate transfer belt <b>6</b>, the four image forming units <b>7</b> of yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C), and black (K) are arranged in this order starting on the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For the sake of description, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image forming units <b>7</b> are respectively labeled with symbols Y, M, C, and K in accordance with reproduced colors. Each image forming unit <b>7</b> includes a photoreceptor <b>13</b>. Around the photoreceptor <b>13</b>, a charger <b>14</b>, an exposing unit <b>19</b>, a developer <b>15</b>, a primary transfer roller <b>16</b>, and a photoreceptor cleaner <b>17</b> are arranged in this order in the clockwise rotational direction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In each of the image forming units <b>7</b>, the exposing unit <b>19</b> radiates a laser beam to the photoreceptor <b>13</b> charged by the charger <b>14</b>, thus forming an electrostatic latent image. The electrostatic latent image is reverse developed using toner supplied from the developer <b>15</b> into a toner image of a corresponding color. At primary transfer nip portions, the toner images of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black are primary transferred in this order on the outer circumferential surface of the intermediate transfer belt <b>6</b> from the photoreceptors <b>13</b>, and superimposed one on top of each other. Un-transferred toner remaining on the photoreceptors <b>13</b> is scraped off the photoreceptors <b>13</b> by the respective photoreceptor cleaners <b>17</b>. The superimposed toner images of the four colors are collectively secondary transferred on the recording medium P through the secondary transfer nip portion <b>11</b>. Un-transferred toner remaining on the intermediate transfer belt <b>6</b> is scrapped off the intermediate transfer belt <b>6</b> by the transfer belt cleaner <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The fixing device <b>5</b> is positioned above the secondary transfer roller <b>10</b> of the image processor <b>3</b>, and includes a fixing roller <b>31</b> and a pressure roller <b>32</b>. The fixing roller <b>31</b> incorporates a heat source such as a halogen heater. The pressure roller <b>32</b> is opposite the fixing roller <b>31</b>. The fixing roller <b>31</b> and the pressure roller <b>32</b> define, at the portion of their contact, a fixing nip portion as a fixing region. The recording medium P past the secondary transfer nip portion <b>11</b> and loaded with an unfixed toner image is heated and pressed through the fixing nip portion between the fixing roller <b>31</b> and the pressure roller <b>32</b>. Thus, the unfixed toner image is fixed on the recording medium P. Then, the recording medium P is discharged on a collection tray <b>27</b> by the rotation of the pair of discharging rollers <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, the developer <b>15</b> of each image forming unit <b>7</b>, the intermediate transfer belt <b>6</b>, and the transfer belt cleaner <b>12</b> are consumables subject to wear through repeated image forming operations. The consumables are exchangeably (removably) disposed in the casing <b>2</b>. For example, each image forming unit <b>7</b> (the photoreceptor <b>13</b>, the charger <b>14</b>, the exposing unit <b>19</b>, the developer <b>15</b>, and the photoreceptor cleaner <b>17</b>) is incorporated in a housing <b>20</b> in the form of a cartridge (integrated structure) and is exchangeably disposed in the casing <b>2</b> as what is called a process cartridge.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">1.2. Power Transmission Structure of Image Forming Unit</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>, a power transmission structure of the image forming unit <b>7</b> will be described below. The printer <b>1</b> includes, on a side of the casing <b>2</b>, a driving motor <b>40</b> serving as a driving source to generate power. The power generated by the driving motor <b>40</b> is first transmitted to an input gear <b>41</b>, which is a component of a first power transmission system. A coupling member <b>44</b> serving as a damper to attenuate oscillation is power transmittably coupled to a distal end of a rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a </i>outwardly protruding from the photoreceptor <b>13</b>. The coupling member <b>44</b> (specifically, to a male fitting <b>47</b>, described later) has outer teeth on the outer circumference, and an input gear <b>41</b> meshes with the teeth. An output gear <b>42</b> is disposed at a portion of the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a </i>between the coupling member <b>44</b> and the photoreceptor <b>13</b> to integrally rotate with the photoreceptor <b>13</b> and branch the power from the driving motor <b>40</b>. The output gear <b>42</b> meshes with an output relay gear <b>43</b>. Part of the power branched through the output gear <b>42</b> and the output relay gear <b>43</b> is transmitted to the developer <b>15</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">That is, part of the power generated by the driving motor <b>40</b> is transmitted to the photoreceptor <b>13</b> through the input gear <b>41</b>, the coupling member <b>44</b>, and the output gear <b>42</b>. The rest of the power is transmitted to the developer <b>15</b> through the output gear <b>42</b> and the output relay gear <b>43</b>. The output gear <b>42</b> and the output relay gear <b>43</b> constitute an output gear train <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a linkage spring <b>46</b> serving as an elastic body is fitted on a portion of the rotary shaft <b>13</b> a of the photoreceptor <b>13</b> between the output gear <b>42</b> and the coupling member <b>44</b>. The linkage spring <b>46</b> has one end engaged with the output gear <b>42</b> and another end engaged with the coupling member <b>44</b> (specifically, to a female fitting <b>48</b>, described later). Thus, the coupling member <b>44</b> transmits rotary power to the output gear <b>43</b> utilizing the elastic restoring force of the linkage spring <b>46</b>. Examples of the linkage spring <b>46</b> include, but not limited to, a coil spring wound coaxially with the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show the coupling member <b>44</b> according to the first embodiment. The coupling member <b>44</b> according to the first embodiment includes the male fitting <b>47</b> and the female fitting <b>48</b> fitted with one another. The rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a </i>penetrates through the male and female fittings <b>47</b> and <b>48</b> in the direction in which the male and female fittings <b>47</b> and <b>48</b> are fitted with one another, so as to rotatably support the male and female fittings <b>47</b> and <b>48</b> respectively via shaft bearings <b>49</b> and <b>50</b>. The male fitting <b>47</b> has a recess <b>51</b> on the side fitted with the female fitting <b>48</b>. The male and female fittings <b>47</b> and <b>48</b> are fitted with one another by press fitting or other means that makes them difficult to fall apart. With the male and female fittings <b>47</b> and <b>48</b> fitted with one another, the recess <b>51</b> of the male fitting <b>47</b> and a bottom inner surface <b>52</b> of the female fitting <b>48</b> define a hollow accommodation space <b>53</b> in the coupling member <b>44</b>. The accommodation space <b>53</b> in the coupling member <b>44</b> accommodates, together with a viscous fluid <b>55</b>, a rotating resistor <b>54</b> to rotate integrally with the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the photoreceptor <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The viscous fluid <b>55</b> provides a viscous resistance (rotation resistance) to the rotating resistor <b>54</b> when the rotating resistor <b>54</b> integrally rotates with the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the photoreceptor <b>13</b>. This effects a relative rotation between the rotating resistor <b>54</b> and the coupling member <b>44</b> (that is, a rotation delay of the rotating resistor <b>54</b> results). The viscous resistance is obtained in association with shear resistance and agitation resistance of the viscous fluid <b>55</b>. The viscous fluid <b>55</b> is not limited to a particular type. Examples include, but not limited to, grease and a highly viscous fluid such as silicone oil.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the coupling member <b>44</b> according to the first embodiment, the rotating resistor <b>54</b> has a cylindrical shape with one end open. In the recess <b>51</b>, the male fitting <b>47</b> has a cylindrical protrusion <b>56</b> fitted with the opening on the one end of the rotating resistor <b>54</b>. The rotating resistor <b>54</b> covers the cylindrical protrusion <b>56</b> in the recess <b>51</b> of the male fitting <b>47</b>. A slight gap exists between the outer circumferential surface of the cylindrical protrusion <b>56</b> and the inner circumferential surface of the rotation resistance <b>54</b>. Similarly, a slight gap exists between the outer circumferential surface of the rotation resistance <b>54</b> and the inner circumferential surface of the recess <b>51</b> of the male fitting <b>47</b>. The viscous fluid <b>55</b> fills the gaps. An oil seal <b>57</b> to prevent leakage of the inner viscous fluid <b>55</b> is disposed at a portion of the cylindrical protrusion <b>56</b> of the male fitting <b>47</b> where the rotary shat <b>13</b><i>a </i>penetrates. Similarly, an oil seal <b>58</b> to prevent leakage of the inner viscous fluid <b>55</b> is disposed at a portion of the bottom inner surface <b>52</b> of the female fitting <b>48</b> where the rotary shat <b>13</b><i>a </i>penetrates.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With the above-described configuration, the power through the driving motor <b>40</b> and the input gear <b>41</b> is first transmitted to the coupling member <b>44</b> (specifically, to the male fitting <b>47</b>). The rotating resistor <b>54</b> in the coupling member <b>44</b> attempts to integrally rotate with the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a </i>while receiving a viscous resistance of the viscous fluid <b>55</b>. This effects a relative rotation between the rotating resistor <b>54</b> and the coupling member <b>44</b> (that is, a rotation delay of the rotating resistor <b>54</b> results). If, for example, an oscillation results from varying rotation rates of the driving motor <b>40</b>, the oscillation is attenuated by the viscous fluid <b>55</b>. With the oscillation attenuated, the power is transmitted to the photoreceptor <b>13</b> through the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a</i>, which integrally rotates with the rotating resistor <b>54</b>, so as to drivingly rotate the photoreceptor <b>13</b>. This, as a result, significantly reduces varying rotation rates of the photoreceptor <b>13</b> and minimizes image blurring (banding), thereby improving image quality. It is particularly noted that the image forming unit <b>7</b> is exchangeably disposed in the casing <b>2</b> in the form of what is called a process cartridge, which additionally advantageously simplifies the power transmission system and reduces size and weight of the power transmission system.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows results of an experiment on how differences between dampers influence the load change rate (variations in the rotation rate) of the photoreceptor <b>13</b>. The graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows frequencies on the horizontal axis and load change rates on the vertical axis. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the symbol &#x201c;&#x2666;&#x201d; represents a resin material as the damper, &#x201c;&#x25aa;&#x201d; represents an anti-oscillation rubber material as the damper, and &#x201c;&#x2218;&#x201d; represents the coupling member <b>44</b> as the damper. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the case where the coupling member <b>44</b> is used as the damper (the case of &#x201c;&#x2218;&#x201d;) significantly reduces the varying rotation rate over a wide range of frequencies compared with the other examples. These prove that the existence of the coupling member <b>44</b> reduces the influence that varying rotation rates of the photoreceptor <b>13</b> have on the image forming operation, thereby ensuring high image quality.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Second Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A second embodiment of the coupling member will be described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In the second embodiment described below, those elements common in configuration and operation to the first embodiment are identified using the same reference numerals, and therefore will not be further elaborated here. The coupling member <b>44</b> according to the second embodiment includes a plurality of annular protrusions <b>62</b> (which may also be regarded as recesses and protrusions) disposed on the rotating resistor <b>54</b>. The annular protrusions <b>62</b> are disposed coaxially and radially around the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a</i>. The recess <b>51</b> of the male fitting <b>47</b> includes a plurality of annular protrusions <b>61</b> in mesh with the annular protrusions <b>62</b> of the rotating resistor <b>54</b> along the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a</i>. In other words, the inner peripheral portion (that is, the recess <b>51</b>) of the coupling member <b>44</b> has a sectional profile in the form of a comb, and the rotating resistor <b>54</b> has a sectional profile in the form of a comb in mesh with the comb of the sectional profile of the inner peripheral portion of the coupling member <b>44</b>. The annular protrusions <b>61</b> of the male fitting <b>47</b> and the annular protrusions <b>62</b> of the rotating resistor <b>54</b> mesh with each other with slight gaps disposed between the annular protrusions <b>61</b> and the annular protrusions <b>62</b> (that is, the annular protrusions <b>61</b> and <b>62</b> loosely mesh with each other). The viscous fluid <b>55</b> is disposed in the gaps.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">This configuration ensures a large area of contact between the viscous fluid <b>55</b> and the inner peripheral portion (that is, the recess <b>51</b>) of the coupling member <b>44</b> as well as the rotating resistor <b>54</b>. This improves the function of the viscous fluid <b>55</b> providing viscous resistance to the rotation of the photoreceptor <b>13</b>, and further reduces varying rotation rates of the photoreceptor <b>13</b>. This, as a result, minimizes image blurring (banding), thereby further improving image quality.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Third Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A third embodiment of the coupling member will be described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In the third embodiment, a coupling member <b>64</b> includes an accommodation space <b>65</b> having a plurality of compartments <b>66</b> aligned along the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the photoreceptor <b>13</b>. The coupling member <b>64</b> is rotatably supported on the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a</i>. At the portions of the rotary axis <b>13</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the compartments <b>66</b>, disk-shaped rotating resistors <b>67</b> are disposed to integrally rotate with the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a</i>. The viscous fluid <b>55</b> is disposed in the compartments <b>66</b> to move between adjacent compartments <b>66</b>. The coupling member <b>64</b> is dividable at the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a </i>serving as the center of division. It is matter of course that the coupling member <b>64</b> has outer teeth on the outer circumference in mesh with the input gear <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Similarly to the second embodiment, the third embodiment is another example where the inner peripheral portion (that is, the compartments <b>66</b>) of the coupling member <b>64</b> has a sectional profile in the form of a comb, and the rotating resistors <b>67</b> have a sectional profile in the form of a comb in mesh with the comb of the sectional profile of the inner peripheral portion of the coupling member <b>64</b>. This ensures a large area of contact between the viscous fluid <b>55</b> and the inner peripheral portion of the coupling member <b>64</b> as well as the rotating resistors <b>67</b>. This, as a result, improves the function of the viscous fluid <b>55</b> providing viscous resistance to the rotation of the photoreceptor <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Fourth Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">A fourth embodiment of the coupling member will be described by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. In the fourth embodiment, a coupling member <b>74</b> includes an accommodation space <b>75</b> having a plurality of fixed ring plates <b>76</b> aligned along the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a </i>of the photoreceptor <b>13</b>. The coupling member <b>74</b> is rotatably supported on the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a</i>. On the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a</i>, disk-shaped rotating resistors <b>77</b> are disposed at appropriate intervals to integrally rotate with the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a</i>. The fixed ring plates <b>76</b> and the rotating resistors <b>77</b> are alternately disposed. The viscous fluid <b>55</b> is disposed in the void in the accommodation space <b>75</b>. The coupling member <b>74</b> is dividable at the rotary shaft <b>13</b><i>a </i>serving as the center of division. It is matter of course that the coupling member <b>74</b> has outer teeth on the outer circumference in mesh with the input gear <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Similarly to the second and third embodiments, the fourth embodiment is another example where the inner peripheral portion (that is, the fixed ring plates <b>76</b>) of the coupling member <b>74</b> has a sectional profile in the form of a comb, and the rotating resistors <b>77</b> have a sectional profile in the form of a comb in mesh with the comb of the sectional profile of the inner peripheral portion of the coupling member <b>74</b>. This ensures a large area of contact between the viscous fluid <b>55</b> and the inner peripheral portion of the coupling member <b>74</b> as well as the rotating resistors <b>77</b>. This, as a result, improves the function of the viscous fluid <b>55</b> providing viscous resistance to the rotation of the photoreceptor <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Other Notes</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It will be appreciated that the present invention will not be limited to the embodiments described above and can be embodied in various other forms. For example, while a printer has been described as an exemplary image forming apparatus, this should not be construed in a limiting sense. Other possible examples include copiers, fax machines, and multi-function machines integrally incorporating copy and fax capabilities. Moreover, the location or arrangement of individual elements in the illustrated embodiments should not be construed in a limiting sense. Various modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Thus, in the embodiments, a coupling member containing a viscous fluid <b>55</b> serves as a damper to attenuate oscillation in the power transmission system, by which power is transmitted from the driving motor <b>40</b> to image carriers (including the image processor <b>3</b> and the intermediate transfer belt <b>6</b>). The viscous fluid <b>55</b> provides a resistance against the rotation of the image carriers, and thereby attenuates oscillations resulting from varying rotation rates of the driving motor <b>40</b>. This ensures that the image carriers are drivingly rotated by the power with the oscillations attenuated. This, as a result, significantly reduces varying rotation rates of the image carriers and minimizes image blurring (banding), thereby improving image quality. The existence of the coupling member <b>44</b> reduces, over a wide range of frequencies, the influence that varying rotation rates of the photoreceptor <b>13</b> have on the image forming operation, thereby ensuring high image quality.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Obviously, numerous modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described herein.</p>
