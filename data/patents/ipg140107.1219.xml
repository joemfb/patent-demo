<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a tool and, more particularly, to a tool including a chuck for holding a bit and a handle connected to the chuck.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,877,751, a tool connector includes a drive body <b>10</b>, a bushing <b>20</b>, and a push ring <b>30</b>. The drive body <b>10</b> includes a polygonal extension rod <b>11</b> and a hole <b>15</b> in communication with two lots <b>16</b>. The bushing <b>20</b> is secured on the drive body <b>10</b>. The push ring <b>30</b> is secured on the bushing <b>20</b>. A spring <b>24</b> is compressed between the bushing <b>20</b> and a locking plate <b>25</b>, which is located against a portion of the push ring <b>30</b>. The locking plate <b>25</b> includes a polygonal hole <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Normally, the locking plate <b>25</b> is tilted. The locking plate <b>25</b> is in parallel to a plane defined at an open end of the push ring <b>30</b> when the push ring <b>30</b> is moved relative to the busing <b>20</b>. Now, a bit <b>40</b> can be inserted through the locking plate <b>25</b>. When the push ring <b>30</b> is released, the locking plate <b>25</b> is returned to the tilted position by the spring <b>24</b>. An internal edge of the locking plate <b>25</b> engages with the bit <b>40</b>, thus keeping the bit <b>40</b> on the tool connector. However, the push ring <b>30</b> could easily be moved by accident so that the locking plate <b>25</b> could be disengaged from the bit <b>40</b>. Thus, the bit <b>40</b> could get lose and detached from the tool connector.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention is therefore intended to obviate or at least alleviate the problems encountered in prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is the primary objective of the present invention to provide a reliable tool.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To achieve the foregoing objective, the tool includes a chuck connected to a handle. The chuck includes a mandrel including a non-circular cavity defined therein, a slit in communication with the non-circular cavity, a first bore in communication with the non-circular cavity, and a second bore in communication with the slit. A bit with a non-circular profile can be inserted in the non-circular cavity. A flat bit can be inserted in the slit. A ball is movably located in the first bore. A pin is movably located in the second bore. A movable sleeve is located around and movable along the mandrel and formed with a thread. A rotary sleeve is rotationally located around the mandrel and formed with a thread engaged with the thread of the movable sleeve. By rotating the rotary sleeve, the movable sleeve pushes the ball into the non-circular cavity and the pin into the slit.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, there are shown three bits that can be held with the chuck <b>2</b>. The bits are saws A. Each of the saws A includes an aperture B defined therein near an end. The end of each of the saws A can be inserted into the slit <b>24</b> because the body <b>32</b> of the pin <b>30</b> is located outside the slit <b>24</b>. The aperture B of the saw A is aligned with the bore <b>22</b> when the end of the saw A is located against the rod <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, by maneuvering the knob <b>60</b>, which is coated with the skin <b>70</b>, the rotary sleeve <b>50</b> is rotated so that the movable sleeve <b>40</b> is moved along the mandrel <b>10</b>. Thus, the tip of the pin <b>30</b> is inserted into the aperture B of the saw A as the head <b>31</b> of the pin <b>30</b> is pushed by the annular slope <b>47</b>. The saw A is sandwiched between an annular shoulder formed on the body <b>32</b> of the pin <b>30</b> and one of the branches of the holder <b>20</b>. Thus, the saw A is firmly held with the chuck <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there are shown four more bits that can be held with the chuck <b>2</b>. The four bits include two screwdrivers C, a socket D and a file E. Each of the bits includes an annular groove F or several recesses F defined therein near an end. The end of each of the bits can be inserted into the cavity <b>25</b> of the holder <b>20</b> because the ball <b>35</b> can be moved out of the cavity <b>25</b> completely as the ball <b>35</b> can be moved into the annular groove <b>45</b> of the movable sleeve <b>40</b> partially. The annular groove F or one of the recesses F of the bit is aligned with the bore <b>23</b> when the end of the bit is located against a closed end of the cavity <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, by maneuvering the knob <b>60</b>, which is coated with the skin <b>70</b>, the rotary sleeve <b>50</b> is rotated so that the movable sleeve <b>40</b> is moved along the mandrel <b>10</b>. Thus, a portion of the ball <b>35</b> is inserted into the annular groove or recess F of the bit as an opposite portion of the ball <b>35</b> is pushed by the cylindrical face <b>44</b> of the movable sleeve <b>40</b>. The bit is held with the chuck <b>2</b>.</p>
