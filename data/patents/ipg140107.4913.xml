<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an electric power control apparatus and an electric power control system for controlling the amount of power consumed by a plurality of information processing apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Known conventional electric power control techniques for saving power include target power control that involves establishing a criterion for targeting a power source with respect to power consumed by an apparatus that is driven, and performing electric power control based on that criterion. For example, an amount of power consumption serving as a fixed target is set as a power consumption criterion for an image forming apparatus. Based on this criterion, the image forming apparatus saves power by entering a power saving mode such as a sleep mode in which little power is consumed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Also, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2003-32397 proposes an invention for efficiently controlling overall power consumption in a system in which a plurality of image forming apparatuses are connected by a network. This invention involves controlling the state of each image forming apparatus in power saving mode, such that waiting time for an image forming apparatus that a user wants to use is minimized. Specifically, it is judged whether the total power of all other image forming apparatuses apart from an image forming apparatus that is judged to have the highest priority level exceeds a target value. If the target value has been exceeded, the other image forming apparatuses are set to a power economizing state. In other words, user-friendliness is improved by setting the image forming apparatus judged to have the highest priority level exceptionally to always be in an operational state.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In other words, while the image forming apparatus that is preferentially always in an operational state can be used at any time, the total amount of power consumption in the overall system is managed with an upper limit value. Consequently, all other image forming apparatuses enter a power economizing state when the amount of power consumption reaches the upper limit, giving rise to a feeling of unfairness among users of low priority image forming apparatuses because they can no longer use those apparatuses. Variability exists among image forming apparatuses belonging to an actual office network environment in terms of function, performance, operating time, and operating content. In order to control the amount of power consumed by image forming apparatuses placed in a variable usage environment, target power control thus needs to be performed with consideration for the factors causing that variability.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention enables realization, in an electric power control apparatus and an electric power control system for controlling power consumption by a plurality of information processing apparatuses, of an electric power control technique for power saving based on actual usage, at the time of using the information processing apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One aspect of the present invention provides an electric power control apparatus for performing electric power control on a plurality of information processing apparatuses, comprising: a first setting unit that sets a first period for performing the electric power control, and an overall target amount of power consumption corresponding to an upper limit of an amount of power to be consumed by all of the plurality of information processing apparatuses during the first period; a first calculation unit that calculates an individual target amount of power consumption corresponding to an upper limit of an amount of power to be consumed by each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses during a plurality of second periods obtained by segmentalizing the first period, based on the first period and the overall target amount of power consumption; a transmission unit that transmits the corresponding second period and the individual target amount of power consumption to each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses; a reception unit that receives an actual usage value of the amount of power consumption in the corresponding second period transmitted from each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses in response to the corresponding second period elapsing; and a second calculation unit that calculates the individual target amount of power consumption, based on the actual usage value of the amount of power consumption received from each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses and the overall target amount of power consumption, wherein the transmission unit retransmits the individual target amount of power consumption calculated by the corresponding second calculation unit to each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses, after the actual usage value of the amount of power consumption during the corresponding second period that is transmitted from each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses has been received by the reception unit.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the present invention provides an electric power control system comprising a plurality of information processing apparatuses and an electric power control apparatus for performing electric power control on the plurality of information processing apparatuses, wherein the electric power control apparatus has: a first setting unit that sets a first period for performing the electric power control, and an overall target amount of power consumption corresponding to an upper limit of an amount of power to be consumed by all of the plurality of information processing apparatuses during the first period; a first calculation unit that calculates an individual target amount of power consumption corresponding to an upper limit of an amount of power to be consumed by each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses during a plurality of second periods obtained by segmentalizing the first period, based on the first period and the overall target amount of power consumption; a transmission unit that transmits the corresponding second period and the individual target amount of power consumption to each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses; a reception unit that receives an actual usage value of the amount of power consumption in the corresponding second period transmitted from each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses in response to the corresponding second period elapsing; and a second calculation unit that calculates the individual target amount of power consumption, based on the actual usage value of the amount of power consumption received from each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses and the overall target amount of power consumption, the transmission unit retransmitting the individual target amount of power consumption calculated by the second calculation unit to each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses, after the actual usage value of the amount of power consumption during the corresponding second period that is transmitted from each of the plurality of information processing apparatuses has been received by the reception unit, and the information processing apparatuses each have: a second reception unit that receives the corresponding second period and the individual target amount of power consumption transmitted from the electric power control apparatus; a second transmission unit that transmits an actual usage value of the amount of power consumption in the corresponding second period to the electric power control apparatus, in response to the corresponding second period elapsing; and a power saving control unit that performs a prescribed power saving control, in a case where the actual usage value of the amount of power consumption in the corresponding second period exceeds the individual target amount of power consumption.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings. It should be noted that the relative arrangement of the components, the numerical expressions and the numerical values set forth in these embodiments do not limit the scope of the present invention unless it is specifically stated otherwise.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example power saving control system of a plurality of information processing apparatuses connected by a network. The power saving control system in the example of the present embodiment is constituted by image forming apparatuses A to E such as printers, copiers, facsimile machines or the like, a power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b> that manages the power consumption of each image forming apparatus A to E, and electric power measurement apparatuses (<b>101</b><i>a </i>to <b>101</b><i>f</i>) that measure power consumed by each image forming apparatus A to E.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Also, information transmission means between the devices constituting the power saving control system and connected by the network is illustrated, taking wireless communication means as an example. In this case, the wireless communication means is multi-hop wireless communication. The image forming apparatuses A to E perform mutual transmission of information with the power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b> and the electric power measurement apparatuses (<b>101</b><i>a </i>to <b>101</b><i>f</i>), either directly through or relayed via the wireless communication means. Although an example is thus shown in which the information transmission means is wireless, the information transmission means is not limited to being wireless, and may be connected by a wired connection, provided that information transmission can be performed. Also, the electric power measurement apparatus is illustrated as being disposed externally to the image forming apparatus, but the electric power measurement apparatus may be incorporated into the image forming apparatus, provided that power consumption of the image forming apparatus can be measured and the measurement information can be received.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The image forming apparatuses A to E receive information on power consumption from the electric power measurement apparatuses <b>101</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Also, the image forming apparatuses A to E receive power saving control period information and target values for implementing target power control from the power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b>. The image forming apparatuses A to E implement target power consumption control based on this received information and power saving control settings configured using a user interface.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows constituent elements of an image forming apparatus constituting the power saving control system. A controller unit <b>1200</b> performs data processing of the image forming apparatus, which plays an active role in power saving control in the power saving control system. The controller unit <b>1200</b> is connected to a scanner <b>10</b> serving as an image reading device and a printer <b>20</b> serving as an image output device.

A HDD <b>1204</b> is a hard disk drive, and stored in the HDD <b>1204</b> are the system software, image data, a software counter value, a target amount of power consumption, information on the amount of power consumption received from the electric power measurement apparatus <b>101</b>, and the like. In the software counter value is stored a value that counts the number of image outputs. This counter value is not limited to storage in the HDD <b>1204</b>, and may be stored in any nonvolatile memory that retains data after power off.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A user interface I/F <b>1206</b> is an interface with a user interface (UI) <b>140</b>, and outputs image data for displaying on the user interface <b>140</b> to the user interface <b>140</b>. Also, the user interface I/F <b>1206</b> has a role of conveying information input by a user of the system from the user interface <b>140</b> to the CPU <b>1201</b>. A network <b>1210</b> is connected to the LAN <b>3300</b>, and performs input/output of various data relating to images for output and information relating to device control. Also, the network <b>1210</b> is capable of receiving image data for output from a host computer (not shown) on the network or an external device (not shown) that manages image data for output and performing image output, in accordance with input operations using the user interface <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A wireless communication I/F <b>1270</b> wirelessly connects to peripheral devices such as a digital camera or PC (not shown) or an electric power measurement apparatus <b>101</b>, and performs input/output of various data relating to images for output and information relating to device control. A scanner/printer communication I/F <b>1208</b> is an interface for communicating respectively with the CPU of the scanner <b>10</b> and the printer <b>20</b>. The above devices are placed on a system bus. A timer <b>1211</b> functions as a timer that issues time settings for the image forming apparatus and the controller unit, and issues interrupts at fixed intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An image bus I/F <b>1205</b> is a bus bridge for converting data structure in response to an instruction of the system bus, and is connected to an image bus <b>2008</b> that performs high-speed transfer of image data. The following devices are placed on the image bus <b>2008</b>. A raster image processor (RIP) <b>1260</b> develops PDL code into a bitmap image. A device I/F unit <b>1220</b> is connected to the scanner <b>10</b> and the printer <b>20</b> serving as image input/output devices and a controller, and performs synchronous and asynchronous conversion of image data. A scanner image processing unit <b>1280</b> performs correction, modification and editing on input image data. A printer image processing unit <b>1290</b> performs printer correction, resolution conversion and the like on image data for printing out. An image rotation unit <b>1230</b> performs rotation of image data. An image compression unit <b>1240</b> performs JPEG compression and decompression in relation to multi-valued image data, and JBIG, MMR and MH compression and decompression in relation to binary image data.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Also, the image forming apparatuses A to E are provided with a sleep mode for power saving. The CPU <b>1201</b> performs control to switch the operation mode to this sleep mode. That is, the CPU <b>1201</b> is able to independently control cut-off and supply of power supply to parts such as the printer <b>20</b>, the scanner <b>10</b> and the user interface <b>140</b>, after having determined the operational state of the image forming apparatus. For example, in the case where only the scanner function is used, power supply to the printer <b>20</b> and the printer image processing unit <b>1290</b> is cut off. On the other hand, in the case where only the printer function is used, power supply to functional units that are not required such as the user interface <b>140</b>, the scanner <b>10</b> and the scanner image processing unit <b>1280</b> is cut off. The image forming apparatuses A to E are thus provided with a mechanism for reducing power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows constituent elements of a power consumption management apparatus constituting the power saving control system. The power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b> manages the amount of power consumption and the target amount of power consumption in the power saving control system. A CPU <b>1301</b> performs overall control of the power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b> by executing a control program. A RAM <b>1302</b> is a system work memory for allowing the CPU <b>1301</b> to operate. A ROM <b>1303</b> is a boot ROM, and stored in the ROM <b>1303</b> is a system boot program. A HDD <b>1304</b> is a hard disk drive, and stored in the HDD <b>1304</b> is system software, target amounts of power consumption, amounts of power consumption received from the image forming apparatuses A to E, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A network <b>1310</b> is a LAN connection interface (I/F) for connecting to external devices with a wired LAN. A wireless communication I/F <b>1307</b> is a wireless communication interface for performing communication with the image forming apparatuses A to E, and performs reception of information on amounts of power consumption and transmission of target amounts of power consumption. An I/O <b>1305</b> is an interface that performs input/output of information with a user interface <b>1306</b> constituted by an input/output device (not shown) such as a liquid crystal display or a mouse. Input of various types of setting instructions for setting the target amount of power consumption and the like in the power saving control system can be accepted with this user interface <b>1306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The configuration of the power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b> has been described above, with this configuration being based on a general-purpose computer. However, the power consumption management apparatus is not limited to this configuration, provided that the amount of power consumption in the power saving control system can be managed and setting input instructions for the target amount of power consumption and the like can be accepted. One of the image forming apparatuses constituting the power saving control system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may act as the above power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows constituent elements of an electric power measurement apparatus <b>101</b> constituting the power saving control system. The electric power measurement apparatus <b>101</b> performs measurement of the amount of power consumption and transmission of measurement results in the power saving control system. A CPU <b>1401</b> performs overall control of the electric power measurement apparatus <b>101</b> such as controlling measurement of power consumption and transmission of measurement results by executing a control program. A RAM <b>1402</b> is a system work memory for allowing the CPU <b>1401</b> to operate. An image forming apparatus <b>102</b> is configured such that the power source is supplied via an electric power measurement unit <b>1404</b> of the electric power measurement apparatus <b>101</b>, and the electric power measurement unit <b>1404</b> directly measures the amount of power on a primary side supplied to a power source portion of the image forming apparatus <b>102</b>. The CPU <b>1401</b> stores information such as the amount of power consumption resulting from this measurement in the RAM <b>1402</b>. A ROM <b>1403</b> is a boot ROM, and stored in the ROM <b>1403</b> is a boot program of the system and system software.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A network <b>1410</b> is a LAN connection interface (I/F) for connecting to external devices with a wired LAN. A wireless communication I/F <b>1407</b> is a wireless communication interface for performing communication with the image forming apparatuses A to E, and performs transmission of information on the amount of power consumption in response to a request from an image forming apparatus.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Also, the electric power measurement apparatus was illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as an external electric power measurement apparatus <b>101</b> capable of communicating with an image forming apparatus, in order to realize the function of measuring power consumption in the power saving control system. However, the electric power measurement apparatus is not limited to the example configuration disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, provided that the amount of power consumption of an image forming apparatus can be measured in the power saving control system, and a configuration may be adopted in which the function thereof is provided in the image forming apparatus as a power consumption measurement unit.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows a screen of the user interface <b>1306</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b> in the power saving control system of the present invention, with an example of a target power consumption amount settings screen <b>1500</b> being shown. The illustrated user interface screen is constituted by an input area <b>1501</b> for inputting the overall target amount of power consumption corresponding to an upper limit of the amount of power to be consumed by all of the image forming apparatuses constituting the power saving control system, and an input area <b>1502</b> for inputting a target power control period for performing power saving control on the overall system. Values input to these input areas are input in order to calculate a target value for the individual devices as power saving control parameters for the overall system.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a screen of the user interface <b>1306</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b> in the power saving control system. Shown here is a screen for configuring advanced settings, in order to calculate a target value for the amount of power consumption to be set for the individual image forming apparatuses. The advanced settings screen <b>1600</b> is provided with an allocation unit setting area <b>1601</b> for setting the unit of allocation of the period allocation settings. This allocation unit setting area <b>1601</b> is provided with selection items that enable the units of allocation for allocating the target amount of power consumption to the target power control period shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> to be selected using checkboxes in units of 1 day <b>1602</b> or 1 week <b>1603</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Also, the allocation unit setting area <b>1601</b> is provided with a day allocation settings button <b>1604</b> for setting allocation of the target amount of power consumption by day, and a checkbox for enabling the day allocation setting, in order to configure advanced allocation settings based on the allocation units set in the allocation unit setting area <b>1601</b>. Pressing this button results in display transiting to a day allocation setting screen <b>1700</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. The allocation unit setting area <b>1601</b> is further provided with a time allocation settings button <b>1605</b> for setting allocation of the target amount of power consumption by time, and a checkbox for enabling the time allocation setting. Pressing this button results in display transiting to a time allocation setting screen <b>1705</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, the advanced settings screen <b>1600</b> is provided with an actual usage allocation settings button <b>1606</b> for setting allocation of the target amount of power consumption by actual usage for performing periodical allocation setting according to past actual usage of the amount of power consumption, that is, the actual usage value of the amount of power consumption, and a checkbox for enabling the actual usage allocation setting. This enables the allocation setting to be determined from the amounts of power consumption received from the image forming apparatuses and stored by the power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b>. The advanced settings screen <b>1600</b> is also provided with an equal allocation button <b>1607</b> for setting allocation of the target amount of power consumption equally among the image forming apparatuses, and a checkbox for enabling equal allocation, as selection items for performing allocation setting per image forming apparatus. Also, the advanced settings screen <b>1600</b> is provided with an actual usage allocation button <b>1608</b> for setting allocation proportionally among the image forming apparatuses according to actual usage, and a checkbox for enabling the actual usage allocation setting.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Pressing the actual usage allocation button <b>1608</b> results in display transiting to an actual usage allocation setting screen <b>1800</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. Because it is envisaged that in the case where this actual usage allocation is selected, an image forming apparatus whose operating rate is extremely low will have an allocation indefinitely approaching zero, a lower limit setting area <b>1609</b> is provided so as to enable a minimum usable allocation value to be allocated. Selecting this checkbox enables allocation setting of an amount equal to a value input to a lower limit setting value input area <b>1610</b> that has been set.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, the advanced settings screen <b>1600</b> is provided with a manual allocation settings button <b>1611</b> for performing allocation of the target amount of power consumption among the devices manually, and a checkbox for enabling the manual allocation setting. Pressing the manual allocation settings button <b>1611</b> results in display transiting to a manual settings screen <b>1806</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows the day allocation settings screen <b>1700</b> displayed with the day allocation settings button <b>1604</b> on the advanced settings screen <b>1600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The day allocation settings screen <b>1700</b> is provided with a total allocation value <b>1701</b> allocated for the week, a display area <b>1703</b> for displaying the daily target amounts of power consumption shown with a bar graph, and an actual usage value import button <b>1704</b> for importing the actual usage values for one week and displaying the imported actual usage values as a bar graph. The day allocation settings screen <b>1700</b> also further includes a change arrow <b>1702</b> for changing the daily values. Because the change of values using this change arrow <b>1702</b> is limited to a change within the range of the total allocation value <b>1701</b>, adjustment up or down between the days of the week is performed within this limit. For example, in the case where it is estimated that an image forming apparatus whose actual usage value has not reached the lower limit of the allocated target amount of power consumption will continue to similarly use a small amount of power, the target amount of power consumption to be reallocated may be reduced, thereby allowing the amount of power by which the target amount of power consumption was reduced to be allocated to another image forming apparatus. In the case where the actual usage values of the power consumption amount of the image forming apparatuses differ, reallocation of the target amount of power consumption for each image forming apparatus based on these actual usage values can be set.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows the time allocation settings screen <b>1705</b> displayed using the time allocation settings button <b>1605</b> on the advanced settings screen <b>1600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The time allocation settings screen <b>1705</b> is provided with a display area <b>1706</b> for displaying the total allocation value allocated for one day, a display area <b>1707</b> for displaying the hourly target amount of power consumption shown with a bar graph, and an actual usage value import button <b>1708</b> for importing the actual usage values for one day and displaying the imported actual usage values as a bar graph. The time allocation settings screen <b>1705</b> is constituted by a change arrow <b>1709</b> for changing the hourly values. The method of changing values using this change arrow <b>1709</b> is similar to the description given for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows the actual usage allocation settings screen <b>1800</b> displayed using the actual usage allocation button <b>1608</b> on the advanced settings screen <b>1600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The actual usage allocation settings screen <b>1800</b> is provided with a display area <b>1801</b> for displaying the total allocation value allocated for one day, a bar graph area <b>1802</b> for the target amount of power consumption for each device for that day shown as a bar graph, and an actual usage value import button <b>1803</b> for importing the actual usage values for one day and displaying the imported actual usage values as a bar graph. Also, the actual usage allocation settings screen <b>1800</b> is provided with a change arrow <b>1805</b> for changing the device-specific values. The method of changing values using this change arrow <b>1805</b> is similar to the description given for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a state in which a lower limit setting area <b>1609</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> has been set is depicted. This set lower limit value <b>1804</b> is shown with a broken line in the bar graph area <b>1802</b>. For example, in the case of a device A, the actual usage value (shaded portion) is under the lower limit value <b>1804</b>. In this case, the value of the lower limit value <b>1804</b> is allocated to the target amount of power consumption. In other words, the target amount of power consumption is allocated so as to not fall below the prescribed lower limit value.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows the manual allocation settings screen <b>1806</b> displayed using the manual allocation settings button <b>1611</b> on the advanced settings screen <b>1600</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The manual allocation settings screen <b>1806</b> is provided with a display area <b>1807</b> for displaying the total allocation value allocated for one day, a bar graph area <b>1808</b> for the target amount of power consumption for each image forming apparatus for that day shown with a bar graph, and an actual usage value import button <b>1809</b> for importing the actual usage values for one day and displaying the imported actual usage values as a bar graph. Also, the manual allocation settings screen <b>1806</b> is provided with a change arrow <b>1810</b> for changing the device-specific values. The method of changing values using this change arrow <b>1810</b> is similar to the description given for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Hereinabove, allocation setting screens were described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, although the allocation setting screens are not limited to the illustrated example, provided that operation means that enables allocation settings based on the various allocation setting methods to be performed is provided. The various allocation setting screens may be screens that enable confirmation and input of allocation settings using numerical values, for example, instead of with bar graphs and change arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> show an example operation flow between the image forming apparatuses A to E and the power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b> in the power saving control system of the present embodiment. In particular, coordinated operation involving transmission of information such as the target amount of power consumption and the like between the image forming apparatuses A to E and the power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b> will also be described.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">At S<b>1806</b> of the flow of the power consumption management apparatus, the CPU <b>1301</b> accepts setting of the target amount of power consumption in the input area <b>1501</b> on the target power consumption amount settings screen <b>1500</b> displayed on the user interface <b>1306</b> in the power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b>. The CPU <b>1301</b> then records the setting value thereof to the RAM <b>1302</b> and the HDD <b>1304</b>. At S<b>1807</b>, the CPU <b>1301</b> accepts setting of the target power control period in the input area <b>1502</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) on the settings screen <b>1500</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>), and records the setting value thereof to the RAM <b>1302</b> and the HDD <b>1304</b>. In this case, an example is illustrated in which one month (30 days) is input as the first period. Next, at S<b>1808</b>, the CPU <b>1301</b> accepts input of advanced settings for calculating the target amounts of power consumption to be set for the individual image forming apparatuses on the advanced settings screen <b>1600</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>), and records the input value thereof to the RAM <b>1302</b> and the HDD <b>1304</b>. In this case, the case where the allocation unit setting area <b>1601</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) is set to 1 day as the second period is illustrated. In other words, the first period of 30 days is segmentalized into a plurality of second periods in units of 1 day. At S<b>1809</b>, the CPU <b>1301</b> decides the individual target amounts of power consumption for the image forming apparatuses corresponding to the upper limit of the amount of power to be consumed by each apparatus in the corresponding second period, from the input allocation setting for the individual image forming apparatuses. Next, at S<b>1810</b>, the CPU <b>1301</b> transmits information on the individual target amounts of power consumption to the respective image forming apparatuses A to E (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) via the wireless communication I/F <b>1307</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At S<b>1801</b> in the flow of the image forming apparatuses, the CPU <b>1201</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) receives information on the target amount of power consumption sent from the power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b>, and records that information to the RAM <b>1202</b> and the HDD <b>1204</b>. Next, at S<b>1802</b>, the CPU <b>1201</b> implements target power consumption control based on this received information on the target amount of power consumption. At S<b>1803</b>, the CPU <b>1201</b> determines whether 1 day of the corresponding second period has elapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">At S<b>1804</b>, the CPU <b>1201</b> of the respective image forming apparatuses A to E, having determined that the second period (1 day) has elapsed, transmits an actual usage value of the amount of power consumption received from the electric power measurement apparatus <b>101</b> to the power consumption management apparatus after the second period (1 day) has elapsed (performed by an actual usage value transmission unit). At S<b>1805</b>, the CPU <b>1201</b> determines whether the first period (30 days) has elapsed from when electric power control was started. In the image forming apparatuses A to E, S<b>1801</b> to S<b>1805</b> are repeated for the duration of these 30 days.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Next, in the power consumption management apparatus <b>106</b>, the CPU <b>1301</b>, at S<b>1811</b>, waits for the second period, that is, 1 day, based on the period allocation setting on the advanced settings screen <b>1600</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). Next, at S<b>1812</b>, the CPU <b>1301</b> receives actual usage values of the amount of power consumption from other image forming apparatuses including the image forming apparatuses A to E, and records those actual usage values to the RAM <b>1302</b> and the HDD <b>1304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, at S<b>1813</b>, the CPU <b>1301</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) derives the actual usage value of the amount of power consumption for the entire network system.

This total amount is then subtracted from the overall target amount of power consumption that has been set, and the balance of the target power consumption for that period is calculated. The target amount of power consumption for the overall system for the next second period (1 day) is then calculated, based on that calculated amount of power consumption.
