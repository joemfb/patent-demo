<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A computer implemented method, system, and/or computer program product generates an audio cohort. Audio data from a set of audio sensors is received by an audio analysis engine. The audio data, which is associated with a plurality of objects, comprises a set of audio patterns. The audio data is processed to identify audio attributes associated with the plurality of objects to form digital audio data. This digital audio data comprises metadata that describes the audio attributes of the set of objects. A set of audio cohorts is generated using the audio attributes associated with the digital audio data and cohort criteria, where each audio cohort in the set of audio cohorts is a cohort of accompanied customers in a store, and where processing the audio data identifies a type of zoological creature that is accompanying each of the accompanied customers.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to an improved data processing system and in particular to a method and apparatus for generating cohorts. More particularly, the present invention is directed to a computer implemented method, apparatus, and computer usable program code for processing audio input data to generate cohorts.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A cohort is a group of people, animals, plants, places, or objects that share a common attribute or experience. For example, a group of people born in 1980 may form a birth cohort. A cohort may include one or more sub-cohorts. For example, the birth cohort of people born in 1980 may include a sub-cohort of people born in 1980 in Salt Lake City, Utah. A sub-subcohort may include people born in 1980 in Salt Lake City, Utah to low income, single parent households.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Cohorts are frequently generated based on one or more attributes of the members of each cohort. The information used to identify the attributes of members of a cohort is typically provided by the members of the cohort. However, information describing attributes of members of a cohort may be voluminous, dynamically changing, unavailable, difficult to collect, and/or unknown to the member of the cohort and/or the user selecting members of a cohort. Moreover, it may be difficult, time consuming, or impractical for an individual to access all the information necessary to accurately generate cohorts. Thus, unique cohorts may be sub-optimal because individuals lack the skills, time, knowledge, and/or expertise needed to gather cohort attribute information from available sources.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A computer implemented method, system, and/or computer program product generates an audio cohort. Audio data from a set of audio sensors is received by an audio analysis engine. The audio data, which is associated with a plurality of objects, comprises a set of audio patterns. The audio data is processed to identify audio attributes associated with the plurality of objects to form digital audio data. This digital audio data comprises metadata that describes the audio attributes of the set of objects. A set of audio cohorts is generated using the audio attributes associated with the digital audio data and cohort criteria, where each audio cohort in the set of audio cohorts is a cohort of accompanied customers in a store, and where processing the audio data identifies a type of zoological creature that is accompanying each of the accompanied customers.</p>

It should be appreciated that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-2</figref> are only exemplary and are not intended to assert or imply any limitation with regard to the environments in which different embodiments may be implemented. Many modifications to the depicted environments may be made.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a pictorial representation of a network of data processing systems in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Network data processing system <b>100</b> is a network of computers in which the illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Network data processing system <b>100</b> contains network <b>102</b>, which is the medium used to provide communications links between various devices and computers connected together within network data processing system <b>100</b>. Network <b>102</b> may include connections, such as wire, wireless communication links, or fiber optic cables.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the depicted example, server <b>104</b> and server <b>106</b> connect to network <b>102</b> along with storage unit <b>108</b>. In addition, clients <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>114</b> connect to network <b>102</b>. Clients <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>114</b> may be, for example, personal computers or network computers. In the depicted example, server <b>104</b> provides data, such as boot files, operating system images, and applications to clients <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>114</b>. Clients <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>114</b> are clients to server <b>104</b> in this example. Network data processing system <b>100</b> may include additional servers, clients, and other devices not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Program code located in network data processing system <b>100</b> may be stored on a computer recordable storage medium and downloaded to a data processing system or other device for use. For example, program code may be stored on a computer recordable storage medium on server <b>104</b> and downloaded to client <b>110</b> over network <b>102</b> for use on client <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the depicted example, network data processing system <b>100</b> is the Internet with network <b>102</b> representing a worldwide collection of networks and gateways that use the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite of protocols to communicate with one another. At the heart of the Internet is a backbone of high-speed data communication lines between major nodes or host computers, consisting of thousands of commercial, governmental, educational and other computer systems that route data and messages. Of course, network data processing system <b>100</b> also may be implemented as a number of different types of networks, such as for example, an intranet, a local area network (LAN), or a wide area network (WAN). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is intended as an example, and not as an architectural limitation for the different illustrative embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a block diagram of a data processing system is shown in which illustrative embodiments may be implemented. Data processing system <b>200</b> is an example of a computer, such as server <b>104</b> or client <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in which computer usable program code or instructions implementing the processes may be located for the illustrative embodiments. In this illustrative example, data processing system <b>200</b> includes communications fabric <b>202</b>, which provides communications between processor unit <b>204</b>, memory <b>206</b>, persistent storage <b>208</b>, communications unit <b>210</b>, input/output (I/O) unit <b>212</b>, and display <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Processor unit <b>204</b> serves to execute instructions for software that may be loaded into memory <b>206</b>. Processor unit <b>204</b> may be a set of one or more processors or may be a multi-processor core, depending on the particular implementation. Further, processor unit <b>204</b> may be implemented using one or more heterogeneous processor systems in which a main processor is present with secondary processors on a single chip. As another illustrative example, processor unit <b>204</b> may be a symmetric multi-processor system containing multiple processors of the same type.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Memory <b>206</b> and persistent storage <b>208</b> are examples of storage devices. A storage device is any piece of hardware that is capable of storing information either on a temporary basis and/or a permanent basis. Memory <b>206</b>, in these examples, may be, for example, a random access memory or any other suitable volatile or non-volatile storage device. Persistent storage <b>208</b> may take various forms depending on the particular implementation. For example, persistent storage <b>208</b> may contain one or more components or devices. For example, persistent storage <b>208</b> may be a hard drive, a flash memory, a rewritable optical disk, a rewritable magnetic tape, or some combination of the above. The media used by persistent storage <b>208</b> also may be removable. For example, a removable hard drive may be used for persistent storage <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Communications unit <b>210</b>, in these examples, provides for communications with other data processing systems or devices. In these examples, communications unit <b>210</b> is a network interface card. Communications unit <b>210</b> may provide communications through the use of either or both physical and wireless communications links.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Input/output unit <b>212</b> allows for input and output of data with other devices that may be connected to data processing system <b>200</b>. For example, input/output unit <b>212</b> may provide a connection for user input through a keyboard and mouse. Further, input/output unit <b>212</b> may send output to a printer. Display <b>214</b> provides a mechanism to display information to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Instructions for the operating system and applications or programs are located on persistent storage <b>208</b>. These instructions may be loaded into memory <b>206</b> for execution by processor unit <b>204</b>. The processes of the different embodiments may be performed by processor unit <b>204</b> using computer implemented instructions, which may be located in a memory, such as memory <b>206</b>. These instructions are referred to as program code, computer usable program code, or computer readable program code that may be read and executed by a processor in processor unit <b>204</b>. The program code in the different embodiments may be embodied on different physical or tangible computer readable media, such as memory <b>206</b> or persistent storage <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Program code <b>216</b> is located in a functional form on computer readable media <b>218</b> that is selectively removable and may be loaded onto or transferred to data processing system <b>200</b> for execution by processor unit <b>204</b>. Program code <b>216</b> and computer readable media <b>218</b> form computer program product <b>220</b> in these examples. In one example, computer readable media <b>218</b> may be in a tangible form, such as, for example, an optical or magnetic disc that is inserted or placed into a drive or other device that is part of persistent storage <b>208</b> for transfer onto a storage device, such as a hard drive that is part of persistent storage <b>208</b>. In a tangible form, computer readable media <b>218</b> also may take the form of a persistent storage, such as a hard drive, a thumb drive, or a flash memory that is connected to data processing system <b>200</b>. The tangible form of computer readable media <b>218</b> is also referred to as computer recordable storage media. In some instances, computer recordable media <b>218</b> may not be removable.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Alternatively, program code <b>216</b> may be transferred to data processing system <b>200</b> from computer readable media <b>218</b> through a communications link to communications unit <b>210</b> and/or through a connection to input/output unit <b>212</b>. The communications link and/or the connection may be physical or wireless in the illustrative examples. The computer readable media also may take the form of non-tangible media, such as communications links or wireless transmissions containing the program code.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some illustrative embodiments, program code <b>216</b> may be downloaded over a network to persistent storage <b>208</b> from another device or data processing system for use within data processing system <b>200</b>. For instance, program code stored in a computer readable storage medium in a server data processing system may be downloaded over a network from the server to data processing system <b>200</b>. The data processing system providing program code <b>216</b> may be a server computer, a client computer, or some other device capable of storing and transmitting program code <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The different components illustrated for data processing system <b>200</b> are not meant to provide architectural limitations to the manner in which different embodiments may be implemented. The different illustrative embodiments may be implemented in a data processing system including components in addition to or in place of those illustrated for data processing system <b>200</b>. Other components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be varied from the illustrative examples shown.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As one example, a storage device in data processing system <b>200</b> is any hardware apparatus that may store data. Memory <b>206</b>, persistent storage <b>208</b>, and computer readable media <b>218</b> are examples of storage devices in a tangible form.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In another example, a bus system may be used to implement communications fabric <b>202</b> and may be comprised of one or more buses, such as a system bus or an input/output bus. Of course, the bus system may be implemented using any suitable type of architecture that provides for a transfer of data between different components or devices attached to the bus system. Additionally, a communications unit may include one or more devices used to transmit and receive data, such as a modem or a network adapter. Further, a memory may be, for example, memory <b>206</b> or a cache such as found in an interface and memory controller hub that may be present in communications fabric <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In many industries and professions, such as, without limitation, search and rescue, research, and industry, it is useful to be able to distinguish different sounds, determine the strength of a sound, and the source of a particular sound. A human user may manually identify sounds and the source of a sound using natural human sense of hearing and/or a human user utilizing a hearing aid or other device that amplifies or modulates sounds for the wearer in combination with the human user's knowledge and experience. However, this technique is limited by the human ability to hear and the human ability to distinguish different sounds in a multitude of different sounds.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Currently, electronic sensing technologies have been developed that are capable of reproducing human senses using audio sensors and other electronic devices, such as microphones. The illustrative embodiments recognize that the information generated by electronic audio sensors may be used to identify cohorts and improve selection of members of cohorts. As used herein, a cohort is a group of objects that share at least one common attribute. The objects in a cohort may be humans, animals, plants, places, locations, or inanimate objects. A cohort may be a null set having no members, a single member, or a group including two or more members. Cohorts may be used in research, marketing, safety studies, and many other industries for various uses.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Therefore, in one embodiment of the present invention, a computer implemented method, apparatus, and computer program product for generating audio cohorts is provided. An audio analysis engine receives audio data from a set of audio input devices. An audio input device is any type of device that can capture, detect, measure, or record vibrations and sound waves transmitted through solids, liquids, semi-solids, or gases, such as, without limitation, the air. For example, an audio input device may be implemented as, but without limitation, a microphone or a sonar device. The audio data may be in an analog format. The audio data is associated with one or more objects. The audio data may include a set of audio patterns. As used herein, the term &#x201c;set&#x201d; refers to one or more, unless specifically defined otherwise. Thus, a set of audio patterns comprises one or more audio patterns. An audio pattern may be any type of pattern, such as, without limitation, patterns in frequency, wavelength, speed, direction, volume, intensity, or any other attribute in audio data.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An audio analysis engine analyzes and processes the audio data and any audio patterns in the audio data to generate digital audio data. The digital audio data comprises metadata describing the audio attributes of the audio data. The audio analysis engine may utilize any type of known or available audio analysis software, audio spectrum analyzer, bioacoustic analysis software, and/or voice recognition software, also referred to as speech recognition software.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An audio attribute is a characteristic, feature, property, character, or quality of a human, an animal, a plant, an object, a place, or a location. For example, audio attributes may include an identification of a sound, identification of a type of sound, a source or origin of a sound, identification of an object generating a sound, identification of a combination of sounds, identification of a combination of objects generating a sound or a combination of sounds, a volume of a sound, and sound wave properties.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A sound wave property is a measurable property of a sound. Sound wave properties include, without limitation, the frequency, wavelength, amplitude, intensity, speed, and direction of a sound. The type of sound may be a general classification or sub-classification of a sound. A type of sound may include, without limitation, a human voice talking, an animal sound, an engine sound, a baby cry, a door opening or closing, footsteps, water running, rain, sound of breaking or shattering, laughter, or any other types of sounds. A sub-category of a type of sound may be more specific. For example, and without limitation, the classification of a human voice talking may have sub-classifications of a female voice talking, a male voice talking, a human voice talking in a whisper, a human voice talking loudly, a human voice talking with a southern accent, a human voice talking with a Texas accent, a human voice talking with a Scottish brogue, a human voice talking with a particular dialect or regional accent, talking in English, talking in Spanish, or talking in any other language.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">An identification of a sound is an identification of a particular sound. For example, an identification of a sound may be the sound of a Harley motorcycle engine, a specific, identified, person's voice, a particular door opening or closing, or some other specific, identified sound. For example, a sound may be identified generally as a human voice, specifically as an identified person's voice, human speech, or specific content of the human speech. Still more particularly, the identification of a sound may include an identification of the sound as human speech and an identification of attributes of the human speech. Attributes of human speech may include, without limitation, an identification of at least one of a language spoken, a regional dialect associated with the human speech, an accent associated with the human speech, an identification of whether the speaker is male or female, a rapidity of speech, and an identification of words spoken in the human speech or the subject matter/content of the speech. The phrase &#x201c;at least one&#x201d; means that the attributes of human speech may include only a single one of the listed attributes, as well as any combination of two or more of the attributes of human speech. For example, the attributes may include an identification of the speaker as male. In another example, the attributes may identify the speaker as a male speaker that is speaking English. In yet another example, the attributes may identify the speaker as a female speaking Spanish with a Venezuelan dialect.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A set of audio cohorts is generated using the attributes in the digital audio data and cohort criteria. Cohort criteria are rules, standards, guidelines, or other criteria for selecting members of a cohort. For example, and without limitation, cohort criteria may specify that members of a car cohort should only include cars with engines that generate noises below a certain loudness threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The set of audio cohorts may comprise a single cohort, as well as two or more cohorts. An audio cohort may have any number of members from a null set to an infinite number of members. An audio cohort may include members that are sounds or audio information. However, audio cohorts are not limited to sounds or audio information describing sounds. A member of an audio cohort may include a human, animal, plant, place, location, or inanimate object. In other words, an audio cohort is a cohort with member objects that are selected using audio data and attributes of audio data. In one embodiment, the audio cohort may be used in a system wide monitoring process to quickly and efficiently pass vital information to a real-time computational process. Thus, the embodiments permit a user to create cohorts based on audio data describing different sounds, sources of different sounds, and other attributes of one or more sounds in a particular area or environment.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, and without limitation, a user may wish to identify every customer in a shopping mall that is speaking to a sale representative or speaking to someone in customer service. In such a case, the user may analyze digital audio data to identify customers that are associated with conversations taking place at customer service centers and/or customers speaking to employees prior to making a purchase. These customers may then be selected as members of one or more cohorts of customers utilizing employee expertise or otherwise utilizing customer services provided by employees.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In another example, attributes of the audio data may be used to identify sounds made by animals and sounds made by babies or children. In such a case, the attributes in the audio data may be used to identify customers with a child or customers with a pet. This audio data may then be used to create cohorts of children, cohorts of pets, cohorts of dogs, cohorts of babies, cohorts of toddlers, cohorts of young children, cohorts of parents or guardians with children, and/or cohorts of pet owners with their pets. These cohorts provide an effective tool for users to create cohorts based on an analysis of audio sensory input gathered by audio input devices, such as, without limitation, a microphone.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of an audio sensory input analysis system in accordance with an illustrative embodiment. Computer <b>300</b> may be implemented using any type of computing device, such as, but not limited to, a main frame, server, a personal computer, laptop, personal digital assistant (PDA), or any other computing device depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Set of audio sensors <b>302</b> is a set of audio input devices that detect, capture, and/or record vibrations <b>304</b>, such as, without limitation, pressure waves and sound waves. Vibrations <b>304</b> may be detected as vibrations <b>304</b> are transmitted through a solid object, a liquid, a semisolid, or a gas, such as the air or atmosphere. Set of audio sensors <b>302</b> may include only a single audio input device, as well as two or more audio input devices. An audio sensor in set of audio sensors <b>302</b> may be implemented as any type of device, such as, without limitation, a microphone, a sonar device, an acoustic identification system, or any other device capable of detecting vibrations <b>304</b> transmitted through a medium, such as a solid, liquid, semisolid, and/or gas.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this embodiment, set of audio sensors <b>302</b> is implemented as a set of microphones connected to computer <b>300</b>, which detects and records sounds and identifies patterns of sounds in vibrations <b>304</b>. However, set of audio sensors <b>302</b> is not limited to implementation using only microphones.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Set of audio sensors <b>302</b> analyzes vibrations <b>304</b> in the audio sample to generate audio data <b>306</b>. In this example, audio data <b>306</b> is analog data generated by set of audio sensors <b>302</b> in response to detecting vibrations <b>304</b>. However, the embodiments are not limited to audio data in an analog format. The embodiments may also be implemented using a set of audio sensors that generate audio data in a digital format.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Audio data <b>306</b> may include audio patterns in vibrations <b>304</b> identified by set of audio sensors <b>302</b>. An audio pattern is a pattern of data that describes patterns or changes the properties of sound waves that occur over time. Different audio patterns are created as a result of contact or exposure with different sounds, different volumes of sounds, different environments which may amplify, echo, or absorb sound, and/or different combinations of sounds in a particular environment.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, a particular audio pattern is produced when a dog barks and a different audio pattern is produced when an engine is revved up. Likewise, a dog barking outside in an open area with few obstructions will produce one audio pattern, while a dog barking in an enclosed space that tends to cause sound to bounce of one or more surfaces and echo sound back will produce a different audio pattern. In another example, if two dogs are barking at a cat that is meowing, a different audio pattern is produced than when only a single dog is barking in an empty room with no other sources of sound present. In other words, a unique audio pattern is produced in response to each unique type of sound, origin of sound, location or environment where the sound is detected, combination of different sounds, and/or volume of the sound.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Audio data <b>306</b> is generated in response to set of audio sensors <b>302</b> detecting a particular sound and/or combinations of sounds in a single audio sample or a series of audio samples. An audio sample comprises the vibrations that are detected and/or recorded during a particular time period. For example, and without limitation, a microphone may record sounds for ten minutes. In such a case, the ten minutes of recording may be a single audio sample or the ten minutes of recording may be broken up into thirty (30) second audio samples to create twenty (20) audio samples from the ten minutes of recording. However, an audio sample is not limited to ten minute or thirty second time periods. An audio recording may be broken down into any number of time segments, such as, without limitation, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, or any other units of time. An audio recording may also be broken down into a single audio sample, as well as two or more audio samples.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In addition, the embodiments do not require that an audio recording be separated into audio samples. An audio recording may be analyzed as a single recording in which a particular segment of the recording is identified or located using time indicators or any other indicators. For example, in an hour long audio recording, indicators may be used to identify a particular segment of the audio recording that occurs twenty minutes (20) and twenty (20) seconds into the recording, or the segment may be identified using the time. So if the segment occurring twenty minutes and twenty seconds into the recording were recorded from 3:45 p.m. to 3:46 p.m., that segment may be identified and located using the time. In another example, a particular segment may be identified using an identification number, an index, or any other method for identifying portions of an audio recording.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Set of audio sensors <b>302</b> sends audio data <b>306</b> to audio analysis engine <b>308</b> in computer <b>300</b>. If audio data <b>302</b> is in an analog format, audio analysis engine <b>308</b> converts audio data <b>306</b> from the analog format into a digital format that is compatible with cohort generation engine <b>314</b>. In other words, audio analysis engine <b>308</b> processes audio data <b>306</b> to form digital audio data <b>312</b>. Digital audio data <b>312</b> identifies attributes of vibrations <b>304</b>. Digital audio data <b>312</b> comprises metadata describing the identified attributes of vibrations <b>304</b> sounds in the audio sample used to generate digital audio data <b>312</b>. Metadata generator <b>310</b> is a software component for generating the metadata describing the attributes of vibrations <b>304</b>. The metadata in digital audio data <b>312</b> describes attributes of vibrations <b>304</b> detected in an audio sample. For example, and without limitation, attributes in digital audio data <b>312</b> may identify a source or origin of a sound, the type of sound, identify a particular sound, identify a combination of sounds, and/or any other attributes. Digital audio data <b>312</b> may be transmitted to cohort generation engine <b>314</b> as, without limitation, a digital wave file with the metadata.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Digital audio data <b>312</b> may also be used to identify humans and animals with irregular breathing, wheezing, congestion, coughing, or sneezing to identify, for example and without limitation, patients and/or animals that are suffering from infections, bronchitis, asthma, the flu, a cold or other health problems, the sound of car alarms, gas leaks, tornado sirens, smoke alarms, fire alarms, burglar alarms, police sirens, fire truck sirens, ambulance sirens, and other emergency or warning alarms that may indicate the presence of potentially hazardous conditions, emergency situations, and/or dangerous substances.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Cohort generation engine <b>314</b> receives digital audio data <b>312</b> from audio analysis engine <b>308</b>. Cohort generation engine <b>314</b> may request digital audio data <b>312</b> from audio analysis engine <b>308</b>. In another embodiment, audio analysis engine <b>308</b> automatically sends digital audio data <b>312</b> to cohort generation engine <b>314</b> in real time as digital audio data <b>312</b> is generated. In yet another embodiment, audio analysis engine <b>308</b> sends digital audio data <b>312</b> to cohort generation engine <b>314</b> upon the occurrence of a predetermined event, such as, without limitation, a predetermined time, completion of processing audio data <b>306</b>, occurrence of a timeout event, a user request for generation of set of audio cohorts <b>324</b> based on digital audio data <b>312</b>, or any other predetermined event.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Cohort generation engine <b>314</b> generates set of audio cohorts <b>324</b> based on digital audio data <b>312</b>. In one embodiment, cohort generation engine <b>314</b> compares the audio patterns described in digital audio data <b>312</b> with identified audio patterns <b>316</b> for comparison. Each different sound and/or combination of sounds in a particular environment creates a different audio pattern. Audio patterns <b>316</b> are audio patterns for known sounds and/or combinations of sounds in a particular environment. A particular audio pattern may be compared to known audio patterns. If a match is found, the matching audio pattern may be used to identify attributes of a particular sound associated with vibrations <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Cohort generation engine <b>314</b> may optionally process digital audio data <b>312</b> in data models <b>320</b>. Data models <b>320</b> are a set of one or more data models for processing audio data and identifying attributes of sounds associated with vibrations <b>304</b>. A data model is a model for structuring, defining, organizing, imposing limitations or constraints, and/or otherwise manipulating data and metadata to produce a result. A data model may be generated using any type of modeling method or simulation including, but not limited to, a statistical method, a data mining method, a causal model, a mathematical model, a marketing model, a behavioral model, a psychological model, a sociological model, or a simulation model. In one embodiment, digital audio data <b>312</b> is processed using one or more data models to create one or more audio cohorts. For example, a data model may be used to identify customers in a department store that are not speaking English. This information is used to create a cohort of English speaking customers and/or cohorts of non-English speaking customers. Likewise, the audio data may be processed in a data model to identify customers speaking a particular language, such as Spanish, German, Mandarin, or any other language. This information may be used to create a cohort of Spanish speaking customers, a cohort of Mandarin speaking customers, and so forth. This information may be useful, for example and without limitation, where a store is providing customer service or employees that speak Spanish, Mandarin, or other languages to better serve their customers.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Cohort generation engine <b>314</b> generates set of audio cohorts using cohort criteria <b>322</b> and optionally, the results of processing digital audio data <b>312</b> in data models <b>320</b> and/or comparisons of digital audio data <b>312</b> with known audio patterns <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Cohort criteria <b>322</b> are a set of criteria and/or guidelines for generating set of audio cohorts <b>324</b>. Cohort criteria <b>322</b> may include, without limitation, sound wave properties, origin of a sound, identification of a sound, and/or identification of a combination of sounds. The sound wave properties may include, without limitation, frequency, volume, amplitude, pitch, wavelength, intensity, direction, and/or speed. Other cohort criteria may include, without limitation, dialect, regional accents, and/or the content of human conversation. The content of human conversation refers to the actual words spoken by a human or the subject matter of a conversation. The audio of a human conversation may be converted into data describing the content of the conversation using any type of known or available speech recognition software. The cohort criteria specify the criteria used to select members for a cohort. For example, and without limitation, cohort criteria may specify that a particular cohort should include all cars with engine producing sounds above a certain volume or decibel level.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Cohort generation engine <b>314</b> may also optionally utilize cohort constraints (not shown) to generate set of audio cohorts <b>324</b>. Cohort constraints specify attributes that are absent from members of a given cohort. In other words, cohort constraints specify attributes that are not present or that are not associated with the members of a particular cohort group. This is in contrast to cohort criteria which specify attributes that are required for members of a particular cohort.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Set of audio cohorts <b>324</b> is a set of one or more cohorts. Each cohort comprises a set having null to infinity member. In other words, an audio cohort may have no members, a single member, or two or more members that share a common attribute. A member of a cohort may be a human, an animal, a plant, place, thing, or object.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, if digital audio data <b>312</b> indicates the sounds of footsteps along a jogging path and one or more dogs barking in a park, the digital audio data <b>312</b> may be used to generate cohorts of pet owners walking their dogs in the park. Digital audio data <b>312</b> may be used to identify cohorts of patients in a hospital with symptoms of coughing, congestion, labored breathing, and/or abnormal breath sounds. Digital audio data <b>312</b> may be used to create a cohort of patients having irregular or labored breathing and/or cohorts of patients with regular, unlabored breathing. In yet another example, digital audio data <b>312</b> may be used to identify cars, motorcycles, trucks, and other motor vehicles with irregular engine firing indicating the vehicle may need a tune-up or new spark plugs or other mechanical problems that may be identified based on sounds made by the vehicle while being started, idling, driving, changing gears, or other operation of the vehicle. The information may be used to create cohorts of vehicle that need a tune-up, new spark plugs, a new starter, or other maintenance and repair work. Thus, the audio cohorts may be used for a variety of industrial, medical, health, safety, and research related endeavors. The audio cohorts may be used as a set of methodologies to solve a variety of problems.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one embodiment, cohort generation engine <b>314</b> provides set of audio cohorts <b>324</b> to inference engine <b>326</b>. Inference engine <b>326</b> is a computer program that derives inferences from a knowledge base. In this example, inference engine <b>326</b> derives inferences <b>328</b> from set of audio cohorts <b>324</b> and/or any other data available in the knowledge base. The data in the knowledge base may include data located in a database located locally on computer <b>300</b> as well as data located on one or more remote data storage devices that may be accessed using a network connection, such as data storage device <b>318</b>. Data storage device <b>318</b> is any type of device for storing data, such as, without limitation, storage <b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Inferences are conclusions regarding possible future events or future changes in the attributes of cohorts that are drawn or inferred based on the knowledge base and set of audio cohorts <b>324</b>. For example, and without limitation, set of audio cohorts <b>324</b> may be analyzed by inference engine <b>326</b> to determine whether a particular volcano is about to erupt, an approximate time when the volcano may erupt, and/or a duration of the potential eruption. In another example, inference engine <b>326</b> may generate inferences regarding which customers are likely to purchase particular products based on cohorts of customers using those products.</p>
