<heading id="h-0001" level="1">RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to International Patent Application No. PCT/SE2011/050157, filed Feb. 14, 2011 and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to radio network controllers in mobile communication networks.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A radio network controller (RNC) is a node in mobile communication networks for controlling several base stations. Base stations are also known as base transceiver stations, node Bs or enhanced node Bs in various standards. Each base station controls at least one radio cell within which mobile communication equipment gains access to the mobile communication network. The RNC is typically provided with interfaces interacting with its base stations, other RNCs and a core network of the mobile communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Controlling a large number of base stations from a single controlling node, e.g. an RNC, is preferable from many aspects. Typically, the most important aspects are node and network administration efficiency, e.g. less border maintenance, simple network expansion, reduced risk for impacts from changes within the area to spread to other nodes. Other positive aspects of such a configuration are improved hardware efficiency and improved control of the radio network. The latter is due to reduction of border areas between neighbouring RNCs, where control tend not to be optimal. The improved hardware is mainly due to increased resource pool size thus improved response times and geographic load distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, building and managing a radio network with large controlling nodes is also complex, due to complex controlling nodes, possible expansion limited to what the node's initial design allows, complex hardware generation shift and very large failure areas in case of node failures.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, in practice, the result is often a compromise, with the size of the radio network attached to each controlling node selected to be less than the optimal size from an operational or efficiency point of view.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It would be very useful if there was a way to design an RNC with the advantages but not the disadvantages of controlling a large number of base stations.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of embodiments herein is to provide a radio network controller with greater capacity and flexibility than a conventional radio network controller.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A first embodiment provides a unit radio network controller for use in a radio network controller assembly and configured for control of plurality of base stations, each base station controlling at least one radio cell. The unit radio network controller comprises: a set of external interfaces configured for interaction with a core network, at least one base station and other radio network controllers. The unit radio network controller further comprises: a set of internal interfaces, distinct from the set of external interfaces, the set of internal interfaces being configured at least for interaction with peer unit radio network controllers belonging to the radio network controller assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Using such a unit radio network controller, arranged to be part of a radio network controller assembly, a flexible structure of unit radio network controllers can be provided. The internal interfaces are free to be designed as desired to improve efficiency etc., without being bound to telecommunication standards, as is the case for external interfaces. Furthermore, using such a radio network assembly provides an efficient way to adjust capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The set of internal interfaces may further comprise an interface for interaction with a database belonging to the radio network assembly, the database storing configuration data comprising mappings of each base station and one of the unit radio network controllers of the radio network assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The internal interfaces may be simpler than the external interfaces. For example, the internal interfaces may be free to make use of TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) as a communication mechanism instead of SS7 (Signalling System #7). This allows handovers between unit radio network controllers of the same radio network controller assembly to be effected with greater ease and efficiency compared to handover between two radio network controllers using an official lur interface.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A second embodiment is a radio network controller assembly arranged to control a plurality of base stations, each base station controlling at least one radio cell, the radio network controller assembly comprising: a plurality of unit radio network controllers according to the first embodiment; and a database arranged to store configuration data comprising mappings of each base station and one respectively associated unit radio network controller of the plurality of unit radio network controllers; wherein the radio network controller assembly is arranged to use the sets of external interfaces for communication with the plurality of base stations, the core network and other radio network controllers external to the radio network controller assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Such a radio network controller assembly behaves like a single radio network controller to any external entities, while providing a flexible and efficient internal structure.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The configuration data may further comprise mappings between each radio cell and one respectively associated unit radio network controller.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The database may be comprised in one of the unit radio network controllers.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The database may be comprised in a device distinct from each of the unit radio network controllers.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Each unit radio network controller may comprise mobile device control functionality for any associated mobile devices.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Each unit radio network controller may be arranged to redirect traffic on an end user connection basis to another unit radio network controller for load management. In other words, base stations are assigned to one unit radio network controller and a new session is directed to the assigned unit radio network controller initially. However, if the assigned unit radio network controller is short of capacity, the session can be redirected dynamically to another unit radio network controller. This dynamic load management can be very valuable to increase efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">One of the unit radio network controllers may be configured to be a singleton device, responsible for radio singleton functionality being network control functionality which is to be performed by only one unit radio network controller. For example certain SS7 signalling tasks should always be performed by the same unit radio network controller.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A second one of the unit radio network controllers may be configured to be a standby singleton device, arranged to take over radio network control functions which are tied to only one unit radio network controller when the singleton device is unable to continue to perform the singleton functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A third embodiment is a radio network controller assembly configured for control a plurality of base stations, each base station controlling at least one radio cell. The radio network controller assembly comprises: a plurality of unit radio network controllers, wherein each unit radio network controller comprises: a set of external interfaces configured for interaction with a core network, base stations and other radio network controllers; and a set of internal interfaces, distinct from the set of external interfaces, the set of internal interfaces being configured at least for interaction with peer unit radio network controllers belonging to the radio network controller assembly. The radio network assembly further comprises a database arranged to store configuration data comprising mappings of each base station to one of the plurality of unit radio network controllers. The radio network controller assembly is arranged to use the set of external interfaces for communication with the plurality of base stations, the core network and other radio network controllers external to the radio network controller assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is to be noted that any feature of the first, second, or third embodiments may, where appropriate, be applied to any other of these embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Generally, all terms used in the application are to be interpreted according to their ordinary meaning in the technical field, unless explicitly defined otherwise herein. All references to &#x201c;a/an/the element, apparatus, component, means, step, etc.&#x201d; are to be interpreted openly as referring to at least one instance of the element, apparatus, component, means, step, etc., unless explicitly stated otherwise.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which certain embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided by way of example so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout the description.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram showing an overview of a mobile communication network comprising an embodiment of an RNC assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A core network <b>16</b> comprises central network elements (not shown) of the mobile communication network, such as SGSN (Serving GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) Support Node), MSC (Mobile Switching Center), MGW (Media GateWay). The core network <b>16</b> provides user data connectivity, billing, roaming capability, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A conventional independent RNC <b>17</b> is connected to the core network <b>16</b> and controls a set of base stations (not shown). It is to be noted that when the term RNC is used herein, it is not tied to any particular standard, but rather refers to any device responsible for controlling a radio network for a geographic region of a mobile communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Significantly, there is also provided an RNC assembly <b>10</b>. The RNC assembly <b>10</b> comprises a plurality of unit RNCs <b>12</b> and a database <b>11</b>. Optionally, the database <b>11</b> is provided in one of the unit RNCs <b>12</b>, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c </i>below. While the RNC assembly <b>10</b> is here shown with three unit RNCs <b>12</b>, the RNC assembly <b>10</b> can contain any suitable number of unit RNCs <b>12</b>. In fact, as will be explained in more detail below, one advantage of the structure of the RNC assembly <b>10</b> is the ease with which capacity can be adjusted by adding or removing individual unit RNCs <b>12</b>. It is to be understood that herein a unit RNC is to be construed as any RNC that is part of an RNC assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The RNC assembly <b>10</b> is connected to a plurality of base stations <b>14</b> under the control of the RNC assembly <b>10</b>. Each base station <b>14</b>, in turn, controls at least one radio cell <b>15</b>, by which means mobile devices <b>13</b> gain access to the mobile communication network. The mobile devices <b>13</b> can be mobile phones and/or data access devices, e.g. with a USB connection for use with a computer.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The mobile communication network can optionally comprise another RNC assembly <b>10</b>&#x2032; controlling a separate set of base stations (not shown). The number of RNCs <b>17</b> and RNC assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032; of the mobile communication network is completely flexible and can be any suitable number as determined during network design, as long as there is at least one RNC assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Returning to the RNC assembly <b>10</b>, three interfaces are exemplified here: lu for communicating with the core network <b>16</b>, lur for communicating with any external RNCs <b>17</b> or RNC assemblies <b>10</b>&#x2032; and lub for communicating with the base stations <b>14</b>. While the names for these interfaces correspond to the terminology of UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System), any equivalent interfaces of other standards, such as GSM (Global System for Mobile communication), CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access)-2000, TD(Time Division)-CDMA, etc, can be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The external interfaces of the RNC assembly <b>10</b> are identical to those of the independent RNC <b>17</b>, whereby to any external entity, the RNC assembly <b>10</b> behaves like an independent RNC <b>17</b>. The RNC assembly <b>10</b> would expose e.g. one SS7 (Signalling System #7) signaling point code, or at least a small set of common set of signaling point codes, a single node id, one common set of IP addresses, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Internally however, the RNC assembly <b>10</b> comprises several unit RNCs <b>12</b>, whereby the capacity is greater than a regular RNC <b>17</b>. Significantly, the capacity of the RNC assembly <b>10</b> is also substantially easier to alter. Each unit RNC <b>12</b> mainly operates as an independent node when it comes to managing its own resources and devices, and controlling its base stations, cells or mobile devices. Furthermore, each unit RNC <b>12</b> can have its own node configuration data such as software version and/or hardware configuration. Optionally, one or more of the unit RNCs <b>12</b> also have the ability to operate as a single RNC, like the independent RNC <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The database <b>11</b> stores configuration data comprising mappings of each base station <b>14</b> and one of the unit RNCs <b>12</b> of the radio network assembly <b>10</b>. In other words, each base station <b>14</b> is coupled to one of the unit RNCs <b>12</b>. Optionally, each unit RNC <b>12</b> can be arranged to redirect traffic on an end user connection basis to another unit RNC <b>12</b> for load management. This allows for dynamic load management, particularly if a unit RNC <b>12</b> is at, or close to, its capacity limit.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Optionally, in a similar way to the base station mappings, the database can also store configuration data comprising mappings of each radio cell <b>15</b> and one of the unit RNCs <b>12</b> of the radio network assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Whenever there is communication from mobile devices <b>13</b> and data that needs to be updated, data in the database <b>11</b> is updated. One way to distribute updates to individual unit RNCs is for each unit RNC <b>12</b> to subscribe to any database modifications relating to its area of responsibility.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">There are several options of how the RNC assembly <b>10</b> is set up. A first option is that each unit RNC <b>12</b> has a pre-configured list of all unit RNCs <b>12</b> in the RNC assembly <b>10</b> and announces itself upon installation. A second option is that each unit RNC <b>12</b> receives a pre-configured id of an RNC assembly <b>10</b> and a unit RNC <b>12</b> identification to be used whereby a broadcast mechanism is used to find the other unit RNCs <b>12</b>. A third option is that each unit RNC <b>12</b> receives a pre-configured id of an RNC assembly <b>10</b> and a unit RNC <b>12</b> identification to be used by contacting and announcing itself to a server maintaining data defining the RNC assembly <b>10</b>. Regardless of the mechanism used, any change in the set of active or configured set of unit RNCs <b>12</b> should be made available to all unit RNCs <b>12</b> to allow prompt actions.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The database <b>11</b> can thus store all radio network data in one location, which is propagated to relevant unit RNCs <b>12</b> to allow fast access to data in each unit RNC <b>12</b>. The radio network data is mostly needed at set-up of the base stations <b>14</b> and cells <b>15</b>, with its communication links, cell parameters, handover criteria etc. That data is made available to the unit RNC <b>12</b> controlling the base station <b>14</b>, or cell <b>15</b>, in question. Also, mobile network operator specific data can be stored in the database and propagated in the same way.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Since the unit RNCs <b>12</b> only need to conform to telecom standard communication (lu, lub, lur in this case) for external communication, not internal communication, interfaces within elements of the RNC assembly <b>10</b> can be made simpler. In fact, using the database <b>11</b>, various state information can be made available to all unit RNCs <b>12</b> of the RNC assembly <b>10</b>. Making such data available to the unit RNCs <b>12</b> removes the RNC assembly internal need for many messages and elaborate mechanisms of the lur interface for RNC to RNC communication, e.g. during handover. Furthermore, TCP/IP (Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) can be used for internal communication instead of SS7. So for example, when a mobile device <b>13</b> shifts from one unit RNC <b>12</b> to another unit RNC <b>12</b> of the same RNC assembly <b>10</b>, the handover is effected with greater ease and efficiency compared to between two RNCs <b>17</b> using the official lur interface.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Additionally, the capacity of the RNC assembly <b>10</b> is easily adjusted. In the prior art, if the capacity of an RNC <b>17</b> is insufficient, a new RNC needs to be installed and a large part of the base stations of the original RNC <b>17</b> need to be reconfigured to be assigned to the new RNC. This work is not only tedious but also takes a long time and can be risky in terms of network availability. Using the RNC assembly <b>10</b>, however, expanding capacity is a simple matter of installing a new unit RNC <b>12</b> and updating the configuration in the database <b>11</b>. All base stations <b>14</b> are still connected to the same RNC assembly <b>10</b> (which they see as a single RNC), whereby the base stations do not need to be reconfigured in any way. Reduction in capacity is also possible in an analogous way.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Moreover, the structure of the RNC assembly <b>10</b> allows for a heterogeneous unit RNC <b>12</b> environment. Since each unit RNC <b>12</b> can be assigned its own number of base stations, capacity does not need to be equal for each unit RNC <b>12</b>. This extends the lifetime for individual RNCs <b>12</b> as they can still continue to function when new unit RNCs <b>12</b> of a new generation/greater capacity are installed in the same RNC assembly <b>10</b>. In fact, the presented structure not only provides heterogeneity in terms of hardware, but also software. Consequently, software upgrades can be performed one unit RNC <b>12</b> at a time while temporarily reassigning base stations, to minimise or even eliminate downtime during such upgrades.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Optionally, the database <b>11</b> is structured such that each unit RNC <b>12</b> is able to identify which part of the database it needs to consider, as well as which interfaces it should terminate in normal operation. The database can also allow for any unit RNC <b>12</b> to check current status of all other unit RNCs <b>12</b> in the RNC assembly <b>10</b>, including operational state, load, available capacity and identification of status on each interface external to the RNC assembly <b>10</b>. In case of failure or maintenance of one of the unit RNCs <b>12</b>, this allows another one of the unit RNCs <b>12</b> to step in and take over.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>is a schematic diagram showing an RNC assembly with one unit RNC <b>12</b>&#x2032; being a singleton device. Singleton functionality can for example be required for certain SS7 functions or management of the database <b>11</b>. The configuration of which unit RNC is the singleton device is stored in the database <b>11</b>. The selection of which unit RNC to function as the singleton device can be performed using various principles such as: pre-configured priority, take-challenge, vote etc. In case a unit RNC being a singleton device disappears, another unit RNC can take over that singleton role. This may follow the same principles, with new selection or a standby was selected already at the first selection has to take place.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Some singleton devices <b>12</b>&#x2032; can be replaced using cold standby without disturbing operation of any of the unit RNCs, e.g. database ownership control. However, other such replacements will cause disturbance, e.g. handling of SS7 maintenance signaling. For the latter group it is highly advantageous to select a more or less active standby for the function at the initial selection.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The communication links of the internal interfaces <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>can be made secure and reliable (failsafe). The significance of this can be illustrated by effect of a hypothetical event where an internal communication link fails, while external interfaces still work. The RNC assembly <b>10</b> would then become separate RNC assemblies with the same ID. The external nodes connect to an arbitrary of one of them or fail to connect at all, which could result in a major loss of traffic. Failsafe internal communication, and/or split avoidance functions of the RNC assembly <b>10</b>, will reduce this risk.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It is to be noted that the internal interfaces <b>20</b><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>are only schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>(as well as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref><i>b</i>-<i>c</i>). For example, all unit RNCs can communicate with each other without communicating through any other RNC. The internal interfaces are there to allow communication between elements of the RNC assembly <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>is a schematic diagram showing an RNC assembly with two unit RNCs being singleton devices for different functions. For example, singleton SS7 functions can be handled by one unit RNC <b>12</b>&#x2032; while database management singleton functions can be handled by another unit RNC <b>12</b>&#x2033;. This allows for better balancing of the load related to singleton tasks between unit RNCs.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>c </i>is a schematic diagram showing an RNC assembly where a the database <b>11</b> is comprised in a unit RNC <b>12</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Here now follows a description of various call handling aspects with reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The unit RNCs <b>12</b> support mobility and other traffic cases involving more than one unit RNC <b>12</b>. To do that successfully, the information held by one unit RNC <b>12</b> is made available to other unit RNCs <b>12</b>. As explained above, this can be done through distribution mechanisms of the database or through direct application interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Different standards solves different issues in different ways, depending of what information is dynamic, included in signalling messages etc. Below follows some call cases as applicable to the 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) W-CDMA (Wideband CDMA) standard. Other standards are equivalent to the presented solutions when applicable.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Here now a scenario for outgoing calls in the RNC assembly <b>10</b>. Firstly, to effect an outgoing call, paging is performed. The call arrives to the RNC assembly <b>10</b> using SS7 signalling to either a random unit RNC <b>12</b> or the unit RNC <b>12</b> owning this SS7 interface (as a singleton device).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The receiver unit RNC <b>12</b> of the page request needs to either send the request to all unit RNCs <b>12</b> or identify which unit RNCs <b>12</b> are effected and send only to those. Once the request has been received in those unit RNCs <b>12</b>, the procedure is the same as in independent RNCs <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Once the mobile terminal <b>13</b> receives the paging, it sends a call request. The call request arrives to the unit RNC <b>12</b> owning the RACH (Random Access Channel) interface for the cell where the mobile terminal <b>13</b> is located. Typically, this same unit RNC <b>12</b> would own the whole base station <b>15</b> with all its broadcast and random access channels.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The unit RNC <b>12</b> can process the call request as a call owner in a way like an independent RNC <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">When initiating signalling toward the core network <b>16</b> over SS7, an SS7 session is established by the RNC assembly <b>10</b>. The unit RNC <b>12</b> can contain the SS7 session, in which case the unit RNC <b>12</b> has information on what session id it is allowed to use, or alternatively, the unit RNC <b>12</b> can forward the request to the interface owner (singleton device) and let that maintain the sessions.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Among the signalling information exchanged, is information on the user plane terminations for each end. The call owner submits identifiers for suitable port where to receive this data in its own unit RNC <b>12</b> and sends any user data with the destination identifiers received from core network <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">All subsequent signalling on for this session follows the same path.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">This procedure also applies when the mobile terminal <b>13</b> takes the initiative and also when the intention is only to set up a signalling bearer, e.g. for an SMS (Short Messaging Service) or LA (Location Area) update.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For mobility within a unit RNC <b>12</b>, the procedures are the same as in independent RNC <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For mobility between unit RNCs <b>12</b>, it is possible to use several different designs, involving the movement of different parts of the data for the users.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">For users on dedicated channels (DCH, incl. high speed modes), a default solution would be to retain all user data at its original location, and to start interaction with cell and base stations controlled by another unit RNC <b>12</b>. This is similar to the lur interface is used between different independent RNCs. Those interactions are required whenever usage of resources by the base stations <b>15</b> changes due to mobility, channel switching, etc. and also whenever messages need to be sent to or from the base station <b>15</b> in question.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For users of FACH(Forward Access Channel)/RACH, the same principles apply by default, as the users often change between DCH and FACH. The additional aspect is that a user plane is located, with its cell responsibility, in another unit RNC <b>12</b>. The user plane is between the DCH user context in the original unit RNC <b>12</b> and the broadcast channel termination.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">However for both URA (UTRAN (UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network) Registration Area) and FACH there are special functions &#x201c;Cell Update&#x201d; and &#x201c;URA Update&#x201d;, where the unit RNC <b>12</b> owning the cell where the update was made, forwards the request to the unit RNC <b>12</b> owning the user. The identity to be used for that purpose, RNTI (Radio Network Temporary Identifier), is therefore unique within the RNC assembly <b>10</b>. Hence, it is provided a global RNTI search function within the RNC assembly <b>10</b> or a structured numbering scheme that all unit RNCs <b>12</b> are aware of.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Mobility between different RNC assemblies <b>10</b>, <b>10</b>&#x2032;, or an RNC assembly <b>10</b> and an independent RNC <b>17</b> is on the outgoing side, i.e. from where the owner of the mobile device <b>13</b> is currently located, to where the current cell is, is quite similar to the legacy solution. The only difference is that some additional effort is needed to find the external signalling interface if this is located in another unit RNC <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the other direction, for incoming communication, this is one of the few cases where a signalling session is established to an RNC. For the RNC assembly <b>10</b>, this session will be established on an arbitrary unit RNC <b>12</b>, or the interface owning unit RNC <b>12</b>. This implies that all subsequent messages are forwarded to the unit RNC <b>12</b> that owns the target cell, to establish the drifting context that couples the cell and user control. In this case, a method can be applied to reduce the number of cases where the interface owner and cell owner are separated. By allocating base stations interfacing a specific other RNC to the same RNC as the RNC owning the interface to said RNC, it is likely that interactions between unit RNCs <b>12</b> is significantly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">There is one additional case of incoming SS7 sessions to an RNC assembly <b>10</b>, which is the Incoming Core Network Hard Handover procedure. Also here, sessions and access in the signalling network is defined before the target unit RNC <b>12</b> has been identified.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Similar principles to the incoming lur handover apply, i.e. the SS7 session is established in an arbitrary unit RNC <b>12</b>, and an owning context is created, either with the cells or when target cell has been identified with the SS7 termination.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In many situations, load may vary significantly between the different unit RNCs <b>12</b>. Some of the unit RNCs <b>12</b> may be overloaded while other has plenty of spare capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As a key reason for having a big monolithic RNC in the prior art was to secure a big capacity pool for all traffic to share. One way to even out the load is to move base station responsibilities as described above. As this can result in disturbances, this is not advisable for short term fluctuations.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A simple way is to even out the load is to forward call requests (rrcRequest) from a unit RNC <b>12</b> which is overloaded, to a unit RNC <b>12</b> with spare capacity. The owner of the user is created in the unit RNC <b>12</b> with spare capacity despite the user being located in a cell owned by the overloaded unit RNC <b>12</b>. The information has been transferred and connections been set up the situation becomes identical to the situation after mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic illustration of a hierarchy of RNC assemblies. Optionally, several RNC assemblies <b>10</b> can be grouped together to form a super RNC assembly <b>10</b>&#x2033;. This type of hierarchy can be used in several levels to achieve desired capacity. Externally, the super RNC assembly <b>10</b>&#x2033; provides the same interfaces (lu, lur, lub) as an individual RNC.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The invention has mainly been described above with reference to a few embodiments. However, as is readily appreciated by a person skilled in the art, other embodiments than the ones disclosed above are equally possible within the scope of the invention, as defined by the appended patent claims.</p>
