<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A user authentication method is applied to a user authentication apparatus for authentication using a unique ID that is information unique to a communication apparatus. The method includes acquiring a user ID as information identifying a user, and detecting a unique ID corresponding to the user ID from a user ID list. The method also includes making a call with a predetermined number of rings to a communication apparatus having the unique ID. Additionally, the method includes receiving a callback made by a communication apparatus after a predetermined number of rings of the call in response to the call. In addition, the method includes determining whether a unique ID of the communication apparatus having made the callback matches the unique ID of the communication apparatus to which the call has been made, and determining, if there is a match, that a user having the user ID is an authorized user.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method, system, apparatus, and computer program product for user authentication.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Technologies have been developed that uses a unique ID of a communication apparatus, such as a calling number of a portable telephone, for user authentication. For example, Patent Document 1 discloses a technology that a service system for providing services to a user stores therein a user ID and a calling number of a portable telephone in an associated manner as a user ID matching list, and that determines that the user is an authorized user, when a user ID and a calling number are acquired from a user terminal and a portable telephone, respectively, and a pair of the user ID and the calling number thus acquired has been stored in the user ID list.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent No. 3497799</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Such conventional technologies, however, require entry of a telephone number for calling a service system every time the user uses the service system. This causes problems such as placing a heavy burden on the user and error entry.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention has been achieved to solve the above problems in the conventional technology and it is an object of the present invention to provide a method, system, apparatus, and computer program product for user authentication that reduce the number of times a user operates a communication apparatus for authentication, thereby enabling to reduce the user's burden.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Means for Solving Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following describes a configuration for achieving the above object. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a user authentication system provides service systems <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>, connected via a network <b>3</b> to a terminal <b>8</b> operated by a user <b>1</b> and providing services to the user <b>1</b>, with authentication of the user <b>1</b> operating the terminal <b>8</b> as an authorized user. In the user authentication system, a user communication apparatus <b>11</b> is prepared that includes: a unique ID storage module <b>11</b><i>a </i>that stores therein a unique ID indicating being an authorized user so as not to be easily rewritten by unauthorized operation; and a callback module <b>11</b><i>b </i>that notifies, upon receiving a call from the service systems via a predetermined network <b>12</b> having tapping and tamper-proof functions, the incoming call to the user <b>1</b>, and that returns, when the user <b>1</b> does not answer the call after a predetermined number of rings and then instructs to make a callback, the unique ID stored in the unique ID storage module <b>11</b><i>a </i>to the service systems. Between the network <b>12</b> and the service systems <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> are provided system communication apparatuses <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, and <b>15</b> that make a call with a predetermined number of rings to the user communication apparatus <b>11</b>, receive the unique ID returned by a callback from the user communication apparatus <b>11</b> after the call, and transfer the unique ID to the service systems <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>. The service systems <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b> store therein user ID matching lists <b>4</b><i>b</i>, <b>5</b><i>b</i>, and <b>6</b><i>b </i>that respectively indicate corresponding relationships between the information identifying the user, i.e., user ID, and the unique ID. When the user <b>1</b> enters a user ID via the terminal <b>8</b> to use a service system, for example, the service system <b>4</b>, a call module <b>4</b><i>d </i>of the service system <b>4</b> detects a unique ID corresponding to the user ID from the user ID matching list <b>4</b><i>b</i>, randomly selects an originating number from among X number of originating numbers with an originating number selector <b>4</b><i>c</i>, and causes the system communication apparatus <b>13</b> to make a call with a predetermined number of rings to the unique ID of the user communication apparatus <b>11</b> via the network <b>12</b>, using the selected originating number. After a predetermined number of rings, when the user communication apparatus <b>11</b> returns the unique ID by a callback to the system communication apparatus <b>13</b> via the network <b>12</b>, the service system <b>4</b> determines whether the unique ID transferred from the system communication apparatus <b>13</b> matches the unique ID of the user communication apparatus <b>11</b> to which the call has been made. If there is a match, the user <b>1</b> operating the terminal <b>8</b> is regarded as an authorized user, and the services are provided to the terminal <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">With this configuration, the unique ID is stored in the storage module that is not easily rewritten by unauthorized operation, and the tapping and tamper-proof functions are added to channels. This prevents falsification of the unique ID, and fraudulent use of the system by a third party spoofing a user relatively easily, as in password systems. Further, the unique ID can be sent to a system communication apparatus that supports a certain service system. This enables login to a plurality of systems with a single user communication apparatus. There is no need to prepare a physical medium and a device for reading the medium at each system or terminal, as required in authentication systems using conventional physical media. Further, because the user communication apparatus sends the unique ID by making a callback to the originating number used to make the call by the system communication apparatus, the user need not enter the originating number.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The predetermined number of rings of the call to the user communication apparatus <b>11</b> is less than the number of rings after which the call is to be transferred to another user communication apparatus. By limiting the call within a predetermined number of rings, it is possible to prevent the call from being transferred to an unauthorized communication apparatus. This prevents that an unauthorized user having obtained the user ID illegally transfers the call made to the user communication apparatus <b>11</b> and uses the services illegally.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a user authentication system that provides service systems <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>26</b>, connected via the network <b>3</b> to the terminal <b>8</b> operated by the user <b>1</b> and providing services to the user <b>1</b>, with authentication of the user <b>1</b> operating the terminal <b>8</b> as an authorized user. In the user authentication system, the user communication apparatus <b>11</b> is prepared that includes: the unique ID storage module <b>11</b><i>a </i>that stores therein a unique ID indicating being an authorized user so as not to be easily rewritten by unauthorized operation; and the callback module <b>11</b><i>b </i>that notifies, upon receiving a call from the service systems via the predetermined network <b>12</b> having tapping and tamper-proof functions, the incoming call to the user <b>1</b>, and that returns, when the user <b>1</b> does not answer the call after a predetermined number of rings and then instructs to make a callback, the unique ID stored in the unique ID storage module <b>11</b><i>a </i>to the service systems. Between the network <b>12</b> and the service systems <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>26</b> is provided an authentication apparatus <b>51</b> including a call module <b>51</b><i>d </i>that stores therein a user ID matching list Sib indicating a corresponding relationship between the information identifying the user, i.e., user ID, and the unique ID, makes a call with a predetermined number of rings to the user communication apparatus <b>11</b> based on an authentication request from the service systems <b>24</b>, <b>25</b>, and <b>26</b>, using an originating number randomly selected from among X number of originating numbers with an originating number selector <b>51</b><i>c</i>, receives the unique ID returned by a callback from the user communication apparatus <b>11</b> after the call, and authenticates the user. When the user <b>1</b> enters a user ID via the terminal <b>8</b> to use a service system, for example, the service system <b>4</b>, an authentication module <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the service system <b>24</b> requests the authentication apparatus <b>51</b> to authenticate the user. The call module <b>51</b><i>d </i>of the authentication apparatus <b>51</b> detects a unique ID corresponding to the user ID from the user ID matching list <b>51</b><i>b</i>, randomly selects an originating number from among X number of originating numbers with the originating number selector <b>51</b><i>c</i>, and makes a call with a predetermined number of rings to the unique ID of the user communication apparatus <b>11</b> via the network <b>12</b>, using the selected originating number. After a predetermined number of rings, when the user communication apparatus <b>11</b> returns the unique ID by a callback via the network <b>12</b>, the call module <b>51</b><i>d </i>determines whether the returned unique ID matches the unique ID to which the call has been made. If there is a match, the call module <b>51</b><i>d </i>notifies the authentication module <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the service system <b>24</b> that the user <b>1</b> operating the terminal <b>8</b> is an authorized user.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With this configuration, the unique ID is stored in the storage module that is not easily rewritten by unauthorized operation, and the tapping and tamper-proof functions are added to channels. This prevents falsification of the unique ID, and fraudulent use of the system by a third party spoofing a user relatively easily, as in password systems. Further, the unique ID can be sent to a system communication apparatus that supports a certain service system. This enables login to a plurality of systems with a single user communication apparatus. There is no need to prepare a physical medium and a device for reading the medium at each system or terminal, as required in authentication systems using conventional physical media. Further, because the user communication apparatus returns the unique ID to the authentication apparatus by making a callback, a user need not enter the originating number.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EFFECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an aspect of the present invention, a user only makes a callback for authentication. This eliminates the need to enter an originating number, thus reducing the user's burden for authentication.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">BEST MODE(S) FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0065">Exemplary embodiments of a method, system, apparatus, and computer program for user authentication according to the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. A first embodiment describes an arrangement that a service system authenticates a user, and a second embodiment describes an arrangement that a service system requests an authentication apparatus to perform user authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0066">[First Embodiment]</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0067">The following describes a configuration of a user authentication system according to a first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic diagram of a user authentication system according to the first embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, indicated by <b>61</b> is a user, <b>62</b> and <b>63</b> are personal computers (PC) serving as terminals, <b>64</b> is a uniplexed information and computing system (UNIX) (registered trademark) workstation (UNIX (registered trademark)) serving as a terminal, <b>65</b> is an internet as a network, <b>66</b> is a file server as a service system, and <b>67</b> and <b>68</b> are WEB service provider servers as service systems.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0068">Further, indicated by <b>71</b> is a portable telephone serving as a user communication apparatus, <b>72</b> and <b>73</b> are respectively a wireless network and a public telephone network serving as predetermined networks, and <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> are modems with originating number receiving function both serving as system communication apparatuses (note that the modem <b>75</b> is shared by the WEB service provider servers <b>67</b> and <b>68</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0069">A user number storage module <b>71</b><i>a </i>within a portable telephone <b>71</b> is used as a unique ID storage module. Specifically, a telephone number (originating number) stored in the user number storage module <b>71</b><i>a </i>is used as a unique ID. The portable telephone <b>71</b> includes a callback module <b>71</b><i>b </i>that makes a callback to an incoming call. The wireless network <b>72</b> and the public telephone network <b>73</b> have tapping and tamper-proof functions for communication. The modems <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> with originating number receiving function serve to read a telephone number of an incoming call and transfer the call.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0070">The file server <b>66</b> and the WEB service provider servers <b>67</b> and <b>68</b> respectively include: user ID matching lists <b>66</b><i>b</i>, <b>67</b><i>b</i>, and <b>68</b><i>b </i>indicating corresponding relationships between user IDs and unique IDs (originating numbers); call modules <b>66</b><i>d</i>, <b>67</b><i>d</i>, and <b>68</b><i>d </i>that make a call with a predetermined number of rings to the portable telephone <b>71</b> via the modems <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> with originating number receiving function; and originating number selectors <b>66</b><i>c</i>, <b>67</b><i>c</i>, and <b>68</b><i>c </i>that randomly select an originating number from among X number of telephone numbers stored in the servers.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0071">The call modules <b>66</b><i>d</i>, <b>67</b><i>d</i>, and <b>68</b><i>d </i>randomly select one originating number with the originating number selectors <b>66</b><i>c</i>, <b>67</b><i>c</i>, and <b>68</b><i>c</i>, respectively, make a call with a predetermined number of rings using the number, and disconnect the call. The predetermined number is less than the number of rings after which the call is to be transferred to another portable telephone, for example one time. The ringing sound of the call may be &#x201c;XX bank logs in&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0072">When the call is not answered by the user <b>61</b> and a callback is made from the portable telephone <b>71</b> after a predetermined number of rings, the call modules <b>66</b><i>d</i>, <b>67</b><i>d, </i>and <b>68</b><i>d </i>determine whether the originating number of the callback matches the number to which the call has been made. If there is a match, the call modules <b>66</b><i>d</i>, <b>67</b><i>d</i>, and <b>68</b><i>d </i>send a talkie message (automatic voice guidance). As a talkie message, &#x201c;This is XX bank. If you want to login, please dial 1#&#x201d; is sent. When characters are returned from the portable telephone <b>71</b>, the call modules <b>66</b><i>d</i>, <b>67</b><i>d</i>, and <b>68</b><i>d </i>determine whether the characters match &#x201c;1#&#x201d;, and determine, if there is a match, that the user <b>61</b> is an authorized user.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0073">As such, by combining the originating number of the callback and the specified characters thus returned, it is possible to prevent operating error of the user <b>61</b> and improve reliability of authentication. When the user <b>61</b> answers the call within a predetermined number of rings, the call is immediately disconnected. Alternatively, other authentication systems may be used. Although &#x201c;1#&#x201d; is specified as a talkie message in the foregoing, other characters and character strings may be specified. The &#x201c;characters&#x201d; include &#x201c;symbols&#x201d; and &#x201c;numbers&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0074">By causing the call modules <b>66</b><i>d</i>, <b>67</b><i>d</i>, and <b>68</b><i>d </i>to make a call to the portable telephone <b>71</b>, the user <b>61</b> can perform authentication only by making a callback. Further, the call modules <b>66</b><i>d</i>, <b>67</b><i>d</i>, and <b>68</b><i>d </i>randomly select one originating number with the originating number selectors <b>66</b><i>c</i>, <b>67</b><i>c </i>and <b>68</b><i>c</i>, respectively, and make a call using the number. This makes it difficult to identify a recipient of the callback, even when an attacker to the service systems can illegally steel the user ID and forges the originating number. In this way, it is possible to reduce the possibility that the service systems are attacked.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0075">The following describes a procedure of a user authentication process performed by the user authentication system according to the first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart of a procedure of a user authentication process performed by a user authentication system according to the first embodiment. As an example, an arrangement is described in which the user <b>61</b> accesses the file server <b>66</b> on the internet <b>65</b> by using the PC <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0076">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the user authentication process, when the user <b>61</b> enters a user ID on the PC <b>62</b>, the PC <b>62</b> sends the user ID to the file server <b>66</b> via the internet <b>65</b> (Step S<b>11</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0077">Upon receiving the user ID, the call module <b>66</b><i>d </i>of the file server <b>66</b> detects a portable telephone number corresponding to the user ID from the user ID matching list <b>66</b><i>b </i>(Step S<b>12</b>), and randomly selects one originating number from among X number of originating numbers with the originating number selector <b>66</b><i>c </i>(Step S<b>13</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0078">Using the selected originating number, the call module <b>66</b><i>d </i>makes a call with a predetermined number of rings to the portable telephone <b>71</b> via the modem <b>74</b> with originating number receiving function (Step S<b>14</b>). After a predetermined number of rings, when the user <b>61</b> instructs to make a callback, the callback module <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the portable telephone <b>71</b> makes a callback (Step S<b>15</b>). Accordingly, the call module <b>66</b><i>d </i>receives an originating number of the callback via the modem <b>74</b> with originating number receiving function, and determines whether it matches an originating number to which the call has been made. If there is a match, the call module <b>66</b><i>d </i>sends a talkie message (Step S<b>16</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0079">When the user <b>61</b> hears the talkie message and dials characters and the portable telephone <b>71</b> returns the characters (Step S<b>17</b>), determination is made as to whether the returned characters match the characters specified in the talkie message (&#x201c;1#&#x201d;). If there is a match, login permission is given to the PC <b>62</b> (Step S<b>18</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0080">As such, upon receiving the user ID, the call module <b>66</b><i>d </i>of the file server <b>66</b> makes a call to the portable telephone <b>71</b> via the modem <b>74</b> with originating number receiving function. This enables the user <b>61</b> to perform authentication only by making a callback, thus reducing the burden on the user <b>61</b> for user authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0081">As described above, in the first embodiment, upon receiving the user ID, the call modules <b>66</b><i>d</i>, <b>67</b><i>d</i>, and <b>68</b><i>d </i>acquire a portable telephone number corresponding to the user ID by using the user ID matching lists <b>66</b><i>b</i>, <b>67</b><i>b</i>, and <b>68</b><i>b</i>, respectively, randomly select one originating number with the originating number selectors <b>66</b><i>c</i>, <b>67</b><i>c</i>, and <b>68</b><i>c, </i>respectively, and make a call with a predetermined number of rings to the portable telephone <b>71</b> that corresponds to the user ID, by using the selected originating number and via the modems <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> with originating number receiving function. After a predetermined number of rings, when the callback module <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the portable telephone <b>71</b> makes a callback based on the instruction from the user <b>61</b>, the call modules <b>66</b><i>d</i>, <b>67</b><i>d</i>, and <b>68</b><i>d </i>perform user authentication based on whether the originating number of the callback received via the modems <b>74</b> and <b>75</b> with originating number receiving function matches a telephone number to which the call has been made, and whether the characters are returned that have been specified to be returned in the talkie message. This enables the user <b>61</b> to perform authentication only by making a callback, thus reducing the user's burden.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0082">In the forgoing, if the originating number of the callback matches the telephone number to which the call has been made, the talkie message is sent. Then, authentication is performed based on whether the characters are returned that have been specified to be returned in the talkie message. Without sending the talkie message, the user may be determined to be an authorized user when the originating number of the callback matches the telephone number to which the call has been made.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0083">In the foregoing, when the user <b>61</b> answers the call within a predetermined number of rings made to the portable telephone <b>71</b>, the call is immediately disconnected. The call may be disconnected after issuing such guidance, &#x201c;Please hang up and call back. Even if you don't answer this call, the ringing sound will stop within about 10 seconds. Next time, please wait until the ringing sound stops and call back.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0084">In the foregoing, a predetermined number of rings are made to the portable telephone <b>71</b>. To securely record incoming call history to the portable telephone <b>71</b>, the calling needs to be made for a certain amount of time. The longer the calling is made, the more likely the user <b>61</b> answers the call by mistake. If authentication is performed with this call, the authentication using the originating number (authentication by callback) cannot be performed, and the security is reduced. Thus, the call may be disconnected by keeping the call ringing until the user <b>61</b> answers the call, and then by issuing such guidance &#x201c;Please hang up and call back&#x201d; when the user <b>61</b> answers the call. In this way, even when the user <b>61</b> answers the call after the first ring, the telephone number of the service system is only notified (incoming call history is recorded) without performing authentication. By making the user <b>61</b> call back, authentication using an originating number is realized with improved security.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0085">[Second Embodiment]</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0086">The first embodiment describes user authentication performed by each service system. User authentication can also be performed using an authentication apparatus that performs user authentication in response to a user authentication request from a service system.

<p id="p-0050" num="0094">Upon receiving the user ID, the authentication module <b>86</b><i>b </i>of the file server <b>86</b> sends a user authentication request to the authentication server <b>76</b> (Step S<b>22</b>). Upon receiving the user authentication request, the call module <b>76</b><i>d </i>of the authentication server <b>76</b> detects a portable telephone number corresponding to the user ID from the user ID matching list <b>76</b><i>b </i>(Step S<b>23</b>), and randomly selects one originating number from among X number of originating numbers with the originating number selector <b>76</b><i>c </i>(Step S<b>24</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0095">Using the selected originating number, the call module <b>76</b><i>d </i>makes a call with a predetermined number of rings to the portable telephone <b>71</b> (Step S<b>25</b>). After a predetermined number of rings, when the user <b>61</b> instructs to make a callback, the callback module <b>71</b><i>b </i>of the portable telephone <b>71</b> makes a callback (Step S<b>26</b>). Accordingly, the call module <b>76</b><i>d </i>determines whether an originating number of the callback matches an originating number to which the call has been made. If there is a match, the call module <b>76</b><i>d </i>sends a talkie message requesting return of characters (Step S<b>27</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0096">When the user <b>61</b> hears the talkie message and dials characters and the portable telephone <b>71</b> returns the characters (Step S<b>28</b>), determination is made as to whether the returned characters match the characters specified in the talkie message (&#x201c;1#&#x201d;). If there is a match, the file server <b>86</b> is notified that the user is an authorized user (Step S<b>29</b>). Accordingly, the authentication module <b>86</b><i>b </i>of the file server <b>86</b> provides login permission to the PC <b>62</b> (Step S<b>30</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0097">As such, upon receiving a user authentication request, the call module <b>76</b><i>d </i>of the authentication server <b>76</b> makes a call to the portable telephone <b>71</b>. This enables the user <b>61</b> to perform authentication by making a callback, thus reducing the burden on the user <b>61</b> for user authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0098">As described, in the second embodiment, the authentication server <b>76</b> performs user authentication in response to a user authentication request from a service system. This eliminates the need to provide a user authentication function in each service system, thus enabling to efficiently establish a user authentication system.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0099">The first and the second embodiments describe user authentication functions of a service provider server and an authentication server. Such user authentication functions are realized by a user authentication program executed by a service provider server and an authentication server. The following describes a hardware configuration of a service provider server and an authentication server that execute this user authentication program.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block diagram of a hardware configuration of a computer that executes a user authentication program according to the first and the second embodiments, i.e., a service provider server and an authentication server. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a computer <b>100</b> includes a random access memory (RAM) <b>110</b>, a central processing unit (CPU) <b>120</b>, a hard disk device (HDD) <b>130</b>, a local area network (LAN) interface <b>140</b>, an input/output interface <b>150</b>, and a digital versatile disk (DVD) drive <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0101">The RAM <b>110</b> is a memory that stores therein a computer program and a result of execution of a computer program. The CPU <b>120</b> is a central processor that reads out a computer program from the RAM <b>110</b> and executes it.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0102">The HDD <b>130</b> is a disk device that stores therein a computer program and data. The LAN interface <b>140</b> is an interface for connecting the computer <b>100</b> to other computers via the LAN and the internet <b>65</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0103">The input/output interface <b>150</b> is an interface to an input device such as a mouse or a keyboard, and a display. The DVD drive <b>160</b> reads from and writes to a DVD.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0104">A user authentication program <b>111</b> executed on the computer <b>100</b> is stored in a DVD, read out from the DVD by the DVD drive <b>160</b>, and installed on the computer <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0105">Alternatively, the user authentication program <b>111</b> may be stored in databases of other computer systems connected via the LAN interface <b>140</b>, read out from the databases, and installed on the computer <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0106">The installed user authentication program <b>111</b> is stored in the HDD <b>130</b>, loaded into the RAM <b>110</b>, and executed by the CPU <b>120</b> in a user authentication process <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0107">The first and the second embodiments describe user authentication using a service system via the Internet. The present invention is not limited to this, and may be similarly applied to other user authentication, for example, user authentication at automatic teller machines (ATM).</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Industrial Applicability</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0108">As described above, a method, system, apparatus, and computer program for user authentication according to the present invention are useful for user authentication, i.e., for identifying whether a user is an authorized user, and are particularly suitable for user authentication where importance is given to reducing the user's burden.</p>
