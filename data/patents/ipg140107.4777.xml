<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The current invention is generally related to an image processing and system, and more particularly related to multi-scale reconstruction while the image volume grid size is successively decreased.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Region of interest (ROI) is zoomed in reconstruction. As ROI is zoomed in an image, the details of the image experience poor quality. Particularly, the challenge becomes apparent for a zoomed image that has been reconstructed using an iterative reconstruction (IR) technique. In general, a reprojection step in IR requires knowledge of the entire object attenuating the x-ray beam. In contrast, analytic filtered back projection (FBP) generally reconstructs an image within the zoomed ROI without the need of the full field of view (FOV) reconstruction, provided that projection data is not truncated.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To overcome the above described challenge in IR, the following approaches have been suggested. Although one prior art technique removed a part of the projection data that corresponds to the outside of ROI in the image volume, the image quality was degraded due to the lacking features in the exterior areas of ROI. Another prior art technique utilized two volume grids including a coarse grid and a fine grid. Unfortunately, the prior art technique was computationally ineffective, and the coarse grid also limited spatial resolution of the fine grid.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the above and other prior art techniques, a multi-scale reconstruction is still desired using not only an iterative reconstruction technique but also an analytic reconstruction technique.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENT(S)</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Referring now to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding structures throughout the views, and referring in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a diagram illustrates one embodiment of the multi-slice X-ray CT apparatus or scanner according to the current invention including a gantry <b>100</b> and other devices or units. The gantry <b>100</b> is illustrated from a side view and further includes an X-ray tube <b>101</b>, an annular frame <b>102</b> and a multi-row or two-dimensional array type X-ray detector <b>103</b>. The X-ray tube <b>101</b> and X-ray detector <b>103</b> are diametrically mounted across a subject S on the annular frame <b>102</b>, which is rotatably supported around a rotation axis RA. A rotating unit <b>107</b> rotates the frame <b>102</b> at a high speed such as 0.4 sec/rotation while the subject S is being moved along the axis RA into or out of the illustrated page.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The multi-slice X-ray CT apparatus further includes a high voltage generator <b>109</b> that generates a tube voltage to be applied to the X-ray tube <b>101</b> through a slip ring <b>108</b> so that the X-ray tube <b>101</b> generates X ray. The X rays are emitted towards the subject S, whose cross sectional area is represented by a circle. The X-ray detector <b>103</b> is located at an opposite side from the X-ray tube <b>101</b> across the subject S for detecting the emitted X rays that have transmitted through the subject S.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the X-ray CT apparatus or scanner further includes other devices for processing the detected signals from X-ray detector <b>103</b>. A data acquisition circuit or a Data Acquisition System (DAS) <b>104</b> converts a signal output from the X-ray detector <b>103</b> for each channel into a voltage signal, amplifies it, and further converts it into a digital signal. The X-ray detector <b>103</b> and the DAS <b>104</b> are configured to handle a predetermined total number of projections per rotation (TPPR) that can be at the most 900 TPPR, between 900 TPPR and 1800 TPPR and between 900 TPPR and 3600 TPPR.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The above described data is sent to a preprocessing device <b>106</b>, which is housed in a console outside the gantry <b>100</b> through a non-contact data transmitter <b>105</b>. The preprocessing device <b>106</b> performs certain corrections such as sensitivity correction on the raw data. A storage device <b>112</b> then stores the resultant data that is also called projection data at a stage immediately before reconstruction processing. The storage device <b>112</b> is connected to a system controller <b>110</b> through a data/control bus, together with a reconstruction device <b>114</b>, input device <b>115</b>, display device <b>116</b>, multi-scale processing device <b>117</b> and the scan plan support apparatus <b>200</b>. The scan plan support apparatus <b>200</b> includes a function for supporting an imaging technician to develop a scan plan.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One embodiment of the reconstruction device <b>114</b> further includes various software and hardware components. According to one aspect of the current invention, the reconstruction device <b>114</b> of the CT apparatus advantageously minimizes total variation (TV) using an iterative reconstruction technique. In general, the reconstruction device <b>114</b> in one embodiment of the current invention operates the total volume iterative reconstruction (TVIR) algorithm, which performs on the projection data simultaneous algebraic reconstruction such an ordered subset simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (OS-SART) step and regularization such as a TV minimization step. The two steps are sequentially implemented in the main loop where a number of iterations were prescribed in one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Before the TV minimization step, the projection data undergoes an ordered subsets simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (OS-SART). The projection data is grouped into a predetermined number of subsets N each having a certain number of views. During the ordered subsets simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (OS-SART), each subset may be sequentially processed in one embodiment. In another embodiment, a plurality of the subsets may be processed in parallel by taking advantage of certain microprocessor such as multiple central processing units (CPU) or a graphics processing unit (GPU). In the total variation (TV) minimization step, one embodiment of the reconstruction device <b>114</b> employs a line search strategy to search a positive step size so as to ensure the objective function of the current image volume to be smaller than that of the previous image volume.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">During the ordered subsets simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (OS-SART), the reconstruction device <b>114</b> also performs two major operations. Namely, for each subset N, the reconstruction device <b>114</b> re-projects the image volume to form the computed projection data and back-projects the normalized difference between the measured projection and the computed projection data to reconstruct an updated image volume. In further detail, one embodiment of the reconstruction device <b>114</b> re-projects the image volume by using the ray tracing technique where no coefficient of the system matrix is cached. Moreover, one embodiment of the reconstruction device <b>114</b> simultaneously re-projects all rays in a subset, and this is optionally implemented in parallel. In the back-projection, one embodiment of the reconstruction device <b>114</b> uses a pixel-driven technique to back-project all of the normalized difference projection data in a subset to form the desired updated image volume. Because the reconstruction device <b>114</b> back-projects all ray sums, i.e., difference projection data, in a subset to form an image volume, this operation is optionally implemented in parallel too. These operations are applied to every subset N to complete a single OS-SART step. In addition, AWAD is optionally combined.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another embodiment of the reconstruction device <b>114</b>, various other software and hardware components perform a predetermined analytic reconstruction process on the projection data. According to one aspect of the current invention, the reconstruction device <b>114</b> of the CT apparatus advantageously reconstructs an image volume by using a predetermined filtered backprojection (FBP) technique. The above described and other embodiments are optionally included in the current scope of the invention as more particularly claimed in the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition to the above described components, one embodiment of the current invention further includes various other software modules and hardware components for performing multi-scale reconstruction functions. According to one aspect of the current invention, a multi-scale device <b>117</b> of the CT apparatus advantageously performs multi-scale reconstruction functions for zooming in on a desired region of interest (ROI) from an original image using a predetermined finer 3D grid. According to another aspect of the invention, one embodiment of the multi-scale device <b>117</b> achieves a desired zoom of the ROI through a predetermined number of successive multi-scaling steps where an image is iteratively reconstructed using a decreasing grid size or a decreasing field of view (FOV) size. In other words, the embodiment utilizes a predetermined set of nested 3D grids during the iterative multi-scale reconstruction. As an image is successively zoomed in, details of the image are determined at a successively smaller grid size so that the final zoomed image maintains the desired details.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to one aspect of the current invention, the multi-scale device <b>117</b> accomplishes one exemplary multi-scale reconstruction by determining the output image using only a pair of a coarse grid and a fine grid. In one example, the coarse grid is the original field of view (FOV) while the fine grid is a desired zoom or region of interest (ROI). Using the fine grid size, an image is reconstructed by combining the interpolated image and the detailed image, and the combined output data is outputted as a final desired output image. As necessary, the following iterative process is performed to reconstruct the final desired output image in certain situations.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another aspect of the current invention, the multi-scale device <b>117</b> accomplishes one exemplary multi-scale reconstruction by iteratively using the output data in combination with a predetermined number of decreasing gird sizes. At each scale of the grid sizes, an image is reconstructed by combining the interpolated image and the detailed image, and the combined output data is used to as a base image for determining a next instance of the interpolated image and the detailed image in the iterative process. A final desired output image is obtained at the end of the above described iterative process when the last scale of the predetermined set of the grid sizes is used. In a strict sense, the iteration begins after the following initial reconstruction using the course and fine grids from an original image.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment according to the current invention, the multi-scale device <b>117</b> is operationally connected to other software modules and or system components such as the storage device <b>112</b>, the reconstruction device <b>114</b>, the display device <b>116</b> and the input device <b>115</b> via a data/control bus. In this regard, the multi-scale device <b>117</b> alone does not necessarily perform multi-scaling functions and or their associated tasks in other embodiments according to the current invention. Furthermore, the multi-scale device <b>117</b> is optionally a part of other devices such as the reconstruction device <b>114</b> in alternative embodiments according to the current invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a flow chart illustrates steps involved in the multi-scale reconstruction process in one embodiment according to the current invention. In certain situations, a portion of the reconstructed image is optionally zoomed to a predetermined size. The desired portion is generally a region of interest (ROI). To accomplish the above described zooming of the image, a scale is initially selected in a step S<b>100</b> based upon the size of the ROI and the desired zoomed image size. One exemplary scale is determined based upon a fine grid size or a fine grid volume in relation to the coarse grid size or the coarse grid volume. In determining the scale, there are other factors that need to be considered in the step S<b>100</b> for certain kinds of data.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In describing the steps of the multi-scale reconstruction process in one embodiment according to the current invention, the operations are also expressed in equations. For the equations, the above-described scale is expressed in terms of a parameter k=0 and 1, which is used as a subscript for two 3D grids x<sub>i,k </sub>for the coarse and fine grids. The parameter k determines the pitch size of the grid, and index i indexes all points on the grid. The grid x<sub>i,0 </sub>is the coarse grid having a first pitch size, corresponding to the full field of view while the finer grid x<sub>i,1 </sub>is the fine grid having a second pitch size, corresponding to the desired zoomed field of view. The second pitch size is smaller than the first pitch size in the grids, but the two grids have the same number of pixels. For the two grids at k=0 and 1, the exemplary multi-scale reconstruction process initially reconstructs a full image volume f<sub>0 </sub>on a coarse grid x<sub>i,1 </sub>from original measure data r<sub>j</sub><sup>0 </sup>according to a predetermined reconstruction technique RECON1 as expressed in Equation (1)

Where the coarse grid size or the coarse grid volume x<sub>i,0 </sub>corresponds to the full or original field of view. According to one exemplary process, the reconstruction technique RECON1 is iterative such as the total volume iterative reconstruction (TVIR) algorithm, which performs on the projection data simultaneous algebraic reconstruction such an ordered subset simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (OS-SART) step and regularization such as a TV minimization step. According to another exemplary process, the reconstruction technique RECON1 is optionally a predetermined analytic reconstruction process such as a filtered backprojection (FBP) technique.
