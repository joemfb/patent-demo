<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a normal mode, when data is written to a memory cell or data is read from a memory cell, a power supply voltage to a semiconductor storage device may decrease. To address the decrease in power supply voltage, a power supply voltage for preventing data stored in a memory cell from being erased, for example, a normal power supply voltage, is supplied to the semiconductor storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a sleep mode, outside input is blocked, and bit lines or word lines (not illustrated) in memory cells are not selected. A minimal power supply voltage that prevents data stored in a memory cell from being erased, for example, a minimum power supply voltage, is supplied to the semiconductor storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Quick switching from the sleep mode to the normal mode may cause an increase in return current that reduces the power supply voltage, and data stored in a memory cell may disappear.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Switching from the sleep mode to the normal mode allows wiring of the semiconductor storage device or a capacitance component of a circuit to be charged to the normal power supply voltage. Quick switching from the sleep mode to the normal mode may cause return current to flow during charging.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A plurality of transistors coupled in parallel between memory cell arrays and a ground are turned on in sequence. Since the conductance increases stepwise, a current flows stepwise. The time interval for switching from the sleep mode to the normal mode may be increased, and the maximum value of return current may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a semiconductor storage device having a plurality of memory macros each including a plurality of memory cell arrays, the plurality of memory macros may be switched contemporaneously in response to a signal for switching from the sleep mode to the normal mode.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary semiconductor storage device. A semiconductor storage device <b>10</b> includes a normal mode and a sleep mode. A first sleep signal SLP<b>1</b> for setting the normal mode or the sleep mode may be input from an external device (not illustrated). In response to the first sleep signal SLP<b>1</b>, the semiconductor storage device <b>10</b> is set to the normal mode or the sleep mode.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The semiconductor storage device <b>10</b> is set to the normal mode in accordance with a high-level first sleep signal SLP<b>1</b>. The semiconductor storage device <b>10</b> is set to the sleep mode in accordance with a low-level first sleep signal SLP<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The semiconductor storage device <b>10</b> includes first to fourth memory macros <b>11</b> to <b>14</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary memory macro. The memory macro illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be the first memory macro <b>11</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first memory macro <b>11</b> includes a drive circuit <b>17</b>, first to n-th memory cell array units M<b>1</b> to Mn, and a sleep cancellation detecting circuit <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The drive circuit <b>17</b> includes a first inverter circuit <b>20</b><i>a </i>and a second inverter circuit <b>20</b><i>b</i>, which are coupled in series. The drive circuit <b>17</b> receives a first sleep signal SLP<b>1</b> from, for example, an external device (not illustrated). The drive circuit <b>17</b> improves the drive performance of the first sleep signal SLP<b>1</b> to obtain a driven sleep signal SLPd, and outputs the driven sleep signal SLPd to the first to n-th memory cell array units M<b>1</b> to Mn and the sleep cancellation detecting circuit <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each of the memory cell array units M<b>1</b> to Mn includes a virtual power control circuit <b>23</b>, a memory cell array <b>24</b>, and a low-potential power supply boosting circuit. The low-potential power supply boosting circuit may include an N-channel metal oxide semiconductor (MOS) transistor T<b>1</b>. The virtual power control circuit <b>23</b> controls the voltage level of a virtual power supply line LK. The virtual power supply line LK may be a low-potential power supply line of the memory cell array <b>24</b>. In the normal mode, the virtual power control circuit <b>23</b> couples the virtual power supply line LK to a ground potential GND. The memory cell array <b>24</b> is supplied with a power supply voltage Vcc as a high-potential power supply voltage and is supplied with the ground potential GND as a low-potential power supply voltage. In the sleep mode, the virtual power control circuit <b>23</b> controls the voltage level of the virtual power supply line LK to a threshold voltage of the N-channel MOS transistor T<b>1</b>. The memory cell array <b>24</b> is supplied with the power supply voltage Vcc as a high-potential power supply voltage and is supplied with the threshold voltage of the N-channel MOS transistor T<b>1</b> as a low-potential power supply voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the sleep mode, the memory cell array <b>24</b> operates at a voltage that is lower than that in the normal mode by an amount corresponding to the threshold voltage of the N-channel MOS transistor T<b>1</b>, resulting in lower power consumption.</p>
