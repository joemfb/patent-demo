<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the field of the video record and reproduction apparatus used in for example a broadcasting station and a video software production company, in recent years, the size of the apparatus has been reduced. A product of which operation switches such as switches and dials and a loading opening of a record medium are disposed on a front panel and a display device that displays a picture that is recorded or reproduced is disposed on the same front panel has come out. Only with this apparatus, the user can completely edit video data recorded on for example a record medium while watching pictures displayed on the display device disposed on the front panel of the apparatus. Thus, it is convenient for the user to use this apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The display device disposed on the front panel are often used to display a menu screen on which various setups are performed and information about the state of the apparatus along with pictures that are recorded or reproduced. Such a menu screen and information are generated by for example a microprocessor disposed in the record and reproduction apparatus. The menu screen and information are switched to the screen for video data. In stead, the menu screen and various status screens may be superimposed with a video signal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Japanese Patent Application Unexamined Publication No. Hei 11-187315 describes a video process apparatus that has a monitor device that can superimpose character information with a picture corresponding to a video signal.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">On the display screen of the related art of which the display device disposed on the front panel, character information is superimposed with a picture that is recorded or reproduced. Thus, a part of a picture is hidden by superimposed character information. As a result, the user may not be able to check the entire picture.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the video record and reproduction apparatus that has been released in recent years, various functions are often controlled by software executed by a microcomputer.

For example, different functions are assigned to each of a plurality of function keys corresponding to operation modes such as record operation, reproduction operation, and setup operation of the apparatus. In this case, it is necessary to display information about the functions assigned to the function keys on the front panel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In this case, to effectively use the front panel, the display device disposed thereon needs to display the functions of the function keys. However, when information about the functions of the function keys is superimposed with a picture that is recorded or reproduced, a large part of a picture is hidden by information about the functions of the function keys. As a result, it becomes difficult for the user to check the picture.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Instead, information about the functions of the function keys may be fixedly displayed on the display screen. The other portion of the display screen may be used for a picture that is recorded or reproduced. However, in this case, the display screen may not be effectively used for a picture that is recorded or reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In view of the foregoing, it would be desirable to provide a reproduction apparatus, a display method thereof, a display program thereof, a display apparatus, and a display method that allow a display screen of the display device disposed on a front panel of the apparatus to be effectively used.</p>

1. Record and Reproduction Apparatus and System According to Embodiment of Present Invention
</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0026" num="0085">1-1. Data</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0086">For easy understanding, a record and reproduction apparatus and a system according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described. In this system, video data and audio data that are broadcast and edited are recorded on a disc shaped record medium. In addition, sub video data, sub audio data, and meta data corresponding to the main video data and main audio data are recorded on the same disc.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0087">In the following description, video data and audio data that are actually broadcast and edited are referred to as main AV (Audio/Video) data. On the other hand, sub video data and sub audio data are referred to as sub AV data. Video data of sub AV data are referred to as sub video data. Audio data of sub AV data are referred to as sub audio data.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0088">For example, video data of the main AV data are data of which base band video data have been compression-encoded according to the MPEG2 (Moving Picture Experts Group 2) system and that have a bit rate of 50 Mbps (Mega bits per second) and/or a bit rate of 25 Mbps. Audio data of the main AV data are data whose sampling frequency is 48 kHz and that have 24 quantizer bits and/or 16 quantizer bits. According to this embodiment of the present invention, video data and audio data of the main AV data that have different bit rates and different quantizer bits can be recorded on the same disc.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0089">On the other hand, the sub AV data are audio/video data having low bit rates based on the main AV data. When the main AV data are recorded on the disc, the sub AV data are generated by the main AV data. The sub video data are compression-encoded according to for example the MPEG4 system. In contrast, the sub audio data are compression-encoded by for example A-Law or sample thin-out process. Thus, the bit rate of the sub AV data is decreased from the bit rate of the main AV data to for example several Mbps.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0090">As well known, according to the MPEG system, video data are compression-encoded by an intra-frame compression encoding scheme using DCT (Discrete Cosine Transform) and an inter-frame compression-encoding scheme using a prediction encoding scheme in the time series direction. In this system, a B (Bidirectionally) picture and a P (Predictive) picture that are predictively encoded in the time series direction and an I (Intra) picture that is complete with one screen (one frame) are defined. A GOP (Group Of Picture) is a completed group containing at least one I picture. The GOP is the minimum accessible unit of an MPEG stream.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0091">The meta data are high level data with respect to particular data. The meta data function as an index that represents contents of various types of data. The meta data can be categorized as time series meta data (sometimes may be referred to as real time meta data) that occur along the time series of the foregoing main AV data and non-time series meta data (sometimes may be referred to as non-real time meta data) that occur in a predetermined region such as each scene of the main AV data.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">1-2. Disc Format</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0092">Next, a data allocation to a disc shaped record medium (hereinafter referred to as the disc) according to this embodiment of the present invention will be described. According to the embodiment of the present invention, data are recorded like annual rings formed on the disc. The annual ring data are data recorded on the disc in the unit of a data amount represented by a reproduction time period for data. With respect to the main audio data and main video data, audio data and video data corresponding to a reproduction time zone are alternately allocated and recorded in a predetermined reproduction time unit having a data size larger than one circular track. When the main audio data and main video data are recorded in such a manner, sets of main audio data and main video data corresponding to reproduction time zones are layered in time series and annual rings are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0093">According to the embodiment of the present invention, in addition to main audio data and main video data corresponding to reproduction time zones, sets of sub AV data corresponding thereto and time series meta data are recorded as annual rings on an optical disc <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0094">Data that compose an annual ring are referred to as annual ring data. The annual ring data have a data amount that is an integer multiple of a sector which is the minimum record unit of the disc. The annual rings are recorded so that their boundaries match the boundaries of sectors of the disc.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example of the state in which annual ring data are formed on the optical disc <b>5</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, audio annual ring data #<b>1</b>, video annual ring data #<b>1</b>, audio annual ring data #<b>2</b>, video annual ring data #<b>2</b>, and sub AV annual ring data #<b>1</b>, and time series meta annual ring data #<b>1</b> are successively recorded from the innermost periphery of the optical disc <b>5</b>. In this cycle, annual ring data are handled. On the outer periphery of the time series meta annual ring data #<b>1</b>, a part of the next cycle annual ring data is represented as audio annual ring data #<b>3</b> and video annual ring data #<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0096">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the reproduction time zone for one annual ring of the time series meta annual ring data corresponds to the reproduction time zone for one annual ring of the sub AV annual ring data. The reproduction time zone for one annual ring of the time series meta annual ring data corresponds to the reproduction time zone for two annual rings of the audio annual ring data. Likewise, the reproduction time zone for one annual ring of the time series meta annual ring data corresponds to the reproduction time zone for two annual rings of the video annual ring data. The relationship of the reproduction time zones and cycles of various types of annual ring data is designated corresponding to for example their data rates and so forth. It is preferred that the reproduction time for one annual ring of the video annual ring data and audio annual ring data be in the range from 1.5 seconds to 2 seconds as an empirical value.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> show an example of which data are read and written from and to the optical disc <b>5</b> having annual rings as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. When the optical disc <b>5</b> has a large and successive blank and non-defect area, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, audio annual ring data, video annual ring data, sub AV annual ring data, and real time meta annual ring data generated from data series of audio data, video data, sub AV data, and real time meta data corresponding to a reproduction time zone are written to the blank area of the optical disc <b>5</b> as if they were written in a single stroke so that a boundary of each type of data matches a boundary of each sector of the optical disc <b>5</b>. Data are read from the optical disc <b>5</b> in the same manner as they are written thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0098">On the other hand, when a particular data series is read from the optical disc <b>5</b>, a record position of the data series is sought and the data are read therefrom. This operation is repeated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> shows a state of which an sub AV data series is selectively read. With reference to also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, after the sub AV annual ring data #<b>1</b> have been read, the real time meta annual ring data #<b>1</b>, the audio annual ring data <b>3</b>, the video annual ring data #<b>3</b>, the audio annual ring data #<b>4</b>, and the video annual ring data #<b>4</b> (not shown) are skipped and the sub AV annual data #<b>2</b> of the next cycle are read.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0099">In such a manner, data are recorded on the optical disc <b>5</b> in a unit of a reproduction period as cyclic annual ring data corresponding to a reproduction time zone. Thus, since audio annual ring data and video annual ring data of the same reproduction time zone are closely allocated on the optical disc <b>5</b>, audio data and video data corresponding thereto can be quickly read and reproduced from the optical disc <b>5</b>. In addition, since data are recorded so that a boundary of an annual ring matches a boundary of a sector, only audio data or video data can be read from the optical disc <b>5</b>. As a result, only audio data or video data can be quickly edited.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0100">In addition, as described above, each of the audio annual ring data, video annual ring data, sub AV annual ring data, and real time meta annual ring data has a data amount that is a multiple of a data amount of a sector of the optical disc <b>5</b>. In addition, data are recorded so that a boundary of annual ring data matches a boundary of a sector. Thus, when only one of audio annual ring data, video annual ring data, sub AV annual ring data, and real time meta annual ring data is needed, it can be read without other types of data.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">1-3. Accessing Disc</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0101">To conveniently use data allocation of annual rings, data need to be recorded on the optical disc <b>5</b> so that continuity of annual rings is assured. Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, this operation will be described. Now, it is assumed that only sub annual ring data (denoted by &#x201c;LR&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>) are read.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0102">When data are recorded, if a sufficient blank area has been allocated, a plurality of annual rings can be successively recorded. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, sub AV annual ring data that are chronologically successive can be read by the minimum number of track jumps. In other words, after the sub AV annual ring data are read, sub AV annual ring data of the next cycle can be read. As a result, the distance for which the pickup jumps becomes the shortest.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0103">In contrast, when data are recorded, if a successive blank area has not been allocated, chronologically successive sub AV data are recorded in different areas of the optical disc <b>5</b>. In this case, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, after first sub AV annual ring data are read, the pickup needs to jump a distance for a plurality of cycles of annual rings and read the next sub AV annual ring data. Since this operation is repeated, the read speed for the sub AV annual ring data decreases in comparison with the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. In addition, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, non-edited AV data (AV clip) may not be quickly reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0104">To assure continuity of annual rings, according to this embodiment of the present invention, an allocation unit that has a plurality of annual rings is defined. When data are recorded to annual rings, a successive blank area that is larger than the allocation unit length is allocated.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0105">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, this operation will be specifically described. The allocation unit length is pre-set. The allocation unit length is set to a multiple of a total reproduction period of each type of data recorded in one annual ring. When the reproduction period of one annual ring is 2 seconds, the allocation unit length is set to 10 seconds. The allocation unit length is used as a ruler with which the length of a blank area of the optical disc <b>5</b> is measured (see an upper right portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, it is assumed that there are three used areas that are not successive on the optical disc <b>5</b> and that blank areas are sandwiched by used areas.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0106">When AV data having a predetermined length and sub AV data corresponding to the AV data are recorded on the optical disc <b>5</b>, the allocation unit length and the length of the blank area are compared. A blank area that has a length larger than the allocation unit length is allocated as a reserved area (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a right blank area of the two blank areas is larger than the allocation unit length and allocated as a reserved area. Annual ring data are successively and continuously recorded from the beginning of the reserved area (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>). In this manner, the annual ring data are recorded. When the length of the blank area of the reserved area is smaller than one annual ring of the annual ring data (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>), the reserved area is deallocated. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the allocation unit length is applied to another blank area of the optical disc <b>5</b> to look for a reserved area.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0107">Since a blank area for a plurality of annual rings is sought and the annual rings are recorded in the blank area, continuity of annual rings is assured to some extent. As a result, annual ring data can be smoothly reproduced. In the foregoing example, the allocation unit length is 10 seconds. However, the allocation unit length is not limited to 10 seconds. Instead, a length larger than this reproduction period can be set as the allocation unit length. Specifically, it is preferred that the allocation unit length be set in the range from 10 seconds to 30 seconds.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">1-4. Data Management Structure</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0108">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a management structure of data according to an embodiment of the present invention will be described. According to this embodiment of the present invention, data are managed in a directory structure. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a directory PAV is disposed immediately under a root directory (root) by using for example UDF (Universal Disk Format) as a file system. According to this embodiment, directories under the directory PAV are defined as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0109">Audio data and video data of a plurality of types of signals coexistively recorded on one disc are defined under the directory PAV. Any data can be recorded in the directory PAV for which a data management according to this embodiment of the present invention is not performed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0110">Disposed immediately under the directory PAV are four files (INDEX.XML, INDEX.RSV, DISCINFO.XML, and DISCINFO.RSV) and two directories (CLPR and EDTR).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0111">The directory CLPR manages clip data. A clip is a block of data generated after a photographing operation is started until it is stopped. For example, when a video camera is operated, one clip is a block of data generated after an operation start button thereof is pressed until an operation stop button thereof is pressed (the operation start button is released).</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0112">One block of data is composed of main audio data and video data, sub AV data generated from the audio data and video data, and real time meta data and non-real time meta data corresponding to the audio data and video data as described above. In each of directories &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>,&#x201d; &#x201c;C<b>0002</b>,&#x201d; and so forth disposed immediate under the directory CLPR, a block of data that composes a clip is stored.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an example of a structure of the directory &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>&#x201d; corresponding to one clip &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>.&#x201d; Hereinafter, a directory corresponding to one clip immediately under the directory CLPR is referred to as a clip directory. In the clip directory &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>,&#x201d; the foregoing types of data are identified by file names and stored. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a file name is composed of 12 digits. First five digits of eight digits followed by a delimiter &#x201c;.&#x201d; are used to identify a clip. Three digits immediately followed by the delimiter are used to identify a type of data such as audio data, video data, or sub AV data. Three digits immediately preceded by the delimiter are an extension that represents a format of data.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0114">Specifically, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, as files as a block that composes the clip &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>,&#x201d; a file &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>C<b>01</b>.SMI&#x201d; that represents clip information, a main video data file &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>V<b>01</b>.MXF,&#x201d; main audio data files &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>A<b>01</b>.MXF&#x201d; to &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>A<b>08</b>.MXF&#x201d; of eight channels, a sub AV data file &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>S<b>01</b>.MXF,&#x201d; a non-real time meta data file &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>M<b>01</b>.MML,&#x201d; a real time meta data file &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>R<b>01</b>.BIM,&#x201d; and a pointer information file &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>I<b>01</b>.PPF&#x201d; are stored in the clip directory &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0115">According to this embodiment of the present invention, a plurality of types of data signals can coexistively stored in clip directories under the directory CLPR. For example, with respect to signals of main video data, a single GOP, 50 Mbps video data is stored in the clip directory &#x201c;C<b>0001</b>,&#x201d; whereas long GOP, 25 Mbps video data is stored in the clip directory &#x201c;C<b>0002</b>.&#x201d; On the other hand, in a clip directory, a plurality of types of data signals of each type of data cannot be coexistively stored. A file of which video data are recorded from the beginning to a particular point at 50 Mbps and from the particular point to the end at 25 Mbps cannot be stored in a clip directory.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0116">With respect to single GOP data, each frame is composed of an I picture and a relationship of 1 GOP=1 frame is satisfied. Each frame can be edited in high quality. With respect to long GOP data, each frame is composed of an I picture, a P picture, and a B picture and one GOP is composed of a plurality of frames that end with an I picture. The long GOP data may have no B picture.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0117">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the directory EDTR manages edit information. According to this embodiment of the present invention, an edit result is recorded as an edit list and a play list. Disposed immediately under the directory EDTR are directories &#x201c;E<b>0001</b>,&#x201d; &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>,&#x201d; and so forth each of which stores a block of data that composes an edit result.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0118">An edit list is a list that describes edit points (IN point, OUT point, and so forth) of a clip, a reproduction order, and so forth. An edit list is composed of a non-destructive edit result of a clip and a play list that will be described later. When the non-destructive edit result of the edit list is reproduced, files stored in the clip directory are referenced corresponding to the list. Reproduced pictures are successively obtained from a plurality of clips as if one edited stream were reproduced. However, in the non-destructive edit result, files are referenced from the list regardless of locations of files on the optical disc <b>5</b>. Thus, continuity of reproduced data is not assured.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0119">When the edit result shows that it is difficult to successively reproduce files and parts thereof referenced by a play list, the files and parts thereof are reallocated to a predetermined area on the optical disc <b>5</b>. As a result, continuity of data is assured when an edit list is reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0120">When management information (for example, an index file &#x201c;INDEX.XML&#x201d; that will be described later) for files to be edited is referenced corresponding to a result of an edit list created by an edit operation, it is estimated whether files can be non-destructively reproduced corresponding to the edit operation, namely the files stored in clip directories can be successively reproduced corresponding to the edit result. When the result shows that the files can be successively reproduced, these files are copied to a predetermined area of the optical disc <b>5</b>. The files reallocated to the predetermined area are referred to as bridge essence files. A list of which an edit result is affected to bridge essence files is referred to as a play list.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0121">If an edit result complicatedly references clips, when one clip is changed to another clip, the pickup may not be able to seek the other clip in time. In this case, a play list is created. Bridge essence files are recorded to a predetermined area of the optical disc <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example of a structure of a directory &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>&#x201d; corresponding to one edit result &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>&#x201d; disposed immediately under the directory EDTR. A directory corresponding to one edit result immediately under the directory EDTR is referred to as an edit directory. Data generated as the edit result are identified by file names and stored in the edit directory &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>.&#x201d; A file name is composed of <b>12</b> digits. First five digits of eight digits followed by a delimiter &#x201c;.&#x201d; are used to identify an edit operation. The remaining three digits of the eight digits are used to identify a type of data. Three digits preceded by the delimiter are an extension that identifies a format of data.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0123">More specifically, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, as files that compose the edit result &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>,&#x201d; an edit list file &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>E<b>01</b>.SMI,&#x201d; a file &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>M<b>01</b>.XML&#x201d; that describes information of real time and non-real time meta data, a play list file &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>P<b>01</b>.SMI,&#x201d; bridge essence files &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>V<b>01</b>.BMX&#x201d; and &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>A<b>01</b>.BMX&#x201d; to &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>A<b>04</b>.MBX&#x201d; of main data, a bridge essence file &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>S<b>01</b>.BMX&#x201d; of sub AV data, and a bridge essence file &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>R<b>01</b>.BMX&#x201d; of real time and non-real time meta data are stored in the edit directory &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0124">Shaded files of files stored in the edit directory &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>,&#x201d; namely the bridge essence files &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>V<b>01</b>.BMX&#x201d; and &#x201c;E<b>002</b>A<b>01</b>.BMX&#x201d; to &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>A<b>04</b>.BMX,&#x201d; the bridge essence file &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>S<b>01</b>.BMX&#x201d; of sub AV data, and the bridge essence file &#x201c;E<b>0002</b>R<b>01</b>.BMX&#x201d; of real time and non-real time meta data are files that belong to the play list.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0125">As described above, for example video data stored in a clip directory are referenced corresponding to an edit list. Since different types of data signals can be coexistently stored in different clip directories, different types of data signals can be coexistently contained in an edit list.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0126">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the file &#x201c;INDEX.XML&#x201d; is an index file that manages material information stored in directories under the directory PAV. In this example, the file &#x201c;INDEX.XML&#x201d; is described in XML (Extensible Markup Language) format. The file &#x201c;INDEX.XML&#x201d; manages each of the foregoing clips and edit lists. The file &#x201c;INDEX.XML&#x201d; manages for example a conversion table for file names and UMIDs, duration information, a reproduction order of each material reproduced from the optical disc <b>5</b>, and so forth. In addition, the file &#x201c;INDEX.XML&#x201d; manages video data, audio data, sub AV data, and so forth that belong to each clip. Moreover, the file &#x201c;INDEX.XML&#x201d; manages clip information for files in a clip directory.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0127">The file &#x201c;DISCINFO.XML&#x201d; manages information about the disc. The file &#x201c;DISCINFO.XML&#x201d; also stores reproduction position information and so forth.</p>

<p id="p-0111" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows an example of the structure of the drive section <b>4</b> of the record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b>. When data are recorded, record data supplied from the signal process section <b>3</b> is stored in a memory <b>118</b> through an ECC (Error Correction Coding) section <b>119</b> and a memory controller <b>117</b>. The memory controller <b>117</b> access-controls the memory <b>118</b> under the control of a control section <b>111</b>. The control section <b>111</b> is composed of a microcomputer. The control section <b>111</b> controls the drive section <b>4</b> corresponding to a control signal supplied from the signal process section <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0136">The ECC section <b>119</b> generates an error correction code in each error correction unit of record data stored in the memory <b>118</b>. An error correction code for video data and audio data is a product code. With the product code, video data or audio data are encoded with an outer code and an inner code in the vertical direction and horizontal direction of a two-dimensional arrangement thereof so that data symbols are dually encoded. As the outer code and inner code, a Reed-Solomon code can be used. A data unit that is complete with the product code is referred to as an ECC block. An ECC block has a size of for example 64 kbytes (65536 bytes). The memory controller <b>117</b> reads an ECC block from the memory <b>118</b> and supplies it as record data to a modulation/demodulation section <b>116</b>. The modulation/demodulation section <b>116</b> modulates the record data, generates a record signal, and supplies the record signal to a pickup section <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0137">The pickup section <b>113</b> controls a laser beam output corresponding to the record signal supplied from the modulation/demodulation section <b>116</b> and records the record signal on the optical disc <b>5</b> driven and rotated by a spindle motor <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0138">The pickup section <b>113</b> converts light reflected from the optical disc <b>5</b> into a current signal and supplies it to an RF (Radio Frequency) amplifier <b>114</b>. The RF amplifier <b>114</b> generates a focus error signal, a tracking error signal, and a reproduction signal corresponding to the current signal supplied from the pickup section <b>113</b> and supplies the tracking error signal and the focus error signal to a servo control section <b>115</b>. In addition, when data are reproduced, the RF amplifier <b>114</b> supplies a reproduction signal to the modulation/demodulation section <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0139">A radiation position of the laser beam is controlled at a predetermined position with a servo signal supplied from the servo control section <b>115</b> to the pickup section <b>113</b>. In other words, the servo control section <b>115</b> controls a focus servo operation and a tracking servo operation. Specifically, the servo control section <b>115</b> generates a focus servo signal and a tracking servo signal corresponding to the focus error signal and the tracking error signal supplied from the RF amplifier <b>114</b> and supplies the generated signals to an actuator (not shown) of the pickup section <b>113</b>. In addition, the servo control section <b>115</b> generates a spindle motor drive signal with which the spindle motor <b>112</b> is driven and controls a spindle servo operation that rotates the optical disc <b>5</b> at a predetermined rotation speed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0140">In addition, the servo control section <b>115</b> performs a thread control that causes the pickup section <b>113</b> to be moved in the radius direction of the optical disc <b>5</b> to change the radiation position of the laser beam. The control section <b>111</b> sets a signal read position of the optical disc <b>5</b> corresponding to the control signal supplied from the signal process section <b>3</b> and controls the position of the pickup section <b>113</b> so that a signal is read from the read position.</p>

The mode CLV&#xd7;1 is a mode that occurs only when the drive section <b>4</b> is started. Thus, this mode is not used in other states. The data rate of the mode CLV&#xd7;2 is twice the data rate of the mode CLV&#xd7;1. Data are written to the optical disc <b>5</b> in the mode CLV&#xd7;2. The mode CLV&#xd7;2.4 is used for reproduction operations for example the normal reproduction operation and the shuttle reproduction operation. The mode CAV&#xd7;1 is used when thumbnails are displayed.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0144">The ECC section <b>119</b> decodes an error correction code of reproduction data supplied in the unit of one ECC block and corrects errors of the supplied reproduction data. When the ECC section <b>119</b> detects an error that exceeds an error correction capability of the error correction code, the ECC section <b>119</b> does not correct the error. In this case, the ECC section <b>119</b> places an error flag in the error correction unit.

<p id="h-0012" num="0000">2-1. Layout of Front Panel</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0176"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an example of the structure of the front panel <b>2</b> of the record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b>. Operation switches disposed on the front panel <b>2</b> are composed of a touch panel except for some of them. The touch panel is of a capacity coupling type of which it is detected whether the user's finger has touched a predetermined portion corresponding to variation of capacitance of electrodes formed on a substrate. For example, electrodes are formed at positions corresponding to operation portions on nearly all the surface of a substrate except for the display section <b>10</b> of the front panel <b>2</b>. The substrate is a file made of for example PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) or the like. A dielectric plate such as a glass plate or an acrylic plate is adhered to the substrate. As a result, a panel surface is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0177">The dielectric plate adhered to the substrate is for example an acrylic plate. It is preferred that a transparent acrylic plate be used for an luxurious design. In the following description, as a dielectric plate adhered to the substrate is a transparent acrylic plate. This plate is called the panel plate.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0178">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a transparent electrode sheet <b>41</b> having a signal pattern and a GND (Ground) pattern made of an ITO (Iridium Tin Oxide) film <b>41</b>A is adhered to a panel plate <b>40</b> made of a transparent acrylic plate.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0179">The rear surface of the panel plate <b>40</b> is painted so that the electrode structure is concealed from the outside. Letters and symbols that represent functions of keys and so forth are printed on the panel plate <b>40</b>. At this point, a transparent paint may be coated. Light emitting devices such as LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes) may be disposed on the rear surface of the transparent paint. When a light emitting device at a position corresponding to an operation of the touch panel is lit, an operations result and so forth can be indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0180">Next, the layout of individual sections of the front panel <b>2</b> will be described in brief. Disposed on the left of the front panel <b>2</b> is the display section <b>10</b> that uses for example an LCD. The display section <b>10</b> can display pictures that are input to the record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b> and pictures reproduces from a record medium by the record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b>. In addition, the display section <b>10</b> can display various statuses of the record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b>, the functions of function keys <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>, that will be described later, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0181">Formed at an upper right portion of the front panel <b>2</b> is a cutout section <b>11</b> that is cut from the upper end in a horizontally elongated rectangular shape. The cutout section <b>11</b> exposes a disc loading opening <b>12</b> disposed on the main body side of the record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b>. The front panel <b>2</b> is movable from the main body of the record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b>. The lower end portion of the front panel <b>2</b> is movable in the forward direction so that the front panel <b>2</b> can be inclined. The lower end section of the front panel <b>2</b> is moved in the forward direction and the upper end portion thereof is lowered in a predetermined manner so that the inclined front panel <b>2</b> does not prevent a disc from being loaded into the disc loading opening <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0182">Disposed at the lower left end portion of the front panel <b>2</b> are rotation knobs <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B, <b>13</b>C, and <b>13</b>D with which the levels of for example audio input signals are adjusted. Parts of circles of the rotation knobs <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B, <b>13</b>C, and <b>13</b>D are exposed at the lower end of the front panel <b>2</b>. The other parts of the rotation knobs <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B, <b>13</b>C, and <b>13</b>D are covered by the panel plate <b>40</b>. The exposed portions have a space enough to allow the user to touch and rotate the rotation knobs <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B, <b>13</b>C, and <b>13</b>D with his or her finger. The scales of the rotation knobs <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B, <b>13</b>C, and <b>13</b>D are marked for example on their front surfaces so that the user can watch them through the panel plate <b>40</b>. Disposed on the right of the rotation knobs <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B, <b>13</b>C, and <b>13</b>D is a switch <b>14</b> with which adjustment modes of the rotation knobs <b>13</b>A, <b>13</b>B, <b>13</b>C, and <b>13</b>D are set.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0183">Disposed at the left end of the front panel <b>2</b> are a power switch <b>15</b>, a remote selection switch <b>16</b>, a headset level volume controller <b>17</b>, and a headset jack <b>18</b>. The power switch <b>15</b>, the remote selection switch <b>16</b>, the headset level volume controller <b>17</b>, and the headset jack <b>18</b> are successively disposed from the top to the bottom of the front panel <b>2</b>. Disposed on the right of the disc loading opening <b>12</b> is an eject button with which the disc loaded into the record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b> is unloaded from the disc loading opening <b>12</b>. Disposed near the center of the front panel <b>2</b> is a shift key <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0184">Next, the operation switches composed of the touch panel of the front panel <b>2</b> will be described. The substances of keys and a search bar <b>30</b> that will be described in the following are sensors made of electrodes formed on the transparent electrode sheet <b>41</b> disposed through the panel plate <b>40</b>. They detect whether the user's finger has touched a predetermined portion corresponding to variation of capacitance and output a predetermined control signal. The front panel <b>2</b> uses digital sensors that detect whether the user's finger has touched a predetermined portion and output a corresponding signal and an analog sensor that linearly and continuously detects positions that the user's finger has touched. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the digital sensors are used for various keys. The analog sensor is used for the search bar <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0185">In the following description, an operation that the user touches a key as a digital sensor with his or her finger and detects that it has touched the key is referred to as &#x201c;pressing the key&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0186">Formed on the right of the display section <b>10</b> are function keys <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>, . . . . The function keys <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>, . . . compose a key set of a plurality of keys (in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, five function keys F1 to F5). For each key set, the functions of the function keys <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>, . . . can be changed. The functions assigned to the function keys <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>, . . . are displayed at the right end of the display section <b>10</b> when the display mode of the display screen on the display section <b>10</b> is a function menu mode.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0187">Formed below the function keys <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>, are a page key <b>21</b> and a display key <b>22</b>. The page key <b>21</b> causes the display mode of the display section <b>10</b> to be switched to the function mode in which the function keys are displayed and a key set of the function keys <b>20</b>, <b>20</b>, . . . to be switched. The display key <b>22</b> causes the display mode on the display section <b>10</b> to be switched.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0188">Formed below the disc loading opening <b>12</b> are various keys <b>23</b>A to <b>23</b>E with which an edit operation and a system setup operation are performed. The various keys <b>23</b>A to <b>23</b>E each have a protrusion portion on their front surfaces so that the user can operate them without need to watch them. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the key <b>23</b>A to <b>23</b>E are assigned two functions each. Their functions are indicated above and below the keys <b>23</b>A to <b>23</b>C. While the shift key <b>24</b> is being pressed, when one of the key <b>23</b>A to <b>23</b>C is pressed, the function indicated below the key is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0189">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the key <b>23</b>A is used to perform a simple edit operation. Namely, the key <b>23</b>A causes a clip to be cut and clips to be connected. The key <b>23</b>B causes a thumbnail search screen to be displayed. When the key <b>23</b>B is operated along with the shift key <b>24</b>, they cause an essence mark search to be performed. The essence mark is a mark that is automatically recorded corresponding to variation of a predetermined condition when a picture is recorded for example a filter of a camera is changed. The keys <b>23</b>C to <b>23</b>E are keys used to perform the system setup operation of the record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b>. The key <b>23</b>C is also used when an edit operation is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0190">Formed below the various keys <b>23</b>A to <b>23</b>E are keys <b>25</b>A to <b>25</b>E with which various record and reproduction operations are controlled. When the key <b>25</b>A is pressed for example one time, the position of the clip that is currently reproduced/selected is returned to the beginning of the clip. When the key <b>25</b>A is pressed for example successively two times, the position is moved to the top clip of the disc. The key <b>25</b>B is a playback key that causes the one-time speed reproduction operation to be started in the forward direction. When the key <b>25</b>C is pressed for example one time, the position is moved to beginning of the next clip of the clip that is being reproduced or selected. When the key <b>25</b>C is pressed for example successively two times, the position is moved to the last clip of the disc. The key <b>25</b>D is a stop key that causes the reproduction operation to be stopped. The key <b>25</b>E is a record key that causes the record operation to be started. Formed on both sides of the record key <b>25</b>E are rod-shaped bumps as guards that prevent a miss-operation of the record key <b>25</b>E. When the playback key <b>25</b>B and the prev key <b>25</b>A are simultaneously pressed, they cause the high speed reproduction operation to be performed in the reverse direction. When the playback key <b>25</b>B and the next key <b>25</b>C are simultaneously pressed, they cause the high speed reproduction operation to be performed in the forward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0191">Formed on the right of the keys <b>25</b>A to <b>25</b>E are four way keys <b>27</b>. The four way keys <b>27</b> are composed of four keys corresponding to the four directions of up, down, left, and right directions. The four way keys <b>27</b> are used to designate a direction corresponding to the display on the display section <b>10</b>. When the edit operation is performed, with the four way keys <b>27</b> and the key <b>23</b>C, an IN point and an OUT point can be designated and a reproduction position can be marked. The positions corresponding to the four way keys <b>27</b> are bumped. Thus, the user can operate the four way keys <b>27</b> without need to watch them.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0192">Formed below the keys <b>25</b>A to <b>25</b>E is the search bar <b>30</b> composed of an analog type sensor. The search bar <b>30</b> can linearly detect positions that the user's finger has touched. For example, the distances of the position that the user's finger has touched from the positions of two electrodes disposed on both ends of the search bar <b>30</b> are obtained corresponding to variation of capacitances of the electrodes. With these distances, the position that the user's finger has touched is determined. Since the position that the user's finger has touched is detected with the values of two points on the both ends, one position that the user's finger has touched can be determined regardless of the thickness of the user's finger and so forth. The search bar <b>30</b> is bored in a horizontally elongated oval shape. Formed at an upper center position in the horizontally elongated oval shape of the search bar <b>30</b> is a bump <b>32</b>. Thus, the user can easily know the center portion of the search bar <b>30</b> with the bump <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0193">Formed in the bottom of the search bar <b>30</b> is a slit shaped transparent portion <b>31</b> corresponding to a horizontal linear position detectable range. When light emitting devices such as LEDs are disposed at positions corresponding to the transparent portion on the rear side of the panel plate <b>40</b>, the user can know light emission of the light emitting device from the panel side. As will be described later, a plurality of light emitting devices are disposed in the slit shaped transparent portion <b>31</b> so that they illuminate corresponding to the position that the user's finger has touched on the search bar <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0194">Formed on the right of the search bar <b>30</b> are search mode keys <b>28</b>A to <b>28</b>C that cause an operation mode and so forth corresponding to the operation of the search bar <b>30</b> to be designated and indicated. Formed on the panel plate <b>40</b> corresponding to the search mode keys <b>28</b>A to <b>28</b>C are transparent portions in a predetermined manner. Disposed at the positions corresponding to the transparent portions on the rear surface of the search bar <b>30</b> are light emitting devices such as LEDs.</p>

<p id="p-0171" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows an outlined circuit structure of the front panel <b>2</b>. The touch panel section <b>4</b> contains the panel plate <b>40</b>, the transparent electrode sheet <b>41</b> (the panel plate <b>40</b> and the electrode sheet <b>41</b> were described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>), and a control module that converts an output signal of the transparent electrode sheet <b>41</b> into a control signal corresponding to the KY microcomputer <b>44</b> disposed downstream of the touch panel section <b>42</b>. The touch panel section <b>42</b> is connected to the KY microcomputer <b>44</b> through an LED substrate module <b>43</b>. The KY microcomputer <b>44</b> is connected to a system controller <b>45</b> of the main body of the record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b>. In the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the system controller <b>45</b> corresponds to for example the CPU <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0196">Output signals of part or all non-touch panel type keys such as the shift key <b>24</b> are directly supplied to for example the KY microcomputer <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0197">The LED substrate module <b>43</b> is disposed on the far side viewed from the front of the front panel <b>2</b> of the touch panel section <b>42</b>. LEDs and an LED light emission control circuit are disposed at predetermined positions of the substrate.

In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, as described above, LEDs are disposed at the positions corresponding to the search mode keys <b>28</b>A to <b>28</b>C. In addition, a plurality of LEDs are disposed along the slit shaped transparent portion <b>31</b> of the search bar <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0198">The KY microcomputer <b>44</b> is composed of for example a microprocessor. The KY microcomputer <b>44</b> outputs a command corresponding to a control signal supplied from the touch panel section <b>42</b> to the system controller <b>45</b> of the main body of the record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b>. In addition, the KY microcomputer <b>44</b> controls the light emission control circuit of the LED substrate module <b>43</b> corresponding to an operation on the touch panel and a command supplied from the system controller <b>45</b> to light the LEDs in a predetermined manner.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0199"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows an example of a detailed structure of the touch panel section <b>42</b>. The touch panel section <b>42</b> has the transparent electrode sheet <b>41</b> (described above) and an output section <b>48</b> that converts an output signal of the transparent electrode sheet <b>41</b> into a control signal that the KY microcomputer <b>44</b> can process. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the transparent electrode sheet <b>41</b> is composed of a key section <b>42</b>A and a search bar section <b>42</b>B. The key section <b>42</b>A has 24 digital type sensors disposed on the front panel <b>2</b>. The search bar section <b>42</b>B composes the search bar <b>30</b> that has an analog type sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0200">First of all, the key section <b>42</b>A will be described. In the key section <b>42</b>A, 24 keys composed of digital type sensors supply 24 output signals to the output section <b>48</b> in parallel. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, sets of eight output signals of the 24 output signals are supplied to digital modules <b>46</b>A, <b>46</b>B, and <b>46</b>C, respectively. The digital modules <b>46</b>A, <b>46</b>B, and <b>46</b>C can process eight-bit signals each. Each of the digital modules <b>46</b>A, <b>46</b>B, and <b>46</b>C converts eight signals into one-bit digital data and supplies the converted data to a control module <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0201">The control module <b>47</b> converts one-bit data corresponding to each key supplied from the digital modules <b>46</b>A, <b>46</b>B, and <b>46</b>C into a code corresponding to each key and outputs the code to the KY microcomputer <b>44</b> through the LED substrate module <b>43</b> (not shown). The KY microcomputer <b>44</b> converts the supplied code into data that the system controller <b>45</b> of the main body of the record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b> can interpret and outputs the converted data to the system controller <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0202"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows an example of which the outputs of the 24 keys are converted into codes by the control module <b>47</b>.

In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, different alphabet letters are assigned to the 24 keys. Upper case alphabet ASCII codes are assigned to the ON states of the keys, whereas the corresponding lower case alphabet ASCII codes are assigned to the OFF states of their keys.

The search bar section <b>42</b>B outputs an analog signal of potential corresponding to the position that the user's finger has touched. For example, an analog signal corresponding to the difference between the outputs of the two electrodes may be output. The analog signal that is output from the search bar section <b>42</b>B is supplied to an analog module <b>46</b>D of the output section <b>48</b>.

In particular, the widest data value range is assigned to the region denoted by position information &#x201c;STILL&#x201d;. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, 26 bits of data values &#x201c;115&#x201d; to &#x201c;140&#x201d; including data value &#x201c;128&#x201d; that denotes the nearly center are assigned to the region denoted by position information &#x201c;STILL&#x201d;.

In the foregoing example, the detectable range of the search bar <b>30</b> is divided into 21 regions. However, this embodiment of the present invention is not limited to this example.

<p id="p-0191" num="0215">The assignment of the data value ranges of the position information is designated as software by for example the KY microcomputer <b>44</b>.

<p id="h-0016" num="0000">3-2. Reproduction Control Using Search Bar</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0217">Reproduction control modes of the search bar <b>30</b> will be described in brief. According to an embodiment of the present invention, as reproduction control modes using the search bar <b>30</b>, there are three operation modes that are a jog mode, a shuttle mode, and a slow mode.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0218">In the jog mode, the reproduction operation is performed at the speed and in the direction corresponding to the position that the user's finger has touched the search bar <b>30</b>. When the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b> and does not operate it, the still reproduction operation is performed. A frame that was reproduced immediately before the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b> is fixedly reproduced. According to this embodiment of the present invention, in the jog mode, the reproduction operation can be performed in both the forward and reverse directions. The reproduction speed can be gradually changed from the still reproduction operation to &#xb1;one-time reproduction operation. In other words, in the jog mode, the reproduction speed can be gradually changed from 0 speed (still reproduction operation) to one-time speed in both the forward and reverse directions.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0219">In the shuttle mode, the reproduction operation is performed at the speed and in the direction corresponding to the position that the user's finger has touched on the search bar <b>30</b>. When the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b> and does not operate it, the reproduction operation is performed at the reproduction speed and in the direction corresponding to the position from which the user's finger has been just released on the search bar <b>30</b>. According to this embodiment of the present invention, in the shuttle mode, the reproduction operation can be performed in both the forward and reverse directions. The reproduction operation can be performed at a speed higher than one-time speed in both the forward and reverse directions. For example, the reproduction speed can be gradually changed from the still reproduction operation to &#xb1;20-time reproduction operation. In other words, the reproduction speed can be gradually changed from the 0 speed to 20-time speed.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0220">In the jog mode and the shuttle mode, low resolution video data that are generated and recorded along with high resolution main video data are used as reproduction video data.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0221">In the slow mode, the reproduction operation is performed at the speed and in the direction corresponding to the position that the user's finger has touched on the search bar <b>30</b>. When the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b> and does not operate it, the reproduction operation is performed at the speed corresponding to the position from which the user's finger has been just released on the search bar <b>30</b>. According to this embodiment of the present invention, in the slow mode, the reproduction operation is performed in the forward direction. The reproduction speed can be gradually changed from the still reproduction operation to one-time speed reproduction operation.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0222">In the slow mode, high resolution main video data are used as reproduction video data. In the slow mode, the reproduction operation can be performed in the reverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0223"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref> show an example of the relationship of the position on the search bar <b>30</b> and the reproduction speed in each of the jog mode, the shuttle mode, and the slow mode. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>, &#x201c;+&#x201d; of the reproduction speed represents the reproduction operation in the forward direction, whereas &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; of the reproduction speed represents the reproduction operation in the reverse direction. &#x201c;STILL&#x201d; of the reproduction speed represents the still reproduction of which one frame is fixedly reproduced at 0 reproduction speed.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0224">In the jog mode exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, the still reproduction operation is performed in the region corresponding to position information &#x201c;STILL&#x201d;. For example, the reproduction operation is performed in the forward direction at &#x201c;+0.03&#x201d; time reproduction speed in the region corresponding to position information &#x201c;+1&#x201d;. The reproduction speed is gradually increased in proportion to the distance to the region corresponding to position information &#x201c;STILL&#x201d;. The reproduction speed in the regions corresponding to position information &#x201c;+9&#x201d; and &#x201c;+10&#x201d; is one-time speed. Like the reproduction operation in the forward direction, when the reproduction operation is performed in the reverse direction, the reproduction speed is changed corresponding to position information.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0225">In the shuttle mode exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>, the still reproduction operation is performed in the region corresponding to position information &#x201c;STILL&#x201d;. For example, the reproduction operation is performed in the forward direction at &#x201c;+0.03&#x201d; time reproduction speed in the region corresponding to position information &#x201c;+1&#x201d;. The reproduction speed is gradually increased in proportion to the distance to the region corresponding to position information &#x201c;STILL&#x201d;. The reproduction speed in the region corresponding to position information &#x201c;+6&#x201d; is one-time speed. The reproduction speed in the region corresponding to position information &#x201c;+10&#x201d; is 20-time speed. Like the reproduction operation in the forward direction, when the reproduction operation is performed in the reverse direction, the reproduction speed is changed corresponding to position information.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0226">In the slow mode exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>, the still reproduction operation is performed in the region corresponding to position information &#x201c;STILL&#x201d;. Like the foregoing jog mode, when the reproduction operation is performed in the forward direction, the reproduction speed is changed. However, according to this embodiment of the present invention, in the slow mode, the reproduction operation cannot be performed in the reverse direction. Thus, all position information that represents the reproduction operation in the reverse direction is correlated with the still reproduction operation. Thus, while the reproduction operation is being performed in the forward direction, if the user's finger touches a position that represents the reproduction operation in the reverse direction, the reproduction operation in the forward direction is changed to the still reproduction operation. While the still reproduction operation is being performed in the still mode, if the user' finger touches a position that represents the reproduction operation in the reverse direction, the still reproduction operation is kept. At this point, it is preferred that the user be informed that he or she has performed an improper operation with for example beep sound.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0227">The relationship of the position information and the data value of digital data that is output from the control module <b>47</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> and the relationship of the position information and the reproduction speed and the reproduction direction shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref> are pre-stored for example in the ROM (Read Only Memory) (not shown) of the KY microcomputer <b>44</b>. Instead, a plurality of different relationships may be pre-stored in the ROM and one of them may be selected for example on the setup menu screen.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0228">When the position information that represents the position on the search bar <b>30</b> is correlated with the reproduction speed and the reproduction direction, the following operations can be performed. When the user's finger touches a particular position on the search bar <b>30</b>, the reproduction operation can be performed at the speed and in the direction corresponding to the position that the user's finger has touched. In the shuttle mode, after the user's finger has touched a particular position, if it touches another position, the reproduction speed and the reproduction direction can be quickly changed. When the user touches the search bar <b>30</b> with his or her finger and horizontally slides it thereon, the reproduction speed can be gradually increased or decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0229">In addition, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, according to this embodiment of the present invention, the regions corresponding to the position information at the center and near the center of the search bar <b>30</b> are wider than other regions. Thus, the detection sensitivity of the regions at the center and near the center of the search bar <b>30</b> is low. As a result, the stop operation and the frame operation as the reproduction control can be easily performed.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">3-3. Indications of Search Bar</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0230">As described above, according to an embodiment of the present invention, in the LED substrate module <b>43</b>, a plurality of light emitting devices such as LEDs are disposed along the search bar <b>30</b>. With the light emitting devices, operations on the search bar <b>30</b> can be indicated. For example, in the LED substrate module <b>43</b>, the KY microcomputer <b>44</b> controls light emission of the LEDs with the position information generated corresponding to the detected result of the position on the search bar <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0231">Next, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19D</figref>, the light emission control of the LEDs will be described. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, when the position detectable range of the search bar <b>30</b> is surrounded by a dotted line, a total of 21 LEDs that are 10 LEDs <b>34</b>, <b>34</b>, . . . , <b>34</b>, one LED <b>35</b>, and 10 LEDs <b>36</b>, <b>36</b>, . . . , <b>36</b> are disposed. For example, the 10 LEDs <b>34</b>, <b>34</b>, . . . , <b>34</b> correspond to the position information &#x201c;&#x2212;10&#x201d; to &#x201c;&#x2212;1&#x201d; in the reverse direction. Likewise, the 10 LEDs <b>36</b>, <b>36</b>, . . . , <b>36</b> correspond to the position information &#x201c;+1&#x201d; to &#x201c;+10&#x201d; in the forward direction. The center LED <b>35</b> corresponds to the position information &#x201c;STILL&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0232">In addition, backlight LEDs <b>33</b> and <b>37</b> are disposed on the left and right of the position detectable range of the search bar <b>30</b>. The backlight LEDs <b>33</b> and <b>37</b> correspond to the reproduction operation in the reverse direction and the reproduction operation in the forward direction, respectively. The backlight LEDs <b>33</b> and <b>37</b> indicate the direction in which the reproduction control can be performed on the search bar <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0233">When the function of the search bar <b>30</b> has been tuned off, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>, all the LEDs <b>34</b>, <b>34</b>, . . . , <b>34</b>, the LED <b>35</b>, the LEDs <b>36</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>36</b>, and the LEDs <b>33</b> and <b>37</b> disposed on the search bar <b>30</b> are turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0234"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref> shows an example of the state of the LEDs in which the search bar <b>30</b> can be used and the still reproduction operation is performed. When the still reproduction operation is performed, the center LED <b>35</b> is turned on, which indicates that the still reproduction operation is performed. In addition, the backlight LEDs <b>33</b> and <b>37</b> are turned on, which indicate that the current state can be changed to the reproduction operation in the forward direction and the reproduction operation in the reverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0235"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref> shows an example of the state of the LEDs in which the search bar <b>30</b> is operated in the jog mode or the shuttle mode and the user's finger is touching the search bar <b>30</b>. In the jog mode and the shuttle mode, a plurality of LEDs from the center LED <b>35</b> to the LED at the position that the user's finger has touched on the search bar <b>30</b> are simultaneously turned on. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, the user's finger has touched the position corresponding to position information &#x201c;&#x2212;6&#x201d; on the search bar <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0236">Depending on whether the LEDs <b>34</b>, <b>34</b>, . . . , <b>34</b> or the LEDs <b>36</b>, <b>36</b>, . . . , <b>36</b> are turned on, the user can know the reproduction direction. The reproduction speed is indicated with the number of LEDs <b>34</b>, <b>34</b>, <b>34</b> or LEDs <b>36</b>, <b>36</b>, . . . , <b>36</b> that are turned on against the center LED <b>35</b>. Thus, the user can intuitionally know the reproduction speed and the reproduction direction with the indications of the LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0237">In the jog mode and the shuttle mode, when the user's finger touches any position on the search bar <b>30</b>, the reproduction control is performed so that the reproduction operation is performed at the reproduction speed and the reproduction direction corresponding to the position that the user's finger has touched on the search bar <b>30</b>. When the state of the LEDs is as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, if the user's finger touches the position corresponding to the position information &#x201c;+10&#x201d; in the shuttle mode, the reproduction control is performed so that the reproduction operation at one-time speed in the reverse direction is quickly changed to the reproduction operation at 20-time speed in the forward direction. In other words, in the jog mode and the shuttle mode, since the reproduction operation can be performed in both the forward and reverse directions, both the backlight LEDs <b>33</b> and <b>37</b> are simultaneously turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0238">When the user's finger is released from the search bar <b>30</b>, the indications of the LEDs depend on whether the mode is the jog mode or the shuttle mode. In other words, in the jog mode, when the user's finger is released from the search bar <b>30</b>, the still reproduction operation is performed. Thus, the LEDs indicates that the still reproduction operation is performed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19B</figref>. As a result, the center LED <b>35</b> and the backlight LEDs <b>33</b> and <b>37</b> are turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0239">On the other hand, in the shuttle mode, when the user's finger is been released from the search bar <b>30</b>, the reproduction operation at the reproduction speed in the reproduction direction corresponding to the position from which the user's finger has been released on the search bar <b>30</b> is kept. Thus, the indications of the LEDs are kept in the state corresponding to the position from which the user's finger has been released on the search bar <b>30</b>. When the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b> in the shuttle mode in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>, until the user's finger touches the search bar <b>30</b>, the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref> is kept. The reproduction operation is performed at the reproduction speed in the reproduction direction in the state shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0240"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19D</figref> shows an example of the state of the LEDs in which the search bar <b>30</b> is operated in the slow mode. According to this embodiment of the present invention, in the slow mode, the reproduction operation is performed only in the forward direction. Thus, only the backlight LED <b>37</b>, which indicates the reproduction operation in the forward direction, is turned on and the LED <b>33</b> is turned off. Like the foregoing jog mode and shuttle mode, the LED <b>35</b> and the LEDs <b>36</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>36</b> corresponding to the reproduction speed are turned on.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">3-4. Switching of Operation Modes of Search Bar</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0241">Three operation modes of the search bar <b>30</b> can be selected with the search mode keys <b>28</b>A, <b>28</b>B, and <b>28</b>C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, respectively. The search mode key <b>28</b>A causes the search bar <b>30</b> to operate in the shuttle mode. The search mode key <b>28</b>B causes the search bar <b>30</b> to operate in the jog mode. The search mode key <b>28</b>C causes the search bar <b>30</b> to operate in the slow mode.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0242">While the search bar <b>30</b> is operating in any operation mode, it is preferred that the operation mode of the search bar <b>30</b> not be switched with the search mode keys <b>28</b>A, <b>28</b>B, and <b>28</b>C. In this example, when the user's finger is released from the search bar <b>30</b> and then touches it again, the operation mode is switched to a new operation mode.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0243">For example, when the operation mode of the search bar <b>30</b> is the shuttle mode and the user's finger is released from the search bar <b>30</b>, if the reproduction operation is kept at the reproduction speed and in the reproduction direction corresponding to the position that the user's finger has touched on the search bar <b>30</b>, even if the user operates the search mode key <b>28</b>B, the operation mode of the search bar <b>30</b> is not switched to the jog mode. After the user operates the search mode key <b>28</b>B, when the user's finger touches the search bar <b>30</b> again, the operation mode of the search bar <b>30</b> is switched to the jog mode.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0244">Each of the search mode keys <b>28</b>A, <b>28</b>B, and <b>28</b>C has two light emission devices that are composed of for example LEDs. In combination of the ON states of these LEDs of the search mode keys <b>28</b>A, <b>28</b>B, and <b>28</b>C, the current operation mode of the search bar <b>30</b> and the new operation mode of the search bar <b>30</b> selected by the search mode keys <b>28</b>A, <b>28</b>B, and <b>28</b>C are indicated.</p>

As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, the search mode key <b>28</b> has an LED <b>29</b>A that illuminates the outside of the key and an LED <b>29</b>B that illuminates the center portion of the key.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0246">When the operation mode of the search bar <b>30</b> has not been selected, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>, both the LED <b>29</b>A and the LED <b>29</b>B are turned off. When the operation mode of the search mode key has been selected and the operation mode of the search bar <b>30</b> is not the operation mode of the search mode key, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref>, the LED <b>29</b>A outside the key is turned on, but the LED <b>29</b>B at the center portion of the key is not turned on. When the current operation mode of the search bar <b>30</b> is the operation mode selected by the search mode key, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20D</figref>, both the LED <b>29</b>A and the LED <b>29</b>B are turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0247">It is preferred that when the user's finger touches each key and the search bar <b>30</b> composed of the touch panel, predetermined sound be output. For example, in the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a sound output section (not shown) is connected to the KY microcomputer <b>44</b>. When the touch panel section <b>42</b> has detected that the user's finger has touched a key or the search bar <b>30</b>, the KY microcomputer <b>44</b> controls the sound output section to generate a predetermined sound. For example, when a key on the touch panel is pressed one time, a beep sound is generated one time. When two or more keys are pressed in combination, a beep sound is generated two times. Likewise, when the touch panel section <b>42</b> has detected that the user's finger has touched the search bar <b>30</b>, a beep sound is generated one time. The sound may be other than a beep sound. It is more preferred that the sound level and sound tone be adjustable. For example, with respect to the sound level, one of &#x201c;HIGH&#x201d; level, &#x201c;LOW&#x201d; level, and OFF (no sound) may be selected. The sound level and sound tone may be changed with keys.</p>

The video process circuit has a signal process circuit <b>101</b>, a graphics process circuit <b>102</b>, and a display section <b>10</b>. The graphics process circuit <b>102</b> corresponds to for example the graphic driver <b>93</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The display section <b>10</b> has an LCD <b>104</b> and a corresponding LCD driver <b>103</b>. The effective display size of the LCD <b>104</b> is for example 373 pixels&#xd7;224 lines. A microcomputer <b>106</b> controls individual sections of the video process circuit. The microcomputer <b>106</b> is for example the CPU <b>52</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0273">The signal process circuit <b>101</b> is for example a PLD (Programmable Logic Device) composed of a programmable logic circuit IC (Integrated Circuit). The PLD is for example an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). The signal process circuit <b>101</b> corresponds to for example a part of the FPGA <b>74</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0274">A horizontal synchronization signal (XHSYNC), a vertical synchronization signal (XVSYNC), and a field signal that are generated with a reference synchronization signal supplied from the outside of the apparatus are supplied to the signal process circuit <b>101</b>. The horizontal synchronization signal (XHSYNC) and the vertical synchronization signal (XVSYNC) that are output from the signal process circuit <b>101</b> are supplied to the graphics process circuit <b>102</b> and the LCD driver <b>103</b>. The field signal that is output from the signal process circuit <b>101</b> is supplied to the graphics process circuit <b>102</b>. A clock (VQCLK) that has a clock frequency of around 27 MHz is supplied to the signal process circuit <b>101</b> and the graphics process circuit <b>102</b> through a buffer <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0275">For example, HD format video data are down-converted and horizontally expanded to 1440 pixels&#xd7;480 lines. The horizontally expanded video data are supplied to the graphics process circuit <b>102</b> through the signal process circuit <b>101</b>. When the signal process circuit <b>101</b> receives a reduction process command from the microcomputer <b>106</b>, the signal process circuit <b>101</b> performs a reduction process for the supplied video data and supplies the reduced video data to the graphics process circuit <b>102</b>.

The selector <b>108</b> reduces the video data under the control of the reduction circuit <b>107</b> and supplies the reduced video data to the graphics process circuit <b>102</b>. For example, the reduction circuit <b>107</b> controls the selector <b>108</b> corresponding to a command supplied from the microcomputer <b>106</b>. The selector <b>108</b> thins out lines of the video data corresponding to a command received from the reduction circuit <b>107</b> and supplies the thinned-out video data to the graphics process circuit <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0276">The signal process circuit <b>101</b> outputs a display clock and supplies it to the graphics process circuit <b>102</b>. The display clock is generated by for example the signal process circuit <b>101</b> corresponding to the clock (VQCLK).

<p id="p-0254" num="0278">The graphics process circuit <b>102</b> has a reduction function for video data supplied from the signal process circuit <b>101</b>. For example, the graphics process circuit <b>102</b> reduces the vertical size and horizontal size of video data supplied from the signal process circuit <b>101</b> to &#xbc; and &#xbc; or &#x2159;, respectively. The reduction function can be accomplished by thinning out video data that are read from the frame memory in a predetermined manner.

<p id="p-0271" num="0295">Screens displayed on the display section <b>10</b> are not limited to the status screen <b>200</b>, the function screen <b>210</b>, and the monitor screen <b>220</b>. For example, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref>, a thumbnail search screen <b>230</b> on which representative pictures of clips recorded on the optical disc <b>5</b> are displayed as thumbnail pictures can be displayed on the display section <b>10</b> so that the user can easily select a clip.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0296">Thumbnail pictures are mainly used as an index. Since they do not need to have high quality, they can be generated by sub AV data. Since sub AV data have low resolution and low data rate, they can be generated without need to impose a heavy load on the apparatus in comparison with the case that they are generated by main AV data.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0297">When the user performs an operation for the user interface section <b>7</b>, index file &#x201c;INDEX.XML&#x201d; is read from the optical disc <b>5</b> so as to obtain information about all clips recorded on the optical disc <b>5</b>. With reference to clip directories, thumbnail pictures are automatically generated by sub AV data. A thumbnail picture is generated by reading a frame at a predetermined position of sub AV data and performing a picture size conversion process and a color space conversion process for the frame that has been read. As a result, a thumbnail picture is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0298"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31A</figref> shows an example of the thumbnail search screen <b>230</b>. The thumbnail search screen <b>230</b> may be displayed on an external monitor through the output terminal <b>81</b>, not displayed on the display section <b>10</b>. The thumbnail search screen <b>230</b> tabulates a predetermined number of thumbnail pictures <b>231</b>, <b>231</b>, . . . . Displayed at the right end of the thumbnail search screen <b>230</b> is a scroll bar <b>236</b>. A scroll box <b>237</b> in the scroll bar <b>236</b> indicates a rough position of a selected thumbnail picture <b>232</b> in all clips recorded on the optical disc <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0299">When the key <b>23</b>B on the front panel <b>2</b> is pressed, a display command for the thumbnail search screen <b>230</b> is issued. When the display command for the thumbnail search screen <b>230</b> has been issued, the drive system of the spindle motor <b>112</b> of the drive section <b>4</b> is switched from the CLV drive system to the CAV drive system. The optical disc <b>5</b> is accessed corresponding to the CAV drive system and sub AV data are read therefrom in a predetermined manner. Thumbnail pictures <b>231</b>, <b>231</b>, . . . displayed on one page of the thumbnail search screen <b>230</b> are generated by the sub AV data. The thumbnail pictures <b>231</b>, <b>231</b>, . . . are tabulated on the thumbnail search screen <b>230</b>.

The thinned-out frames are temporarily written to the RAM <b>65</b>. When frames to be displayed on the thumbnail search screen <b>230</b>, namely the thumbnail pictures <b>231</b>, <b>231</b>, . . . , have been written to the RAM <b>65</b>, the thumbnail pictures <b>231</b>, <b>231</b>, . . . are read from the RAM <b>65</b> and supplied to the FPGA <b>74</b> through the FPGA <b>64</b>.

Equally divided sets of the position information are correlated with the same number of jumped thumbnail pictures. Instead, the size of a set of position information may be reversely proportional to the distance from the position information &#x201c;STILL&#x201d;. For example, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, the position information &#x201c;+1&#x201d; to &#x201c;+3&#x201d; are correlated with the number of jumped thumbnail pictures &#x201c;+1&#x201d;.

<p id="p-0295" num="0319">In addition, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the position information may be coarsely assigned corresponding to the number of jumped thumbnail pictures.

<p id="h-0034" num="0000">6-1. Outline of Reproduction Control by Another Method</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0321">In the foregoing example, when the reproduction operation for video data is controlled using the search bar <b>30</b>, reproduction speed information corresponding to the position that the user's finger has touched on the search bar <b>30</b> is output. The output method of the reproduction speed information corresponding to the position detection output of the search bar <b>30</b> is not limited to that example. In other words, reproduction speed information may be output corresponding to the moving speed of the user's finger when it horizontally moves while it keeps touching the search bar <b>30</b>. In the following description, the operation &#x201c;the user's finger moves while it keeps touching the search bar <b>30</b>&#x201d; is referred to as &#x201c;trace&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0322">Next, the method of outputting the reproduction speed information corresponding to the moving speed of the user's finger when it traces the search bar <b>30</b> will be described. The moving speed of the user's finger when it traces the search bar <b>30</b> is obtained with the position and time at which the user's finger has touched the search bar <b>30</b> and the position at which the user's finger has touched after a predetermined time period has elapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0323">In addition, corresponding to the obtained moving speed, the operation mode of the reproduction stop process performed when the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b> is decided. For the moving speed at which the user's finger has been just released from the search bar <b>30</b>, a first threshold value is designated.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0324">If the moving speed at which the user's finger has been just released from the search bar <b>30</b> is lower than the first threshold value, the still stop mode is performed. In the still stop mode, while a frame is being reproduced, when the user's finger is released from the search bar <b>30</b>, the still reproduction operation for the frame is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0325">If the moving speed at which the user's finger has been just released from the search bar <b>30</b> exceeds the first threshold value, the flywheel stop mode is performed. In the flywheel stop mode, when the user's finger is released from the search bar <b>30</b>, the reproduction speed is gradually decreased and after a predetermined time period has elapsed, the still reproduction operation is performed. In other words, in the flywheel stop mode, for a predetermined time period after the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b>, the reproduction operation is performed with negative acceleration. More specifically, in the flywheel stop mode, while the reproduction operation is being performed, when the user's finger is released from the search bar <b>30</b>, the reproduction speed is gradually decreased. After a predetermined time period has elapsed, the reproduction operation is performed at 0 reproduction speed, namely the still reproduction operation is performed. The deceleration is for example [&#x2212;one-time speed]/sec. In other words, when the reproduction operation is being performed at five-time reproduction speed, the reproduction speed is decreased in five seconds. Thereafter, the still reproduction operation is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0326">For the moving speed at which the user's finger is tracing the search bar <b>30</b>, a second threshold value can be designated. When the moving speed at which the user's finger is tracing exceeds the second threshold value, the reproduction operation is performed at a predetermined fixed speed higher than one-time reproduction speed (for example, five-time reproduction speed).</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0327">The speed that is designated as the second threshold value is higher than the speed that is designated as the first threshold value. For example, the first threshold value is around 0.5 cm/1 sec, whereas the second threshold value is around 5 cm/0.2 sec.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0328">Of course, the reproduction direction is correlated with the tracing direction. When the search bar <b>30</b> is traced rightward, the reproduction operation is performed in the forward direction. When the search bar <b>30</b> is traced leftward, the reproduction operation is performed in the reverse direction.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0329">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, it is assumed that the search bar <b>30</b> is traced from the position corresponding to data value &#x201c;<b>80</b>&#x201d; on the search bar <b>30</b> (referred to as the position &#x201c;<b>80</b>&#x201d;) to the position corresponding to the data value &#x201c;<b>200</b>&#x201d; (referred to as the position &#x201c;<b>200</b>&#x201d;). While the search bar <b>30</b> is being traced from the position &#x201c;<b>80</b>&#x201d; to the position &#x201c;<b>200</b>&#x201d;, the reproduction speed is stepwise or gradually varied from the frame reproduction operation to a high speed reproduction operation for example five-time speed reproduction operation corresponding to the speed at which the user's finger traces the search bar <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0330">When the user's finger has traced up to the position &#x201c;<b>200</b>&#x201d; and has been released from the search bar <b>30</b>, if the moving speed at which the user's finger has been just released from the search bar <b>30</b> is smaller than the first threshold value, the reproduction stop operation is performed in the still stop mode. The still reproduction operation is performed for the frame corresponding to the position &#x201c;<b>200</b>&#x201d; from which the user's finger has been released.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0331">On the other hand, when the user's finger has traced up to the position &#x201c;<b>200</b>&#x201d; and released from the search bar <b>30</b>, if the moving speed at which the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b> is larger than the first threshold value, the reproduction stop operation is performed in the flywheel stop mode. The reproduction speed is decreased from the reproduction speed at which the user's finger has traced the position &#x201c;<b>200</b>&#x201d; for a predetermined time period. After a predetermined time period has elapsed from the position &#x201c;<b>200</b>&#x201d; that the user's finger has traced, the reproduction operation is stopped. Thereafter, the still reproduction operation is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0332">In such a manner, corresponding to the moving speed of the user's finger on the search bar <b>30</b> immediately before the user's finger has been just released from the search bar <b>30</b>, the stop mode is switched between the still stop mode and the flywheel stop mode. Thus, as if the user manually moved a film, he or she can search for his or her desired frame.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0333">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> where the reproduction operation is performed in the forward direction, when the user's finger is released from the search bar <b>30</b> at the position &#x201c;<b>200</b>&#x201d;, if the user releases his or her finger from the search bar <b>30</b> while moving his or her finger rightward, the reproduction stop operation is performed in the flywheel stop mode. In the flywheel stop mode, while the reproduction speed is gradually decreased, the reproduction operation is continued. After a predetermined time period has elapsed, the still reproduction operation is performed at 0 reproduction speed. When the user's finger is released from the search bar <b>30</b>, if he or she temporarily stops his or her finger at the position &#x201c;<b>200</b>&#x201d;, the reproduction stop operation is performed in the still stop mode.</p>

<p id="p-0311" num="0335">When it has been detected that the user's finger has touched the search bar <b>30</b> at step S<b>30</b>, the flow advances to step S<b>31</b>. At step S<b>31</b>, position P<sub>1 </sub>that the user's finger has touched on the search bar <b>30</b> is detected. The position P<sub>1 </sub>is detected as digital data that are output from for example the search bar <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0336">When the position that the user's finger has touched has been detected, the flow advances to step S<b>32</b>. At step S<b>32</b>, it is determined whether the user's finger be touching the search bar <b>30</b>. When the determined result denotes that the user's finger is touching the search bar <b>30</b>, the flow advances to step S<b>33</b>. At step S<b>33</b>, it is determined whether a unit time period &#x394;T has elapsed after the position has been detected at step S<b>31</b> or step S<b>34</b> that will be described later. When the determined result denotes that the unit time period &#x394;T has elapsed, the flow returns to step S<b>32</b>. The unit time period &#x394;T is for example in the range from several milliseconds to several ten milliseconds.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0337">When the determined result at step S<b>33</b> denotes that the unit time period &#x394;T has elapsed after the former position has detected, the flow advances to step S<b>34</b>. At step S<b>34</b>, position P<sub>2 </sub>at which the user's finger has touched the search bar <b>30</b> is detected. Thereafter, the flow advances to step S<b>35</b>. At step S<b>35</b>, speed S<sub>1 </sub>at which the user's finger traces the search bar <b>30</b> is calculated by the following formula (1).
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>S</i><sub>1</sub>=(<i>P</i><sub>2</sub><i>&#x2212;P</i><sub>1</sub>)/&#x394;<i>T</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0338">When the speed S<sub>1 </sub>has been calculated at step S<b>35</b>, the flow advances to step S<b>36</b>. At step S<b>36</b>, the reproduction speed is designated corresponding to the calculated speed S<sub>1</sub>. When the absolute value of the speed S<sub>1 </sub>is equal to or lower than the second threshold value, the reproduction speed corresponding to the speed S<sub>1 </sub>is designated. When the absolute value of the speed S<b>1</b> exceeds the second threshold value, a fixed reproduction speed, for example five-time reproduction speed, is designated. Thereafter, the flow advances to step S<b>37</b>. At step S<b>37</b>, a reproduction control signal is generated corresponding to the designated reproduction speed and supplied to the system controller <b>45</b>. When the speed S<sub>1 </sub>is a positive value, it denotes the reproduction operation in the forward direction. When the speed S<sub>1 </sub>is a negative value, it denotes the reproduction operation in the reverse direction. When the reproduction control signal is generated, the flow returns to step S<b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0339">In contrast, when the determined result at step S<b>32</b> denotes that the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b>, the flow advances to step S<b>38</b>. At step S<b>38</b>, position P<sub>3 </sub>at which the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b> is detected. Thereafter, the flow advances to step S<b>39</b>. At step S<b>39</b>, speed S<sub>2 </sub>at which the user's finger has traced the search bar <b>30</b> immediately before the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b> is calculated by the following formula (2).
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>S</i><sub>2</sub>=(<i>P</i><sub>3</sub><i>&#x2212;P</i><sub>2</sub>)/&#x394;<i>T</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(2)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0340">At step S<b>40</b>, the operation mode of the reproduction stop process is decided corresponding to the speed S<sub>2</sub>. The speed S<sub>2 </sub>is compared with the first threshold value. When the determined result denotes that the speed S<sub>2 </sub>is smaller than the first threshold value, the reproduction stop process is performed in the still stop mode. In contrast, when the determined result denotes that the speed S<sub>2 </sub>is larger than the first threshold value, the reproduction stop process is performed in the flywheel stop mode.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0341">In the foregoing example, when the user's finger is released from the search bar <b>30</b>, the stop process is performed corresponding to the moving speed at which the user's finger has traced the search bar <b>30</b>. However, this embodiment is not limited to this example. In other words, the distance for which the user's finger has touched and traced the search bar <b>30</b> and has been released from it is used. Corresponding to the moving distance and the moving speed, the reproduction stop process performed when the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b> can be controlled. The distance for which the user's finger has touched and traced the search bar <b>30</b> and has been released from it is the distance for which the moving speed of the user's finger on the search bar <b>30</b> is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0342">For the moving distance, a third threshold value is designated. When the moving distance for which the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b> exceeds the third threshold value and the speed S<sub>2 </sub>at which the user's finger has been released from the search bar <b>30</b> exceeds the first threshold value, the reproduction stop process is performed in the flywheel stop mode. In contrast, when the moving distance does not exceed the third threshold value or the speed S<sub>2 </sub>does not exceed the first threshold value, the reproduction stop process is performed in the still stop mode.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0343">More specifically, corresponding to the position P<sub>3 </sub>detected at step S<b>38</b> and the position P<sub>1 </sub>detected at step S<b>31</b> of the foregoing flow chart, the moving distance D for which the user's finger has moved is obtained. It is determined whether the moving distance D exceeds the third threshold value and whether the speed S<sub>2 </sub>calculated at step S<b>39</b> exceeds the first threshold value. Corresponding to the determined results, the operation mode of the reproduction stop process is decided.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0344">In the example of which the reproduction control is performed corresponding to the speed at which the user's finger has traced the search bar <b>30</b>, an LED at which the user's finger has touched the search bar <b>30</b> and LEDs adjacent thereto can be turned on.</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">7. Others</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0345">In the foregoing examples, the record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention uses the optical disc <b>5</b> as the record medium. However, an embodiment of the present invention is not limited to this example. In other words, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, an embodiment of the present invention can be applied to a record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b>&#x2032; that uses a magnetic tape <b>500</b> as a record medium.

<p id="p-0322" num="0346">Main AV data and sub AV data that are output from a signal process section <b>3</b> are supplied to a drive section <b>400</b>. The drive section <b>400</b> maps data so that main AV data and sub AV data for one frame are placed on a predetermined number of tracks. Predetermined processes such as an error correction code encoding process are performed for the mapped data. As a result, record data are obtained. The record data are modulated in a predetermined manner. As a result, a record signal is obtained. The record signal is recorded on helical tracks formed on a magnetic tape by a rotation head (not shown). When data are reproduced, a signal is reproduced as a reproduction signal from the magnetic tape <b>500</b>. The reproduction signal is demodulated and reproduction data are obtained. Predetermined processes such as an error correction code decode process are performed for the reproduction data. As a result, main AV data and sub AV data are reproduced. Corresponding to the reproduced sub AV data, thumbnail pictures displayed on a thumbnail search screen <b>230</b> and a detailed thumbnail search screens <b>230</b>A and <b>230</b>B are generated.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0347">In addition, as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>, an embodiment of the present invention can be applied to a record and reproduction apparatus <b>1</b>&#x2033; that uses a semiconductor memory <b>501</b> as a record medium.
