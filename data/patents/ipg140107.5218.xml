<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The technology of the present application relates generally to devices to inhibit a surgical patient's bite during surgical operations and, more particularly, to a resilient bite block for placement in a mouth with at least one electrode access bore to facilitate placing an electrode in the tongue of a patient for intraoperative monitoring (IOM) during the surgical operations.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The tongue is a muscle that has its movement stimulated by nerves such as, for example, the XIIth Cranial Nerve hypoglossal nerve. The movement of the tongue is useful in swallowing and making sounds associated with speech among other things. Thus, damage to the nerves associated with the control of the tongue is potentially severe as it may inhibit a person's ability to eat and speak. Moreover, bite block inhibits the ability of the person to bite the tongue and inhibits potential tooth and/or jaw damage associated with severe clamping of the jaws after transcranial electrical stimulation for motor evoked potentials. To monitor for potential damage to the nerves associated with the tongue's muscle control, a bipolar or monopolar recording electrode is placed about the tongue. The tongue is activated when the XIIth CN is mechanically or electrically stimulated during the surgical intervention. The recording electrodes in the tongue are used to record the electromyelographic response of the activated muscles in the tongue.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As can be appreciated, the electrodes are placed by a trained technician locating the electrodes on the tongue. To do this, the technician opens the mouth of a patient and places an electrode. For example, the technician may advance a needle electrode into the tongue until the electrode is proximate the muscle the electrode will record. The mouth is often propped open using an object in the mouth generally known as a bite block. The bite block is positioned between the teeth of a patient to inhibit the mouth from closing. Wires from the electrode are connected to an amplifier as is common in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The bite block often if formed of a hard plastic material. The hard plastic material may in some instances cause injury to the teeth of the patient, such as, for example, a chipped or cracked tooth. Also, the bite block occupies a portion of the patient's mouth and can make placement of the recording electrode difficult. Moreover, the bite block takes up a significant volume in the patient's mouth that may hinder placement of the needle electrode in certain cases.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, against this background, it would be desirous to provide an improved bite block that would be less likely to injury the teeth of the patient as well as facilitate rather than hinder placement of the recording electrode.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Embodiments disclosed herein address the above stated needs by providing a bite block adapted for use during intraoperative monitoring of nerves associated with the mouth or tongue of a patient. The bite block includes a resilient left portion having an inside face and an outside face separated by a width, a front face and a back face separated by a depth, and a top face and a bottom face separated by a height as well as a resilient right portion having an inside face and an outside face separated by a width, a front face and a back face separated by a depth, and a top face and a bottom face separated by a height. The resilient left and right portions are connected by a flexible bridge adapted to extend across at least a portion of a mouth of a patient. An access port resides in at least one of the resilient left portion or the resilient right portion, the access port having a first opening and a second opening residing in the inside face formed opposite the first opening and forming a through bore in the at least one of the resilient left portion or the resilient right portion from the first opening to the second opening, the first opening being arranged a first distance from the top face and the second opening being arranged a second distance from the top face where the second distance is greater than the first distance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Embodiments disclosed herein address the above stated needs by providing a method for using a bite block adapted for use during intraoperative monitoring of nerves associated with the mouth or tongue of a patient. The procedure includes placing the bite block in the mouth of the patient. In some cases, the placement includes arranging a tab associated with the bridge of the bite block to cause the tongue of the patient to bulge. An electrode is then placed through a bore in the bite block until the electrode is properly placed for intraoperative monitoring of the XIIth Cranial Nerve hypoglossal nerve.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The technology of the present application will now be described with reference to the attached <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref>. While the technology of the present application is described with reference to a bite block useful for measuring the CN XII&#x2014;Hypoglossal Nerve&#x2014;during intraoperative monitoring (IOM) associated with certain surgical procedures, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize on reading the disclosure that the bite block may be useful for facilitating separation of the mouth in procedures where teeth may be injured, chipped, cracked or the like. Additionally, while the technology of the present application is described with regards to advancing a needle electrode or the like, other electrodes and other instruments that require specific placement in the mouth may benefit from the technology of the present application. Moreover, the technology of the present application will be described with reference to particular exemplary embodiments. The word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean &#x201c;serving as an example, instance, or illustration.&#x201d; Any embodiment described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments unless specifically indicated as such. Thus, the examples provided should be considered illustrative of the technology of the present application and not limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, anatomy associated with the tongue is provided. In particular, the hypoglossal nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve [CN XII] leading to the tongue. It supplies motor signals to a majority of the muscles of the tongue. Thus, the hypoglossal nerve facilitates functions such as swallowing, chewing, speech, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As explained above, IOM of the hypoglossal nerve may be used in certain surgeries to alert surgeons to potential issues or damage to the nerve, which may inhibit muscle function of the tongue. Some surgeries that may benefit from monitoring of the hypoglossal nerve include, for example, surgery relating to brainstem tumors, brainstem cavernous malformations, brainstem aneurysms and other surgical procedures in which the hypoglossal nerve may be inadvertently damaged such as common carotid artery or internal jugular vein lesions where the hypoglossal nerve may be at risk to name but a few.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a bite block <b>10</b> consistent with the technology of the present application is shown. The bite block <b>10</b> is shown with left and right portions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> generally rectangular in shape, although the shape is optional. The left and right portions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> have a width W, a depth D, and a height H as shown. Although shown as symmetrical, the left and right portions do not need to be shaped the same.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The height H is generally chosen as appropriate to keep the mouth of the patient open. The width W is typically the approximate width of a tooth, such as, for example, a molar, an incisor, or the like depending on placement. Typically the width W would be slightly larger than a tooth to facilitate placement. The depth D is typically approximately the depth of a single tooth, but may be longer than one tooth and may bridge several teeth. Width W generally separates an inside face <b>1</b> and an outside face <b>2</b>. Depth D generally separates a front face <b>3</b> and a back face <b>4</b>. Height H generally separates a top face <b>5</b> and a bottom face <b>6</b>. As mentioned above, while generally described as rectangular, the left and right portions may be any shape including circular, elliptical, polygonal, or random shapes such that the faces may be a relatively flat sidewall as shown, curved portions of the device, or potentially multifaceted.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The left and right portions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may be separate pieces that function in cooperation with each other or connected by bridge <b>16</b> as shown. It is believed a bridge <b>16</b> would facilitate placement of the bite block <b>10</b> by the anesthesiologist, surgeon, nurse, or other O.R. personnel. The bridge <b>16</b> may be integrated to each portion <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> such that the bite block <b>10</b> functions as a single unit. The bridge <b>16</b> is shown as being flat across from the left and right portions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Optionally, bridge <b>16</b> may be shaped to conform to the roof of the patient's mouth. Alternatively, bridge <b>16</b> may be shaped to hold the tongue in a desired position. In certain embodiments, a tab <b>16</b><i>t </i>may be associated with the bridge <b>16</b> to hold the tongue down so that the sides of the tongue bulge, which makes the tongue taut. The bulging and tautness of the tongue is beneficial for puncturing the tongue with the electrode. Tab <b>16</b><i>t </i>(only shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for convenience) may be located proximate one or the other of the left and right portions to facilitate bulging of the tongue. Moreover, the tab <b>16</b><i>t </i>may be modular and removable such that the tab <b>16</b><i>t </i>may be removed after the placement of an electrode. Also, while only one tab <b>16</b><i>t </i>is shown, the tabs may be on one or both sides of the bridge <b>16</b>. In still other embodiments, the tab <b>16</b><i>t </i>may extend off of one or both of the resilient left and right portions. The bridge <b>16</b> may be a flexible material such as a plastic or composite strap, thong, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, both the left and right portions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> have an access bore <b>20</b>. Access bores <b>20</b> are sized to fit a needle electrode <b>22</b> snuggly, but slidingly. Needle electrode <b>22</b> is slidingly advanced into and through access bore <b>20</b> until the needle electrode <b>22</b> is properly inserted into the tongue of the patient. To facilitate placement, the needle electrode <b>22</b> may incorporate a stop <b>24</b> that abuts left or right portion <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> to stop advancement of the needle electrode <b>22</b> when it is properly inserted. As shown, needle electrode <b>22</b> has a flared stop <b>24</b> that forms a friction fit with access bore <b>20</b> to positively stop needle electrode <b>22</b> and hold the needle electrode <b>22</b> in place until it is removed by the surgeon. The leads <b>26</b> extend from stop <b>24</b>. Access bore <b>20</b> may be substantially cylindrical in shape as shown. Alternatively, access bore <b>20</b> may be conical to cooperatively engage stop <b>24</b>. As will be explained further below, access bore <b>20</b> is a through bore extending from a first opening <b>21</b> on outside face <b>2</b> that is a first distance I&#x2032; from the top face <b>5</b> to a second opening <b>23</b> on inside face <b>1</b> that is a second distance I&#x2033; from the top face <b>5</b>. The second distance I&#x2033; is greater than first distance I&#x2032; such that the access bore <b>20</b> forms an angle with a plane defined by the tongue as explained further below.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In still other embodiments, access bore <b>20</b> may be located in a countersunk bore <b>28</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Countersunk bore <b>28</b> has a base or shoulder <b>30</b> and sidewalls <b>32</b> defining a recess <b>34</b>. Stop <b>24</b> may be sized and shaped to fit within recess <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The reason for including the CV XII nerve monitor holes is for procedures in which nerve/muscle monitoring is desirous, such as, for example, when there is a low brainstem tumor or other lesion in which that cranial nerve is at risk. Because transcranial electric motor evoked potentials are needed for these types of procedures, a bite block is typically used and often necessary to inhibit tooth and jaw damage due to the clenching described above. Providing a bite block that facilitates electrode placement and electrode securing is one of several advantages of the present technology.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Bite block <b>10</b> may be formed of a variety of materials including, for example, metals, metal alloys, plastics, composites, polymers, gels or the like. Preferably bite block <b>10</b> would be formed of a resilient material, such as, for example, a silicone gel, an ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA), or the like. Forming the bite block <b>10</b> out of a resilient material would inhibit damage to one or more teeth. In particular, the mouth may constrict, contract, or close abruptly during surgery, which is one of the reasons bite blocks are used. Providing the bite block <b>10</b> out of an inelastic or rigid material, such as a metal, may cause injury to one or more teeth as the rigid material may chip, crack, or break the tooth. The bite block <b>10</b> should be sufficiently capable of holding a shape, however, such that constriction, contraction, or closing of the mouth does not move the electrode <b>22</b> or cause the electrode <b>22</b> to be removed or moved from it desired location. In some cases, bite block <b>10</b> may have an outer skin or membrane <b>9</b> forming the desired shape of bite block <b>10</b> such that a soft filler material <b>11</b> may be used in the volume defined by the skin <b>9</b>. However, it other cases, bite block <b>10</b> may be molded from a plastic, composite or gel.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, a top plan view of the electrode <b>22</b> extending through the portion <b>14</b> of the bite block <b>10</b> into a tongue <b>40</b> of a patient is provided. As shown, electrode <b>22</b> extend through access bore <b>20</b> extending between the outside face <b>2</b> and the inside face <b>1</b> of the portion <b>14</b>. It may be difficult in certain patient anatomy to arrange the bite block <b>10</b> to allow the electrode <b>22</b> to extend laterally as shown. Instead of traveling straight across portion <b>14</b>, access bore may have be located in a first location <b>42</b> in the outside face <b>2</b> and a second location <b>44</b> in the inside face such that the first location <b>42</b> is anterior or forward of the second location as shown by the access bore <b>20</b> in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the access bore <b>20</b> may be arranged between the front face <b>3</b> and the inside face <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a side elevation view of electrode <b>22</b> extending through the portion <b>14</b> is provided. Access bore <b>20</b> is shown as extending from the outside face <b>2</b> to the inside face <b>1</b>, but alternative arrangements are possible as explained above. The access bore <b>20</b> is arranged in portion <b>14</b> such that the bore <b>20</b> at the outside face <b>2</b> is closer to the top face <b>5</b> than the bore <b>20</b> at the inside face <b>1</b>. This provides for the electrode <b>22</b> to exit access bore <b>20</b> and approach the tongue at an angle &#x3b1; with respect to a plane <b>50</b> shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The angle &#x3b1; facilitates insertion of electrode <b>22</b> to the appropriate position in the tongue <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>B, and <b>5</b> expressly show portion <b>14</b>, it should be appreciated that portion <b>12</b> may have similar features. While in some situations, a needle electrode <b>22</b> will be inserted through one of the left or right portions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, in some cases a needle electrode <b>22</b> will be inserted through both of the left and right portions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the bite blocks <b>60</b> and <b>70</b> are provided. Similar to bite block <b>10</b>, the bite block <b>60</b> has the left and right portions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> connected by a bridge <b>16</b>, which is shown as being adapted to cooperatively engage the roof of a patient's mount in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. As shown, each of the left and right portions <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> as inside and outside extensions or protrusions <b>62</b> forming a channel or groove <b>64</b>. The grooves <b>64</b> would be sized such that one or more teeth would fit within groove <b>64</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the bite block <b>70</b> may be provided with a cavity <b>72</b> to substantially encompass the crown of a tooth. Grooves <b>64</b> and cavities <b>72</b> are provided to more securely retain the bite blocks in place.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In use, the bite block <b>10</b>, <b>60</b>, or <b>70</b> would facilitate insertion of an electrode into a tongue of a patient for IOM. After opening the mouth and angling the head to the desired surgical position, the bite block would be placed by the anesthesiologist, surgeon, nurse, or other O.R. personnel. Once placed, the anesthesiologist, surgeon, nurse, or other O.R. personnel would align an electrode with the access port. The electrode would be slidingly advanced through the access port until it contacts and pierces the tongue of the patient. The electrode would be advanced into the tongue until it is properly positioned to record electromyelographic responses from the CN XII nerve or the like. Notice that the electrodes may be used on one or both sides of the tongue of the patient.</p>
