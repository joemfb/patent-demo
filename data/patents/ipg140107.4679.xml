<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Many organizations use teleconferences to communicate information between parts of the organization. A common problem experienced with teleconferences is poor audio quality. Determining the causes of poor audio quality during a teleconference can be difficult. Further, the audio quality problems can also be difficult to troubleshoot after the teleconference because the problem may not persist. Often, the problems in the teleconference are due to the configuration of the surrounding network environment or the end user's system or configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Teleconferences are often conducted with a system called a conference bridge. Conference bridges may be manually reconfigured during a conference, but this method to address audio quality problems is haphazard and laborious. Further, if the conference bridge is not the problem, it may be difficult to determine what other system is the cause of the problem. The conference participants may attempt to adjust the teleconference by muting some participants or setting a mode in the teleconference to better optimize the conference's performance. However, these user-made adjustments can embarrass participants or lead to wasted time as the conference is adjusted rather than participated in.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There is no current solution that allows for a conference bridge to self-analyze historical statistics and identify the cause of poor audio in conferences and self-configure to work around the problem. Analyzed data can include network delay, packet loss, jitter buffer statistics, etc. If the problem cannot be resolved by self-configuration, the conference bridge may be able to send an alert to the system administrator to have manual help in fixing the problem.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The embodiments presented herein provide an automated system for recording, providing, or acting on quality measures and/or configuration information in a conference. A conference bridge can record quality and configuration for a conference in a historical data database. Upon receiving a complaint or information about a quality problem in a subsequent conference, the conference bridge can access the historical information to help diagnose or automatically correct the quality issue.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This idea proposes a conference diagnosis system which can correlate available information about the conference and/or past conferences and make an intelligent assessment as to the potential cause of a poor audio condition. The conference bridge can then change various configuration settings on the conference bridge to resolve the problem. A running average of the results of past adjustments can be measured and direct configuration changes. Thus, past successful adjustments can provide a starting point for changes to a new conference and real-time digital signal processing (DSP) adjustments can help tailor changes to the specific conference.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This automated system can alleviate an administrator from making manual adjustments. The aim of the system is to use past information to resolve issues that are caused by a configuration of the conference bridge itself or by a configuration of the surrounding network infrastructure. Quality changes (whether improvements or degradations) associated with subsequent adjustments to a conference call can be measured and taken into account. In effect, the conference bridge may intelligently adapt to the environment in which the conference bridge is deployed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Statistics used to diagnose the problem will include network delay, packet loss, jitter buffer statistics, time of day, average load, current load, processor load, memory usage, and the like. Additionally, neural networks could be used by the conference bridge to &#x201c;learn&#x201d; over time how to better solve such problems within the specific environment that it is deployed in.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The ensuing description provides embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability, or configuration of the claims. Rather, the ensuing description will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing the embodiments. It being understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A system <b>100</b> for conducting a conference is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The system <b>100</b> can conduct a conference using one of several configurations. The configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is only one example of the several configurations, but the configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be used to explain the systems and methods described hereinafter. The system <b>100</b> may be conducting a conference between two communication endpoints, <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b</i>, with a single conference bridge <b>114</b>. The conference can include two or more conference bridges and more or fewer communication endpoints <b>102</b> than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as represented by ellipses <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">To configure the conference, the communication endpoints <b>102</b> may communicate through a PBX <b>106</b> to the conference bridge <b>114</b>. The PBX <b>106</b> can be any PBX as known in the art to establish or allow communications for one or more communication endpoints <b>102</b>. The PBX <b>106</b> may communicate with the first gateway <b>108</b><i>a</i>. Similar to the PBX <b>106</b>, the gateway <b>108</b><i>a </i>can be any gateway as known in the art to establish communications through or into a network <b>110</b>. The network <b>110</b> can be any network known in the art that allows communications associated with the conference.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Communications from the network <b>110</b> can be received at a second gateway <b>108</b><i>b </i>that is associated with the conference bridge <b>114</b>. The second gateway <b>108</b><i>b </i>can be similar to the first gateway <b>108</b><i>a </i>and operable to receive or send data and communications through the network <b>110</b>. The gateway <b>108</b><i>b </i>can be in communication with another network <b>112</b>, such as a LAN, which then can interface or communicate with the conference bridge <b>114</b>. The system components (e.g., PBX <b>106</b>, gateway <b>1</b> <b>108</b><i>a</i>, network <b>110</b>, gateway <b>2</b> <b>108</b><i>b </i>and/or LAN <b>112</b>) show one type of configuration for a conference, but other configurations are possible and contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An embodiment of a conference bridge <b>114</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The conference bridge <b>114</b> can include one or more modules, which may be hardware, software, or a combination of hardware and software. For ease of description, the modules will be described as being software components that are in communication with each other to send and receive data amongst the different modules.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The conference bridge <b>114</b> can include a conference engine <b>202</b>. The conference engine <b>202</b> is operable to establish and conduct one or more conferences, for example, conference <b>1</b> <b>204</b><i>a </i>and conference <b>2</b> <b>204</b><i>b</i>. The conference engine <b>202</b> is operable to conduct more or fewer conferences than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, as represented by ellipses <b>206</b>. The conference engine <b>202</b> can conglomerate the communications from the two or more communication endpoints <b>102</b> into the conference <b>204</b> for provision to all endpoints <b>102</b>. Thus, the conference engine <b>202</b> can receive conference information <b>218</b> and broadcast the conference information <b>218</b> to the other participants in the conference <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The conference engine <b>202</b> also can be in communication with one or more other modules, such as a data collection module <b>208</b>, quality measurement module <b>210</b>, and/or configuration model <b>212</b>. The data collection module <b>208</b> can monitor the one or more ongoing conferences <b>204</b> to determine the audio quality of the signals being received and sent by the conference engine <b>202</b>. The data collection module <b>208</b> can measure data associated with the conferences <b>204</b> to determine one or more quality measures as will be described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. Thus, as the conference <b>204</b> is ongoing the quality measures may be recorded and stored in a historical data database <b>214</b>. Further, the data collection module <b>208</b> may also collect information about the configuration of the conference <b>204</b>. Thus, the data collection module <b>208</b> can collect information about the different configuration characteristics as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. The conference information may also be stored in the historical data database <b>214</b> with the quality characteristics. As such, the data collection module <b>208</b> is operable to provide data and other types of information for diagnosing problems in conferences <b>204</b> or in optimizing the configuration of conferences.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The historical data database <b>214</b> can be any database or data store as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. The historical data database <b>214</b> can store information regarding conferences <b>204</b> and provide that information in the future or in real-time to help insure that the conferences <b>204</b> are conducted in the best manner and have optimized audio quality.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A quality measurement module <b>210</b> may collect quality measurement data for the data collection module <b>208</b>. Thus, the quality measurement module <b>210</b> can determine the characteristics for each conference and provide that information to the data collection module <b>208</b>. The quality measurement module <b>210</b> can measure the quality characteristics as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The configuration module <b>212</b> is operable to provide configuration information to the data collection module <b>208</b>. Thus, the configuration module <b>212</b> can determine the characteristics of the configuration, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3C</figref>. The data collection module <b>208</b> can receive the information from the configuration module <b>212</b> to store in the historical data database <b>214</b>. In other embodiments, configuration module <b>212</b> can also change or adjust a configuration of a conference <b>204</b> during the conference. For example, the configuration module <b>212</b> can receive a signal from the data collection module <b>208</b> or the quality measurement module <b>210</b> that indicates that there is a quality issue with the conference <b>204</b>. The configuration module <b>212</b> may then access a best rules database <b>216</b> to determine how to adjust the conference configuration settings to improve the quality characteristics or to eliminate the problem experienced during the conference <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The configuration module <b>212</b> may also pre-configure a conference <b>204</b> based on historical information and upon receiving a conference request. Thus, the configuration module <b>212</b> can request historical information from the data collection module <b>208</b>. The configuration module <b>212</b> attempts to match the components provide d or configuration requested in the current conference request with successful configurations in the historical information. Based on the historical information, the configuration module <b>212</b> can instruct the conference engine <b>202</b> to configure the conference in a pre-determined manner to insure the best quality audio and/or video signal for the conference.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The best rules database <b>216</b> can be any database as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>. The best rules database <b>216</b> can store information on how to pre-configure or reconfigure a conference <b>204</b> based on historical information. The best rules database <b>216</b> can include one or more algorithms on how to adjust the configuration of a conference as will be described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Embodiments of database <b>300</b> can store one or more items of information associated with historical quality and configuration characteristics as described hereinafter and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, and <b>3</b>C. A historical data data structure <b>302</b>, as stored in a historical data database <b>214</b>, is shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The historical data data structure <b>302</b> can include a conference identifier <b>304</b>, conference quality measures <b>306</b>, and/or conference configuration information <b>308</b>. The historical data data structure <b>302</b> can include more or fewer items or data than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, as represented by ellipses <b>310</b>. The conference identifier <b>304</b> can be any identifier that can uniquely identify the conference <b>204</b> in relation to all other conferences conducted by the conference engine <b>202</b> or the conference bridge <b>114</b>. The conference identifier <b>304</b> can be a globally unique identifier (GUID), a security code for the conference <b>204</b>, a telephone number for the conference <b>204</b>, or some other identifier that is unique among conferences.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Conference quality measures <b>306</b> can be any measurement of quality of the conference <b>204</b>. The conference quality measures <b>306</b> may be recorded once or several times during the duration of the conference <b>204</b>. For example, the conference quality measures <b>306</b> may be measured periodically every minute during the conference <b>204</b> and stored such that the conference quality measures <b>306</b> have a date and time stamp and a series of quality measures, and have several iterations of these measures for each conference. In other embodiments, the conference quality measures <b>306</b> may be taken in response to an event, such as a complaint about the audio quality or a reconfiguration of the conference <b>204</b>. The quality measures may also be recorded when a user signals that the quality of the conference is good. An embodiment of conference quality measures <b>306</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The conference configuration data <b>308</b> can include any information about the configuration of the conference <b>204</b>. The configuration characteristics in the conference configuration data <b>308</b> can be recorded before the conference <b>204</b> begins, e.g., during the initial configuration of the conference <b>204</b>, and then during the conference upon any change to the conference configuration. In other embodiments, the conference configuration may be stored periodically, for example, every minute. An example of conference configuration data <b>308</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An embodiment of a conference quality measures data structure <b>312</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. The conference quality measures data structure <b>312</b> may have more or fewer sections for storing conference quality measures than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, as represented by ellipses <b>330</b>. The conference quality measures data structure <b>312</b> can include sections for delay <b>314</b>, packet loss <b>316</b>, jitter buffer statistics <b>318</b>, echo monitoring <b>320</b>, distortion <b>322</b>, interface measures <b>324</b>, gain control <b>326</b>, and/or signal to noise ratio <b>328</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Delay <b>314</b> can be any measure of the delay or timing of a data packet or other signal sent from a transmitting communication endpoint <b>102</b> to a receiving communication endpoint <b>102</b> or sending to or receiving from a conference bridge <b>114</b> during a conference. The measurement of and the types of delay that can be measured are generally known in the art. Packet loss <b>316</b> can be any measure of the number or types of data packets sent during a conference <b>204</b> that are lost during communication. Generally, the measurement of packet loss is known in the art. Delay <b>314</b> and packet loss <b>316</b> are generally regarded as measures of the quality of a digital data transmission. Other measures for quality of a digital data transmission can be stored within the conference quality measures data structure <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Jitter buffer statistics <b>318</b> can be any measure of jitter within the conference signal. Jitter can generally mean the fluctuation of one or more parameters of a signal. For example, jitter can measure the fluctuation of the frequency, amplitude, phase, or other parameter of a signal. Echo monitoring <b>320</b> can be any measure of echo within a signal. Echo generally occurs when a microphone receives a signal already transmitted and broadcast through a speaker at a conference site. The measurement of echo monitoring is generally known in the art. Distortion <b>322</b> can measure the degradation of a parameter of a signal. For example, distortion <b>322</b> can measure the degradation of the frequency or amplitude of a signal. Distortion <b>332</b> and the measurement of distortion <b>322</b> are generally known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The interface measures <b>324</b> can record any measurement of quality at an interface. For example, the conference bridge <b>114</b> may interface with a gateway <b>108</b><i>b</i>. A separate measurement program or system, at the gateway <b>108</b><i>b</i>, may measure the quality of the conference using one or more of the quality measures already described or other quality measures known in the art. Those one or more measures may be stored within the interface measure section <b>324</b>. As such, the conference quality measures <b>306</b> can have several sections of conference quality data measured at different points along the transmission path of the conference signal. These separate measurement points allow for the easier diagnosis of issues with conference quality.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The gain control section <b>326</b> can store measures of gain control. The measurement of gain and gain control <b>326</b> is generally known in the art. Gain control can be the measure of the amplitude of the signal and the loss of amplitude or change in the amplitude of the conference signal during transmission in the conference <b>204</b>. Signal to noise ratio <b>328</b> can measure signal to noise as known in the art. Generally, during the transmission of the signal in a conference <b>204</b>, interference or other types of electromagnetic processes can create noise in the conference signal. The signal to noise ratio <b>328</b> can measure the effects of those electromagnetic processes.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An embodiment of conference configuration information <b>322</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>. The conference configuration information <b>322</b> can include more or fewer sections than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, as represented by ellipses <b>360</b>. Each section can store information about the conference bridge <b>114</b> or one or more of the portions of the transmission path of the conference <b>204</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Some examples of information that may be stored in the conference configuration data structure <b>322</b> are a public switched telephone network (PSTN) identifier (ID) <b>334</b>, a gateway identifier <b>336</b>, a PBX identifier <b>338</b>, a caller identifier or Internet Protocol (IP) address <b>340</b>, a line identifier <b>342</b>, a location <b>344</b>, a communication endpoint <b>102</b> identifier <b>346</b>, a user group <b>348</b>, a coder or decoder identifier <b>350</b>, a subnet identifier <b>352</b>, a site identifier <b>356</b>, and/or an address base <b>358</b>. These different sections will be described briefly in turn.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The PSTN ID <b>334</b> can provide or store the ID, number, or some other information about the network <b>110</b> or one or more other networks that are used in the transmission path of the conference <b>204</b>. The PSTN ID <b>334</b> can store not only an identifier but the type or other information about the PSTN such as the provider, the location, the type of equipment that may be used in the PSTN, etc. PSTNs and the identification thereof are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The gateway ID <b>336</b> can identify the type and characteristics of one or more gateways in the transmission path of the conference <b>204</b>. For example, a gateway ID <b>336</b> can store information about gateway <b>1</b> <b>108</b><i>a </i>and/or gateway <b>2</b> <b>108</b><i>b</i>. Again, similar to the PSTN ID <b>334</b>, the gateway ID <b>336</b> can store an identity or information about the type and characteristics of the gateway <b>108</b>. Gateways and the identification thereof are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The PBX ID <b>338</b> can store information about the PBX <b>106</b> used in the conference <b>204</b>. The PBX ID <b>338</b> can store an identifier for the PBX and can store information about the configuration, type or operating configuration of the PBX <b>106</b>. A caller ID <b>340</b> can store an identifier of the user or communication endpoint <b>102</b>. For example, the caller ID can store a phone number for the communication endpoint <b>102</b> or an internal protocol (IP) address for the communication endpoint <b>102</b>. Further, the caller ID <b>340</b> can store information about the type or configuration of the communication endpoint <b>102</b>. The line ID <b>342</b> can store information about the line used in one or more of the PBX <b>106</b>, the network <b>110</b>, or some other connection in the transmission path shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thus, the PBX <b>106</b> or the network <b>110</b> can have two or more lines used for communication, and the line ID <b>342</b> can identify the lines being used by the PBX <b>106</b> or the network <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The location <b>344</b> can store the location of one or more of the components within the transmission path shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, the location <b>344</b> can store the location of the PBX <b>106</b>, the gateway <b>106</b>, the LAN <b>112</b>, or the network <b>110</b>. Further, the location <b>344</b> may store the location of one or more of the communication endpoints <b>102</b> or the location of the conference bridge <b>114</b>. The locations may be used to identify problems in certain geographical areas when communicating with certain sites in a conference <b>204</b>. The endpoint identifier <b>346</b> can be similar to the caller identifier <b>340</b>, in that the endpoint ID <b>346</b> can identify the communication endpoint <b>102</b>. The communication endpoint ID <b>346</b> can also include information about the communication endpoint <b>102</b> and may provide the same, supplemental, or different information on than caller ID <b>340</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The user group <b>348</b> can store information about a logical grouping for one or more of the communication endpoints <b>102</b> or other components in the transmission path shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, during digital communications, a communication endpoint <b>102</b> may be organized into a group of other communication endpoints <b>102</b> at a site; this grouping information may be recorded in the user group <b>348</b>. Thus, the user group information <b>348</b> can be used to identify problems with certain sites or groups of users that may be using similar technology or using similar systems when communicating in conferences <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">One or more coders or decoders may be used during the transmission of information during a conference <b>204</b>. The codec ID <b>350</b> can record an ID, type, other configuration information, or other characteristics of one or more codecs used in the conference transmission path shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The subnet ID <b>352</b> can store information about the logical organization of one or more of the components within a network <b>110</b> and/or transmission path. Thus, the subnet ID <b>352</b> can store the identifier or type of subnet being used in one or more networks <b>110</b> and/or transmission path for the one or more of the components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The site ID <b>356</b> is similar to the subnet ID <b>352</b> and can provide information about logical organization of one or more of the components within a network <b>110</b> and/or transmission path. Thus, the site ID <b>356</b> can record the site being used by one or more communication endpoints <b>102</b>. For example, in a conference call between New York and London, the conference <b>204</b> would include two site IDs <b>356</b>: a first ID for the New York site and a second ID for the London site. The address base <b>358</b> also can store information about the logical organization of the components within the network <b>110</b> and/or transmission path. The address base <b>358</b> can store the identifier, type, or other characteristics of the group of IP addresses used by one or more of the components in the transmission path shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">An embodiment for method <b>400</b> for automatically storing information about a conference <b>204</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Generally, the method <b>400</b> begins with a start operation <b>402</b> and terminates with an end operation <b>420</b>. While a general order for the steps of the method <b>400</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the method <b>400</b> can include more or fewer steps or arrange the order of the steps differently than those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The method <b>400</b> can be executed as a set of computer-executable instructions executed by a computer system and encoded or stored on a computer readable medium. Hereinafter, the method <b>400</b> shall be explained with reference to the systems, components, modules, data structures, user interfaces, etc. described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A conference bridge <b>114</b> receives a conference request, in step <b>404</b>. A communication endpoint <b>102</b> begins a conference <b>204</b> by sending a conference request to a conference bridge <b>114</b>. The conference request generally includes information about the type or initial configuration of a conference <b>204</b> to be executed by a conference engine <b>202</b> within the conference bridge <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The conference engine <b>202</b>, of the conference bridge <b>114</b>, can initiate the conference <b>204</b> by accessing historical information through a data collection module <b>208</b> and/or a configuration module <b>212</b>. The historical information stored in a historical database <b>214</b> can be used to pre-configure the conference <b>204</b> based on a historical best case, in step <b>406</b>. In embodiments, the conference engine <b>202</b> may communicate with a configuration module <b>212</b> to receive the pre-configuration parameters for the conference <b>204</b>. The configuration module <b>212</b> can access the historical data in the historical data database <b>214</b> or information in a best rule database <b>216</b> to determine, from past conferences with similar initial configurations, similar characteristics, and/or similar conference requests, which is the best configuration to begin the conference <b>204</b>. The conference engine <b>202</b> may then pre-configure the conference <b>204</b> based on this determined best case pre-configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The initial conference configuration may then be stored, in step <b>408</b>. Thus, the conference engine <b>202</b> can send the final configuration for the initial set-up of the conference <b>204</b> to the data collection module <b>208</b>, which can then store the initial conference configuration in the historical data database <b>214</b>. This configuration information can be as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At some time thereinafter, the conference engine <b>202</b> begins to execute or conduct the conference <b>204</b> for one or more communication endpoints <b>102</b>. As the conference <b>204</b> is being conducted, the conference engine <b>202</b> can provide quality measures to the data collection module <b>208</b> and/or the quality measurement module <b>210</b>. In embodiments, the quality measurement module <b>210</b> can measure or record the quality measures, such as those quality measure described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. The quality measurement module <b>210</b> may provide the measured quality parameters to the data collection module <b>208</b>. The data collection module <b>208</b> can then store the quality measures while the conference is being conducted, in step <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In embodiments, the data collection module <b>208</b> stores the quality measures in the historical data database <b>214</b> and associates those quality measures with the configuration information already recorded. Further, the data collection module <b>208</b> may store a quality measure periodically or after every change in one or more of the quality measures. For example, the data collection module <b>208</b> may store one or more quality measures every minute during the conference <b>204</b>. In other embodiments, the data collection module <b>208</b> will store the quality information if any change in the configuration of the conference <b>204</b> is made.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The conference engine <b>202</b> may change the configuration of the conference <b>204</b> during the conference <b>204</b>. The change in the configuration may be made to improve quality measures or may be made because of a change in how the conference <b>201</b> is being conducted. For example, one or more additional communication endpoints <b>102</b> may be added or dropped from the conference <b>204</b>. A new site may be added during the conference or some other type of change may be initiated by the users in the conference <b>204</b>. The data collection module <b>208</b> or configuration module <b>212</b> can determine if a new configuration is created during a conference <b>204</b>, in step <b>412</b>. Here, the conference engine <b>202</b> may provide a consistent stream of information about the configuration of the conference <b>204</b> to the configuration module <b>212</b> and/or the data collection module <b>208</b>. In other embodiments, the configuration module <b>212</b> or data collection module <b>208</b> can poll the conference engine <b>202</b> for information about a conference and compare the characteristics of the received information to past information already received about the conference <b>204</b>. If the data collection module <b>208</b> or configuration module <b>212</b> determines that a new configuration is created, step <b>412</b> proceeds YES to step <b>414</b>. However, if the data collection module <b>208</b> or configuration module <b>212</b> determine that no new configuration is created, step <b>412</b> can proceed NO to step <b>418</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In step <b>414</b>, the configuration module <b>212</b> can store the new configuration information or provide the new configuration information to the data collection module <b>208</b> to store in the historical data database <b>214</b>. As such, the data collection module <b>208</b> may record two or more configurations, similar to those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, during a single conference <b>204</b>. The two or more configurations may be stored with a single conference identifier <b>304</b> in the historical data database <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">After the new configuration is created, the quality measurement module <b>210</b> may record or measure new quality characteristics <b>312</b> for the data collection module <b>208</b>. The data collection module <b>208</b> may store these new quality measures in the historical data database <b>214</b>, in step <b>416</b>. The new quality measures may create new sets of quality measure data structures <b>312</b> in the historical data database <b>214</b> and associate those new sets of quality measure data structures <b>312</b> with the same conference identifier <b>304</b>. The procedures for recording the configuration and quality measures continue until the conference engine <b>202</b> ends the conference <b>204</b>. Upon ending the conference, the conference engine <b>202</b> sends information to the data collection module <b>208</b>. The data collection module <b>208</b> may then archive the recorded data in the historical data database <b>214</b>, in step <b>418</b>. Thus, this recordation of the final information makes a historical record in the historical data database <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">An embodiment of a method <b>500</b> for providing historical information to diagnose conference problems is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Generally, the method <b>500</b> begins with a start operation <b>502</b> and terminates with an end operation <b>514</b>. While a general order for the steps of the method <b>500</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the method <b>500</b> can include more or fewer steps or the order of the steps may be arranged differently than the method <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The method <b>500</b> can be a set of computer-executable instructions executed by a computer system or processor and/or encoded or stored on a computer readable medium. Hereinafter, the method <b>500</b> shall be explained with reference to the systems, components, modules, data structures, user interfaces, etc. described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The conference engine <b>202</b> can receive a request to diagnose a conference <b>204</b>, in step <b>504</b>. The request can be received from a communication endpoint <b>102</b> during a conference <b>204</b>. The request can be a signal that there is an issue with the configuration or signal quality, whether audio, video, or other signal, with the conference <b>204</b>. The conference engine <b>202</b> may send the request to diagnose the conference <b>204</b> to the data collection module <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The data collection module <b>208</b> can determine quality measures currently being recorded during the conference <b>204</b>, in step <b>506</b>. The data collection module <b>208</b> may request current quality measures from the quality measurement module <b>210</b> or may retrieve the current quality measures from the conference quality measures data structure <b>312</b> stored in the historical data database <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The data collection module <b>208</b> may then determine the configuration of the conference <b>204</b>, in step <b>508</b>. In embodiments, the data collection module <b>208</b> requests a configuration from the configuration module <b>212</b>. In other embodiments, the data collection module may request the current configuration from the conference engine <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">To determine the cause of the problem in the conference <b>202</b> or to provide pertinent data about the conference <b>204</b>, the data collection module <b>208</b> may then search historical data in the historical data database <b>214</b> for similar configuration and/or quality issues, in step <b>510</b>. The search of the historical data database <b>214</b> may search one or more quality characteristics in the quality measurement data structure <b>312</b> or one or more like configuration characteristics as stored in the configuration data structure <b>332</b>. The data collection module <b>208</b> may then make a determination of the similarity or a confidence interval for the likeness of the conference quality measures <b>213</b> and/or the configuration <b>332</b> between the historical data and the current conference <b>204</b>. Upon determining the most similar conference and/or quality measures in the historical data, the data collection module <b>208</b> may provide that historical information to a user or administrator, in step <b>512</b>. The data collection module <b>208</b> can provide the similar conference information in the historical data, for help in diagnosing the issues with current conference <b>204</b>, to the conference engine <b>202</b>, which then may broadcast or provide that information to one or more communication endpoints <b>102</b> that are currently engaged in the conference <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">An embodiment of a method <b>600</b> for automatically reconfiguring a conference <b>204</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Generally, the method <b>600</b> begins with a start operation <b>602</b> and terminates with an end operation <b>618</b>. While a general order for the steps of the method <b>600</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the method <b>600</b> can include more or fewer steps or the order of the steps may be arranged differently than the method <b>600</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The method <b>600</b> can be a set of computer-executable instructions executed by a computer system or processor and/or encoded or stored on a computer readable medium. Hereinafter, the method <b>600</b> shall be explained with reference to the systems, components, modules, data structures, user interfaces, etc. described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Similar to the method <b>500</b>, the conference engine <b>202</b> can receive a complaint about the quality of the signal or the performance of a conference <b>204</b>, in step <b>604</b>. Here, the conference engine <b>202</b> may receive the complaint by input by one or more communication endpoints <b>102</b> that are engaged in the conference <b>204</b>. The conference engine <b>202</b> can receive this complaint and send the complaint to the data collection module <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The data collection module <b>208</b> may then determine the configuration of the conference <b>204</b>, in step <b>606</b>. The data collection module <b>208</b> may request the current configuration from the conference engine <b>202</b> or may access conference configuration information in the conference configuration data structure <b>332</b>. Further, the data collection module <b>208</b> may determine the current quality measures, in step <b>608</b>. Here, the data collection module <b>208</b> may request the current quality measures from the quality measurement module <b>210</b> or may access the conference quality measures in the conference quality measures data structure <b>312</b> stored in the historical data database <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Also similar to method <b>500</b> described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the data collection module <b>208</b> may then access the historical data database <b>214</b> to search the historical data for similar conferences with similar configurations and/or quality issues, in step <b>610</b>. Thus, the data collection module <b>208</b> may compare one or more data items associated with the current conference in the conference quality measures data structure <b>312</b> or in the conference configuration information <b>332</b> with data items associated with historical data in other conference quality measures data structure <b>312</b> or other conference configuration data structure <b>332</b>. Various algorithms can be used to determine a likeness of the configuration or quality to the past historical data. For example, certain data may be rated more important than other data, and, as such, the data collection module <b>208</b> may attempt to find the nearest comparison with those more important data points. In other embodiments, the data collection module <b>208</b> may use a form of regression analysis or other methodical algorithm that can produce a confidence interval for how closely related the quality conference measures or the conference configuration are to the historical data.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Upon determining the historical data that is most pertinent to the current complaint, the data collection module <b>208</b> may send the information to the conference configuration module <b>212</b>. Unlike method <b>500</b> described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the conference module <b>212</b> may automatically adjust the configuration of the conference <b>204</b> rather than simply provide information to a user for the user to adjust the conference <b>204</b>. Here, the conference configuration module <b>212</b> can determine corrective measures, in step <b>612</b>. Corrective measures can be several different types of automated adjustments that can be made to the conference <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In one embodiment, the conference configuration module <b>212</b> may access a best rules database <b>216</b> to determine the best rules for modifying the conference configuration when encountering the type of quality problems in the current conference <b>204</b>. These best rules may be based on the historical data <b>214</b> and/or the information received from the data collection module <b>208</b>. A best rule may direct, for example, if a certain quality measure is out of normal range, to adjust a certain part of the configuration to correct that problem. The best rules may be in a hierarchal form where the first rule is completed, and then, if that does not work or newly read quality measures do not improve, the configuration module <b>212</b> executes a subordinate rule until the quality problem is eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In other embodiments, the configuration module <b>212</b> may use a type of artificial intelligence to learn from making minor changes to the conference configuration. Thus, the conference configuration module may adjust one of the conference configuration data points shown in the conference configuration data structure <b>332</b> and then determine a change to the quality measures stored in the conference quality measures data structure <b>312</b>. If an improvement is made, the conference configuration module <b>212</b> may continue to adjust that one parameter or may select other parameters to adjust. If the conference obtains a quality that is acceptable to the user or within a range considered to be &#x201c;good&#x201d;, then the conference configuration module <b>212</b> may stop the adjustments. These types of minor adjustments may be used then to change or modify the best rules database <b>216</b>, thus allowing the configuration module <b>212</b> to learn from the adjustments.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As corrective measures are made, the configuration module <b>212</b> can receive new conference quality measures from the quality measurement module <b>210</b> to determine if the quality measures have improved, in step <b>614</b>. The conference configuration module <b>212</b> can determine if the quality measures are within a certain range specified by a user or administrator or may ask the users if the conference has improved they wish to accept the changes. Thus, there are several methods for determining if the quality measures have improved contemplated by the embodiments presented herein. If the quality measures have improved, step <b>614</b> proceeds YES to step <b>16</b>. If the quality measures have not improved, step <b>614</b> proceeds NO to return to step <b>612</b> to continue to enact corrective measures. Once the quality measures have improved and the configuration is accepted, the configuration module <b>212</b> may send the configuration information back to the data collection module <b>208</b>. The data collection module <b>208</b> may then store the new configuration information and the new quality measures within the historical data database <b>214</b>, thus, creating more or addendums to the conference quality measures data structure <b>312</b> and the conference configuration data structure <b>322</b>.</p>
