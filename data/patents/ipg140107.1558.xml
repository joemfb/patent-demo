<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to art kits. More particularly, the invention relates to artwork kits containing forms having detachable components that can be customized by printing thereon using computer software and a printer to create user-customized works of art.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Forms featuring detachable components such as labels or business cards have been available for purchase by consumers. Likewise, art kits that include pre-printed scenes, paint, paint brushes, and instructions, such as paint-by-number kits, are available for purchase by consumers. Printing and imprinting on the customizable spaces of conventional printable forms may be accomplished using a home or office desktop printer. Printable and imprintable forms have not previously been combined with other materials and components to create artwork kits that involve the user and that permit the user to make customizations simultaneously with the creation of a work of art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">An artwork kit is provided that includes one sheet or a plurality of sheets of material that may be printed or imprinted upon using a printing device. The artwork kit can also include a substrate. Each sheet can include a single sheet or a plurality of sheets, each of which can include one or more detachable components. After printing or imprinting, the detachable components may be separated and attached to a substrate to create an artwork.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The sheet can be manufactured from paper, paperboard, metallic foil, semi-metallic foil, or plastic. Each sheet can include a frame formed from the paper or other material of the sheet. The frame can be formed around the side edges of each detachable component, or the sheet may be constructed so that the frame is formed only around the outside edges of each sheet. The detachable components can be sized, shaped, and arranged on the sheet so as to maximize the usage of paper included in each sheet and to reduce waste by ensuring that the frame forms only a minimally necessary portion of the sheet. Each sheet may also include no frame at all but only detachable components connected to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The detachable components may be torn, punched out, or otherwise detached from the sheet along lines of separation. The lines of separation can be perforations that assist the user in cleanly removing each detachable component from the sheet without creating rips in the detachable component or leaving hanging paper fragments that result when two detachable components are separated along a line of separation (e.g., a fold line) that does not include perforations. Microperforations can also be used to provide the cleanest separation so that the edges of the separated detachable components appear smooth.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The sheet can be a printable form and can include pre-printed graphics and text or it may be supplied to the user totally blank. Software that can be installed on the user's computer or accessed remotely on a website via the Internet can be used to customize and print or imprint customizations on the printable form.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The printable form can include one, two, three, four, five, or more sheets, each sheet featuring one or more detachable pieces that can be configured to form an artwork. The detachable pieces may be formed into regular or irregular shapes and can be separable from each sheet along lines of separation. The lines of separation can be fold lines that may be cut or torn apart by a user or perforations that may be torn or punched out by the user to separate the detachable pieces from each other and from a frame in embodiments where the sheet includes a frame. The sheets can include preprinted text or images, or the sheets can be entirely blank or can include blank customizable spaces. The user may print, draw, or emboss images or text onto the customizable spaces or affix labels or stamps on or over the customizable spaces.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The sheets may be supplied as part of a kit that also includes a plurality of separator pieces and a substrate. The substrate can be more rigid than the printable forms. The user may print the same image, symbol, or text on two, but preferably three or more, sheets. The sheets customized in this manner will include sets of detachable pieces identical in shape and size. Each set of identical detachable pieces may be separated from their respective sheets and attached together using the separator pieces and an adhesive. When connected, each image printed on each identical detachable piece can be viewed, in large part, even though the identical detachable pieces are attached together using the separator pieces in a stacked configuration. The same image, symbol, or text can be printed on an additional sheet that can be attached to a front surface of the substrate to form a base sheet. The base sheet can be attached to the substrate as a single unitary sheet, or its detachable pieces may be separated and attached individually to the substrate in an arrangement or orientation decided by the user. Using a separator piece, the connected, stacked identical detachable pieces can be secured above corresponding identical images, symbols, or text on the base sheet, thereby allowing the user to create a three-dimensional artwork composed of stacked images, symbols, or text.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, the detachable pieces can be connected together using separator pieces and adhesive to form stacked images. The stacked images can be connected to the substrate to create three-dimensional artworks.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another embodiment, the substrate can include perforations or cuts that permit it to be disassembled into a plurality of regularly or irregularly shaped pieces that can be reassembled or reconnected to reform the original shape of the substrate. The sheet can include perforations or cuts so that its detachable components correspond in size and shape to the plurality of regularly or irregularly shaped pieces of the substrate. Once a photograph or other image has been printed or imprinted on the sheet, the sheet can be connected to the substrate by adhesive so that the lines of perforation of the substrate and of the sheet align, thereby creating a puzzle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, the sheet can include a plurality of fold lines, perforations, or cuts that permit the sheet to be folded and assembled into a predetermined object such as, for example, into the shape of a toy car or a Christmas tree ornament. In this way, a user can print or imprint colors, photographs, or other images on the sheet to customize the appearance of the object before the sheet is folded and assembled to create the object.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The terms &#x201c;print&#x201d; and &#x201c;printable&#x201d; as used herein relate to printing on one of the multi-purpose forms during the manufacturing of the form, or printing on a surface of the form in a first instance by a manufacturer. The terms &#x201c;imprint&#x201d; and &#x201c;imprintable&#x201d; as used herein refer to printing on one of the forms by a user subsequent to manufacturing. Imprinting can be accomplished manually using a pen, pencil, or other handheld writing instrument, or mechanically using a printer or printing device. For example, the user may imprint customizations onto a blank form in the first instance where the manufacturer has not printed any information on the form during manufacturing, or the user may imprint customizations in a second, third, fourth or other instance onto a form that includes information printed thereon by the manufacturer during manufacturing. By way of further example, a form that includes information printed thereon by the manufacturer during manufacturing is printed in the first instance, customizations subsequently printed onto the form by a user are imprinted in the second instance, and additional information thereafter printed onto the same form by the same user or by another user is imprinted in the third instance.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One advantage of the printable form is that users may create artwork or puzzles easily and quickly using the kit and a home or office desktop printer without the need for any specialized knowledge or skills.</p>
