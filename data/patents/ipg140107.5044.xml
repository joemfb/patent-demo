<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to providing a method and apparatus for customizing a user interface menu based upon the past and current user activity.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wireless communication technologies have seen explosive growth over the past few years. This growth has been fueled by wireless services providing freedom of movement to the mobile public, and cutting the tether to hardwired communication systems. As mobile communication devices have become ubiquitous, an overwhelming number of applications and features have been developed for use on mobile devices. Many of these applications and/or features are pre-loaded on the mobile device and offered to the user through the user interface menu. The user interface menu, being a concise display of available applications/features, is often truncated to display only a sampling of the available applications/features.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">However, as the number and complexity of the applications and/or features increase, their setup, capabilities and general usage can become quite baffling to many users. Given the limited space available in mobile device displays, there is simply not enough room to display all of the available applications/features to users in the user interface menu. Many times a series of complex navigation maneuvers must be performed to access a particular application/feature. As a result, many potentially desirable applications/features are either undiscovered or rarely used. Consequently, a user may not receive the full experience offered by the mobile device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The various embodiments provide methods and a mobile device which monitors a user's activity on the mobile device, maps the user's activity record to other applications/features available to the user on the mobile device, and provides suggestions to the user regarding the other applications/features (e.g., undiscovered or rarely used applications/features) already available to the user on the mobile device based upon the user's activity record. Upon receiving the suggestions, the user may elect to modify the user interface menu to highlight or include the suggested application/features for future use. In an embodiment, the identity of an application/feature and number of times a user activates the application/feature may be recorded. The frequency of use of a particular application/feature may be calculated. An affinity table may be used to estimate a user's potential interest in an application/feature based upon the user's record of use of another application/feature. The affinity table may be used to calculate relative values of the user's potential interest in applications/features note currently listed or displayed on the user interface menu. The applications/features having the highest relative values may be displayed to the user as a suggestion to add to or modify the user interface menu. In another embodiment, the affinity table may be modified to reflect the user's actions subsequent to the displayed suggestion. In another embodiment, a user's previously created activity record may be transferred from a first mobile device to a second mobile device in order to present suggestions to modify the second mobile device's user interface menu so that it may be similar to that of the first mobile device. In yet another embodiment, the modified affinity table may also be transferred from the first mobile device to the second mobile device in order to present suggestions to modify the second mobile device's user interface menu so that it may be similar to that of the first mobile device.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;mobile device&#x201d; refers to any one or all of cellular telephones, personal data assistants (PDA's), palm-top computers, lap-top computers, wireless electronic mail receivers (e.g., the Blackberry&#xae; and Treo&#xae; devices), multimedia Internet enabled cellular telephones (e.g., the Blackberry Storm&#xae;), Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers, wireless gaming controllers, and similar personal electronic devices which include a programmable processor and memory.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As the popularity of mobile communication devices has increased, so have the complexity of these devices. Today's mobile devices do not simply serve to support cellular telephone communications. Rather, today's mobile devices have become a sophisticated computing platform from which a dizzying array of applications may be executed and features utilized. Most current mobile devices come pre-programmed with a wide variety of applications while providing the user with the capability to customize the applications executable on the mobile device by loading additional &#x201c;after-market&#x201d; applications onto the mobile device. Moreover, most current mobile devices contain a number of features that allow users to perform a broad scope of actions. For example, many mobile devices come equipped with cameras that allow the user to take still photos as well as moving video. In addition, many mobile devices come equipped with the ability to record sound. Still further, integrated GPS receivers are becoming commonplace in mobile devices which allow the mobile device to determine its position in the world with precision and accuracy.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In order to present the various application and features options to the user of the mobile device, most mobile devices implement a user interface menu. The user interface menu may be a convenient display of the applications and features available on the mobile device. Typically, by selecting an icon or listing of one of the applications or features, the selected application or feature is launched. However, to enable their portability, many mobile devices employ displays of limited size. Consequently, in many instances the user interface menu (or at least a top page of a user interface menu) lists a limited number of the available functions/applications. In most cases, only the most frequently used applications are displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Despite the wide variety of applications/features available on mobile devices, many users fall into a routine of using a relatively small set of familiar available applications and/or features on their mobile devices. In some cases, the applications/features utilized by the user are the only features that the user has become familiar with through repeated use. As users upgrade and replace older mobile devices with newer ones loaded with advanced applications and/or features, the user may not take advantage of these new applications and/or features because the user is unaware or unfamiliar with them. As a result, many users fail to receive the full benefits offered by their mobile devices. In many instances, users need simply to be made aware or reminded of the availability of unused applications/features to enable them to take fuller advantage of their mobile devices. By identifying or highlighting unused applications/features in a main user interface menu, users may be prompted to utilize a new or rarely used application/feature.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Additionally, while users frequently upgrade and replace older mobile devices with newer ones, there is a limited amount of data that is transferred to new mobile devices. Typically, users transfer their contact lists. In many instances, this transfer of contact lists occurs via a physical transfer of a smart card (e.g., SIM card). Some wireless communication network providers will transfer some of a user's personal data from an old mobile device to the new mobile device for a nominal fee. However, the capabilities of such services are often limited. On the whole, a user's settings and preferences are often non transferable between mobile devices. Consequently, any user interface menu modifications or customizations made by the user on an older device are often not transferred to the new mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The various embodiments raise a user's attention to additional applications/features readily available on the user's mobile device that the user may be interested in using based upon the user's past and/or current activity on the mobile device. By monitoring a user's activity on the mobile device (i.e., the applications and features utilized), the mobile device may be able to suggest other applications/features that the user may not be aware of but might be interested in using based upon the user's established activity record. The suggested applications/features may be identified or highlighted in the user interface main menu to make it easier for the user to discover and use the software application or hardware. Existing user interface menu customization methods typically place shortcuts on the menu to the most frequently used applications/features. While listing commonly used applications/features on the main menu may assist users in finding and launching the applications/features they use most often, such customization methods do not allow the user to discover other applications/features that are likely to be of benefit to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Various embodiments described herein monitor a user's application and feature usage habits and use such information to customize a user interface menu with targeted applications/features that may best suit and possibly enhance the user's utilization of the mobile device and consequently improve their user experience. In various embodiments, the mobile device may be loaded with a matrix of links, affinity tables, fuzzy logic, or learning algorithms which enable a device processor to identify and prioritize relationships between the various applications/features available on the mobile device. Using observed user behavior patterns and the embodiment methods, the mobile device may suggest to users previously unused or unknown applications/features available on their mobile devices which the user may be interested in using without the need for any external resource to generate the suggestion.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Other embodiments allow the user to transfer records of user behavior patterns from one mobile device to another. In this manner, the second mobile device may immediately make suggestions for customizing its user interface menu so that it may appear similar to that of the first mobile device without the need to generate a new user activity record. In an alternative embodiment, modifications to the matrix of links, affinity tables, fuzzy logic, or learning algorithms may be transferred from one mobile device to another in order to present suggestions to modify the second mobile device's user interface menu so that it may appear similar to that of the first mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a process flow diagram illustrating an overview embodiment method for customizing a user interface menu to identify/highlight applications and/or features available to the user on a mobile device based upon the user's activity on the mobile device. A mobile device may monitor the user's activity on a mobile device, step <b>101</b>. As an example, a mobile device may identify each request to launch or utilize a software application and/or a hardware feature on the mobile device. The mobile device may store a record of these launches or utilization requests in a user activity record data table <b>301</b>. An example of a user activity record table <b>301</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and described in more detail below. In addition to storing the identity of various applications and features used by the user in the user activity record data table <b>301</b>, the mobile device <b>10</b> may store a measure of use of applications, such as the number of times the user launches or utilizes an identified application and/or feature, or a frequency of use or launch of applications or features (e.g., number of uses divided by a unit of time).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Once the user's activity has been observed and recorded, the mobile device <b>10</b> may map the user's activity record to other available applications and/or features available on the mobile device <b>10</b>, step <b>105</b>. Any of a number of algorithms and methods may be used to map a user's past and current activity to other available applications and/or features available on the mobile device. For example, a matrix of links may be established which link other available applications/features to the applications/features that are already being utilized by the user. As another example, an affinity table may be stored in memory which includes weighting factors that can be used to estimate the likelihood that the user would be interested in using other available applications/features based on the applications/features that are already being used. Other methods such as the use of fuzzy logic or learning algorithms may be implemented to map the user's activity record to other available applications and/or features available on the mobile device <b>10</b> in step <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Once the user's activity record has been mapped to other applications/features available on the mobile device, the mobile device <b>10</b> may display the other applications/features that are most likely to be of benefit to the user based upon the user's activity record, step <b>110</b>. This display of other applications/features available on the mobile device <b>10</b> may be made as a suggestion to modify the user interface menu to include other recommended applications/features. If the user elects to accept the suggested modification, the user interface menu may be modified to reflect the accepted suggestions, step <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a process flow diagram of an embodiment method for generating a user activity record on a mobile device. The processor of a mobile device may oversee a number of processes and operations being executed on the mobile device in a main loop routine, step <b>201</b>. The main loop may comprise a number of subroutines, loops and processes that are executed at various times in the normal operation of the mobile device. When a mobile device user manipulates the user interface to launch an application or utilize a hardware feature on the mobile device an interrupt may be received by the processor to initiate a subroutine to record the user activity, step <b>202</b>. Upon receipt, in addition to launching the application or initiating operation of the feature, the processor may record the identity of the software application or hardware feature being launched by the user, step <b>203</b>. In addition, the processor of the mobile device may increment a counter for the launching application or feature which indicates the number of times the application or feature has been launched or used, step <b>204</b>. Such a usage counter may tally all uses, or alternatively all uses within a unit of time, such as a day, week, month or year to provide a frequency of use metric.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> provides an example of a data table containing a sample of a user activity record that may be stored in the memory of the mobile device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a user activity record data table <b>301</b> may identify a number of possible software applications and hardware features available to the user on the mobile device along with a measure of the use made of such applications or features. In the example user activity record data table <b>301</b> the hardware features include a camera, a voice recorder, and a video recorder, while the available software applications include email, Short Message Service (SMS), Multimedia Message Service (MMS), and a social networking website application. This list of hardware features and software applications is provided merely as an illustration and is not intended to be comprehensive. In addition, a user activity record data table <b>301</b> will include a measure of the use of applications and features by the user. The measure of use may be in the form of counter values indicating the number of times the identified application/feature has been launched/used. Alternatively, the measure of use may be in the form of a frequency value (as shown) indicating the number of times the identified application/feature has been launched/used within a unit of time (e.g., day, week, month, year, etc.). In some embodiments, the activity record may periodically decrement the counters in order to reflect the frequency of use (i.e., total number of times the identified application/feature has been launched/used during the refresh period). In other embodiments, the activity record may contain a value indicating the total number of times the identified application/feature has been launched/used for the life of the mobile device. In such embodiments, the processor may calculate the frequency by dividing the counter value by the amount of time that has elapsed since the mobile device was activated.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Once the user's activity record has been generated, the mobile device <b>10</b> may map the user's activity record to other available applications/features on the mobile device in order to provide the user with suggestions of other available applications/features on the mobile device that the user is likely to be interested in based upon the activity record. If accepted, the suggested applications/features may be added to the user interface menu so that these previously unknown or little used applications/features are presented on a priority menu for easy access by a user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a process flow diagram illustrating an embodiment method for mapping the user's activity record to other available applications/features on the mobile device. The process flow illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> utilizes an affinity table which may be stored in local memory of the mobile device or accessed in a remote server memory. An example of an affinity table is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and described in more detail below. The process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref>, and <b>6</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, while in the main loop routine, step <b>201</b>, the mobile device processor may periodically check to see if the time to perform a mapping function has elapsed, determination <b>205</b>. The periodicity of the mapping function may be arbitrarily set by the user, service provider, mobile device manufacturer, or some third party. The length of the time between mapping functions may be chosen to most accurately reflect the user's current behavioral usage patterns. For example, the length of time between mapping functions may be selected to be long enough to collect a minimum threshold of &#x201c;data points&#x201d; in the activity record. Additionally, the length of time may be selected such that only the user's more recent activity is reflected in the activity record. If an extraordinarily long period of time is selected, the activity record may not accurately reflect the user's current behavior patterns. For example, if a user launched a particular application repeatedly in the first week following acquisition of the mobile device <b>10</b> but never there after, if the length of time between mapping function operations is selected to encompass the first week of activity, the stored activity record may not accurately reflect the user's current behavior patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">If the period of time between mapping function has not yet elapsed (i.e., determination <b>205</b>=No), the processor returns to the main loop routine, step <b>201</b>. However, if the period of time between mapping functions has elapsed (determination <b>205</b>=Yes), the processor may multiply the frequency of use for each application/feature recorded in the activity record data table by an affinity weighting factor listed in an affinity table stored in memory to determine an affinity value for each available application/feature, step <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">An example of an affinity table <b>302</b> that may be used with an embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. For each application/feature listed in the first column of the affinity table <b>302</b>, an affinity weighting factor is provided indicting a relative affinity that a user may have to use the particular application/feature given the user's usage of the application/feature listed in the first column.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The use of the affinity table illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be explained by the way of an example, in which the hardware features and software applications include: a camera, a voice recorder, a video recorder, email, SMS, MMS, and a social networking website application (e.g., Facebook&#xae;, Twitter&#xae;, myspace&#xae;). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an affinity table for such a mobile device may include a data record (row) for each of the used applications and features with each data record including a data field (column) for each the possible applications and features. In this example, the use of a particular application or feature is given full weight, so applications/features have an affinity of &#x201c;1&#x201d; for themselves. Thus, if the user uses the camera hardware feature, this usage indicates a likelihood that the user will want to use the camera feature again in the future. Thus, the affinity weighting factor for a camera usage stored in the camera data record (i.e., first row and first column) is &#x201c;1.&#x201d; Other affinity weighting factors may be set by software or services providers as estimates of how likely a user utilizing a first application/feature will be interested in using a second application/feature. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the affinity weighting factor assigned to the voice recorder feature (third column) given uses of the camera feature is 0.2. The affinity weighting factor may be in arbitrary units, but assigning a weighting factor of 0.2 to voice recorder may be viewed as similar to estimating that one who uses the camera feature has a 20% likelihood of being interested in using the voice recorder feature. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an affinity weighting factor for the video recorder feature (fourth column) given use of the camera function of 0.6. This affinity weighting factor implies that one who uses the camera feature is three times more likely to use the video recorder feature than the voice recorder feature. The example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> further includes an affinity weighting factor of 0.3 for the email application (fifth column) given use of the camera function, an affinity weighting factor 0.2 for the SMS application (sixth column) given use of the camera function, an affinity weighting factor of 0.6 for the MMS application (seventh column) given use of the camera function, and an affinity weighting factor of 0.7 for the social networking application (eighth column) given use of the camera function. It should be noted that the affinity weighting factors shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are completely arbitrary and for illustrative purposes only.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The affinity weighting factors may be provided by any of service providers and based upon a number of information sources. For example, polling services may conduct surveys which ask mobile device users several questions about their mobile device usage, such as &#x201c;do you use the camera function on your mobile device?&#x201d; By obtaining information about the different types of applications and features used by the general population, patterns may be detected regarding common application/feature usages. For example, surveys may reveal that users who use camera features are likely to also use a video recorder feature and an MMS software application. Similarly, surveys may reveal that users who send text messages are also likely to use social networking application. Based on the survey data, affinity weighting factors may be generated and stored in a table such as affinity table <b>302</b> reflecting such cross-application usage patterns. The affinity weighting factor thus can provide a relative measure of the likelihood that a user will enjoy, benefit from, or use application/feature X given that the user uses application/feature Y.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It is noted that the illustrative affinity table <b>302</b> is symmetrical in that the affinity weighting factor of application/function X given application/function Y is the same as the affinity weighting factor of application/function Y given application/function X. However, this is for illustrative purposes only and affinity tables may also be asymmetrical. An asymmetrical affinity table would be appropriate if survey data indicates that the likelihood of a user using application/feature X given use of application/feature Y is not the same as the likelihood of a user using application/feature Y given use of application/feature X. For example, survey results may reveal that users who send MMS messages may not be particularly likely to use a camera feature, but those users who do use the camera feature are quite likely to also use an MMS software application.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition, as shown in the example affinity table <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there may be no affinity among some application/feature pairings. For example, in row 2, column 5, the affinity weighting factor reflecting whether a user who uses the email application is likely to use the camera feature is zero (0). This example affinity weighting factor reflects a conclusion that email usage has little if any relationship to camera usage.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, by multiplying the frequency that a user uses a particular application/function by the affinity weighting factors listed in an affinity table <b>302</b> for that particular application/function, affinity values can be obtained for each applications/functions addressed in the table, step <b>206</b>. Such affinity values will reflect a relative likelihood that the user may be interested in the other applications/functions based upon the use of the particular application/function. Using all of the usage frequency values listed in the user activity record data table <b>301</b> and the affinity weighting factors listed in an affinity table <b>302</b>, total affinity values may be calculated. For example, using the data illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, an affinity value for the camera feature given use of the camera is 20 (i.e., 20.times.1=20), an affinity value for the voice recorder feature given use of the camera is 4 (i.e., 20.times.0.2=4), and an affinity value for the video recorder feature given use of the camera is 12 (20.times.0.6=12). Other affinity values based on the data illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref> are listed in an affinity value summing table <b>303</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the affinity values for every application/feature available on the mobile device are calculated based upon the activity record table and the affinity table, the affinity values for each application/feature may be summed to provide a total or overall affinity value, step <b>207</b>. An example of such calculations is shown in the affinity value summing table <b>303</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. By adding each affinity value for a particular application/feature (i.e., adding each affinity value in a column of affinity value summing table <b>303</b>), an overall relative affinity value can be obtained that reflects the relative likelihood that the user will be interested in a particular application or feature given the user's overall mobile device usages. Summing also takes into account multiple variant information, such as the likelihood of use of social networking applications given use of the camera feature and SMS and MMS applications. In other words, the summed affinity values provide an estimate of the relative likelihood that a user may use or benefit from a particular application or feature based upon the user's on-going usage of all other applications/features.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> further illustrates that by completing all of the affinity value calculations, an overall ranking of applications/features can be obtained as shown in the bottom row of affinity value summing table <b>303</b>. For example, using the example user activity record data table <b>301</b> and affinity table <b>302</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, the camera feature exhibits a total affinity value of 43, the voice recorder feature exhibits a total affinity value of 8.5, video recorder feature exhibits a total affinity value of 29, the email application feature exhibits a total affinity value of 41.1, the SMS application feature exhibits a total affinity value of 52, the MMS application feature exhibits a total affinity value of 51.5 and the social networking application feature exhibits a total affinity value of 60.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> illustrates an important benefit provided by the various embodiments which is identifying unused applications or features that the user might find interesting. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> it can be seen that the user in this example never sends MMS messages or launches a social networking application. However, the total affinity values for these applications shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> indicates that, based upon the user's over all activities, which include use of the camera, video recorder, email and SMS, the user is likely to benefit from MMS and social networking applications.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It should be noted that the data table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is for illustrative purposes only and does not reflect a particular user, implementation or required aspect. The affinity value summing table <b>303</b> illustrates calculated affinity values and the total affinity values, but these values need not be stored in memory.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the mobile device processor may reorder the priority of each application/feature available on the mobile device according to the summed affinity values, step <b>208</b>. Thus, the application/feature having the highest summed affinity value may be deemed to be the application/feature most likely to be of benefit to the user based upon the user's activity record. Using the illustrative summed affinity values appearing in the affinity value summing table <b>303</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the mobile device processor may determine that the user will most likely use (benefit from use of) the social networking application followed by the SMS application, the MMS application, the camera function, the email application, the video recorder function, and finally, if there are sufficient lines in the user interface menu, the voice recorder function. As noted above, the social networking application and MMS application are included in the user interface menu based solely on the affinity calculations, and not based upon prior usage. Thus, these applications are listed high in the user menu order since they appear to be of interest to the user based on the user's overall mobile device usage pattern, even though the user has not utilized those applications in the past. Some or all of the reordered priority list may be displayed to the user on the mobile device as suggestions to add the highest priority application/features to the user interface menu (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, step <b>110</b>). Once the priority of each of the available applications/features has been generated, in embodiments where the activity record counter values are reset/refreshed, the mobile device processor may reset or refresh the activity record counter values, step <b>209</b>. The mobile device <b>10</b> may then return to the main loop routine, step <b>201</b> until the next period for performing the mapping function has elapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As noted earlier, the total affinity value summing table <b>303</b> need not be generated for storage in memory. In alternative embodiments, the mobile device processor may calculate the affinity values and sum them in a single algorithm calculation without storing a table of affinity values. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6B and 6C</figref> illustrate alternative data tables which may be generated containing only the total affinity values in a data table <b>304</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, or values indicative of the priority of each application/feature in a data table <b>305</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> based upon the overall affinity values.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">While the embodiment method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> utilizes an affinity table to determine a relative ranking of applications and features based upon a user activity record, other methods for mapping the user activity record to applications and features may be utilized. For example, instead of multiplying activity values times and affinity weighting factor, application links may be determined using a matrix of links. The total number of links for each application or feature may then be used to develop a relative ranking of applications and features. As another example, instead of reflecting survey results in affinity weighting factors, inferences and patterns obtained from user surveys may be translated into fuzzy logic factors that can be applied to the user activity record in order to develop the relative ranking of applications and features. As a further example, inferences and patterns obtained from user surveys may be translated into learning algorithms which may be applied to the user activity record in order to develop the relative ranking of applications and features.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a process flow diagram illustrating an embodiment method for customizing a user interface menu based upon a user activity record. The embodiment method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> makes use of the activity record generation process described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the mapping process described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Thus, for example, the mobile device processor may perform the process flow shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to generate a user activity record data table <b>301</b> similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Concurrently with or subsequent to generating the user activity record data table <b>301</b>, the mobile device <b>10</b> processor may perform the example method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. As discussed in more detail above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the mobile device <b>10</b> processor may determine whether it is time to perform a mapping process, determination <b>205</b>. If the time to perform the mapping process has elapsed (i.e., determination <b>205</b>=Yes), the mobile device processor may perform steps <b>206</b>-<b>209</b> in a manner similar to that described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>6</b>A-<b>6</b>C. Once the priority of each available applications/features has been determined based upon the summed affinity values, step <b>209</b>, the mobile device processor may determine whether the top priority applications/features are already displayed in the user interface menu, determination <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As noted above, due to display size constraints and other factors, the user interface menu may not display or list all of the software applications or hardware features (at least on a top page of the user interface menu). In many instances, links or shortcuts to only a fraction of available application/features will be included in the user interface menu. Accordingly, a mobile device processor may compare the top priority applications/features determined during the re-ordering step with those currently displayed in the user interface menu to determine if suggestions should be made to the user to modify the user interface menu.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">If all of the top priority applications are already displayed in the user interface menu (determination <b>210</b>=Yes), there is no need to present suggestions to the user to modify the user interface menu, so the mobile device processor may return to the main loop routine, step <b>201</b>. However, if any, all or some of the top priority application/features are not currently displayed in the user interface menu (i.e., determination <b>210</b>=No), the mobile device processor may determine which of the top priority application/features is (are) not currently displayed in the user interface menu, step <b>211</b>. The mobile device <b>10</b> processor may then display one or more suggestions or requests to add each of the top priority application(s)/feature(s) that are not currently included in the user interface menu as to the user interface menu, step <b>212</b>. The mobile device <b>10</b> processor may wait for and receive the user's response to the suggestion to modify the user interface menu, step <b>213</b>. If the received user response indicates acceptance of at least one of the suggestions to modify the user interface menu (i.e., determination <b>214</b>=Yes), the mobile device processor may modify the user interface menu to display each of the top priority application/features in the user interface menu accepted by the user, and remove one or more non-top priority application/features from the user interface menu, step <b>220</b>. Once the user interface menu has been modified, the mobile device processor may return to the main loop routine, step <b>201</b> until it is again time to perform the mapping process elapses.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">If, however, the user's response to the suggestion indicates a rejection of the displayed suggestion to modify the user interface menu (i.e., determination <b>214</b>=No), the mobile device processor may alter the affinity weighting factors stored in the affinity table <b>302</b>, step <b>225</b>. The user's rejection of a suggestion to modify the user interface menu may indicate that the user is not interested in and therefore will not use the suggested application or feature. Since the initial affinity weighting factors may be arbitrary or based upon a general population survey that is not applicable to the particular user, a user's response to a suggestion to modify the user interface menu may provide further insight into the user's usage patterns which can be used to refine the affinity weighting factors for the specific user. For example, upon implementation of the embodiment method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the mobile device processor may present a suggestion to the user to replace the email application with the social networking application on the user interface menu. In response the user may reject this suggestion. This rejection may be an indication that, unlike many other users, this particular user has no interest in social networking. Accordingly, for this particular user the affinity weighting factors for the social networking application maybe decreased or set to zero. Modifying the affinity weighting factors in this manner reduces the likelihood that the mobile device processor will issue a suggestion to add the social networking application in the future. In alternative embodiments, the affinity weighting factors may be manually adjusted by the user, such as in the form of a preference setting, to increase or decrease their value, thereby increasing or decreasing the likelihood that that application/feature will be suggested by the mobile device processor to be added to the user interface menu in the future. Once the modified affinity weighting factors are stored in the affinity table <b>302</b>, the mobile device processor may return to the main loop routine, step <b>201</b>, until the next time to perform the mapping process elapses.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is a process flow diagram illustrating an alternative embodiment method for customizing a user interface menu based upon a user activity record. The embodiment method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and thus, the descriptions of steps <b>201</b>-<b>214</b> above apply as well to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. In contrast to the embodiment method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, if the user accepts the suggestion to modify the user interface menu (i.e., determination <b>214</b>=Yes), the mobile device processor may prompt the user to indicate whether the proposed modifications to the user interface menu are satisfactory, decision <b>215</b>. For example, the mobile device processor may reorder all available applications/features on the mobile device in accordance with step <b>209</b> and the summed affinity values. If the top priority applications/features include at least one application/feature not previously displayed in the user interface menu, at least one application/feature previously displayed in the user interface menu may be replaced by a higher priority application feature. Logically, the application/feature with the lowest summed affinity value may be chosen for replacement by the mobile device processor. However, the user may wish to accept the mobile device processor's suggestion to add an application/feature to the user interface menu, but disagree with the suggested application/feature to be removed from the user interface menu. In other instances, the mobile device processor may suggest replacing multiple applications/features with multiple applications/features. It may be the case that the user only agrees to accept one or some of the suggested application/feature replacement. Still further, the user may wish to modify the user interface menu, but rather than replace applications/features with those suggested by the mobile device <b>10</b> processor, the user may prefer to add and delete a different set of applications/features. If the suggested user interface menu (e.g., replacing lowest a summed affinity value application/feature with a suggested application/feature) is accepted by the user (i.e., decision <b>215</b>=Yes), the mobile device processor may modify the user interface menu similar to step <b>220</b> described above. However, if the proposed user interface menu is rejected by the user (i.e., decision <b>215</b>=No), the mobile device <b>10</b> processor may receive the user's input of applications or features to add to and deleted from the user interface menu, step <b>216</b>, and make the appropriate changes to the user interface menu, step <b>217</b>. In addition, user's selection of applications/features to add to and delete from the user interface menu may be used to modify the affinity values in the affinity table <b>302</b>, step <b>225</b>. As discussed above, if the user rejects a suggestion to add an application or feature, this user input may indicate that the affinity values are not properly calibrated to the particular user's desires. To correct the situation, the mobile device processor may modify the affinity weighting factors in the affinity table by decreasing or zeroing the affinity weighting factors for the suggested but not accepted application/feature may need change. In contrast, if the user elects to add an application/feature that was not suggested by the mobile device processor, this addition may indicate a need to increase the affinity weighting factors for the elected application/feature. In this manner, the implementation of the mapping functions shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>7</b><i>a</i>, and <b>7</b>B may result in a higher likelihood that the elected application/feature will be suggested by the mobile device processor in the future.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Users often replace their mobile devices. When doing so, the user may wish to transfer the user's customized user interface menu from the old mobile device to the new one. If the user interface menu appearing on a user's previous mobile device was generated and modified based on the user's behavioral patterns according to the various embodiments, to obtain the same customized user interface, the user may be required to replicate his behavior on the new mobile device. This may be time consuming if the user had used the earlier mobile device for a long time. By transferring the user's activity record from the mobile device to the replacement device, the user may be able to insure a seamless transition of the user interface menu from one mobile device to another. Alternatively, if a second user appreciates the customized user interface menu appearing on the first user's mobile device and desires to obtain the same customized user interface menu on the second user's mobile device, the second user may receive and load the first user's activity record into the second user's mobile device. In this manner, a subsequent implementation of an embodiment method, such as the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, will result in a similar customized user interface menu.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The activity record may be transferred from one device to another in any of a variety of methods. For example, the activity record may be saved to a portable SIM card that is physically transferred from one device to another. Alternatively, the activity record data may be downloaded via a wired or wireless connection using any wireless communication protocols and technologies (e.g., 802.11, Bluetooth, Zigbee, near field communications, infrared transmission, etc.). In addition, a user's activity record appearing on a first mobile device may be uploaded to a remote storage site, such as the memory of a remote server, and accessed by a second mobile device via direct link or network link (e.g., private intranet or public Internet) to download the activity record into the second mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref><i>a </i>illustrates an embodiment method by which a second (replacement) mobile device can obtain a customized user interface menu similar to the user interface menu implemented on a first mobile device. While performing a main loop routine, step <b>201</b>, a second mobile device processor may receive an activity record table from an external source, step <b>230</b>. The external source may be the first mobile device or an external storage storing the activity record table such as a remote server memory. The second mobile device processor may then replace or augment the activity record data table currently stored in the second mobile device memory, step <b>231</b>. For example, the activity record in the second mobile device may have additional applications/features not previously identified in the first mobile device activity record. Thus, the activity record table stored in the second mobile device may be used to augment the currently stored activity record by adding counter values or usage frequency information for each identified application/feature to the values for the corresponding application/feature stored in the second mobile device activity record. In addition, if any application/feature is identified in the first mobile device activity record that does not appear in the second device activity record, the identified application/feature may be added to the second mobile device activity record. This may occur when a particular application/feature has been modified or replaced by a newer application/feature or may simply be obsolete (e.g., infrared data transfer). Once the activity record table in the second mobile device has been replaced or augmented, the second mobile device processor may optionally implement a process to modify the user interface menu (such as by performing step <b>206</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>7</b>A, and <b>7</b>B), step <b>240</b>. Alternatively, the second mobile device processor may simply return to the main loop routine, step <b>201</b> and wait until the time to perform the mapping function process elapses.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates an alternative embodiment method for customizing a second mobile device's user interface menu to be similar to that of a first mobile device. Similar to the process flow illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the second mobile device processor may perform a main loop routine, step <b>201</b> and receive an activity record table from a first mobile device (either directly or indirectly), step <b>230</b>. The second mobile device processor may replace or augment the activity record data table stored in the second mobile device, step <b>231</b>. Since, the customized user interface menu implemented in the first mobile device may be the result of both the user's activity record and modifications made to the affinity weighting factors stored in an affinity table <b>302</b>, the second mobile device processor may also receive modified affinity weighting factors from the first mobile device, step <b>232</b>. Once modified affinity weighting factors are received, the second mobile device processor may replace or augment the affinity table <b>302</b> stored in memory of the second mobile device with the affinity weighting factors received from the first mobile device), step <b>233</b>. Once the activity record table in the second mobile device has been replaced or augmented, the second mobile device processor may optionally immediately implement a process to modify the user interface menu (such as by implementing step <b>206</b> described above with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>7</b>A, and <b>7</b>B), step <b>240</b>. Alternatively, the second mobile device processor may simply return to the main loop routine, step <b>201</b>, and wait until it is again time to perform the mapping function process.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref> illustrates yet another embodiment method for customizing a second mobile device's user interface menu to be similar to that of a first mobile device. In this alternative embodiment, rather than migrating the activity record and/or affinity table, the summed affinity value table may be migrated from the first mobile device to the second mobile device. Thus, while the second mobile device processor is performing the main loop routine, step <b>201</b>, it may receive the summed affinity value table (e.g., tables <b>303</b>, <b>304</b> or <b>305</b>) from a first mobile device, step <b>250</b>. By migrating the summed affinity value table (<b>303</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>305</b>) to the second mobile device, the second mobile device processor may simply compare the top priority application/features identified in the received summed affinity value table with the applications/features currently displayed in the second mobile device user interface menu, step <b>208</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The second mobile device processor may then replace the user interface menu displayed on the second mobile device such that the top priority application/features identified in the received summed affinity value table are now displayed in the user interface menu, step <b>209</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Alternatively, the second mobile device processor may compare the top priority applications/features identified in the received summed affinity value table to determine if the second mobile device processor should suggest to replace applications/features currently displayed user interface menu with top priority applications/features identified in the received summed affinity value table, steps <b>211</b>-<b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>.</p>
