<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/227,979, filed on Sep. 8, 2011, the entirety of which is hereby incorporated by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The semiconductor integrated circuit (IC) industry has experienced rapid growth. Technological advances in IC materials and design have produced generations of ICs where each new generation has smaller and more complex circuits than the previous generation. However, these advances have increased the complexity of processing and manufacturing ICs and, for these advances to be realized, similar developments in IC processing and manufacturing are needed. In the course of integrated circuit evolution, functional density (i.e., the number of interconnected devices per chip area) has generally increased while geometry size (i.e., the smallest component or line that can be created using a fabrication process) has decreased. This scaling-down process generally provides benefits by increasing production efficiency and lowering associated costs. Such scaling down also produces a relatively high power dissipation value, which may be addressed by using low power dissipation devices such as complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Due to this scaling down trend, common manufacturing tasks have become more difficult, for instance, due to high aspect ratios. As one example, one approach to improve the electrical connections between source and drain regions and associated source and drain contacts has been to perform a silicidation process on the source and drain regions through the source and drain contact holes before they are filled with contact metal. However, this through-contact-hole silicidation process may be more difficult and less successful when the contact holes have a high aspect ratio. Thus, although these approaches have been satisfactory for their intended purpose, they have not been satisfactory in all respects.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The following disclosure provides many different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the invention. Specific examples of components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over or on a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features may be formed between the first and second features, such that the first and second features may not be in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the various examples. This repetition is for the purpose of simplicity and clarity and does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a flow chart of a method <b>100</b> for fabricating an integrated circuit device according to various aspects of the present disclosure. In the present embodiment, the method <b>100</b> is for fabricating an integrated circuit device that includes a fin-like field effect transistor (FinFET) device. The method <b>100</b> begins at block <b>102</b> where a semiconductor substrate is provided and a fin structure is formed over the substrate. Then, at block <b>104</b>, a temporary gate structure is formed over a portion of the fin structure and spacers are formed on the sidewalls of the temporary gate structure. Also, spaced source and drain regions may be formed in the fin structure at block <b>104</b>. The method <b>100</b> continues with block <b>106</b> where a temporary ILD layer is deposited over the fin and temporary gate structures. A chemical-mechanical polishing/planarization (CMP) process is also performed to remove the portion of the temporary ILD layer above the temporary gate structure. Next, in block <b>108</b>, a portion (i.e. a dummy gate electrode) of the temporary gate structure is removed to form a trench therein. The method continues to block <b>110</b> where a metal gate electrode is deposited into the trench and partially etched back to form an opening in the gate structure. Then, in block <b>112</b>, a hard mask layer is deposited into the opening and over the temporary ILD layer on either side of the gate structure. The portion of the hard mask layer outside of the opening is then removed with a CMP process. At block <b>114</b>, the temporary ILD layer is removed by an etching process such that the underlying source and drain regions of the fin structure are exposed. The method proceeds to block <b>116</b> where silicide layers are formed on source and drain regions of the fin structure on either side of the gate structure. More specifically, a metal layer is deposited on the source and drain regions, the metal layer and substrate are annealed to create the silicide, and any remaining un-reacted metal is removed by an etching process. Next, in block <b>118</b>, another ILD layer is deposited over the gate structure and substrate, and a CMP process is performed to remove the hard mask layer from above the metal gate electrode and also to planarize the ILD layer. Finally, in block <b>120</b>, source and drain contacts are formed through the ILD layer such that they are conductively coupled to the silicide layers on the respective source and drain regions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additional steps can be provided before, during, and after the method <b>100</b>, and some of the steps described can be replaced or eliminated for other embodiments of the method. For example, semiconductor material may be epitaxially (epi) grown in the source and drain regions after the dummy gate structure is formed in block <b>104</b>. The discussion that follows illustrates various embodiments of an integrated circuit device that can be fabricated according to the method <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagrammatic perspective view of a FinFET device <b>200</b> according to various aspects of the present disclosure and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagrammatic fragmentary sectional view of the FinFET device <b>200</b> taken along line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the present disclosure, the term FinFET device refers to any fin-based transistor. The FinFET device <b>200</b> may be included in a microprocessor, memory cell, and/or other integrated circuit device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> has been simplified for the sake of clarity to better illustrate the inventive concepts of the present disclosure. Additional features may be added in the FinFET device <b>200</b>, and some of the features described below can be replaced or eliminated in other embodiments of the device <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The FinFET device <b>200</b> includes a substrate (wafer) <b>210</b>. The substrate <b>210</b> is a bulk silicon substrate. Alternatively, the substrate <b>210</b> comprises an elementary semiconductor, such as silicon or germanium in a crystalline structure; a compound semiconductor, such as silicon carbide, gallium arsenic, gallium phosphide, indium phosphide, indium arsenide, and/or indium antimonide; or combinations thereof. Alternatively, the substrate <b>210</b> includes a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate. The SOI substrate may be fabricated using separation by implantation of oxygen (SIMOX), wafer bonding, and/or other suitable methods. The substrate <b>210</b> may include various doped regions and other suitable features.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The FinFET device <b>200</b> includes a fin structure <b>212</b>, such as a silicon (Si) fin, that extends from the substrate <b>210</b>. The fin structure <b>212</b> is formed by a suitable process, such as a lithography and etching process. For example, the fin structure <b>212</b> may be formed by forming a photoresist layer (resist) overlying the substrate, exposing the resist to a pattern, performing a post-exposure bake process, and developing the resist to form a masking element including the resist. The masking element may then be used to etch the fin structure <b>212</b> into the silicon substrate <b>210</b>. The fin structure <b>212</b> may be etched using a reactive ion etch (RIE) and/or other suitable process. Alternatively, the fin structure <b>212</b> is formed by a double-patterning lithography (DPL) process. DPL is a method of constructing a pattern on a substrate by dividing the pattern into two interleaved patterns. DPL allows enhanced feature (e.g., fin) density. Various DPL methodologies may be used including double exposure (e.g., using two mask sets), forming spacers adjacent features and removing the features to provide a pattern of spacers, resist freezing, and/or other suitable processes.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Isolation features <b>213</b>, such as shallow trench isolation (STI) structures, surround the fin structure <b>212</b> and isolate the fin structure <b>212</b> from other not-illustrated fins of the FinFET device <b>200</b>. The isolation features <b>213</b> may be formed by partially filling trenches surrounding the fin structure <b>212</b> (formed after etching the substrate <b>210</b> to form the fin structure <b>212</b>) with an insulating material, such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, other suitable material, or combinations thereof. The filled trench may have a multi-layer structure, for example, a thermal oxide liner layer with silicon nitride filling the trench.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The FinFET device <b>200</b> includes a gate structure <b>214</b>. The gate structure <b>214</b> traverses the fin structure <b>212</b>, and in the depicted embodiment, is formed on a central portion of the fin structure <b>212</b>. The gate structure <b>214</b> engages three surfaces of the fin structures <b>212</b>&#x2014;the top surface and two adjacent side surfaces. The gate structure <b>214</b> includes a gate dielectric layer <b>215</b> and a metal gate electrode <b>216</b> in addition to other layers. In the illustrated embodiment, the gate dielectric layer <b>215</b> includes a high-k dielectric material, but alternatively may include other suitable dielectric material, such as silicon oxide or combinations thereof. Examples of high-k dielectric material include HfO<sub>2</sub>, HfSiO, HfSiON, HMO, HMO, HfZrO, zirconium oxide, aluminum oxide, hafnium dioxide-alumina (HfO<sub>2</sub>&#x2014;Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) alloy, other suitable high-k dielectric materials, and/or combinations thereof. The metal gate electrode includes a metal such as Al, Cu, Ti, Ta, W, Mo, TaN, NiSi, CoSi, TiN, WN, TiAl, TiAlN, TaCN, TaC, TaSiN, other conductive materials, or combinations thereof. The metal gate electrode <b>216</b> may be formed using a gate last process as will be described below.

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As will be described below, the gate structure <b>214</b> is formed by a suitable process, including deposition, lithography patterning, and etching processes.

The lithography patterning processes include photoresist coating (e.g., spin-on coating), soft baking, mask aligning, exposure, post-exposure baking, developing the photoresist, rinsing, drying (e.g., hard baking), other suitable processes, or combinations thereof. Alternatively, the lithography exposing process is implemented or replaced by other methods, such as maskless photolithography, electron-beam writing, and ion-beam writing.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Spacers <b>217</b> are formed on the gate structure <b>214</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The spacers <b>217</b> are disposed on sidewalls of the gate structure <b>214</b>, and may be considered part of the gate structure. The spacers <b>217</b> are formed by a suitable process to a suitable thickness. For example, a dielectric layer, such as a silicon oxide layer, is blanket deposited over the FinFET device <b>200</b>; and then, the silicon oxide layer is etched to remove the silicon oxide layer to form spacers <b>217</b>. Alternatively, the spacers <b>217</b> include another dielectric material, such as silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The fin structure <b>212</b> includes a channel region <b>218</b> in those portions nearest to the gate structure <b>214</b>. The fin structure <b>212</b> further includes doped source and drain (S/D) regions <b>219</b> on either side of the channel region <b>218</b>.

In the current embodiment, the silicide layers <b>220</b> are nickel silicide (NiSi) layers, but in alternative embodiments, the silicide layers may include another type of metal. Further, in some embodiments, the source and drain regions <b>219</b> may include epitaxial (epi) growths in or near the silicide layers <b>220</b> to strain the channel region <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the fin structure <b>212</b> and gate structure <b>214</b> of FinFET device <b>200</b> are surrounded by an inter-level dielectric (ILD) layer <b>221</b>. For the sake of clarity, device <b>200</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> without ILD <b>221</b>. The FinFET device <b>200</b> includes source and drain contacts <b>222</b> (MO) that extend down through the ILD layer <b>221</b> and engage respective silicide layers <b>220</b> over the source and drain regions <b>219</b>.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-12</figref> are diagrammatic fragmentary sectional views similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> but showing the FinFET device <b>200</b> during various stages of manufacture. The stages of manufacture depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-12</figref> correspond with fabrication of the device <b>200</b> using a CMOS technology process flow. It should be understood that additional processes may be provided before, during, and/or after the stages illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-12</figref>, and that some selected processes may only be briefly described if they are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the FinFET device <b>200</b> is shown in a partially completed state and has undergone previous manufacturing steps. In the illustrated embodiment, the FinFET device <b>200</b> has undergone processes described above to form the fin structure <b>212</b> including the source and drain regions <b>219</b> and a temporary gate structure <b>250</b>. The temporary gate structure <b>250</b> includes the gate dielectric layer <b>215</b> and a dummy polysilicon layer <b>252</b> (dummy gate electrode) surrounded by the spacers <b>217</b>. The gate dielectric layer <b>215</b> and dummy polysilicon layer <b>252</b> may be formed using any suitable process, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), physical vapor deposition (PVD), atomic layer deposition (ALD), high density plasma CVD (HDPCVD), metal organic CVD (MOCVD), remote plasma CVD (RPCVD), plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD), plating, other suitable methods, and/or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, additional layers such as capping layers, interface layers, diffusion layers, barrier layers, and strain-inducing layers may be deposited to form a portion of the temporary gate structure <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further, in some embodiments, epitaxial growths are grown on fin structure <b>212</b> on opposite sides of the temporary gate structure <b>250</b>. In such a case, the channel region <b>218</b> is disposed between epitaxial growths and, as the epitaxial growths are grown, strain may be induced in the channel region due to lattice mismatch. In those embodiments in which FinFET device <b>200</b> is an NMOS device, the epi growths may be silicon or silicon carbon (Si:C) and may be doped with n-type dopants, such as phosphorous or arsenic, to form the source and drain regions. In those embodiments in which FinFET device <b>200</b> is a PMOS device, the epi growths may be silicon germanium (SiGe) and may be doped with a p-type dopant such as boron to form the source and drain regions. Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a temporary ILD layer <b>254</b> has been deposited over the fin structure <b>212</b> and temporary gate structure <b>250</b>, and a CMP process has been completed to planarize the ILD layer <b>254</b> such that it is co-planar with the top of the temporary gate structure.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a gate replacement process is performed, wherein the top layer of the temporary gate structure <b>250</b> is removed and replaced with a metal gate electrode. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates the temporary gate structure <b>250</b> after removal of the dummy polysilicon layer <b>252</b> (dummy gate electrode). The dummy polysilicon layer <b>252</b> may be removed from the temporary gate structure <b>250</b> by any suitable process, such as a dry etching and/or wet etching process. After etching away the layer <b>250</b>, the top of the gate dielectric layer <b>215</b> and the inner surfaces of spacers <b>270</b> respectively define bottom and side surfaces of a trench <b>260</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, trench <b>260</b> is completely filled (not shown) with a metal fill layer to form the metal gate electrode <b>216</b>. The metal gate electrode <b>216</b> is formed by the deposition of aluminum or other conductive metal such as copper, tungsten, or titanium. In some embodiments, filling the trench <b>260</b> includes depositing a work function layer prior to depositing a metal fill layer. Next, after the trench <b>260</b> has been completely filled with a metal fill layer, an etching process is performed to remove a portion of the metal gate electrode <b>216</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, approximately 5-10 nanometers (nm) from the top portion of the metal gate electrode <b>216</b> is etched away to form an opening <b>262</b> approximately 5-10 nm deep. In alternative embodiments, more or less of the metal gate electrode may be etched away.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, a hard mask is deposited over the gate structure to protect the metal gate electrode <b>216</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a hard mask material layer <b>264</b> is deposited into the opening <b>262</b> and over the temporary ILD layer <b>254</b>. In the current embodiment, the hard mask material is silicon nitride (SiN), but, in alternative embodiments, the hard mask material may be silicon carbon (SiC), silicon oxynitride (SiON) or another suitable material. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a CMP process is performed to remove portions of the hard mask material layer <b>264</b> outside of the opening <b>262</b>. After the CMP process is performed, a hard mask cap <b>266</b> (i.e. a portion of the hard mask layer <b>264</b>) remains over the metal gate electrode <b>216</b> and between the spacers <b>217</b>. The hard mask cap <b>266</b> protects the metal gate electrode <b>216</b> from subsequent processes.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the temporary ILD layer <b>254</b> is etched away such that the source and drain regions <b>219</b> in the fin structure <b>212</b> are exposed. The metal gate electrode <b>216</b> remains intact due to the protection of the hard mask cap <b>266</b>. Next, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a silicidation process is performed on the FinFET device <b>200</b>. Specifically, a silicidation process such as a self-aligned silicide (salicide) process is performed to grow a silicide layer on any exposed silicon-based surface. Specifically, a metal material such as nickel (Ni) is deposited over at least the fin structure <b>212</b>, the temperature is raised to cause a reaction between the nickel and any silicon exposed to the nickel, and then any un-reacted nickel is etched away. During silicidation, silicide layers <b>220</b> are formed in the source and drain regions <b>219</b>. Because the entire source and drain regions are exposed during the silicidation process, the silicide layers <b>220</b> form across approximately the entire length of the regions including in those portions of the source and drain approximately adjacent the channel region <b>218</b>. Hard mask cap <b>266</b> remains on metal gate electrode <b>216</b> during silicidation to prevent damage. In alternative embodiments, other metals besides nickel may be used in the silicidation process.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the gate structure <b>214</b> is finalized. First, the ILD layer <b>221</b> is deposited over the fin structure <b>212</b> and the hard mask cap <b>266</b>. Then, a CMP process is performed to planarize the ILD layer <b>221</b> with the top of the metal gate electrode <b>216</b>. Specifically, during the CMP process, the hard mask cap <b>266</b> is removed along with top portions of the spacers <b>217</b>. Finally, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the ILD layer <b>221</b> is augmented with additional dielectric material and the source and drain contacts <b>222</b> are formed therethrough. In more detail, after the ILD layer <b>221</b> is augmented, contact holes are etched through the ILD layer down to the silicide layers <b>220</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the contact holes have high aspect ratios (a ratio of depth over width). In some embodiments, the aspect ratios of the contact holes may be higher than approximately 3, but, in other embodiments, may be between approximately 1 and 3. Metal such as tungsten is then deposited into the contact holes down to the silicide layers <b>220</b> to form the source and drain contacts <b>222</b>. When formed, the source and drain contacts <b>222</b> are conductively coupled to the silicide layers <b>220</b>. As compared with previous designs in which silicidation of source and drain regions is performed through the high-aspect contact holes, the source and drain contacts <b>222</b> in the device <b>200</b> may make a better electrical connection with the source and drain regions <b>219</b>. During operation, when the FinFET device is switched &#x201c;on&#x201d; via the gate structure <b>214</b>, current may flow down the source contact <b>222</b>, through the channel region <b>218</b>, and then up the drain contact. Notably, the current may flow horizontally through the silicide layers <b>220</b> when flowing between the source and drain contacts <b>222</b> and the channel region <b>218</b> without flowing through the more resistive portions of the source and drain regions <b>219</b> below the silicide layers. In this manner, operating resistance in the FinFET device <b>200</b> may be reduced as compared to previous designs that employ through-contact-hole silicidation processes.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is understood that the FinFET device <b>200</b> may undergo further processing to complete fabrication. For example, a not-illustrated multilayer interconnection (MLI) including metal layers (e.g., M1, M2, etc.) and inter-metal dielectric (IMD) may be formed above fin and gate structures <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> in order to electrically couple various device parts to form an integrated circuit. The multilayer interconnection includes vertical interconnects, such as conventional vias or contacts, and horizontal interconnects, such as metal lines. The various interconnection features may utilize various conductive materials including copper, tungsten and silicide. In one example, a damascene process is used to form copper multilayer interconnection structure.</p>
