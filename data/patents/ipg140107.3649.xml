<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to virtual simulation systems, and more particularly to a virtual simulation system having an eddy current brake actuator for providing haptic feedback to a user.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Virtual reality computer systems provide users with the illusion that they are part of a &#x201c;virtual&#x201d; environment and may be used for training and/or entertainment purposes. In many fields, virtual reality systems have been used successfully to allow a user to learn from and experience a realistic virtual environment. The appeal of using virtual reality computer systems for training relates, in part, to the ability of such systems to allow trainees the luxury of confidently operating in a highly realistic environment and making mistakes without real world consequences. For example, in the medical field, a virtual reality computer system allows a doctor-trainee or other human operator or user to manipulate an intravascular or laparoscopic tool within a computer-simulated body and thereby perform medical procedures on a virtual patient. In this instance, a user device such as a computer mouse or joystick is used to represent a surgical instrument. As the surgical instrument moves within a provided space or structure, results of such movement are updated and displayed in a body image displayed on the screen of the computer system so that the operator gains the experience of performing such a procedure without practicing on an actual human being or a cadaver. In other applications, virtual reality computer systems allow a user to handle and manipulate the controls of complicated and expensive vehicles, equipment, and other machinery.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For virtual reality systems to provide a realistic and therefore effective experience for the user, sensory feedback and manual interaction should be as natural as possible. In addition to sensing and tracking a user's manual activity and feeding such information to a controller or computer to provide a 3D visual representation to the user, a human interface mechanism should also provide tactile and/or kinesthetic feedback, more generally known as haptic feedback herein. The need for the user to obtain realistic haptic feedback is extensive in many kinds of simulations and other applications. For example, in medical/surgical simulations, the &#x201c;feel&#x201d; of a surgical tool is important as it is moved within the simulated body. It is invaluable to a medical trainee to learn how an instrument moves within a body, how much force is required depending on the operation performed, the space available in a body to manipulate an instrument, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many types of actuators for generating computer-controlled forces are known, including DC and stepper motors, voice coils, hydraulic actuators, and pneumatic actuators. Some devices are active, such as motors, which mean that the device provides an active force that has the ability to move an object or push back on the user. Other actuators are passive, such as brakes, which provide a resistance to motion generated by another source such as the user and cannot generate forces on their own. An advantage of active devices is their ability to simulate all kinds of force sensations. However, active actuators may be unstable and may settle into a feedback loop in which oscillating forces are output on the manipulandum, for example. Dampers may be utilized with an active actuator in order to stabilize the system, such as those described in &#x201c;Initial results using Eddy Current Brakes as Fast Turn-on, Programmable Physical Dampers for Haptic Rendering&#x201d; by Gianni Campion, Andrew Gosline, and Vincent Hayward, and &#x201c;Eddy Current Brakes for Haptic Interfaces: Design, Identification, and Control&#x201d; by Andrew Gosline and Vincent Hayward, both of which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety. The above-mentioned articles describe the use of an eddy current brake as a linear, fast actuating, programmable viscous damper in order to stabilize a motor, which is utilized as the active actuator for haptic rendering. Other disadvantages of active actuators include a high cost, and large size and weight. Passive actuators, on the other hand, while not able to output all the types of force sensations of active actuators, can provide relatively high magnitude forces, are inherently stable and safe, and are typically of low cost and weight. However, standard passive actuators can still be expensive for lower-cost devices and can still add significant weight to an interface device. In addition, a passive actuator may be limited in its ability to simulate different types of force sensations. For example, the article &#x201c;Passive Viscous Haptic Textures. Proc. 16th Symposium on Haptic Interfaces For Virtual Environment And Teleoperator Systems&#x201d; by Gianni Campion, Andrew Gosline, and Vincent Hayward, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, discusses the use of an eddy current brake to generate a viscous texture on a haptic interface. The eddy current brake is not utilized to simulate other force sensations such as vibrations, pulses, jolts, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With demand for haptic interfaces in areas such as medical training, manufacturing, and perception research, there is a demand for improved and/or alternative actuators for providing haptic effects.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Specific embodiments of the present invention are now described with reference to the figures, wherein like reference numbers indicate identical or functionally similar elements. Actuators known in the art for providing haptic effects, such as motors and braking devices, typically involve contact between moving surfaces, or with particles in suspension, and can be slow to actuate and when they rely on particle magnetization, may suffer from demagnetization hysteresis. Moreover, all contact-based actuated brakes, including friction brakes, particle brakes, magnetorheological (MR) brakes, electrorheological (ER) brakes, exhibit nonlinear and often multi-valued relationships between velocity and braking torque due to the nature of the physics used to create dissipation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments hereof relate to an eddy current brake as an actuator for providing haptic feedback to a user device. An eddy current brake is a relatively simple magnetic device that consists of a conductor moving through a magnetic field. As a result of the motion, eddy or Foucault currents are induced to create a resistive force or drag on the conductor that is proportional to the relative velocity, according Lorentz' Force Law. When the conductor moves, eddy currents are induced and a resistive force is generated due to dissipation induced by the Joule Effect. At low speeds, when the effects of the magnetic field induced by the eddy currents can be neglected, the resistive force is proportional to the speed of the conductor. An advantage of using an eddy current brake as an actuator is that it can render friction and transient feedback without any contact between its parts, i.e., the conductor and the magnet. Further, the physics behind eddy current brakes makes them ideal candidates for haptic feedback because they are fast, friction free, and linear in the range of velocities in haptic rendering.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Referring to the schematic illustration on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a haptic interface <b>110</b> having an eddy current brake actuator <b>106</b> for providing haptic effects to a user object or device <b>108</b> is shown. As will be explained in more detail below with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, user object <b>108</b> is a manipulatable interface device such as a mouse, a joystick, a stylus, a knob or the like that provides input signals to a host computer (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). User object <b>108</b> is physically contacted by the user and moveable in at least one degree of freedom. Eddy current brake actuator <b>106</b> includes a conductor <b>112</b> and at least one magnet <b>114</b> that defines a central passageway <b>116</b>. Conductor <b>112</b> is coupled to user object <b>108</b> such that when a user manipulates user object <b>108</b>, conductor <b>112</b> moves within passageway <b>116</b> of magnet <b>114</b> and a magnetic field created by magnet <b>114</b> imparts a resistive force or drag on conductor <b>112</b>. To impart a resistive drag force on conductor <b>112</b>, relative motion between user object <b>108</b> and eddy current brake <b>106</b> is required. Typically, magnet <b>114</b> of haptic interface <b>110</b> is stationary or fixed and user object <b>108</b> is movable relative to magnet <b>114</b> although other configurations are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The resistive force or drag on conductor <b>112</b> is communicated to the user contacting user device <b>108</b> as a haptic effect, i.e., the user feels a resistive force acting against the user object <b>108</b> preventing or retarding movement thereof in one or more degrees of freedom. To vary the amount of resistive force or drag on user object <b>108</b> and thereby produce transient haptic effects, the magnetic field produced by magnet <b>114</b> is varied. The magnetic field may be varied several different ways, depending upon whether magnet <b>114</b> is an electromagnetic magnet or a permanent magnet, or some combination of both. In one embodiment, magnet <b>114</b> is at least one electromagnetic magnet and the magnetic field within passageway <b>116</b> is varied by controlling the supplied current. When the magnetic field oscillates, forces are induced in conductor <b>112</b> at the oscillation frequency. The applied magnetic field has a magnitude and a frequency, and the magnetic field may be applied in various signal configurations such as but not limited to a sine wave, square wave, a saw-toothed-up wave, a saw-toothed-down wave, and a triangle wave. The frequency and/or the magnitude of the magnetic field may be varied. Varying the magnitude of the magnetic field will affect the strength of the signal felt by the user, while varying the frequency will affect the speed, or time dependence of the signal. In one embodiment, the frequency may be varied between 10 Hz to 400 Hz. With an electromagnetic magnet, the magnet field may be completely turned off, i.e., resulting in a magnetic field of 0 Tesla having no haptic effects, and may range up to approximately 1.5 Tesla which is the maximum achievable magnetic field with an iron core in a cost effective magnetic circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In another embodiment, magnet <b>114</b> includes a plurality of magnets that are a combination of at least one permanent magnet and at least one electromagnetic magnet. The magnetic field within passageway <b>116</b> is varied by controlling the magnitude and/or frequency of the supplied current to the at least one electromagnetic magnet as described above. When utilized in combination with at least one permanent magnet, the magnetic field cannot be completely turned off due to the permanent magnet but the magnitude and/or period of the magnetic field may be varied due to the at least one electromagnetic magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment hereof, the actuator includes a plurality of permanent magnets and the magnetic field within the passageway is varied by controlling the distance or space between the permanent magnets. More particularly, with reference to the schematic shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an eddy current brake actuator <b>506</b> includes a conductor <b>512</b> and two permanent magnets <b>514</b>A, <b>514</b>B that define a central passageway <b>516</b>. Similar to eddy current brake actuator <b>106</b>, conductor <b>512</b> moves within passageway <b>516</b> of magnets <b>514</b>A, <b>514</b>B and a magnetic field created by magnets <b>514</b>A, <b>514</b>B imparts a resistive force or drag on conductor <b>512</b>. To vary the amount of resistive force or drag on conductor <b>512</b>, the magnetic field produced by magnets <b>514</b>A, <b>514</b>B may be varied by changing the amount of air space or gap <b>529</b> between the permanent magnets. Magnets <b>514</b>A, <b>514</b>B are coupled to a first end <b>521</b>A, <b>521</b>B of arms <b>527</b>A, <b>527</b>B, respectively, and the first ends are spaced apart from each other to form gap <b>529</b>. In one embodiment, arms <b>527</b>A, <b>527</b>B are iron bars. Second ends <b>523</b>A, <b>523</b>B of arms <b>527</b>A, <b>527</b>B are coupled together via a hinge or revolving joint <b>519</b>. Hinge <b>519</b> is electrically coupled to the controller (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of the haptic interface, and the controller actuates joint <b>519</b> to enlarge or reduce angle &#xd8; between arms <b>527</b>A, <b>527</b>B. In other words, the controller causes second ends <b>523</b>A, <b>523</b>B of arms <b>527</b>A, <b>527</b>B to move towards or away from each other, thereby effectively varying the length of gap <b>529</b> between the two permanent magnets <b>514</b>A, <b>514</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The magnet may be one or more magnets having any suitable geometry or configuration that creates a magnetic field within passageway or opening that is sized to receive conductor <b>112</b>. In one embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, magnet <b>414</b> is a coiled or toroid configuration. Magnet <b>414</b> includes a solid iron core and an enamel coated magnet wire wrapped around the core. The conductor is introduced into passageway <b>416</b>, which is formed between a first end <b>415</b> of magnet <b>416</b> and a second end <b>417</b> of magnet <b>415</b>. Magnet <b>414</b> may be constructed by machining a toroid from a solid iron ingot on a lathe. A thin slot is cut in the toroid to form passageway <b>416</b>, and then an enamel coated magnet wire is wrapped around the coil.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Conductor <b>112</b> is formed from a conductive material. In one embodiment, conductor <b>112</b> is formed from aluminum which is conductive and has a light density. However, other conductive materials are possible such as but not limited to gold, silver, copper, or magnesium. In one embodiment, conductor <b>112</b> is an elongated tubular object or shaft. Conductor <b>112</b> may have any suitable cross-section including circular, square, rectangular, or any polygonal cross-section. In one embodiment, conductor <b>112</b> is solid rather than hollow for increased conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a schematic block diagram of haptic interface <b>110</b> utilized within a virtual simulator system <b>100</b> according to an embodiment hereof is shown. Virtual simulator system <b>100</b> includes a display <b>102</b>, a controller <b>104</b>, and haptic interface <b>110</b> which includes eddy current brake actuator <b>106</b> and user object <b>108</b> as described above. Display <b>102</b> may be a standard display screen or any other visual interface that provides a graphical environment to a user. As understood by those of ordinary skill in the art of virtual simulator systems, a user interacts with the graphical environment of display <b>102</b> by manipulation of the user object <b>108</b> and by receiving visual, audible, and/or haptic feedback of the interaction. Within the graphical environment is a cursor <b>103</b>, such as the arrow cursor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. By cursor it is meant any cursor or object, the position, movement, shape, or the like of which is controllable. Also within the graphical environment is a graphical representation <b>105</b> such as a graphical representation of at least a portion of a living body. For example, the graphical representation <b>105</b> may comprise a human body, a portion of a human body, an animal body, or a portion of an animal body.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Controller <b>104</b> may include logic resources, such as a general-purpose or specific-purpose processing device or microcontroller, and may further include other specific sensor-dependent components required to analyze and store data/measurements from user object <b>108</b>. In one embodiment, controller <b>104</b> may be associated with a memory device (not shown) for storing data and/or instructions. The memory device can be any type of storage device or computer-readable medium, such as random access memory (&#x201c;RAM&#x201d;) or read-only memory (&#x201c;ROM&#x201d;). The memory device stores logical instructions, commands, and/or code executed by controller <b>104</b>. In another embodiment, logical instructions, commands, and/or code can be implemented in hardware and incorporated in controller <b>104</b> using discrete logic circuitry, an application specific integrated circuit (&#x201c;ASIC&#x201d;), a programmable gate array (&#x201c;PGA&#x201d;), a field programmable gate array (&#x201c;FPGA&#x201d;), etc., or any combination thereof. In yet another embodiment, logical instructions, commands, and/or code can be implemented in both hardware in controller <b>104</b> and software/firmware stored in the memory. Controller <b>104</b> is typically implemented by a conventional or commercially available workstation, such as those manufactured by IBM, Dell or Silicon Graphics, Inc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Controller <b>104</b> is electrically coupled to display <b>102</b> via a transmission medium (not shown), and is also electrically or optically coupled to user object <b>108</b> to receive position or movement information therefrom. Signals may be sent between controller <b>104</b> and display <b>102</b>, and between controller <b>104</b> and user object <b>108</b>, by a standard wired interface such as RS-232, USB, Firewire, serial, parallel, etc. or by wireless transmission and reception. Controller <b>104</b> is capable of generating and/or controlling the graphical environment of display <b>102</b> according to the position or movement information received from user object <b>108</b>. More particularly, user object <b>108</b> is manipulatable by a user and the manipulation of user object <b>108</b> controls the position of cursor <b>103</b> within graphical environment <b>105</b>, for example by directly correlating a position of user object <b>108</b> with a displayed position of cursor <b>103</b> or by correlating a position of user object <b>108</b> with a rate of movement of cursor <b>103</b>. For example, when user object <b>108</b> is moved by the user, a graphical representation of the tool or a part of the tool may be moved correspondingly within a graphical environment displayed on display <b>102</b>. Accordingly, a user interacts with user object <b>108</b> while observing the effects of the interaction on display <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition to controlling the graphical environment of display <b>102</b> during operation of virtual simulator system <b>100</b>, controller <b>104</b> directly controls the forces output by eddy current brake actuator <b>106</b>. In a closed-loop manner, controller <b>104</b> causes eddy current crake actuator <b>106</b> to output haptic feedback to the user in response to a predetermined interaction between the cursor <b>103</b> and the graphical representation <b>105</b>. For example, when user object <b>108</b> is manipulated so as to cause the cursor <b>103</b> to be positioned on or in contact with the graphical representation <b>105</b>, a haptic effect is provided by eddy current brake actuator <b>106</b> to the user object <b>108</b> in accordance with program code within or in communication with controller <b>104</b>. By haptic effect it is meant any sensation provided to the user that is related to the user's sense of touch. Herein, the term &#x201c;haptic effect&#x201d; or &#x201c;tactile sensation&#x201d; may refer to either a single force or a sequence of forces output by eddy current brake actuator <b>106</b> which provides a transient resistive force to the user. For example, vibrations, a single jolt or pulse, or a texture sensation are all considered haptic sensations. The haptic effect may be kinesthetic force feedback and/or tactile feedback. By kinesthetic force feedback it is meant any active or passive force applied to the user to simulate a force that would be experienced in the graphical environment of display <b>102</b>, such as a resistive force applied to the user object <b>108</b> to simulate a force acting on at least a portion of the cursor <b>103</b>. For example, if the cursor <b>103</b> is positioned against a surface, a barrier, or an obstruction, eddy current brake actuator <b>106</b> may output a force against user object <b>108</b> preventing or retarding movement of the user object <b>130</b> in the direction of the surface, barrier or, obstruction. By tactile feedback it is meant any active or passive force applied to the user to provide the user with a tactile indication of a predetermined occurrence within the graphical environment of display <b>102</b>. For example, a vibration, click, pop, or the like may be output to the user when the cursor <b>102</b> interacts with a graphical object. Additionally, tactile feedback may comprise a tactile sensation applied to approximate or give the illusion of a kinesthetic force. For example, by varying the frequency and/or the amount of an applied resistive force, variations in surface textures of different graphical objects can be simulated, or by providing a series of clicks when a cursor penetrates an object, resistance to the penetration can be simulated. In one exemplary version, a kinesthetic force sensation, such as a spring force, may be applied to the user whenever cursor <b>103</b> engages graphical representation <b>105</b> to simulate a selectively deformable surface. Alternatively or additionally, a tactile sensation, such as a pop, may be applied to the user when cursor <b>103</b> is moved across a surface of graphical representation <b>105</b> to simulate a texture of graphical representation <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment described in more detail herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the feedback provided by eddy current brake actuator <b>106</b> is related to the user applied force to user object <b>108</b>. Controller <b>104</b> monitors the velocity/speed of user object <b>104</b> via one or more sensors and then varies the magnetic field of eddy current brake actuator <b>106</b> in order to vary the resistive force or drag imposed on conductor <b>112</b>, thereby providing transient haptic effects to user object <b>108</b> which are feedback related to the amount of force applied to the user object <b>108</b>. Controller <b>104</b> receives the position or movement information from user object <b>108</b> and accordingly processes or analyzes the data/measurements as necessary in order to control the magnetic field of eddy current brake actuator <b>106</b>. Controlling the magnetic field of the eddy current brake actuator by either varying the current supplied to an electromagnetic magnet or by varying the amount of air space between at least two permanent magnets provides haptic feedback information to an operator.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In one embodiment, controller <b>104</b> includes a host medical simulation application program and virtual simulation system <b>100</b> performs a medical simulation. Suitable software for such applications is available from Immersion corporation of San Jose, Calif. For example, virtual simulation system <b>100</b> may be a catheter or trocar insertion simulation system and controller <b>104</b> may determine the effects on a simulated human anatomy based on the user applied force to user object <b>108</b>. Anatomical models are deformed or otherwise adjusted to reflect catheter or trocar motion with simulated results displayed by controller <b>104</b> on display <b>102</b>. In addition, resistive or reactive forces encountered by a medical professional during an actual procedure are imparted to user object <b>108</b> via eddy current brake actuator <b>106</b> as described herein to enable the simulation to have a realistic feel. Medical virtual simulation systems may include additional components not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, such as but not limited to a barrier (not shown) used to represent a portion of the skin covering the body of a patient. Virtual simulation system <b>100</b> may be other medical simulation systems, including but not limited to a vascular access training system which trains medical professionals to access veins in hospital and/or clinical settings for introduction of fluids into and sampling blood from the accessed veins. Basically, a vascular access training system may be utilized to train medical professionals to perform various techniques, such as peripheral vascular access, intravenous catheterization, peripherally inserted central catheter placement and central venous catheterization.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One example of a medical simulation system is shown in the schematic illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Medical simulation system <b>300</b> includes a computer <b>320</b> which includes a display <b>302</b> and a controller <b>304</b>. Computer <b>320</b> is electrically coupled via at least one lead <b>326</b> to a haptic interface device <b>310</b> for supplying current to the magnet of the eddy current brake actuator. Lead <b>326</b> includes at least two wires or channels, one for transferring sensor information from the user object to the computer and one for transferring actuation information from the computer to the eddy current actuator. The wires do not have to be the same size. For example, a thinner wire may be utilized for transferring the sensor information since low current is required, while a thicker wire may be utilized for transferring the actuation information since the thicker wire has a higher current carrying capacity. Similar to haptic interface device <b>110</b>, haptic interface device <b>310</b> includes a user object <b>308</b> and an eddy current brake actuator <b>306</b> for providing haptic effects to the user. Computer <b>320</b>/controller <b>304</b> directly controls and processes all signals to and from haptic interface device <b>310</b>, i.e., computer <b>320</b> directly receives sensor signals from user object <b>308</b> and directly controls the forces output by eddy current brake actuator <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">User object <b>308</b> is a mouse-like device having a housing <b>328</b> that is preferably grasped or gripped and manipulated by a user. By &#x201c;grasp,&#x201d; it is meant that users may releasably engage a portion of the object in some fashion, such as by hand, with their fingertips, etc. Mouse-like user object <b>308</b> rests on a ground surface <b>324</b> such as a tabletop, mousepad, or a platform. A user grasps mouse-like user object <b>308</b> and moves mouse-like user object <b>308</b> in a planar workspace on the surface <b>324</b> as indicated by arrows <b>325</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Mouse-like user object <b>308</b> includes and one or more sensors <b>332</b> that sense the position or motion of the mouse, e.g., the housing <b>328</b>, in its planar degrees of freedom along the X and Y axes and provide signals to controller <b>304</b> including information representative of the position or motion. Sensors suitable for detecting planar motion of a tactile mouse include digital optical encoders frictionally coupled to a rotating ball or cylinder, as is well known to those skilled in the art. Optical sensor systems, linear optical encoders, potentiometers, optical sensors, velocity sensors, acceleration sensors, strain gauge, or other types of sensors can also be used, and either relative sensors which detect a change in position or absolute sensors which track the absolute position of mouse-like user object <b>308</b> with reference to a particular predefined workspace can be provided. For example, an optical sensor that has no moving mouse ball component may be used, where the optical sensor detects motion of the mouse relative to the planar support surface by optically taking and storing a number of images of the surface and comparing those images over time to determine if the mouse has moved. For example, the IFeel&#x2122; mouse device from Logitech Corporation uses this type of sensor. An optional sensor interface (not shown) can be used to convert sensor signals to signals that can be interpreted by controller <b>304</b>, as is well known to those skilled in the art.</p>

Eddy current brake actuator <b>306</b> includes an elongated conductor <b>312</b> and electromagnetic magnet <b>314</b> that defines a central passageway <b>316</b>. Conductor <b>312</b> is coupled to user object <b>308</b> such that when a user manipulates user object <b>308</b>, conductor <b>112</b> moves within passageway <b>316</b> of magnet <b>314</b> and a magnetic field created by magnet <b>314</b> imparts a resistive force or drag on conductor <b>312</b> and thereby provides haptic effects to the user. Computer <b>320</b>, via controller <b>304</b>, varies the magnetic field created by magnet <b>314</b> in order to produce transient haptic effects.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment, user object <b>308</b> may be a modified EV Lite&#x2122; device manufactured by CAE Healthcare of Montreal, Calif. The EV Lite&#x2122; device uses mouse tracking or position sensors to estimate insertion and twist on an elongated rod inserted through a continuous channel or passageway <b>330</b> formed through housing <b>328</b>. When modified for use herein, a conductive rod <b>312</b> is inserted through the continuous channel <b>330</b> of the EV Lite&#x2122; device housing. Rod <b>312</b> is formed from a conductive material such as but not limited to aluminum, gold, silver, copper, or magnesium.

Controller <b>304</b> uses the sensor signals from user object <b>308</b> to control the graphical environment on display <b>302</b> as well as to vary the magnetic field created by magnet <b>314</b> in order to generate transient haptic effects on user object <b>308</b> and provide haptic feedback to the user that relates to the amount of force applied to the user object. Thus images are displayed and/or modified on the display <b>302</b> of the computer <b>320</b> in response to manipulations of mouse-like user object <b>308</b>, and at the same time relevant haptic feedback related to the force applied to mouse-like user object <b>308</b> is provided to the user. The user experiences the forces generated on mouse-like user object <b>308</b> as realistic simulations of force sensations such as clicks or detents, jolts, vibrations, and the like.
