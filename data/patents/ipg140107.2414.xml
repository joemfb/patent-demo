<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current producing fuel cells are well known in the prior art. U.S. Pat. No. 7,018,733 to Seguira, for example, discloses a cathode flow plate and an anode flow plate parallel to the cathode flow plate. Each of the flow plates defines a collector face and a membrane face. Each of the collector faces defines a plurality of cooling channels. Each of the membrane faces defines a plurality of active channels for presenting fluid for reaction. One of the collector face and the membrane face of each of the flow plates defines a plurality of transport channels for moving fluid to and from the active channels. Each of the flow plates defines a center axis extending centrally therethrough and perpendicular to the membrane face and the collector face.</p>
