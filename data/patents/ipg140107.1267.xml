<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates to connection fixtures of the type for attaching to a structure to be lifted to facilitate the lifting thereof. The present disclosure further relates to a method of use of such connection fixtures.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There are presently a number of means available for lifting heavy structural elements. For example, large structural steel panels of the type used in the construction of large industrial facilities are commonly lifted by bolting a connection fixture to the panel to which lifting cables can be attached. Such lifting cables are operated from above by lifting devices such as cranes, hoists, winches, and the like. Frequently a spreader bar, also referred to as a spreader beam or a lifting beam, is suspended from the connection device and the lifting cables attach the load to the spreader bar.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Although the use of bolt-on connection fixtures with such devices is quite simple and has been in use for many years, it has been found that this still leaves much to be desired in terms of precise, safe and ergonomic operation. Having to manually install bolts to attach the connection fixture to each panel is extremely time-consuming and fraught with potential for human error as well as repetitive stress injury. From the perspective of the construction workers, it would be desirable to have a way to attach the connection fixture which would avoid the use of bolts. From an economic perspective, it would further be desirable to have a way to facilitate the attachment of the connection fixture without the time-consuming procedure of installing individual bolts.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In one aspect, a connection fixture is provided capable of engaging holes in an upper horizontal lip of a structure to be lifted. The connection fixture includes an outer angle iron and an inner angle iron which attach to one another in a mating relationship wherein the outer angle iron and the inner angle iron are slideable with respect to one another between an open position and a closed position. Each of the outer angle iron and the inner angle iron are formed of a length of structural angle having a vertical portion having a shackle receiving hole therein and a horizontal portion. The horizontal portion of the outer angle iron has a plurality of pins distributed along the length thereof protruding upwardly. A plurality of fasteners is attachable to the vertical portion of the outer angle iron such that the bushings when attached protrude inwardly from the vertical portion of the outer angle iron. The inner angle iron has a plurality of holes in the horizontal portion of the inner angle iron distributed along the length thereof which align with the plurality of pins protruding from the horizontal portion of the outer angle iron. The vertical portion of the inner angle iron has a plurality of vertical slots distributed along the length thereof which align with the plurality of fasteners attachable to the vertical portion of the outer angle iron. The outer angle iron and the inner angle iron each has a shackle receiving hole through which a shackle can be installed when the connection fixture is in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In another aspect, a method is provided for securing the connection fixture to an upper horizontal lip of a structure to be lifted wherein the upper horizontal lip has a plurality of holes therein. The method includes sliding the inner angle iron upward with respect to the outer angle iron thereby providing space between the horizontal portions of the inner angle iron and the outer angle iron; upwardly inserting the plurality of pins protruding upwardly from the horizontal portion of the outer angle iron into a plurality of holes in the upper horizontal lip of the structure to be lifted; and sliding the inner angle iron downward with respect to the outer angle iron into a closed position. In the closed position, the plurality of pins passes through the upper horizontal lip of the structure to be lifted and the horizontal portion of the inner angle iron; the upper horizontal lip of the structure to be lifted is held in intimate contact between the horizontal portions of the inner angle iron and the outer angle iron; and the shackle receiving holes of the inner angle iron and the outer angle iron are aligned. At this point, a shackle can be attached to the connection fixture through the shackle receiving holes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In yet another aspect, a connection fixture is provided capable of engaging holes in a structure to be lifted without an upper horizontal lip. The connection fixture includes a first planar element having a shackle receiving hole therein and a plurality of pins distributed along the length thereof; and a second planar element having a shackle receiving hole therein and having a plurality of pin receiving holes distributed along the length thereof. The first planar element and the second planar element are capable of mating with one another in such a way that the pins of the first planar element are positionable to align with the plurality of holes in the second planar element and the shackle receiving holes of the first planar element are positionable to align with the shackle receiving holes of the second planar element.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet another aspect, a connection fixture is provided capable of engaging a structure. The connection fixture includes a first structural angle iron having first and second portions, and a second structural angle iron having first and second portions. The first portion of the first structural angle iron has a shackle-receiving hole. The second portion of the first structural angle iron extends at a first angle from the first portion and has a plurality of pins distributed along the length of the second portion and protruding in a direction generally parallel to the first portion. The first portion of the second structural angle iron has a shackle-receiving hole, and the second portion of the second structural angle iron extends from the first portion at the first angle and has a plurality of holes distributed along the length thereof. The first portions of the first and second structural angle irons are slideably connected to one another such that the second portion of the first structural angle iron is configured to be slideably translated toward the second portion of the second structural angle iron to insert the plurality of pins of the first structural angle iron into the plurality of holes of the second structural angle iron and align the shackle-receiving holes of the first and second structural angle irons with the lip of the structure disposed between the second portions of the first and second structural angle irons.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A connection fixture is provided which can be securely connected to a lip of a structure to facilitate lifting of the structure. One embodiment of a connection fixture <b>10</b> for engaging holes in an upper horizontal lip of a structure <b>17</b> to be lifted is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates the device in the open position, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the device in the closed position, as will be described further herein. The connection fixture <b>10</b> includes a length of structural angle referred to as an outer angle iron <b>12</b> and a length of structural angle referred to as an inner angle iron <b>14</b> between which can be securely captured an upper horizontal lip of a structure to be lifted, as will be described further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The outer angle iron <b>12</b> and the inner angle iron <b>14</b> are formed of a metallic material selected from the group consisting of iron, steel, aluminum, and alloys thereof. The metallic material is extruded and finished by milling to the exact desired dimensions. Each of the outer angle iron <b>12</b> and the inner angle iron <b>14</b> has a cross-section which is generally L-shaped, by which is meant that the structural angle has a vertical portion and a horizontal portion which intersect to form a lower right angle. The outer angle iron <b>12</b> has a horizontal portion <b>12</b>A and a vertical portion <b>12</b>B. Likewise, the inner angle iron <b>14</b> has a horizontal portion <b>14</b>A and a vertical portion <b>14</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In one embodiment, the outer angle iron <b>12</b> and the inner angle iron <b>14</b> have similar lengths. In one embodiment, the length of the outer angle iron <b>12</b> and the length of the inner angle iron <b>14</b> are each from 16 in (40.6 cm) to 24 in (61.0 cm). In one embodiment, the vertical portion <b>12</b>B of the outer angle iron <b>12</b> and the vertical portion <b>14</b>B of the inner angle iron <b>14</b> are each from 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) in height. In one embodiment, the horizontal portion <b>12</b>A of the outer angle iron <b>12</b> and the horizontal portion <b>14</b>A of the inner angle iron <b>14</b> are each from 5 to 6 inches (12.7 to 15.2 cm) in depth. In one embodiment, the vertical and horizontal portions of the outer angle iron <b>12</b> and the inner angle iron <b>14</b> are each from 0.375 to 0.5 inches (0.95 to 1.3 cm) in thickness. These dimensions are provided for example only, and are nonlimiting.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The outer angle iron <b>12</b> and the inner angle iron <b>14</b> can be mated such that the inner angle iron <b>14</b> is positioned within the right angle of the outer angle iron <b>12</b>, and the vertical and horizontal portions of the inner angle iron are positioned adjacent the vertical and horizontal portions of the outer angle iron. This is referred to herein as a &#x201c;mating relationship.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The horizontal portion <b>12</b>A of the outer angle iron <b>12</b> has a plurality of pins <b>16</b> distributed along the length thereof protruding upwardly from the horizontal portion. Said pins <b>16</b> can be integrally formed as part of the outer angle iron <b>12</b>. Alternatively, the pins <b>16</b> can be threaded fasteners such that they can be inserted into corresponding threaded holes in the horizontal portion <b>12</b>A. The horizontal portion <b>14</b>A of the inner angle iron <b>14</b> has a plurality of holes <b>18</b> distributed along the length thereof in positions corresponding to the pins <b>16</b> protruding from the horizontal portion <b>12</b>A of the outer angle iron <b>12</b>. The dimensions of the pins <b>16</b> and the holes <b>18</b> are such that the pins <b>16</b> fit within the holes <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The vertical portion <b>14</b>B of the inner angle iron <b>14</b> has a plurality of vertical slots <b>20</b> distributed along the length thereof. The vertical portion <b>12</b>B of the outer angle iron <b>12</b> has a plurality of openings located at lengthwise positions corresponding to the plurality of vertical slots <b>20</b>. When the inner angle iron <b>14</b> is positioned in a mating relationship with the outer angle iron <b>12</b>, the openings are accessible through the vertical slots <b>20</b>. Fasteners such as threaded bushings <b>22</b> can be installed in the openings which may be threaded openings through the vertical slots <b>20</b>, thus securing the outer angle iron <b>12</b> and the inner angle iron <b>14</b> to one another. When attached, the bushings <b>22</b> protrude inwardly from the vertical portion <b>12</b>B of the outer angle iron <b>12</b>. The tension applied by the bushings <b>22</b> when the bushings are properly installed is such that the inner angle iron <b>14</b> is retained in a vertically slideable relationship with respect to the outer angle iron <b>12</b>, i.e., the inner angle iron <b>14</b> is able to slide up and down vertically with respect to the outer angle iron <b>12</b>, with little or no relative horizontal motion. In other words, the vertical portions of the inner and outer angle irons are slideably connected to one another such that the horizontal portion of the outer angle iron is configured to be translated toward the horizontal portion of the inner angle iron to insert the plurality of pins of the outer angle iron into the plurality of holes of the inner angle iron and align the shackle-receiving holes of the inner and outer angle irons with the lip of the structure disposed between the horizontal portions of the inner and outer angle irons. When the inner angle iron <b>14</b> is positioned at the highest position relative to the outer angle iron <b>12</b>, the horizontal portion <b>14</b>A is well above the horizontal portion <b>12</b>A such that a gap <b>36</b>A is provided between the pins <b>16</b> and the horizontal portion <b>14</b>A. Gap <b>36</b>A provides sufficient clearance such that the upper horizontal lip of the structure to be lifted fits therein. This is referred to herein as the &#x201c;open position&#x201d; of the connection fixture. When the inner angle iron <b>14</b> is positioned at the lowest position relative to the outer angle iron <b>12</b>, the pins <b>16</b> fit within the holes <b>18</b> of the horizontal portion <b>14</b>A. A smaller gap <b>36</b>B is provided between the horizontal portion <b>12</b>A and the horizontal portion <b>14</b>A. Gap <b>36</b>B is sufficient merely to fit the upper horizontal lip of the structure to be lifted therein during use of the connection fixture.
