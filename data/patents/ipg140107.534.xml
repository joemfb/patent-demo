<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows, in a perspective view, a hinge <b>1</b> with an arrangement <b>10</b> for damping and/or retarding a movable part and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a partial longitudinal cross-section of such a hinge <b>1</b> in connection with such a damping arrangement <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The hinge <b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> is a pot hinge. It has two hinge legs <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> of which one (<b>2</b>) is attached for example to a furniture body and the other (<b>3</b>) to a pivotable door of a furniture body. The two hinge legs <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> are pivotally interconnected by means of two hinge levers <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>. The pivot angle of the hinge <b>1</b> is limited by the open and closed end positions of the hinge <b>1</b> and is for example 110 degrees. The hinge leg <b>2</b> to be attached to the furniture body is in the representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a mounting leg <b>2</b>. The hinge leg <b>3</b> to be attached to the door includes a hinge pot <b>6</b> with a flange <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The damping arrangement <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> in an exploded view. It comprises a housing <b>20</b>, a cylinder-piston unit <b>40</b> and a pressure member <b>50</b>. It is centered on the hinge pot <b>6</b> by means of an adapter <b>32</b> including a guide lug <b>33</b> and two guide surfaces <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> and can be mounted to the pivotable door panel of the furniture body for example outside of the hinge pot <b>6</b> by means of a mounting flange <b>11</b>. The damping arrangement <b>10</b> however may also be attached to the hinge <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the exemplary embodiment, the damping arrangement <b>10</b> has a maximum overall length of 50 millimeters and a width of 45 millimeters in the area of the mounting flange <b>11</b>. The stroke of the pressure member <b>50</b> relative to the housing <b>20</b> is for example 12 millimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The housing <b>20</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as an individual component is an injection molded part consisting for example of a thermoplastic material. It may also consist of aluminum or an aluminum alloy. It has a semi-oval interior space <b>21</b> which is open toward the bottom and toward the front end <b>22</b>. The wall <b>23</b> of the interior space <b>21</b> includes two oppositely arranged guide grooves <b>24</b>, which extend to the front end <b>22</b>. Their length is about 25 millimeter and their height is about 1.3 millimeter. The guide grooves <b>24</b> are for example 1 millimeter deep. The distance between the opposite areas <b>26</b>, <b>27</b> of the inner wall <b>23</b> is in the exemplary embodiment 12 millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The closed rear end wall <b>28</b> of the housing <b>20</b> is provided with an accommodation recess <b>29</b> oriented toward the interior space <b>21</b> as well as with reinforcement ribs <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The housing <b>20</b> has a bottom plate <b>38</b>, which is provided with openings and which comprises an adapter area <b>32</b> including a guide lug <b>33</b> which is formed integrally with the housing <b>20</b> and projects therefrom. The adapter area <b>32</b> which here is in the form of an accommodation recess extends normal to the vertical longitudinal center plane of the arrangement <b>10</b>. The vertical center plane is also normal to the support plane <b>15</b> and includes the center axis <b>18</b>. In the direction of the center axis <b>18</b>, the adapter area <b>32</b> is longer, for example by 6%, than the edge <b>7</b> of the hinge pot <b>6</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the assembled state, the adapter area <b>32</b> extends around the edge <b>7</b> at least in some areas. The inner surface of the adapter area <b>32</b> which faces the guide lug <b>33</b> and extends normal to the support plane <b>15</b> is a guide surface <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The centering lug <b>33</b> delimits the adapter area <b>32</b> and is aligned for example with the support plane <b>15</b> of the damper arrangement. In the exemplary embodiment, it has an at least approximately parallelepiped shape with a guide surface <b>35</b> which is oriented normal to the vertical longitudinal center plane of the arrangement <b>10</b> and normal to the support plane. But it may also have a cylindrical shape with a circular, oval or elliptical cross-section. With such an embodiment, the guide surface <b>35</b> of the adapter are 32 faces the outer surface of the guide lug <b>33</b>. At least the guide surface area <b>35</b> of the guide leg <b>33</b> facing the rear end wall <b>3</b> of the hinge pot <b>6</b> may also be inclined so that the head cross-section of the guide lug <b>33</b> is smaller than the first end cross-section at the bottom plate <b>38</b>. The two guide surfaces <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> are oriented at least approximately opposite each other. This means that their normal surface vectors point in opposite directions wherein however the individual normal vector may deviate from this direction by an angle of up to 30 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The length of the bottom plate <b>38</b> in the direction of the center axis <b>18</b> corresponds in the exemplary embodiment to half the length of the housing <b>20</b>. The bottom plate <b>38</b> comprises additionally the mounting flange <b>11</b> which has in the representation of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> four through-bores <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>. Two throughbores <b>13</b> are disposed on the extension of the adapter area <b>32</b>, the other two throughbores <b>14</b> are disposed outside the adapter area <b>32</b> displaced for example in the longitudinal direction of the damping arrangement <b>10</b>. The throughbores <b>13</b> serve for example the reduction of the use of material. The damping arrangement <b>10</b> however may also be attached to the hinge <b>1</b> or to the door panel outside the hinge <b>1</b> for example by means of screws which extend through the throughbores <b>13</b>. The damping arrangement <b>10</b> may be mounted to the furniture piece by screws extending through the throughbores <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The pressure member <b>50</b> is a pot-shaped component which is open at one side thereof. It is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as an individual part. The pressure member <b>50</b> has for example in the direction of the longitudinal axis <b>58</b> a length of 95% of the length of the guide groove <b>24</b>. Its wall thickness is for example 1 millimeter. The outer surface <b>51</b> of the pressure member <b>50</b> includes two guide tracks <b>52</b> which are oriented in the longitudinal direction and which extend to a point in the proximity of the opening <b>53</b>. The height of these guide tracks <b>52</b> is for example 0.7 millimeter and their length is half the length of the pressure member <b>50</b>. By means of these guide tracks <b>52</b>, the pressure member <b>50</b> is supported in the guide grooves <b>24</b> of the housing <b>20</b>. Because of this large guide length, a cogging of the pressure member <b>50</b> in the housing <b>20</b> is prevented. The vertical and the lateral plays of the pressure member <b>50</b> in the housing <b>20</b> are for example in each case 0.5 millimeter. This allows a maximally inclined position of the pressure member <b>50</b> with respect to the center axis <b>18</b> of the damping arrangement <b>10</b> of 2.4 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">At the bottom side <b>54</b> of the pressure member <b>10</b> an elongated opening <b>55</b> as arranged. Its length as shown in the exemplary embodiment is for example four thirds of the maximum stroke of the pressure member <b>50</b>. The elongated opening is for example four millimeter wide. In the assembled state, the elongated opening <b>55</b> forms for example with a stop pin <b>39</b> arranged in the housing a stroke limit.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The end wall <b>56</b> opposite the opening <b>53</b> is provided in the exemplary embodiment with a central section <b>57</b> which extends normal to the longitudinal axis <b>58</b> of the pressure member <b>50</b>. Above this central section <b>57</b>, a section <b>59</b> is provided which is inclined with respect to the central section <b>57</b> by for example 22 degrees, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the lower area, the end wall <b>56</b> has a curved section <b>61</b>. The end wall may also be curved convexly about one or two axes; it may include an inclined plane etc. At its inside <b>62</b>, the front end wall <b>56</b> includes an accommodation recess <b>63</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The accommodation recess <b>29</b> of the housing <b>20</b> and the accommodation recess <b>63</b> of the pressure member <b>50</b> support the cylinder piston unit <b>40</b>. The cylinder-piston unit <b>40</b> comprises a cylinder <b>41</b> and a piston which is connected to a piston rod extending from the cylinder <b>41</b>. In the cylinder <b>41</b>, which is for example filled with an oil, the spring-biased piston, which includes for example throttle valves, separates a displacement chamber from a compensation chamber. The cylinder <b>41</b> is disposed in the accommodation recess <b>29</b> with radial play. The piston rod <b>42</b> is accommodated in the accommodation recess <b>63</b> also with radial play. The radial play of the cylinder-piston unit <b>40</b> with respect to the housing <b>20</b> and the pressure member <b>50</b> is for example greater than the play of the pressure member <b>50</b> relative to the housing <b>20</b>. The cylinder-piston unit <b>40</b> may also be installed reversed in the damper arrangement <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For the assembly of the damper arrangement <b>10</b>, first the cylinder piston unit <b>40</b> is inserted into the housing <b>20</b>. Then the pressure member <b>50</b> is installed and engaged by the lug. The installation may also be performed in another sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The damper arrangement <b>10</b> consequently consists only of three parts, that is, the housing <b>20</b>, the cylinder-piston unit <b>40</b> and the pressure member <b>50</b>. It is inexpensive to manufacture and can be installed without special tools.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It is also possible to form the pressure member <b>50</b> and the cylinder <b>41</b> of the cylinder-piston unit <b>40</b> as a single component. Then the elongated opening <b>55</b> is a cavity in the cylinder housing oriented in the longitudinal direction of the cylinder. The piston rod <b>42</b> is supported in the embodiment in the housing <b>20</b>. Such a damper arrangement comprises only two parts.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The assembled damper arrangement <b>10</b> may be placed with its support plane <b>15</b> for example onto the door panel. Herein the damper arrangement <b>10</b> is aligned by means of the guide surface <b>34</b> of the adapter area <b>32</b> with the edge <b>7</b> of the hinge pot <b>6</b>. In addition, the guide lug <b>33</b> extends into the hinge pot <b>6</b>. The guide surface <b>35</b> of the guide lug <b>33</b> may abut the rear end wall <b>9</b> of the hinge pot <b>6</b> or it may be spaced therefrom for example by up to one millimeter. The guide leg <b>33</b> forms in this way a centering member by which the position of the damper arrangement <b>10</b> relative to the hinge is determined. Lateral movement or pivoting of the damping arrangement <b>10</b> relative to the hinge <b>1</b> is prevented except within the position tolerance. The adapter area <b>32</b> surrounds, with its guide surfaces <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> disposed at different sides, the edge <b>7</b> of the hinge pot <b>6</b>. The damping arrangement <b>10</b> is mounted to the door panel for example by means of screws which extend through the throughbores <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Upon closing the furniture door, the two hinge legs <b>2</b>, <b>3</b> pivot relative to each other. The pressure member <b>50</b> approaches the mounting leg <b>2</b>. As soon as the pressure member <b>50</b> contacts the mounting leg <b>2</b> or the outer hinge lever <b>4</b>, it is moved inwardly. In the process, it slides along the hinge leg <b>2</b> or the outer hinge lever <b>4</b>. The pressure member <b>50</b> moves, in the pivot angle next to the closed end position of the hinge <b>1</b>, the piston rod <b>42</b> together with the piston inwardly. In this procedure, the elongated opening <b>55</b> moves along relative to the stop pin <b>39</b>. With a possible off-center force application, the guide structure <b>24</b>, <b>52</b> takes up the transverse force components so that the cylinder piston unit <b>40</b> is subjected to a force only in the direction parallel to the piston rod <b>42</b>. The piston rod seal is therefore not subjected to transverse forces which could cause leakages of the cylinder piston unit <b>40</b>. Upon inward movement of the piston, for example a hydraulic or pneumatic medium is displaced in a throttled manner and the speed of the door panel is reduced. This retardation is for example greater the greater the angular pivot speed of the door panel is. The force transmitted to the cylinder piston unit <b>40</b> is transferred to the housing <b>20</b> and from there, via the mounting flange <b>11</b>, to the furniture door.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Upon opening the door, the pressure member <b>50</b> is moved away from the hinge leg <b>2</b> or from the outer hinge lever <b>4</b>. For example, the spring arranged in the cylinder <b>41</b> pushes the piston with the piston rod <b>42</b> and the pressure member <b>50</b> outwardly. The elongated opening <b>55</b> moves thereby along the stop pin <b>39</b> until its rear edge <b>64</b> abuts the stop pin <b>39</b>. The stop pin <b>39</b> now prevents further outward movement of the pressure member <b>50</b>. It forms therefore an end stop for the extended position of the damper arrangement <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The damping arrangement (<b>10</b>) can be arranged on all pot hinges <b>1</b> whose rim or edge <b>7</b> in the direction of the center axis <b>18</b> is shorter than the length of the adapter area <b>32</b> in this direction.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows another embodiment of the hinge <b>1</b> including a damping arrangement <b>10</b>. The hinge pot <b>6</b> has for example a rear end wall <b>9</b> provided with a recess. The damping arrangement <b>10</b> has two guide pins <b>12</b>, <b>36</b>, which are arranged at the side of the front end opening <b>25</b> of the housing <b>20</b>. They project for example in the direction of the end wall <b>56</b> of the pressure member <b>50</b> by three millimeters. The length of the guide pins <b>12</b>, <b>36</b> normal to the support plane <b>15</b> corresponds to the length of the guide lug <b>33</b> shown in the first exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a perspective bottom view of a damping arrangement <b>10</b> including an adapter area <b>32</b> with two non-centered guide pins <b>12</b>, <b>36</b>. The cylinder piston unit <b>40</b> is disposed in the housing <b>20</b>. Herein the cylinder <b>41</b> is accommodated in the accommodation recess <b>29</b> with radial play. The piston rod <b>42</b> is supported in the pressure member <b>50</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The pressure member <b>50</b> is supported in guide grooves <b>24</b> of the housing <b>20</b> so as to be slideable in the direction of the center axis <b>18</b>. At its bottom side <b>54</b>, the pressure member <b>50</b> has an elongated opening <b>55</b> into which a stop pin <b>39</b>, which is integrally formed with the housing <b>20</b>, projects. The mounting flange <b>11</b> of the damping arrangement <b>10</b> has four throughbores <b>13</b>, <b>14</b> of which in each case two (<b>13</b>) are accommodated in the adapter area <b>32</b> and the two others (<b>14</b>) are arranged outside the adapter area <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The assembly and installation of the damping arrangement <b>10</b> is performed as described earlier. After installation, the damping arrangement <b>10</b> is disposed on the side of the door panel, for example on the pot hinge <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The adapter area <b>32</b> and the guide lug <b>33</b> engage therebetween the edge <b>7</b> of the hinge pot <b>6</b> adjacent the rear end wall <b>9</b> thereof. In this way, the damping arrangement <b>10</b> can be mounted without the need for any fitting work. As a result, the damping arrangement <b>10</b> can be added to a hinge <b>1</b> without adaptation work. In the exemplary embodiment, the two guide pins <b>12</b>, <b>36</b> are disposed, after installation, in an area outside the hinge pot <b>6</b>. This damping arrangement <b>10</b> can therefore be used in connection with pot hinges <b>1</b> whose hinge leg <b>2</b> mounted on the furniture body extends with the hinge <b>1</b> pivoted to a closest state over the length of the hinge pot <b>6</b> in the direction of the center axis <b>18</b> by more than 90%. Of course, the damper arrangement <b>10</b> may also be used in connection with other types of pot hinges <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The adapter area <b>32</b> may extend around the edge <b>7</b> of the hinge pot <b>6</b>. To this end, it may have for example three guide surface areas of which one is for example arranged like the guide surface <b>34</b> shown in the first embodiment. The two other guide surface areas are then arranged opposite each other at the edge areas oriented in the longitudinal direction of the hinge <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Instead of the arrangement <b>10</b> as described, it is also possible to install a retardation arrangement wherein for example air is discharged from the cylinder compression chamber to the ambient upon actuation of the arrangement. The return movement of the retardation arrangement occurs for example by means of a spring.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The arrangement for damping and/or retarding <b>10</b> may also be arranged at an open end position of two parts which are movable relative to each other such as a slide or pivot door.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Also, a combination of the various exemplary embodiments is possible.</p>
