<heading id="h-0004" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The mammalian mismatch repair system stabilizes the genome by correcting DNA biosynthetic errors, preventing illegitimate recombination events, and participating in the cellular response to certain types of DNA damage (reviewed in (1-5)). Mismatch repair deficiency is the cause of hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, and may also be involved in the development of a subset of sporadic tumors (6).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The human mismatch recognition activities MutS&#x3b1; (MSH2-MSH6) and MutS&#x3b2; (MSH2-MSH3) differ in their substrate specificities: MutS&#x3b1; recognizes base-base mismatches and some insertion-deletion (I/D) mismatches, whereas MutS&#x3b2; predominantly processes I/D substrates (1-5). MutS&#x3b1; is also capable of recognizing certain types of DNA damage and participates in the checkpoint response to such lesions (7), while MutS&#x3b2; may cooperate with the nucleotide excision repair machinery in the repair of interstrand cross-links (8, 9). Thus, there is substantial overlap between substrates recognized and processed by these two activities, but the determinants that govern whether a particular lesion is processed by MutS&#x3b1; or MutS&#x3b2; are not known.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Although MutS&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b2; are generally regarded as genetic stabilization activities, both heterodimers have been implicated in the production of certain mutations. MutS&#x3b1; participates in the somatic hypermutation phase of immunoglobulin gene affinity maturation (10), and MutS&#x3b2; is required for the triplet repeat expansions that are responsible for a number of neurodegenerative diseases (11).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Heteroduplex repair reactions initiated by MutS&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b2; have been reconstituted in purified systems that also contain MutL&#x3b1; (MLH1-PMS2), exonuclease 1 (Exo1), RPA, PCNA, RFC, and DNA polymerase &#x3b4; (12-16). Initiation of repair in the MutS&#x3b1;-dependent system involves activation of a latent endonuclease of MutL&#x3b1; in a reaction that requires a mismatch, MutS&#x3b1;, RFC, PCNA and ATP (16). Action of the MutL&#x3b1; endonuclease is directed to the heteroduplex strand that contains a pre-existing break and is biased to the distal side of the mismatch to yield a molecule in which the mismatch is bracketed by strand breaks. This multiply incised intermediate serves as substrate for Exo1, which is activated by MutS&#x3b1; in a mismatch-dependent manner, leading to mismatch removal. The ensuing gap is filled by RPA and repaired by DNA polymerase &#x3b4; in a reaction that also depends on PCNA and RFC. Although a MutS&#x3b2;-dependent repair reaction directed by a 5&#x2032;-strand break has been reconstituted from purified components (15), it is not known whether activation of the MutL&#x3b1; endonuclease occurs in a MutS&#x3b2;-dependent manner. Coordination of these activities during the course of repair is presumably mediated by a temporally evolving set of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. The most thoroughly studied of the multi-protein assemblies involved in mismatch repair have been the MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; complex that assembles on heteroduplex DNA (17-19) and the MutS&#x3b1;-PCNA complex that has been observed both in solution and on DNA (20, 21). While the former complex is generally believed to play an important role in the reaction (22), disruption of the MutS&#x3b1;-PCNA interaction confers only a partial mismatch repair defect in vivo and in vitro (20, 21, 23). Although the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA and MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; complexes have been the subject of only limited study (23-26), yeast strains carrying mutations in the PCNA-binding motif of MSH3 display hypermutability similar to that of MSH3 null (23). Also, little is known regarding the functional significance of the MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction. We demonstrate here that MutS&#x3b2; differs from MutS&#x3b1; in the manner that it interacts with PCNA and MutL&#x3b1;.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one aspect, the invention includes methods for testing an agent for the ability to inhibit MutS&#x3b2;, by forming an assay that includes the agent, MutL&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b2;, and evaluating interaction between MutL&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b2; in the assay. The methods may also involve testing the agent for the ability to inhibit the interaction between MutL&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b1; by forming an assay including the agent, MutL&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b1;, and evaluating interaction between MutL&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b1; in the assay.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">MutS&#x3b1; (MSHS2-MSH6) and MutS&#x3b2; (MSH2-MSH3) are the primary DNA mismatch recognition factors in humans. Whereas MutS&#x3b1; recognizes and processes base-base mismatches and some insertion-deletion loops, MutS&#x3b2; predominantly recognizes insertion-deletion loops. These proteins are required for the maintenance of genome integrity. Surprisingly, MutS&#x3b2; has been implicated in the somatic and intergenerational expansion of (CAG)<sub>n </sub>repeats that cause hereditary neurological diseases such as myotonic dystrophy, Huntington's disease, Kennedy's disease, and several types of spinocerebellar ataxia.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In light of the foregoing, it is envisioned that inhibitors of MutS&#x3b2; may suppress (CAG)<sub>n </sub>somatic expansion in affected individuals in order to delay the onset of or ameliorate neurodegenerative symptoms. However, a major obstacle to developing therapies that inhibit MutS&#x3b2; is that, because MutS&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b2; share significant homology, inhibitors of MutS&#x3b2; are likely to also affect MutS&#x3b1; Inhibition of MutS&#x3b1; function would be undesirable, because MutS&#x3b1; inactivation confers strong cancer predisposition. In contrast, MutS&#x3b2; inactivation in mice confers a relatively mild phenotype Inhibitors that selectively inhibit MutS&#x3b2; have yet to be identified.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Both MutS&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b2; activate a latent endonuclease in MutL&#x3b1; (MLH1-PMS2) in a reaction that requires the sliding clamp PCNA, the RFC clamp loader, and a mispaired DNA substrate. The interaction between MutS&#x3b1;/&#x3b2; and MutL&#x3b1; is considered to be essential for mismatch repair function. However, as described in the Examples below, we have discovered that the mechanisms of MutS&#x3b1;- and MutS&#x3b2;-mediated mismatch repair are substantially different. In particular, these proteins differ in their modes of interaction with PCNA and MutL&#x3b1;. Whereas MutS&#x3b1; can simultaneously associate with PCNA and MutL&#x3b1; because PCNA and MutL&#x3b1; bind independently to MutS&#x3b1;, PCNA competes with MutL&#x3b1; for binding to MutS&#x3b2; due to overlap in binding sites on the MSH3 subunit of MutS&#x3b2; for PCNA and MutL&#x3b1;. MSH3 PIP box mutations abolish MutS&#x3b2; interaction with both PCNA and MutL&#x3b1;, whereas PIP box mutations in MutS&#x3b1; do not interfere with MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction. Thus, it may be possible to identify small molecule inhibitors that interfere with MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction but do not substantially interfere with MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction, i.e., inhibitors that selectively target MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Our discovery of differences in the mode of interaction of MutS&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b2; with MutL&#x3b1; will facilitate the identification of selective inhibitors of the MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction. We intend to screen for specific inhibitors of MutS&#x3b2; function by identifying molecules that specifically inhibit MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction. We envisage that such inhibitors may fall into three types of inhibitors. One type of inhibitor would include molecules that bind MSH2 or MSH3, in regions removed from the MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction site, that affects MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction by allosteric effects. A second type of inhibitor could bind residues of MutS&#x3b2; and/or MutL&#x3b1; in the vicinity of the interaction interface responsible for MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction. A third type of inhibitor may bind to MLH1 or PMS2 in a manner that specifically attenuates MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction without substantially attenuating MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally, it is envisaged that screening for inhibitors having differential effects on MutS&#x3b1;/&#x3b2; interactions with MutL&#x3b1; will identify molecules that selectively interfere with MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction but not MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction. Such inhibitors may be used as laboratory reagents to study MutS&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b2; function in various DNA metabolic processes.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The Examples below describe suitable assays that may be performed in accordance with the method of the invention. However, it is envisioned that any method of screening an agent for its effect on MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction and MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction could be used in the methods of the invention, and would fall within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described in the Examples below, MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction and MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction may be assessed in the presence of a suitable heteroduplex DNA substrate. The DNA substrates for use in the methods and kits of the invention may be attached at one end to a solid support, such as a polystyrene microtiter plate. As one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate, any suitable solid support of any suitable material may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the Examples, it is proposed that the DNA substrate may be attached to a solid support either through interaction between a fluorescein label at one end with an anti-fluorescein antibody coating the solid support, or between a biotin tag at one end and streptavidin coating the solid support. However, it is envisaged that the DNA substrate may be attached using any chemistry suitable for attaching DNA to a solid support</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Suitable DNA substrates include those that comprise a MutS&#x3b2;- or MutS&#x3b1;-recognizable mismatch. A MutS&#x3b2;-recognizable mismatch includes an appropriate insertion/deletion mismatch. A MutS&#x3b1;-recognizable mismatch includes an appropriate base-base or insertion/deletion mismatch. The DNA substrates described in the Examples were approximately 200 bp long. However, DNA substrates of any suitable length may be used. Preferably, the DNA substrate is sufficiently long to allow formation of a ternary complex between the DNA, MutL&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b1; or MutS&#x3b2;.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In order to maintain the ternary complex to enhance detection, the free end of the DNA substrate, i.e, the end that is not attached to the solid support, may optionally be modified to include bound protein that promotes trapping of the MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; or MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; complex on the DNA. For example, the free end could be modified to include biotin that is in turn bound by monovalent avidin. Alternatively, the free end could be modified to include a label such as fluorescein at the free end, to which anti-fluorescein antibody may be bound. In yet another embodiment, the end may be modified to include an EcoRI site near the free terminus and a hydrolytically dead mutant of EcoRI endonuclease can be used to bind to the EcoRI site. It is envisioned that other proteins may be used to stabilize the ternary complex by binding at or near the free end of the DNA substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Any suitable method of detection may be used to detect MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction and MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction, including immunological or FRET-based methods.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The Examples also describe the direct detection of MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction or MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction, i.e., interaction that occurs in the absence of DNA. It is envisioned that these and any other suitable method of detecting direct MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction or MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction may be used to assay agents for the ability to affect MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction or MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">While the methods of the invention are most conveniently performed in a high-throughput format, the present invention is intended to encompass single assays as well.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The methods and kits of the invention can be used to screen any suitable agent for its ability to affect MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction or MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction. Suitable agents may include, for example, libraries of agents, e.g., libraries of small molecules. Suitably, the small molecules have a molecular weight of about 800 Daltons or less, but could also include small peptides with a mass somewhat greater than this value. The agents may be tested individually or initially, in pools of, for example, five or ten agents.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">An agent that is an inhibitor of MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; or MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction is one that reduces interaction relative to the interaction that takes place in the absence of the agent. For an agent to be identified as an inhibitor of MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; or MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction, it is not necessary that inhibition be 100%. Preferably, interaction is inhibited at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90% or more. An agent that is selective inhibitor of MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction inhibits MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction to a greater extent than it inhibits MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction. Preferably, inhibition of MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction is maximized and inhibition of MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction is minimized. However, an agent that affords less than 100% inhibition of MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction may still have therapeutic value, or can be modified to afford greater inhibition, while some inhibition of MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction may be acceptable, depending on the severity of the condition being treated. Most preferably, the selective inhibitor of MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction does not inhibit MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Protein-protein interactions are thought to coordinate the sequence of molecular events involved in DNA mismatch repair. A number of multi-protein assemblies have been documented in this system including MutS&#x3b1;-PCNA, MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA, MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1;, MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1;, MutL&#x3b1;-PCNA, MutS&#x3b1;-ExoI, MutL&#x3b1;-ExoI, and ExoI-PCNA (1-5). Of these, the MutS&#x3b1;-PCNA complex has received the most attention in the literature, but recent studies suggest that this interaction may play only a limited role in the error correction reaction (20, 21, 23).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Because MSH3, like MSH6, interacts with PCNA via a PIP box located near its N-terminus, it might be expected that the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex may display similar characteristics. However, the Examples below present results that indicate that this is not the case. The affinity of MutS&#x3b2; for PCNA is &#x2dc;8-fold higher than that of MutS&#x3b1;, a difference that may be necessitated by the fact that the MutS&#x3b2; levels in human cells are 5- to 8-fold lower than that of the MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer (30, 44). Furthermore, while the stoichiometry of the MutS&#x3b1;-PCNA complex is limited to 1:1 even when MutS&#x3b1; is in molar excess (21), as much as 20% of the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complexes are multivalent under conditions of MutS&#x3b2; excess. This valency difference could reflect steric factors in that MutS&#x3b2; is significantly smaller than MutS&#x3b1;. Despite these differences, complex formation between MutS&#x3b2; and PCNA does not significantly alter the affinity or specificity of MutS&#x3b2; for a -TG- insert, a property it shares with MutS&#x3b1;.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">However, the most striking difference between MutS&#x3b2; and MutS&#x3b1; is the finding described here that the modes of interaction of the two mismatch recognition activities with PCNA and MutL&#x3b1; differ dramatically. In contrast to MutS&#x3b1;, which can interact independently with PCNA and MutL&#x3b1;, interaction of these two proteins with MutS&#x3b2; occurs in an either/or fashion. As discussed above, MSH3 PIP box mutations compromise MutS&#x3b2; interaction with both PCNA and MutL&#x3b1;. Furthermore, PCNA competes with MutL&#x3b1; for binding to MutS&#x3b2; and inhibits ATP-dependent assembly of the DNA-MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; ternary complex, an effect that is reversed by p21, which is known to interact strongly with PCNA (45). The simplest interpretation of these results is that the MutS&#x3b2; motif(s) involved in its interaction with MutL&#x3b1; partially overlap with the MSH3 PIP box responsible for the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA interaction. It is noteworthy in this regard that an R-S-K/R-Y/F-F (SEQ ID NO: 1) sequence has been identified as a MutL&#x3b1; interaction motif in human Exo1 and BLM helicase (46). A similar highly conserved motif L-S-R-F-F (SEQ ID NO: 2) overlaps with the MSH3 PIP box (Q-A-V-L-S-R-F-F) (SEQ ID NO: 3), and may correspond to one component of the MutL&#x3b1; binding site within MutS&#x3b2;. To our knowledge, this is the first instance where residues within the PCNA-binding motif of a protein are also employed for interaction with a second activity.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Recently, Fishel and colleagues (47) have described an interaction between human MLH1 and a polypeptide corresponding to the N-terminal 250 residues of human MSH3; interaction of MLH1 with MSH2 was not observed in this study. These findings are consistent with those described here. By contrast, studies in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>(48) have implicated yMSH2 residues in the interaction of yMutS&#x3b1; with yMutL&#x3b1;, although mutational alteration of the yMSH2 residues in question did not result in an interaction defect as severe as that described in our study. It is thus conceivable that MSH2 sequence elements contribute to MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; interaction, but if this is the case, residues in the vicinity of the MSH3 PIP box must also be required.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Our finding that PCNA and MutL&#x3b1; interact in an either/or fashion with MutS&#x3b2; may reflect steric interference effects but could also be indicative of use of common interaction interfaces. For example, MutS&#x3b2; and MutL&#x3b1; interaction with a common PCNA motif would account for our findings, as would MutS&#x3b2; and PCNA interaction with a common interface on MutL&#x3b1;.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Since ATP-dependent assembly of a ternary complex involving heteroduplex DNA and a MutS and MutL homolog is believed to be a key step in the initiation of mismatch repair (3, 4), the inability of MutS&#x3b2; PIP box mutants to support MutL&#x3b1; endonuclease activation, mismatch-provoked excision and repair might be attributed to the inability of these mutants to support ternary complex formation. However, it is also possible that in contrast to the MutS&#x3b1;-initiated reaction, MutS&#x3b2; interaction with PCNA may be a key step in MutS&#x3b2;-initiated repair events. The pleiotropic nature of these mutants does not permit distinction between these possibilities, although our results almost certainly indicate that MutS&#x3b1;- and MutS&#x3b2;-initiated mismatch repair events proceed by distinct mechanisms.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Interestingly, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </i>studies have suggested that while PIP box integrity may be required for MSH3 function, it has only a limited role in MSH6 activity (20, 23). In an msh3 null background, the rate of frameshift mutagenesis within a (A)<sub>14</sub>:(T)<sub>14 </sub>run was &#x2dc;30-fold higher for an msh6&#x394; allele (1.5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) than for a msh6 PIP box mutant (5.2&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>) (23). By contrast, deletion of msh3 in an msh6 null background resulted in a mutation rate (1.5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>) only &#x2dc;2-3 fold higher than that observed upon inactivation of the MSH3 PIP-box (6.5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;4</sup>) (23). Our findings that MSH3 PIP-box mutations are pleiotropic may explain these observations.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A potential mechanistic implication of our findings is that whereas PCNA is required for both MutS&#x3b1;- and MutS&#x3b2;-dependent activation of MutL&#x3b1; endonuclease, a transient increase in local PCNA concentration could lead to specific destabilization of the MutL&#x3b1;-MutS&#x3b2;-DNA complex, thus aborting a MutS&#x3b2;-initiated event to allow a MutS&#x3b1;-dependent reaction to proceed unhindered. Since some I/D mispairs are subject to either MutS&#x3b1;- or MutS&#x3b2;-dependent repair (30), this type of PCNA-mediated switch might function to control processing of such lesions by a particular pathway.</p>

SPRS experiments were done on a Biacore 2000 (17,21) in a buffer composed of 25 mM HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl (unless otherwise indicated), 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1 mM dithiothreitol. Streptavidin sensor chips were derivatized with &#x2dc;200 response units of a 200 bp -TG- I/D heteroduplex, or an otherwise identical homoduplex DNA, via a 5&#x2032; biotin tag.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Far-western analyses were performed by spotting 0.25-4 pmol of the indicated proteins on a nitrocellulose membrane (Protran, Whatman) or by electrophoresing 2 pmol protein through a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, followed by transfer to nitrocellulose. After incubation in blocking buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 5% milk solids) for 1 hour at room temperature, the membrane was incubated overnight at 4&#xb0; C. with PCNA or MutL&#x3b1; in blocking buffer as indicated, followed by two buffer washes.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) experiments&#x2014;SAXS was performed on the Sibyls beamline 12.3.1 at ALS, Berkeley.

For SAXS-based stoichiometry measurements, scattering data were collected for mixtures of PCNA and MutS&#x3b2; (or MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28) in which PCNA concentration was varied (3.3-105 &#x3bc;M) at a fixed concentration of MutS&#x3b2; (10, 20 or 35 &#x3bc;M) or MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 (10 &#x3bc;M) in the buffer described above. Concentration-normalized scattering data were then used to derive forward scattering intensities I(0) (intensity at &#x3b8;=0&#xb0;) (32). The theoretical I(0) for a protein mixture was estimated as the sum of the expected I(0) contributions of each component of that mixture, the latter property being the product of mass fraction of the component and the I(0) value corresponding to its molecular mass. Since protein concentrations were much higher than the K<sub>d </sub>for MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA interaction, the limiting species was assumed to be present only in the (MutS&#x3b2;)<sub>n</sub>-PCNA complex.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Characterization of Interaction Between MutS&#x3b2; and PCNA</heading>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">MutS&#x3b2; interacts with PCNA via a conserved QXX(L/I)XXFF motif (SEQ ID NO: 6) that resides near the N-terminus of MSH3 (23, 24, 26), but the molecular nature of the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex has not been examined. To address the nature of this interaction as well as the functional consequences of its disruption, we constructed MSH3 variants in which the PCNA-binding motif (PIP box) was either deleted (MSH&#x3b2;&#x394;28) or altered by amino acid substitution mutation (MSH3-F27A-F28A) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). These variants were co-expressed with MSH2 and purified as stable heterodimers. Both mutant heterodimers display Stokes radii comparable to the wild type protein as determined by gel filtration chromatography (Table I).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Interactions between the MSH3 variants and PCNA were further characterized, and the results are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B-1E</figref>. DNA affinities of MutS&#x3b2;, MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28, and MutS&#x3b2;-F27A-F28A were determined by SPRS (Experimental Procedures) by flowing the proteins over a sensor chip derivatized with 200 bp homoduplex or -TG- I/D heteroduplex DNA Mass response units at saturation were recorded as a function of MutS&#x3b2; concentration and fit to a rectangular hyperbola to yield apparent affinities shown. PCNA effects on MutS&#x3b2;-DNA interaction were assessed by titration with MutS&#x3b2; in presence of 2.0 &#x3bc;M PCNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Interaction of PCNA with MutS&#x3b2; in the absence of DNA was evaluated by equilibrium gel filtration (Experimental Procedures).

Formation of the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex is associated with an increase in apparent Stokes' radius (open circles).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Interaction parameters of PCNA with DNA-bound MutS&#x3b2; were determined by SPRS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>).

Molar stoichiometries were calculated assuming that one RU of MutS&#x3b2; (232 kDa) corresponds to 0.37 RU for the PCNA trimer (86 kDa). Data were fit to a rectangular hyperbola, yielding an apparent K<sub>d </sub>of 0.02 &#x3bc;M, and a stoichiometry of 1 mole of PCNA per mole of MutS&#x3b2;.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">To determine whether these MSH3 mutations altered the mismatch recognition activity of MutS&#x3b2;, we used surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (SPRS) to measure affinities of MutS&#x3b2;, MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 and MutS&#x3b2;-F27A-F28A for a 200 bp -TG- dinucleotide I/D heteroduplex, or an otherwise identical homoduplex. Apparent affinities and specificities of the MutS&#x3b2; variants did not differ significantly from that obtained with the wild type protein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). Furthermore, wild type and mutant forms of MutS&#x3b2; dissociated with similar kinetics from heteroduplex DNA upon ATP challenge (not shown). The presence of 2.0 &#x3bc;M PCNA, a saturating concentration for MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex formation (see below), did not significantly alter the affinity or specificity of MutS&#x3b2; interaction with heteroduplex/homoduplex DNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex was characterized by the Hummel-Dreyer equilibrium gel filtration procedure that was previously employed to determine equilibrium parameters that govern formation of the MutS&#x3b1;-PCNA complex (21). The Hummel-Dreyer elution profile for MutS&#x3b2; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>) in the presence of 0.75 &#x3bc;M PCNA shows two distinct but overlapping peaks followed by a trough at &#x2dc;1.35 ml that represents depletion of PCNA from the running buffer due to complex formation with MutS&#x3b2;. Because the later eluting peak (1.14 ml) corresponds to free MutS&#x3b2;, we infer that earlier peak (1.1 ml) represents the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex. By contrast, MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 and MutS&#x3b2;-F27A-F28A elute as single peaks (1.14 ml) corresponding to uncomplexed MutS&#x3b2;. Furthermore, as judged by absence of a significant trough at 1.35 ml, the two mutant heterodimers fail to deplete PCNA from the equilibrating buffer, indicating that their ability to bind PCNA has been severely compromised. The extent of PCNA binding to MutS&#x3b2; was a hyperbolic function of PCNA concentration corresponding to an apparent K<sub>d </sub>of 0.10 &#x3bc;M and a stoichiometry of 0.8-0.9 PCNA trimer per MutS&#x3b2; heterodimer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). Formation of complex with PCNA increases the Stokes radius of MutS&#x3b2; from 64 &#x212b; to 74 &#x212b; (Table I).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">PCNA binding to DNA-bound MutS&#x3b2; was evaluated by SPRS. As determined by this procedure DNA-bound MutS&#x3b2; interacts with PCNA with an apparent K<sub>d </sub>of 0.020 &#x3bc;M and a stoichiometry of 1.1 mol of PCNA trimer per mol of MutS&#x3b2; heterodimer (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). Although MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 and MutS&#x3b2;-F27A-F28A efficiently bind heteroduplex DNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), PCNA interaction with the heteroduplex-bound mutant proteins was almost undetectable (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>). The apparent affinity of PCNA for DNA-bound MutS&#x3b2; as judged by SPRS is &#x2dc;5-fold higher than that for free MutS&#x3b2; as determined by the Hummel-Dreyer method. A similar difference has been observed for affinities of the MutS&#x3b1;-PCNA complex determined by the two methods (21), and is likely due to avidity or re-binding artifacts that are known to occur when multivalent species such as PCNA are present in the mobile phase of SPRS analysis (34).</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Characterization of Interaction of MutS&#x3b2; or MutS&#x3b1; PIP Box Mutants with MutL&#x3b1;</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">MutS&#x3b2; PIP Box Mutants are Defective in MutL&#x3b1; Interaction&#x2014;</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Interaction between MutS and MutL homologs has been documented in several systems (3, 4), but the nature of the human MutL&#x3b1;-MutS&#x3b2; complex has not been addressed. We have therefore used SPRS to examine the capacity of MutS&#x3b2; and its PIP box mutants to support formation of a MutL&#x3b1;-MutS&#x3b2;-DNA ternary complex. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, ATP-dependent assembly of the MutL&#x3b1;-MutS&#x3b2;-DNA ternary complex was scored by SPRS using a 200 bp -TG- I/D heteroduplex (solid lines) or homoduplex (dashed lines) DNA. The upper panel shows mass bound upon flow of 0.10 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b2; alone (grey) or a mixture of 0.10 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b2; and 0.24 &#x3bc;M MutL&#x3b1; (black) over heteroduplex or homoduplex in the presence of 1 mM ATP. Similar analyses were performed with MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 (middle panel) and MutS&#x3b2;-F27A-F28A. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, in the presence of ATP-Mg<sup>+2 </sup>MutS&#x3b2; forms specific but short-lived complexes with the 200 bp -TG- I/D heteroduplex described above. Inclusion of both MutL&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b2; resulted in a substantial increase in DNA-bound mass (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>), indicative of ternary complex formation. This mass increase was not observed in the absence of ATP (not shown), and we were unable to detect DNA binding by MutL&#x3b1; alone (not shown). The latter results are consistent with previous findings that assembly of ternary complexes involving MutL and MutS homologs is ATP-dependent and that DNA binding by MutL homologs is limited at physiological ionic strength (17, 25, 35-38). The lifetime of the ternary complex is also short, with 80% dissociating with a t<sub>1/2 </sub>of 7s. The apparent affinity of MutL&#x3b1; for DNA-bound MutS&#x3b2; was estimated from the MutL&#x3b1; dependence of the mass increase over and above that observed with MutS&#x3b2; alone (0.1 &#x3bc;M). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, results fit well to a rectangular hyperbola with a K<sub>d </sub>of 0.4 &#x3bc;M. Apparent affinity of MutL&#x3b1; for MutS&#x3b2; (circles), MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 (squares) or MutS&#x3b2;-F27A-F28A (triangles) was determined from SPRS experiments like those described above, but in which the concentration of MutL&#x3b1; was varied as shown in the presence of 0.10 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b2;. Data were fit to a hyperbola by nonlinear least squares regression to yield an apparent K<sub>d </sub>of 0.40 &#x3bc;M on heteroduplex DNA (closed symbols). Complex formation on homoduplex DNA (open symbols) was not saturable.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">To our surprise, substitution of MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 or MutS&#x3b2;-F27A-F28A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, middle and lower panels) for MutS&#x3b2; abolished ternary complex formation, indicating that MSH3 PIP box mutations compromise the ability of DNA-bound MutS&#x3b2; to interact with MutL&#x3b1;. In contrast, deletion of the PIP box motif of MutS&#x3b1;, while severely attenuating the capacity of MutS&#x3b1; to associate with PCNA (21), does not alter the ability of the MSH2-MSH6 heterodimer to support ternary complex formation with MutL&#x3b1; and heteroduplex DNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). MutS&#x3b1;&#x394;12, a PIP box mutant of MutS&#x3b1;, was also evaluated for its ability to interact with MutL&#x3b1;. Assembly of an ATP-dependent MutL&#x3b1;&#xb7;MutS&#x3b1;&#xb7;heteroduplex ternary complex was scored as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, mass bound upon flow of 0.20 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b1; alone (grey) or a mixture of 0.20 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b1; and 0.20 &#x3bc;M MutL&#x3b1; (black) over heteroduplex (solid lines) or homoduplex (dashed lines) DNA in a buffer (Experimental Procedures) containing 0.25 mM ATP is shown for wild type MutS&#x3b1; (Top panel) and MutS&#x3b1;&#x394;12 (Bottom panel).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">To assess the interaction of MutS&#x3b2; with MutL&#x3b1; by an independent method, we employed far-western analyses (Experimental Procedures), wherein the indicated amounts of each protein was spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane, and incubated at 4&#xb0; C. overnight with 0.18 &#x3bc;M of either PCNA or MutL&#x3b1; in solution, followed by immunochemical detection of membrane-bound PCNA or MutL&#x3b1; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>). Interaction of MutS&#x3b2; variants with PCNA and MutL&#x3b1; was also assessed independently by far western analysis. PCNA and MutL&#x3b1; were detected immunochemically. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> (top panel), complexes of PCNA with MutS&#x3b1;, MutS&#x3b2;, and MutL&#x3b1; can be detected by this method, confirming previous findings (14, 26). However, binding of PCNA to MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 and MutS&#x3b2;-F27A-F28A to PCNA was substantially reduced compared that of wild type MutS&#x3b2;. When MutL&#x3b1; was in solution (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, bottom panel), robust complex formation with membrane-bound MutS&#x3b2; was observed. However, binding of MutL&#x3b1; to both MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 and MutS&#x3b2;-F27A-F28A was severely compromised. While PCNA in solution is able to associate with membrane-bound MutL&#x3b1;, such an interaction was not observed in the converse experiment wherein MutL&#x3b1; was in solution and PCNA was membrane-bound. The reason for this difference is not clear, but it is possible that PCNA binding to the membrane may occlude access to its MutL&#x3b1;-binding surface. An alternate possibility is that the &#x3b1;-MLH1 antibody used to probe for presence of PCNA-bound MutL&#x3b1; may compete with PCNA for a common binding site. MutL&#x3b1; in solution also interacts poorly with nitrocellulose-bound MutS&#x3b1;, possibly due to membrane occlusion effects. Taken together with the SPRS ternary complex observations described above, these far-western results indicate that the MutS&#x3b2; motif responsible for its interaction MutL&#x3b1; resides at least in part within the N-terminal 28 residues of MSH3 and includes Phe-27 and Phe-28.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Interaction of MutL&#x3b1; with separated MSH2 or MSH3 subunits of MutS&#x3b2; or its variants (BSA served as a negative control) was assayed by far western analysis after subunit resolution by SDS-PAGE (Experimental Procedures). Membrane treatment was as described above in the preceding paragraph, except that incubation was with 0.09 &#x3bc;M of MutL&#x3b1;. In fact, strong MutL&#x3b1; interaction with the MSH3 subunit of MutS&#x3b2; was directly demonstrable by far western analysis of membrane transfers from SDS gel-resolved MutS&#x3b2; subunits, and this interaction was abolished by the PIP box mutations described above (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>).</p>

<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Effects of PCNA on MutL&#x3b1; binding to MutS&#x3b2; and MutS&#x3b1;</heading>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The simplest interpretation of Example 2 is overlap of MSH3 binding sites for PCNA and MutL&#x3b1;, an idea that predicts competition of the two proteins for complex formation with MutS&#x3b2;. To test this possibility we used SPRS to examine effects of PCNA on DNA-MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; ternary complex formation. The results, presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, show that PCNA and MutL&#x3b1; compete for binding to MutS&#x3b2; but not to MutS&#x3b1;. The effect of PCNA on formation of DNA-MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; and DNA-MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; ternary complexes was evaluated by SPRS using a sensor chip derivatized with 200 bp -TG- I/D heteroduplex (solid lines) or control homoduplex (dashed lines) DNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) Sensorgram profiles show mass response units upon flow of solutions containing 1 mM ATP and: 0.10 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b2; (curve 1); 0.10 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b2; and 0.24 &#x3bc;M MutL&#x3b1; (curve 3); 0.10 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b2; and 2.0 &#x3bc;M PCNA (curve 2); and 0.10 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b2;, 0.24 &#x3bc;M MutL&#x3b1; and 2.0 &#x3bc;M PCNA (curve 4). Inhibition of ternary complex formation as a function of PCNA concentration was measured by monitoring mass bound when solutions containing 0.050 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b2; (curve 1), or a mixture composed of 0.050 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b2;, 0.050 &#x3bc;M MutL&#x3b1;, and one of the following: 0 (curve 2), 0.50 (curve 3), 1.0 (curve 4), or 2.0 &#x3bc;M (curve 5) PCNA were allowed to flow over the sensor chip in the presence of 0.25 mM ATP and 125 mM KCl. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). Effect of p21 on PCNA-dependent inhibition of DNA-MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; ternary complex formation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>) was assessed as in (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) by flowing a mixture of 0.050 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b2;, 0.050 &#x3bc;M MutL&#x3b1;, and 0.25 mM ATP (curve 1, Top and Bottom panels) or the same mixture supplemented with one of the following: 1.0 &#x3bc;M PCNA (curve 2, Top panel), 0.50 &#x3bc;M PCNA (curve 2, Bottom panel), 1.0 &#x3bc;M PCNA and 6.0 &#x3bc;M p21 (curve 3, Top panel), or 0.50 &#x3bc;M PCNA and 6.0 &#x3bc;M p21 (curve 3, Bottom panel). SPRS experiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> were as in (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>), but with 0.20 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b1; (curve 1); 0.20 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b1; and 0.20 &#x3bc;M MutL&#x3b1; (curve 2); 0.20 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b1; and 1.6 &#x3bc;M PCNA (curve 3); 0.20 &#x3bc;M MutS&#x3b1;, 0.20 &#x3bc;M MutL&#x3b1; and 1.6 &#x3bc;M PCNA (curve 4).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Addition of 2.0 &#x3bc;M PCNA to a solution containing MutS&#x3b2; results in an increase in mass bound to the sensor surface consistent with MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex formation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). Addition of the same amount of PCNA to a mixture of MutS&#x3b2; and MutL&#x3b1; results in a substantial decrease in chip-bound mass as compared with that in the absence of the clamp (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, compare red and black lines), indicating that PCNA inhibits the assembly of the DNA-MutS&#x3b2;-MutL&#x3b1; ternary complex. PCNA inhibition of this reaction increases with increasing PCNA concentration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), an effect that is reversed by presence of a molar excess of the PCNA-binding cell cycle regulator p21<sup>CIP1 </sup>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As discussed above, unlike MutS&#x3b2; PIP box mutants, MutS&#x3b1;&#x394;12, which lacks the MSH6 PCNA interaction motif, is proficient in assembly of the DNA-MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; ternary complex (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). It might therefore be expected that assembly of the MutS&#x3b1; ternary complex would be refractory to the inhibitory effect of PCNA. Indeed, presence of PCNA in solutions containing MutS&#x3b1;, MutL&#x3b1;, and ATP resulted in a further increase in DNA-bound mass (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>), indicating the formation of a DNA-MutS&#x3b1;-PCNA-MutL&#x3b1; quaternary complex. Interestingly, the resultant mass increase is &#x2dc;2-3 fold greater than that due to PCNA association with the DNA-MutS&#x3b1; complex, which may indicate that MutL&#x3b1; promotes multiple MutS&#x3b1; loading events or that PCNA may interact with both MutS&#x3b1; and MutL&#x3b1; components of the ternary complex (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) (13). By contrast, MutS&#x3b1;&#x394;12 fails to support formation of a DNA-MutS&#x3b1;&#x394;12-PCNA-MutL&#x3b1; quaternary complex (not shown), indicating that initial association of PCNA with the DNA-MutS&#x3b1;-MutL&#x3b1; ternary complex occurs via multiply loaded MutS&#x3b1; molecules. These data suggest that in contrast to MutS&#x3b2;, MutS&#x3b1; has distinct binding sites that can be simultaneously occupied by MutL&#x3b1; and PCNA.</p>

<heading id="h-0017" level="1">The MSH3 PIP Box Required for MutL&#x3b1; Endonuclease Activation and Bidirectional Mismatch-Provoked Excision and Repair</heading>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">We have previously shown that MutS&#x3b1;&#x394;12, although unable to associate with PCNA, retains mismatch recognition activity, supports MutL&#x3b1; endonuclease activation, and is as active as the wild type protein in mismatch-provoked excision. The mutant does however display a partial defect in 5&#x2032;- but not 3&#x2032;-directed mismatch repair (21). To determine the functional consequences of disruption of the MSH3 PIP box motif in MutS&#x3b2;, we examined the activities of MutS&#x3b2; PIP box mutants in nuclear extracts of MSH2<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212; </sup>RL95-2 cells, and in a purified system that scores MutL&#x3b1; endonuclease activation. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, top panel, repair of 5&#x2032;-(closed symbols) or 3&#x2032;- (open symbols) dinucleotide I/D heteroduplex (Experimental Procedures) was scored in nuclear extracts of MSH2<sup>&#x2212;/&#x2212; </sup>RL95-2 cells as a function of exogenously added MutS&#x3b2; (circles) or MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 (squares). Excision on 5&#x2032;- and 3&#x2032;-substrates was scored by NheI-resistant gap formation assay (33) in RL95-2 extracts in the absence of exogenous dNTPs as a function of added MutS&#x3b2; and MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, bottom panel). As judged by extract assay, MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 displays a severe defect in 5&#x2032;- and 3&#x2032;-excision and repair as compared with the wild type protein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, MutS&#x3b2; (black bars) and MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 (white bars) (100 ng or 430 fmol) were compared for their ability to support MutL&#x3b1; endonuclease activation (16) on 5&#x2032;- and 3&#x2032;-TG- I/D heteroduplex or A-T homoduplex DNAs (Experimental Procedures). Results shown are corrected for background observed in the absence of MutS&#x3b2;, MutL&#x3b1;, RFC, and PCNA. Unlike the wild type protein, the capacity of this truncation mutant to activate the MutL&#x3b1; endonuclease is also severely attenuated (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Initial rates of MutS&#x3b2;-dependent MutL&#x3b1; endonucleolytic activity supported by MutS&#x3b2;-F27A-F28A are also &#x2dc;3-4 fold lower than the wild type protein (data not shown). Thus, unlike MSH6, integrity of the MSH3 PIP box is required for mismatch repair.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows solution X-ray scattering data and linear portions of Guinier plots for MutS&#x3b2;, MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28, PCNA, and an equimolar mixture of MutS&#x3b2; and PCNA. The corresponding pairwise interatomic distances distributions (P(r)) were derived from scattering profiles by indirect Fourier transform (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). Results of small-angle X-ray scattering studies of MutS&#x3b2; and the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex are presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A-5D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, normalized pair distribution (P(r)) plots for MutS&#x3b2;, MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28, an equimolar mixture of MutS&#x3b2; and PCNA, and PCNA alone, reproduced from (21) were derived by indirect Fourier transform (49) of solution scattering data. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, stoichiometry of the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA interaction was determined (Experimental Procedures) from experimentally determined forward scattering intensities I(0) plotted as a function of PCNA:MutS&#x3b2; (closed circles) or PCNA:MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 (closed squares) molar ratio. The theoretical dependence of I(0) on PCNA:MutS&#x3b2; molar ratio was calculated for scenarios that assume formation of the stoichiometric complexes MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA (318 kDa) (open circles), (MutS&#x3b2;)<sub>2</sub>-PCNA (550 kDa) (closed triangles) or (MutS&#x3b2;)<sub>3</sub>-PCNA (782 kDa) (open triangles) (Experimental Procedures). The expected I(0) values for PCNA mixtures with MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 (open squares) are also shown with the assumption of no interaction. Molecular masses corresponding to I(0) values (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>) are indicated on the right vertical axis. Ab initio shape reconstructions of MutS&#x3b2; and MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 were performed from SAXS data as described (21). Envelopes shown represent an average of 10 independent shape reconstructions. Due to non-availability of a MutS&#x3b2; crystal structure, the MutS&#x3b1;&#x394;341-DNA complex structure (40) is superimposed on the MutS&#x3b2; SAXS envelope for size reference. Ab initio shapes of the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex were generated as described above from experimental scattering data collected for 1:1 molar mixtures of MutS&#x3b2; and PCNA. Eight independent ab initio shapes are shown manually superimposed on each other. Despite the low resolution of these models, a central channel of dimensions similar to that of PCNA is clearly defined and was used to align the individual reconstructions. See also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and Table 2.</p>

Guinier plots (ln I vs. Q<sup>2</sup>) (2), linear portions of which are shown (inset), were derived from scattering profiles and were used to determine radii of gyration (Table 1). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, forward scattering intensities I(0) (intensity at &#x3b8;=0&#xb0;) for MutS&#x3b2; (closed triangle) MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 (open triangle) and an equimolar mixture of MutS&#x3b2; and PCNA were derived from concentration-normalized scattering data by the Guinier approximation (32) and are plotted as a function of the molecular mass of each molecule (41). Data are plotted alongside results reproduced from Iyer et al.

Data for PCNA (closed circles) are reproduced from Iyer et al. (21). MutS&#x3b2;, MutS&#x3b1;&#x394;28, and MutS&#x3b2;&#xb7;PCNA displayed negligible interparticle association. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>) P(r) plots from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, excluding that for PCNA, are reproduced alongside pairwise interatomic distances calculated from the crystal structures of MutS&#x3b1;&#x394;341&#xb7;DNA (40) and <i>E. coli </i>MutS&#xb7;DNA (39).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Table 2 summarizes the model-independent structural parameters R<sub>g </sub>and D<sub>max </sub>obtained from these experiments. As observed previously for MutS&#x3b1; (21), the P(r) distributions for MutS&#x3b2; and MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 are skewed toward larger r values indicating that the conformations of these two heterodimers are significantly more elongated than the published structures of truncated forms of MutS homologs (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>) (39, 40). Addition of one PCNA trimer equivalent to MutS&#x3b2; results in a further skewing of the P(r) distribution towards higher values.</p>

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As noted above (Table 1), gel filtration studies showed an increase in Stokes' radius for MutS&#x3b2; from 64 to 74 &#x212b; due to formation of the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex. The similar but distinct conformational parameter, R<sub>g</sub>, measured by SAXS also increases when one PCNA equivalent is added to MutS&#x3b2;, an effect that is not observed with MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 (Table 1). The SAXS data also permit extraction of forward scattering intensity I(0), which is a linear function of molecular mass (41) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>). I(0) values determined for 1:1 mixtures of the MutS&#x3b2; and PCNA proteins are substantially greater than those for either of the individual molecules (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>) and are consistent with expected molecular mass of a 1:1 MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA trimer complex (318 kDa). By contrast, an equimolar mixture of MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 and PCNA yields a significantly lower value for I(0), indicating that the two proteins fail to interact (see below).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Given the trivalent nature of PCNA (42), it is potentially possible to assemble MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complexes of differing stoichiometries: MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA, (MutS&#x3b2;)<sub>2</sub>-PCNA, and (MutS&#x3b2;)<sub>3</sub>-PCNA, with monovalent complexes favored under conditions of PCNA excess. As discussed above, the stoichiometry of this interaction determined by equilibrium gel filtration and SPRS is 1 MutS&#x3b2; heterodimer per PCNA homotrimer. Because complex formation in both of these procedures was measured under conditions where PCNA was in excess, these experiments are insensitive to the formation of potential (MutS&#x3b2;)<sub>2</sub>-PCNA, and (MutS&#x3b2;)<sub>3</sub>-PCNA assemblies. To address this issue, we determined I(0) values for PCNA-MutS&#x3b2; mixtures as a function of molar ratio under conditions where the concentration of each protein was well above the K<sub>d </sub>for binary complex formation. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the experimental maximum I(0) occurs at a PCNA:MutS&#x3b2; molar ratio of 0.5, indicative of presence of multivalent species. Comparison of experimentally determined values to those calculated for mixtures of (MutS&#x3b2;)<sub>2</sub>-PCNA and MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA, or (MutS&#x3b2;)<sub>3</sub>-PCNA and MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA demonstrated that the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex is the favored species at PCNA:MutS&#x3b2; molar ratios &#x2267;1, but as many as 20% of the complexes are multivalent at lower values (Table 2). Furthermore, I(0) does not increase as a function of the MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28:PCNA ratio (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>), a finding that independently confirms the PCNA interaction defect of this MutS&#x3b2; variant.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Ab initio shape reconstructions for MutS&#x3b2; and the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex from SAXS data&#x2014;Model-independent D<sub>max </sub>values (Table 1, (21)) indicate that the MutS&#x3b2; conformation in solution (D<sub>max</sub>=165 &#x212b;) is more extended than MutS&#x3b1;&#x394;341 (D<sub>max</sub>=140 &#x212b;) but more compact than MutS&#x3b1; (D<sub>max</sub>=202 &#x212b;). Since a crystal structure of MutS&#x3b2; is not available, SAXS results described above were used to generate low-resolution conformational models (43) of the heterodimer, as well as its complex with PCNA. The validity of the models was assessed using the crystal structures of the human MutS&#x3b1;&#x394;341-DNA complex (40) and PCNA (42). Ab initio envelopes of MutS&#x3b2; and MutS&#x3b2;&#x394;28 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>) accommodate superimposition of the crystal structure of the MutS&#x3b1;&#x394;341-DNA complex, and display additional mass that presumably corresponds to portions of MutS&#x3b2; that do not share sequence or conformational homology with MutS&#x3b1;&#x394;341.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As noted above, addition of one trimer equivalent of PCNA to MutS&#x3b2; results in a P(r) plot that is skewed towards higher interatomic distances by &#x2dc;55 &#x212b;, an effect that is manifested as a substantial increase in D<sub>max </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, Table I). However, the maximum P(r) value for the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex occurs at an r value (56 &#x212b;) that is nearly identical to that for MutS&#x3b2; alone (54 &#x212b;). These results suggest that the MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA complex adopts an &#x201c;extended&#x201d; end-to-end conformation rather than a stacked arrangement wherein the DNA-binding channels of the two proteins are juxtaposed, since the latter conformer would be expected to display a P(r) maximum at a substantially higher r value (21). In fact, ab initio shapes generated from SAXS data are consistent with an end-to-end association of MutS&#x3b2; and PCNA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>), with the ring shape of PCNA being clearly defined in the low resolution models along with substantial associated mass consistent with presence of a MutS homolog dimer equivalent. By contrast to the variety of extended ab initio shapes obtained for the MutS&#x3b1;-PCNA complex (21), low resolution MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA models are strikingly similar (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>), suggesting that there is limited variability between individual MutS&#x3b2;-PCNA conformers in solution.</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">High throughput assay for ternary complex formation. Streptavidin-coated polystyrene plates in 96-well format (Greiner Bio-One) will be derivatized with a biotin end-labeled 200 bp heteroduplex (or control homoduplex) DNA, which we prepare by a PCR, strand separation, hybridization procedure (20). MutL&#x3b1;-MutS&#x3b1;/MutS&#x3b2;-heteroduplex ternary complex assembly is ATP-dependent, and the resultant complexes are dynamic, apparently capable of movement along the helix (50, 17, 19). Because such complexes can be trapped on a linear heteroduplex if both DNA ends are blocked by bound protein (17, 19), blocking of the free heteroduplex terminus distal to the polystyrene surface may enhance ternary complex signal for immunological or fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) detection purposes (see below). For FRET-based assay, this can be accomplished by placement of an EcoRI site near the free terminus and use of hydrolytically dead mutant of EcoRI endonuclease (EcoRIE<sub>111</sub>Q) that binds to d(GAATTC) sites with an affinity of 10<sup>13 </sup>M<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>at 150 mM NaCl (57). An alternate possibility for immunological assay involves heteroduplex preparation with a biotin label at one end and fluorescein at the other, coupled with use of commercial anti-fluorescein antibody to block the dye-tagged heteroduplex terminus. Initial experiments will utilize a 200 bp -TG-&#x201c;loopout&#x201d; heteroduplex, which is readily recognized by both MutS&#x3b1; and MutS&#x3b2;, with an otherwise identical homoduplex as control (50).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Immunological assay will rely on demonstration of mismatch and MutS&#x3b1;/MutS&#x3b2;-dependent assembly of a complex, that after rinsing the reaction wells, yields a signal upon incubation with rabbit anti-peptide or mouse monoclonal anti-hPMS2 or anti-hMLH1 antibody. Immune complexes will be scored by luminescence assay after reaction with an appropriate peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antiserum. Although MutL&#x3b1;-MutS&#x3b1;/MutS&#x3b2;-heteroduplex ternary complex formation could result in occlusion of some hPMS2 or hMLH1 antigenic sites, we are not overly concerned about this problem because commercially available anti-hPMS2 or anti-hMLH1 antibodies target a number of different epitopes.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">FRET assay will be based on the tetracysteine/biarsenical chemistry developed by Tsien and colleagues for specific fluorescent labeling of proteins (58, 59). We have already tagged hMSH2 (N-terminal derivative) and hMLH1 (N-terminal and C-terminal derivatives) with an optimized tetracysteine peptide (FLNCCPGCCMEP) (SEQ ID NO: 7) that is highly reactive with the biarsenical fluorogenic probes 4&#x2032;,5&#x2032;-bis(1,3,2-dithiarsolan-2-yl)fluorescein (FlAsH, FRET donor) and 4,5-bis(1,3,2-dithiarsolan-2-yl)-resorufin (ReAsH, FRET acceptor). Our intent is to utilize FlAsH-derivatized hMutS&#x3b1;/hMutS&#x3b2; and ReAsH-derivatized hMutL&#x3b1;, or other appropriate FRET pair, for high throughput assay of ternary complex formation.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Another approach to assay development would be to attach a 200-bp heteroduplex DNA substrate prepared by PCR such that the 5&#x2032;-end of the top strand contains a biotin tag, and the 5&#x2032;-end of the bottom strand has a fluorescein label to a standard 96-well ELISA plate coated with goat anti-fluorescein antibody. After blocking the non-specific DNA and protein binding sites on the plate, the double tagged DNA substrate will be attached to the plate surface via the fluorescein label. The free biotin tagged end will be blocked by recombinant monovalent avidin. The DNA substrate will be incubated with MutS&#x3b2;, MutL&#x3b1; and ATP, unbound protein will be washed off. MutS&#x3b2;-dependent recruitment of MutL&#x3b1; will be detected immunologically as detailed below. The presence of two end-blocks on the DNA substrate will stabilize and permit detection of DNA&#xb7;MutS&#x3b2;&#xb7;MutL&#x3b1; complexes that may otherwise be short lived due to rapid dissociation off a free DNA end. MutL&#x3b1; will be detected by incubation with a mouse or rabbit anti-MLH1 antibody, followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase labeled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody. The amount of MutL&#x3b1; present will be inferred by colorimetric quantitation of peroxidase activity using tetramethylbenzidine as substrate. This is a rapid assay that can be used to screen libraries of small molecules for their ability to inhibit recruitment of MutL&#x3b1; to DNA-bound MutS&#x3b2;. A parallel assay will be set up wherein MutS&#x3b1; is used instead of MutS&#x3b2;, and will be used to identify molecules that are without effect on the MutS&#x3b1;-dependent recruitment of MutL&#x3b1;.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">A high throughput assay described above will be used to assay libraries of small molecules. For example, a proof of principle small molecule inhibitor screen could be performed using the 1364 compound NCI Diversity Set II small molecule inhibitor library. These compounds will be screened in sets of 5-10. Those responsible for inhibitory hits at &#x3c;100 &#x3bc;M will be identified and individually screened for their ability to inhibit hMutL&#x3b1;-hMutS&#x3b1;-heteroduplex and hMutL&#x3b1;-hMutS&#x3b2;-heteroduplex complex assembly as judged by plate reader screen and by independent BIAcore assay (50, 17). Because of their potential therapeutic value, we are particularly interested in the latter class of inhibitor, but inhibitors that block formation of either or both ternary complex would be of potential interest to the MMR field.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The molecules identified in such a screen may be further characterized by a modified far-western assay designed to detect direct interaction between MutS&#x3b2; and MutL&#x3b1;. A defined amount of MutS&#x3b2; will be spotted in each well of a 96-well nitrocellulose bottom microplate. After non-specific protein binding sites have been blocked with a nonspecific protein such as casein, the wells will be incubated with a solution containing MutL&#x3b1;. Presence of MutL&#x3b1; will be detected immunologically as detailed above. Molecules that directly inhibit binding of MutL&#x3b1; to MutS&#x3b2; will be identified by this method.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Molecules that have been identified by the rapid screens described above will be further tested for their capacity to inhibit MutS&#x3b2;-dependent activation of MutL&#x3b1; endonucleolytic function in in vitro assays on heteroduplex DNA substrates. These molecules will then be tested for their capacity to inhibit bidirectional mismatch excision and repair of a variety of heteroduplex substrates (some of which will be prepared from triplet repeats) in in vitro assays composed of either purified mismatch repair proteins extracts of mismatch repair capable human cells. Kinetics of binding/inhibition will be measured by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy (Biacore).</p>
