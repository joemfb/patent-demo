<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an exposure apparatus and a device fabrication method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A projection exposure apparatus has been conventionally employed to fabricate micropatterned semiconductor devices such as a semiconductor memory and a logic circuit using photolithography. The projection exposure apparatus projects and transfers a pattern (circuit pattern) formed on a reticle (mask) onto a substrate such as a wafer using a projection optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To keep up with advances in micropatterning (an increase in packing density) of semiconductor devices, the projection exposure apparatus is required to transfer the pattern of a reticle onto a wafer with a higher resolution. A minimum feature size (resolution) that the projection exposure apparatus can transfer is proportional to the wavelength of light for use in exposure (exposure light) and is inversely proportional to the numerical aperture (NA) of the projection optical system. According to this principle, the shorter the wavelength of the exposure light, the better the resolution. In view of this, currently, a KrF excimer laser beam (wavelength: about 248 nm) or an ArF excimer laser beam (wavelength: about 193 nm) is being used as the exposure light. At the same time, the practical application of an F<sub>2 </sub>laser beam (wavelength: about 197 nm) and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light is in progress.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The projection exposure apparatus is also required to expose a wider exposure region. To meet this requirement, an exposure apparatus (scanner) which relatively scans a reticle and a wafer to expose a rectangular slit-like exposure region has become the current mainstream in place of an exposure apparatus (stepper) which reduces and projects a nearly square-shaped exposure region on a reticle onto a wafer and performs full-plate exposure of the wafer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Exposure using such an exposure apparatus requires alignment between a reticle and a wafer, so the exposure apparatus includes a plurality of alignment optical systems. The alignment optical systems include, for example, an off-axis alignment optical system and TTL (Through The Lens) alignment optical system. The off-axis alignment optical system detects an alignment mark on a wafer without a projection optical system. The TTL alignment optical system is also called a TTR (Through The Reticle) optical system, and detects the position of an alignment mark on a wafer relative to that of an alignment mark on a reticle via a projection optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Also, the exposure apparatus includes an oblique-incidence focus-leveling detection system as a wafer surface position detection unit. The focus-leveling detection system obliquely irradiates with light a wafer surface onto which the pattern of a reticle is to be transferred (or a reference plate surface on a wafer stage), and detects the light obliquely reflected by the wafer surface (or the reference plate surface). In the focus-leveling detection system, an image sensor which senses the light reflected by the wafer surface (or the reference plate surface) is located such that the image sensor (image sensing surface) is nearly conjugate to the reflection point of the reflected light. With this arrangement, a positional shift (defocus) of the wafer (or the reference plate) in the optical axis direction of the projection optical system is measured as that on the image sensor of the focus-leveling detection system.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When the projection optical system absorbs exposure heat or its surrounding environment changes, an error naturally occurs between the measurement origin of the focus-leveling detection system and the focal plane of the projection optical system. To combat this situation, the TTL alignment optical system also has a function of measuring such an error (focus calibration).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Alignment detection and focus detection using a TTL alignment optical system will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, a reticle <b>1100</b> is located on the object plane side of a projection optical system <b>1200</b>. A TTL alignment optical system <b>1300</b> is located to allow observation of a wafer stage <b>1400</b> (i.e., a reference plate <b>1500</b> mounted on the wafer stage <b>1400</b>) through an opening <b>1110</b> in the reticle <b>1100</b>. The reference plate <b>1500</b> has a grid pattern <b>1510</b> formed in it. The opening <b>1110</b> in the reticle <b>1100</b> also has a grid pattern <b>1112</b> formed in it. Also, the TTL alignment optical system <b>1300</b> includes an illumination fiber <b>1310</b>, field stop <b>1320</b>, half mirror <b>1330</b>, imaging lens <b>1340</b>, and image sensor <b>1350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">After the reference plate <b>1500</b> is positioned at a predetermined position, the TTL alignment optical system <b>1300</b> captures the grid pattern <b>1510</b> in the reference plate <b>1500</b> and the grid pattern <b>1112</b> in the opening <b>1110</b> in the reticle <b>1100</b> side by side, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. Subsequently, the amount of relative shift between the grid patterns <b>1510</b> and <b>1112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> in their longitudinal direction is measured, thereby performing alignment detection between the reference plate <b>1500</b> and the reticle <b>1100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Focus detection between the reference plate <b>1500</b> and the reticle <b>1100</b> is done as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">First, the grid pattern <b>1112</b> in the opening <b>1110</b> in the reticle <b>1100</b> is captured by the image sensor <b>1350</b>. The position of the reticle <b>1100</b> in the optical axis direction of the imaging lens <b>1340</b> is adjusted so as to optimize the contrast of the waveform of the captured image sensing signal. With this operation, focusing between the reticle <b>1100</b> and the image sensor <b>1350</b> (its image sensing surface) is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Likewise, the grid pattern <b>1510</b> in the reference plate <b>1500</b> is captured by the image sensor <b>1350</b>, and the reference plate <b>1500</b> is moved in the optical axis direction to a position based on the capturing result, thereby performing focusing between the reference plate <b>1500</b> and the image sensor <b>1350</b>. With this operation, focusing among the reticle <b>1100</b>, the reference plate <b>1500</b>, and the image sensor <b>1350</b> (its image sensing surface) is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 62-058624, 63-220521, 04-348019, 06-324472, and 2004-266273 disclose techniques associated with the foregoing alignment detection and focus detection using a TTL alignment optical system. In addition, Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-055435 discloses a technique of focus detection by transferring an asymmetrical grid pattern on a reticle onto a wafer, and measuring the position of the formed resist pattern, instead of using a TTL alignment optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In recent years, as, for example, the wavelength of the exposure light shortens, and the NA of the projection optical system increases, the depth of focus decreases extremely. Along with this trend, accuracy of aligning a wafer surface to be exposed with a best imaging plane (so-called focus accuracy) increasingly becomes stricter. Furthermore, as micropatterning of semiconductor devices advances, overlay accuracy becomes more stringent as well. Under the circumstances, to maintain a given apparatus performance, it is becoming necessary to increase the frequencies of focus and alignment calibrations. Note that the fabrication of semiconductor devices must be stopped during these calibrations. In this respect, shortening the calibration time leads to a reduction in cost (an improvement in throughput) of semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Unfortunately, the techniques disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Nos. 62-058624, 04-348019, and 06-324472 obtain a position at which the waveform contrast or the light amount is maximum by scanning the wafer stage in the optical axis direction of the projection optical system, so it takes a long time to scan the wafer stage. In addition, the technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 63-220521 obviates the need to scan the wafer stage by using a decentered stop but cannot perform alignment detection concurrently with focus detection, resulting in a decrease in throughput. Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2004-266273 discloses alignment detection but does not disclose focus detection.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The technique disclosed in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2002-055435 can detect a best focus position with high accuracy but requires the formation of a resist pattern on a wafer. Thus, this technique is inferior in throughput to the other techniques using a TTL alignment optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A TTL alignment optical system in an exposure apparatus (EUV exposure apparatus) which uses EUV light as the exposure light poses problems unique to the EUV exposure apparatus. For example, first, the EUV exposure apparatus uses a reflective reticle and therefore cannot use a conventional TTL alignment optical system. Second, the EUV exposure apparatus uses multilayer film mirrors and therefore suffers from a shortage of light attributed to a low light reflectance in case of the so-called double-pass detection scheme in which the test light reciprocates a projection optical system.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention provides an exposure apparatus advantageous to shorten the time taken for focus detection.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an exposure apparatus including a projection optical system configured to project a pattern of a reticle located on an object plane onto a substrate located on an image plane, a phase shift type mark mounted on a stage which holds the substrate, an image sensor which is set at one of a position of the object plane and a position optically conjugate to the object plane, and is configured to capture an image of the mark via the projection optical system, and a controller configured to control the stage based on an interval between edge images, formed by a pair of edge portions of the mark, in the image of the mark captured by the image sensor.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings. Note that the same reference numerals denote the same members throughout the drawings, and a repetitive description thereof will not be given.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a view showing the arrangement of an exposure apparatus <b>1</b> according to a first embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the exposure apparatus <b>1</b> is a projection exposure apparatus (scanner) which transfers the pattern of a reticle <b>20</b> onto a wafer <b>50</b> by the step &#x26; scan scheme.

In this embodiment, the imaging lenses <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> have a unit imaging magnification, and the imaging lens <b>103</b> has an imaging magnification of 50&#xd7;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a view showing the arrangement of the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The object plane side mark <b>172</b> for alignment, formed on the reference plate <b>170</b> on the reticle stage <b>30</b>, is imaged on the field stop <b>106</b> via the imaging lenses <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>.

The object plane side mark <b>172</b> is formed on the reference plate <b>170</b> formed from a transmission substrate (e.g., a glass substrate or a quartz substrate). The object plane side mark <b>172</b> is formed from a light-shielding film made of, for example, chromium or chromium oxide, and has a function of shielding the light beam from the optical fiber <b>62</b>. In other words, the object plane side mark <b>172</b> is made of chromium or chromium oxide having a thickness (about 100 nm) large enough to sufficiently shield (absorb) a light beam. In this embodiment, the object plane side mark <b>172</b> includes a mark <b>172</b><i>x </i>including two rectangular patterns, and a mark <b>172</b><i>y </i>obtained by rotating the mark <b>172</b><i>x </i>through 90&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The overall size of the object plane side mark <b>172</b> is determined in accordance with the reduction magnification of the projection optical system <b>40</b>.

In this manner, the image plane side mark <b>182</b> has a step structure formed from a so-called phase shift type mark without using a light-shielding film.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Let &#x3bb; be the wavelength of the light beam from the optical fiber <b>62</b> (a light beam which illuminates the image plane side mark <b>182</b>), n be the refractive index of the reference plate <b>180</b> (transmission substrate), and m be a natural number.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">From the foregoing, the phase shift amount (the phase difference between a light beam which passes through a relatively low region (first region) and that which passes through a relatively high region (second region) in the step structure) of a light beam which passes through the image plane side mark <b>182</b> in the step structure (edge portion) is an odd multiple of 90&#xb0;. Note that equation (1) shows the step d of a most preferable step structure. For this reason, the phase shift amount does not need to be exactly an odd multiple of 90&#xb0;.

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The distribution characteristic of a light beam which passes through the image plane side mark <b>182</b> of the phase shift type will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5D</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> is an enlarged sectional view of the image plane side mark <b>182</b>.

In this case, as the image plane side mark <b>182</b> moves in the Z-axis direction, the centroid of the light intensity in the X-Y plane also moves.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In contrast, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, an image plane side mark <b>182</b> which implements a phase shift by an amount of 180&#xb0; that largely deviates from an odd multiple of 90&#xb0; generates a light distribution in which the scattering characteristics near the edge portions of the step structure are nearly symmetrical about the Z-axis direction.

A light beam which forms the image plane side mark image <b>182</b>&#x2032; (edge images <b>182</b>L&#x2032; and <b>182</b>R&#x2032;) has a decreased intensity due to factors associated with the edge portions <b>182</b>L and <b>182</b>R of the step structure which forms the image plane side mark <b>182</b>. Note that a decrease in light intensity due to factors associated with the edge portions <b>182</b>L and <b>182</b>R of the step structure is accounted for by the influence of their light scattering and interference between the upper surface/lower surface at the edge portions.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The imaging state of the image plane side mark <b>182</b> of the phase shift type will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7C</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7C</figref>, the light beam (scattered light) from the image plane side mark <b>182</b> on the reference plate <b>180</b> illuminated with the light beam from the optical fiber <b>62</b> enters the projection optical system <b>40</b> and forms an image on the reference plate <b>170</b>.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the distributions of light beams scattered by the edge portions <b>182</b>L and <b>182</b>R of the step structure which forms the image plane side mark <b>182</b> are not isotropic but asymmetrical. More specifically, the distributions of light beams scattered by the edge portions <b>182</b>L and <b>182</b>R each have a light intensity that is higher in a direction away from the central portion of the image plane side mark <b>182</b> (step structure) and is lower in other directions. Moreover, because the edge portions <b>182</b>L and <b>182</b>R have a structure symmetrical about the optical axis, the distributions of light beams scattered by the edge portions <b>182</b>L and <b>182</b>R are bilaterally symmetrical about the central portion of the image plane side mark <b>182</b>. In this manner, the image plane side mark <b>182</b> of the phase shift type is used to generate scattered light having asymmetrical light distributions in this embodiment. A displacement of the image plane side mark image <b>182</b>&#x2032; on the image sensor <b>107</b> is especially large when the phase shift amount (phase difference) is an odd multiple of 90&#xb0;, as described above.</p>

Hence, the defocus state of the image plane side mark <b>182</b> (i.e., the reference plate <b>180</b>) can be detected by measuring the interval between the edge image <b>182</b>La&#x2032; or <b>182</b>Lb&#x2032; and the edge image <b>182</b>Ra&#x2032; or <b>182</b>Rb&#x2032;.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The position of the image plane side mark <b>182</b> in the X-Y plane can be detected independently of focusing by measuring the middle position between the edge image <b>182</b>La&#x2032; or <b>182</b>Lb&#x2032; and the edge image <b>182</b>Ra&#x2032; or <b>182</b>Rb&#x2032;.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Focus detection will be explained next. Focus detection is performed by measuring a distance (interval) D between the edge images <b>182</b>L&#x2032; and <b>182</b>R&#x2032;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A signal processing method known to those skilled in the art can be used to measure the positions of the mark images in alignment detection and to measure the interval between the mark images in focus detection.

In addition, the imaging magnification at which the light from the image plane side of the projection optical system <b>40</b> forms an image is assumed to be 4&#xd7;, and the imaging magnification of the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b> is assumed to be 100&#xd7;. The image sensor <b>107</b> of the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b> is assumed to be a CCD, which has a pixel pitch of 5 &#x3bc;m.

The light beam from the optical fiber <b>62</b> is assumed to have a coherence factor &#x3c3; of 0.5 via the lens <b>64</b>. The lens <b>64</b> is assumed to be able to illuminate a range wider than the size of an image obtained by inversely projecting the object plane side mark <b>172</b> onto the reference plate <b>180</b>.

The wafer <b>50</b> is positioned at the imaging position of the projection optical system <b>40</b> by the wafer stage <b>60</b>, and the reticle <b>20</b> is positioned by the reticle stage <b>30</b>.

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In this manner, the exposure apparatus <b>1</b> according to this embodiment performs focus detection based on the position information of the image plane side mark <b>182</b> of the phase shift type. Hence, the exposure apparatus <b>1</b> can simultaneously perform both focus detection and alignment detection in a short period of time because there is no need to scan the wafer stage <b>60</b> in the optical axis direction (Z-axis direction) of the projection optical system <b>40</b>.</p>

The condensing mirror has a function of converging EUV light which is nearly isotropically radiated by the EUV light source <b>312</b>.

The image plane side mark <b>382</b> is formed by etching the reference plate <b>380</b>, and has a quadrangular step structure in this embodiment. In this manner, the image plane side mark <b>382</b> has a step structure formed from a so-called phase shift type mark without using a light-shielding film.

Reference numerals <b>382</b>L and <b>382</b>R respectively denote the left and right (a pair of) edge portions of the step structure.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The grid pattern GL in the object plane side mark <b>372</b> will be explained hereinafter. The grid pattern GL has a function of deflecting the light beam from the optical fiber <b>62</b> in a direction different from that toward EUV light as the exposure light, and guiding the deflected light beam to a position at which it does not interfere with the optical path of the illumination optical system <b>314</b>. In this manner, because the light beam from the optical fiber <b>62</b> does not interfere with the optical path of the illumination optical system <b>314</b>, there is no need to drive the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C at the time of an exposure process.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The relationship between the incident angle and diffraction angle of a light beam which impinges on the grid pattern GL will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. The grid pattern GL is a one-dimensional diffraction grating having lines arrayed at a pitch P in the X-axis direction. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, let &#x3b8;in be the incident angle of a light beam B0 which impinges on the grid pattern GL, &#x3b8;1 be the diffraction angle of a 1st-order diffracted light beam B1, and &#x3b8;2 be the diffraction angle of a 2nd-order diffracted light beam B2. Also, let &#x3b8;p be the angle between the Z-axis and the optical axis of the projection optical system <b>340</b>. Note that the angle &#x3b8;p is equal to the incident angle at which EUV light as the exposure light strikes the reticle <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The incident angle &#x3b8;in of the light beam B<b>0</b> which impinges on the grid pattern GL and a diffraction angle &#x3b8;m of an mth-order diffracted light beam satisfy a relation:

</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">Where m is the order of diffraction, and &#x3bb; is the wavelength of a light beam from the alignment light source <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">For example, assuming that the incident angle &#x3b8;p of EUV light which strikes the reticle <b>320</b> is 7&#xb0;, the incident angle of a light beam which comes from the alignment light source <b>360</b> and impinges on the grid pattern GL (reference plate <b>370</b>) is also 7&#xb0;. Assume also that the wavelength of a light beam from the alignment light source <b>360</b> is 266 nm, the 1st-order diffracted light beam B1 is guided to the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C, and the diffraction angle of the 1st-order diffracted light beam B1 is 20&#xb0;. In this case, the pitch P of the grid pattern GL is 1.208 &#x3bc;m. Also, the diffraction angle of the 2nd-order diffracted light beam B2 is 34.2&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">Unwanted diffracted light (e.g., 0th-order diffracted light) from the grid pattern GL has a diffraction angle greatly different from that of 1st-order diffracted light, and therefore does not pass through the aperture stop <b>104</b> of the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C. Consequently, the grid pattern GL is not imaged on the image sensor <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">In this manner, it is important for the grid pattern GL to guide a light beam from the alignment light source <b>360</b> to the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C while keeping away from the optical axis of the projection optical system <b>340</b>. The grid pattern GL beneficially has a pitch small enough so that it is not resolved by the image sensor <b>107</b>. If the grid pattern GL is resolved or a light intensity distribution is generated on the image sensor <b>107</b> to a small extent, this produces noise and therefore decreases the accuracies of alignment detection and focus detection.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">In this embodiment, the grid pattern GL guides the light beam from the object plane side mark <b>372</b> in a direction different from that toward the optical axis of the projection optical system <b>340</b>. However, a retractable mirror <b>392</b> may be located in the optical path of the projection optical system <b>340</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>. With this arrangement, the light beam from the object plane side mark <b>372</b> can be guided to the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C by inserting the mirror <b>392</b> into the optical path of the projection optical system <b>340</b>. Note that the mirror <b>392</b> is retracted to a position at which it does not shield EUV light at the time of an exposure process. Alternatively, a mirror <b>392</b> may be located on the reference plate <b>370</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25A and 25B</figref> are views for explaining guidance of a light beam from the object plane side mark <b>372</b> to the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Since the projection optical system <b>340</b> is formed from multilayer film mirrors, it suffers from no chromatic aberration. For at least this reason, even when the projection optical system <b>340</b> receives a light beam having a wavelength other than that of the exposure light (EUV light), the reticle <b>320</b> and wafer <b>50</b> remain in an imaging relationship. Consequently, the image plane side mark <b>382</b> illuminated with a light beam from the alignment light source <b>360</b> is imaged on the reference plate <b>370</b> on the reticle stage <b>30</b> via the projection optical system <b>340</b>. The image plane side mark <b>382</b> imaged on the reference plate <b>370</b> is reflected by the reference plate <b>370</b> and imaged again on the image sensor <b>107</b> of the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">An object plane side mark image of the object plane side mark <b>372</b> and an image plane side mark image of the image plane side mark <b>382</b>, which are captured by the image sensor <b>107</b> of the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C, are the same (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>) as in the first embodiment. Hence, the same processes as in the first embodiment allow alignment detection and focus detection using the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Alignment detection and focus detection between the reference plate <b>370</b> and the reference plate <b>380</b> using the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C by forming the object plane side mark <b>372</b> including the grid pattern GL on the reference plate <b>370</b> have been explained in this embodiment. However, the object plane side mark <b>372</b> including the grid pattern GL may be formed on the reticle <b>320</b>. In this case, the grid pattern GL is preferably formed from an absorber which absorbs EUV light.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">The exposure apparatus <b>1</b>C includes the alignment light source <b>360</b> which emits a light beam having a wavelength different from that of EUV light. This makes it possible to form the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C using, for example, lenses while allowing the use of EUV light as the exposure light. If EUV light is used as the alignment light, the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C is formed from mirrors, resulting in greater light attenuation in the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C. In contrast, in this embodiment, the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C is formed from, for example, lenses using a light beam from the alignment light source <b>360</b> as the alignment light. This makes it possible to circumvent the problem of light attenuation in the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C. Moreover, the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C does not need to use EUV light which would entail a high running cost, and therefore allows alignment detection at costs comparable to conventional techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C can image the object plane side mark <b>372</b> and image plane side mark <b>382</b> on the image sensor <b>107</b> such as a CCD at an optical magnification of about 50&#xd7;. Hence, the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C can perform both alignment detection and focus detection with high accuracies.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Also, in this embodiment, since the projection optical system <b>340</b> is a catoptric system, it generates no chromatic aberration. This obviates the need for a chromatic aberration correction optical system necessary in applying a TTL alignment optical system which uses non-exposure light to a dioptric projection optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">If a light beam having a wavelength around 13 nm is used, neither focus detection nor alignment detection can be performed with high accuracies. This is for the following reason. The refractive index of the material of a phase shift type mark for a light beam having a wavelength around 13 nm is close to 1. For example, refractive indices (n, k) of SiO<sub>2</sub>, Mo, and Si are (0.997, 3.15e-5), (0.999, 2.6e-4), and (0.997, 1.6e-5), respectively. To give a phase difference of 90&#xb0; to a light beam having a wavelength of 13 nm, it is beneficial to form, for example, a step of about 11.2 &#x3bc;m for SiO<sub>2 </sub>and Si and a step of about 3.4 &#x3bc;m for Mo. At this time, the amounts of absorption in phase shift type marks, calculated from the extinction coefficients k, are 93% for SiO<sub>2</sub>, 15% for Si, and 56% for Mo. In this manner, the larger the step, the greater the absorption in the phase shift type mark becomes. This changes the shape of the phase shift type mark due to heat generated upon absorption, and, in turn, causes errors in focus detection and alignment detection. To prevent this, an exposure apparatus which uses EUV light as the exposure light needs to use a light beam having a wavelength of 150 nm or more for focus detection and alignment detection instead of using the exposure light. The use of a light beam having a wavelength of about 150 nm or more for focus detection and alignment detection allows selection of an unabsorbent material such as quartz or fluorine-doped quartz. This makes it possible to prevent absorption in the phase shift type mark, and, in turn, prevent a change in its shape.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The wavelength of a light beam emitted by the alignment light source <b>360</b> is preferably 150 nm (inclusive) to 370 nm (inclusive), and is more preferably 240 nm (inclusive) to 280 nm (inclusive). This is because a multilayer film mirror has a reflectance of more than 50% for a light beam having a wavelength of 370 nm or less, and, at the same time, there presently exists no glass material which can transmit a light beam having a wavelength shorter than 150 nm. Note that a multilayer film mirror has a reflectance of 65% to 70% or more for a light beam having a wavelength of 240 nm (inclusive) to 280 nm (inclusive), and the efficiency (reflectance) of the projection optical system is maximal in this case.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Also, in this embodiment, since the projection optical system <b>340</b> is a reduction system, it is advantageous to locate a phase shift type mark on the image plane side and guide the light beam to the projection optical system <b>340</b> from the image plane side from the viewpoint of the magnification of the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C. For example, a case in which the overall magnification is 200&#xd7;, and the magnification of the projection optical system <b>340</b> is &#xbc; will be considered. In this case, the magnification necessary for the TTL alignment optical system <b>100</b>C is 50&#xd7; when the light beam enters it from the image plane side, and is 800&#xd7; when the light beam enters it from the object plane side.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Exposure apparatuses <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>A, and <b>1</b>C can simultaneously perform both focus detection and alignment detection in a short period of time, as described above. Hence, the exposure apparatuses <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>A, and <b>1</b>C can provide devices (e.g., a semiconductor device, an LCD device, an image sensing device (e.g., a CCD), and a thin-film magnetic head) with a high throughput and good economical efficiency. In accordance with a seventh embodiment of the present invention, devices are fabricated by a step of exposing a substrate (e.g., a wafer or a glass plate) coated with a photoresist (photosensitive agent) using the exposure apparatuses <b>1</b>, <b>1</b>A, and <b>1</b>C, and a step of developing the exposed substrate. These steps may be repeated. Moreover, the device may be further processed using known steps, such as metallization and packaging.</p>

The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all such modifications and equivalent structures and functions.</p>
