<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a power converting apparatus which converts DC power into AC power and, in particular, the invention is concerned with a power converting apparatus which converts DC power fed from a DC power supply like a solar battery having a stray electrostatic capacitance into AC power with three-phase outputs and outputs the AC power to a load.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Among conventional power converting apparatuses, there exists a below-mentioned power converting apparatus for photovoltaic power generation that converts DC power fed from a solar battery into AC power with three-phase outputs and delivers the AC power to a three-phase power system whose one phase is grounded with the power converting apparatus interconnected with the power system.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The power converting apparatus is provided with 3 sets of half-bridge inverters which are connected between output terminals of the solar battery, each half-bridge inverter being made up of two series-connected switching devices, single-phase inverters connected in series with AC output lines of the individual half-bridge inverters, and two series-connected capacitors for dividing a voltage of the solar battery, wherein output terminals of the single-phase inverters are connected to individual phases of the three-phase power system. The half-bridge inverters are operated at a rate of one pulse per half cycle and the individual single-phase inverters are controlled by pulse width modulation (PWM) so as to compensate for voltage insufficiencies with respect to a system voltage, whereby the power converting apparatus outputs the sums of outputs of the half-bridge inverters and the respective single-phase inverters. For this reason, it is possible to reduce an input DC voltage of the half-bridge inverters and a high voltage is not necessary to perform PWM control operation. Additionally, it is possible to reduce switching losses and lower the capacity of an output filter (refer to Patent Document 1, for example).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">PRIOR ART DOCUMENT</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Patent Document</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent Document 1: International publication No. 2008-102552</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since a conventional power converting apparatus like the one mentioned above utilizes three-phase 2-level inverters as inverters connected to a solar battery, a bus line potential of a DC power supply fluctuates during operation of the inverters. On the other hand, a power system has a wiring for grounding a V phase or a neutral point and, therefore, if fluctuation occurs in the bus line potential of the DC power supply, there occurs a zero-phase-sequence current which flows through a stray electrostatic capacitance and a grounding point of the power system owing to the stray electrostatic capacitance of the DC power supply and potential fluctuation thereof. One problem that might occur has been that an earth leakage breaker operates due to the zero-phase-sequence current, causing the apparatus to stop operating.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention has been made to solve the aforementioned problem. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a power converting apparatus featuring a compact and low-cost system configuration as well as high conversion efficiency and having capabilities to suppress a zero-phase-sequence currant which may potentially flow through a stray electrostatic capacitance of a DC power supply and prevent malfunction of an earth leakage breaker.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Means for Solving the Problems</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A power converting apparatus according to the present invention includes a three-phase three-level inverter connected between positive and negative terminals of a first DC power supply, one or a plurality of single-phase inverters which are connected in series with an AC output line of each phase of the three-phase three-level inverter, and a control device, the power converting apparatus being configured such that the sums of output voltages of the three-phase three-level inverter and output voltages of the respective single-phase inverters are output to a load through a smoothing filter. A voltage of second DC power supplies which are DC input power supplies of the single-phase inverters is lower than a one-level voltage of the three-phase three-level inverter. Also, the control device controls the three-phase three-level inverter in such a manner that each phase of the three-phase three-level inverter outputs a voltage at a rate of one pulse per half cycle of an output voltage to a corresponding phase of the load as a primary voltage pulse, and the control device controls the individual single-phase inverters by PWM so that output voltages supplied to individual phases of the load form sine waves of which phases are offset by 2&#x3c0;/3 from one phase to another, the sine waves having the same peak value, and the output voltages supplied to the individual phases of the load being referenced to a point having a zero DC potential or a fixed DC potential with respect to a reference potential of the first DC power supply.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The power converting apparatus according to the present invention can perform with high accuracy an operation for controlling output voltages forming sine waves of which phases are offset by 2&#x3c0;/3 from one phase to another, the sine waves having the same peak value, wherein the output voltages are referenced to a specific DC potential point of the first DC power supply so that fluctuations of a bus line potential of the first DC power supply can be eliminated. For this reason, it is possible to make an apparatus configuration which produces no AC component between a neutral potential of a three-phase output and one of potentials the first DC power supply and, thus, it is possible to suppress a zero-phase-sequence current flowing through a stray electrostatic capacitance of the first DC power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Also, since the power converting apparatus outputs voltages by combination of the three-phase three-level inverter and the single-phase inverters, the three-phase three-level inverter may be of a type having a low input DC voltage and it is not necessary to perform PWM control operation with a high voltage. For this reason, the power converting apparatus is constructed to have a compact and low-cost system configuration as well as high conversion efficiency.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A power converting apparatus according to a first embodiment of the present invention is now described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram illustrating the configuration of the power converting apparatus according to the first embodiment of this invention. The power converting apparatus is provided with a three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> constituting a main circuit and an output control unit <b>13</b>. The three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> is for converting DC power fed from a first DC power supply <b>2</b> and into three-phase AC power and outputting the same to a load <b>7</b>, the first DC power supply <b>2</b> being a DC power supply like a solar battery having a stray electrostatic capacitance <b>17</b> with respect to the ground. The load <b>7</b> is grounded at a load grounding point <b>16</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> includes a three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> of which bus line voltage is a voltage of the first DC power supply <b>2</b>, single-phase inverters <b>4</b> connected in series with AC output lines of individual phases of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b>, and a three-phase smoothing filter <b>6</b> connected to downstream stages of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b>, the smoothing filter <b>6</b> being made up of reactors and capacitors which are not illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Each phase of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> is configured with four semiconductor switching devices <b>8</b> which are made up of insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) or the like, each including diodes connected in reverse parallel, and two clamping diodes <b>9</b>. Also, the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> is provided with a first series-connected capacitor <b>10</b> and a second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b> as two series-connected capacitors for dividing the voltage of the first DC power supply <b>2</b>, a junction point between the first series-connected capacitor <b>10</b> and the second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b> being connected to a junction point between the two clamping diodes <b>9</b> of each phase. This means that the junction point between the first series-connected capacitor <b>10</b> and the second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b> serves as a neutral point that is a potential point which divides the voltage of the first DC power supply <b>2</b> into two parts, so that a junction point between the two semiconductor switching devices <b>8</b> constituting upper and lower arms of each phase is clamped at a neutral point potential.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Each of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> is provided with a full-bridge inverter <b>12</b> made up of four semiconductor switching devices and a DC capacitor <b>5</b> which serves as a second DC power supply for retaining a voltage. An output voltage of the single-phase inverter <b>4</b> of each phase is superimposed on an output voltage of each phase of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b>, and the sum of the output voltage of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> and the output voltage of each single-phase inverter <b>4</b> is output to the load <b>7</b> through the smoothing filter <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The voltage of the DC capacitor <b>5</b> of each single-phase inverter <b>4</b> is made lower compared to one half of the voltage of the first DC power supply <b>2</b> (or voltages of the first and second series-connected capacitors <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>). This means that the voltage of the DC capacitor <b>5</b> is lower than a one-level voltage of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b>. It is to be noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a circuit configuration of the single-phase inverter <b>4</b> of one phase only among the three single-phase inverters <b>4</b>, omitting illustration of the other phases, for the sake of simplification.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> and the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> are controllably driven by a three-phase three-level inverter control signal <b>14</b> and a single-phase inverter control signal <b>15</b> which are output from the output control unit <b>13</b> capable of performing mathematical operation by use of a central processing unit (CPU), a digital signal processor (DSP), a field-programmable gate array (FPGA), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Operation of the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> thus configured is described below referring to voltage waveforms depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>. Individual potentials in the waveforms are potentials shown with reference to the neutral point, that is, the junction point between the first series-connected capacitor <b>10</b> and the second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a phase voltage command <b>20</b> which is a voltage command for one phase, e.g., a U phase, output from the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> and a voltage waveform (three-phase three-level inverter voltage <b>21</b>) output from the U phase of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b>. It is to be noted that the phase voltage commands <b>20</b> are sine waves of which phases are offset by 2&#x3c0;/3 from one phase to another, the sine waves having the same peak value.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The DC voltage output from the first DC power supply <b>2</b> is charged into a series circuit unit which is made up of the first series-connected capacitor <b>10</b> and the second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b>. The voltages of the first DC power supply <b>2</b>, the first series-connected capacitor <b>10</b> and the second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b> are detected and individually detected voltage values are transmitted to the output control unit <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Controlled by the three-phase three-level inverter control signal <b>14</b> fed from the output control unit <b>13</b>, the individual phases of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> output voltage pulses, 200 V in this case, of which peak values correspond to the individual voltage values of the first series-connected capacitor <b>10</b> and the second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b> (or a voltage value corresponding to one half of the voltage of the first DC power supply <b>2</b>) at a rate of one pulse per half cycle in response to the phase voltage commands <b>20</b> using the DC voltages of the first series-connected capacitor <b>10</b> and the second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b> as input voltages. These voltage pulses output at the rate of one pulse per half cycle are hereinafter referred to as primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a</i>. Here, the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>are output one pulse in a positive-going side of the phase voltage command <b>20</b> and one pulse in a negative-going side of the phase voltage command <b>20</b> during one complete cycle of the phase voltage command <b>20</b>. While the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>are output in such a fashion that a power balance during half cycle (or one cycle) of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> becomes zero, a detailed description of this control operation will be given at a later time.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts an output voltage command (single-phase inverter voltage command <b>22</b>) given to each single-phase inverter <b>4</b>. The single-phase inverter voltage command <b>22</b> is obtained by subtracting the three-phase three-level inverter voltage <b>21</b> of each phase from the phase voltage command <b>20</b> given to the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b>. Controlled by the single-phase inverter control signal <b>15</b> fed from the output control unit <b>13</b>, the individual single-phase inverters <b>4</b> output voltages after high-frequency PWM control operation performed in such a manner as to compensate for differences between the phase voltage commands <b>20</b> given to the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> and output voltages of the respective phases of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b>. In this PWM control operation, the individual single-phase inverters <b>4</b> are controlled such that output currents supplied to the individual phases of the load <b>7</b> become sine waves.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts single-phase inverter voltage commands for the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> of the individual phases, wherein designated by <b>22</b><i>a </i>is a U-phase single-phase inverter voltage command, designated by <b>22</b><i>b </i>is a V-phase single-phase inverter voltage command and designated by <b>22</b><i>c </i>is a W-phase single-phase inverter voltage command. In this case, a peak value of each waveform is &#xb1;125 V and it is necessary that a bus line voltage of each single-phase inverter <b>4</b> be equal to or higher than 125 V in order to output voltages according to these voltage commands.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Output voltages of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> of the individual phases are superimposed on the output voltages of the respective phases of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b>, and the sum of the output voltage of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> and the output voltage of each single-phase inverter <b>4</b> is output to the load <b>7</b> through the smoothing filter <b>6</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts an output voltage of each phase of the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> that is the sum of the output voltage of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> and the output voltage of each single-phase inverter <b>4</b>. Designated by <b>23</b> is the output voltage of each phase and designated by <b>24</b> is an averaged voltage waveform of the output voltage <b>23</b> of each phase.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The output voltage waveform <b>24</b> of each phase supplied to the load <b>7</b> forms a voltage waveform similar to the phase voltage command <b>20</b> for each phase, which means that the voltage waveforms <b>24</b> form sine waves of which phases are offset by 2&#x3c0;/3 from one phase to another, the sine waves having the same peak value, and the voltage waveforms <b>24</b> being referenced to the potential of the neutral point, that is, the junction point between the first series-connected capacitor <b>10</b> and the second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Next, operation for controlling output of the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> and the power balance of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As mentioned in the foregoing, the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>are output in such a fashion that the power balance during half cycle or one cycle of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> becomes zero. Since the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> output the voltages in such a manner as to compensate for the differences between the phase voltage commands <b>20</b> and the output voltages of the respective phases of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b>, the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> may output such electric power that is equivalent to electric power output in accordance with the phase voltage commands <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a case where the power converting apparatus is controlled in such a manner that the phases of the output currents coincide with the phases of the output voltages (operation at power factor 1), Vp can be expressed by equation (1) below wherein Vp denotes a peak voltage of the phase voltage commands <b>20</b> and Ed denotes one half of a DC voltage input into the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> (which is the voltage of the first DC power supply <b>2</b> or the sum of the voltage of the first series-connected capacitor <b>10</b> and the voltage of the second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b> in this example). It is to be noted that &#x3b8;<b>1</b> (0&#x3c;&#x3b8;<b>1</b>&#x3c;&#x3c0;/2) is a phase corresponding to a leading edge of each primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a</i>.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Voltage pulses having a pulse width (&#x3c0;&#x2212;2&#x3b8;<b>1</b>) that rise or fall at phases (n&#x3c0;+&#x3b8;<b>1</b>) as calculated in the aforementioned manner constitute the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a</i>. Upon performing the aforementioned mathematical operation, the output control unit <b>13</b> transmits the three-phase three-level inverter control signal <b>14</b> obtained on the ground of calculation results and thereby control outputs of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b>. While the phase &#x3b8;<b>1</b> corresponding to the leading edge of each primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>is calculated by the aforementioned mathematical operation, determining this phase &#x3b8;<b>1</b> is identical to determining the pulse width (&#x3c0;&#x2212;2&#x3b8;<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The present embodiment employs the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> as an inverter connected to the first DC power supply <b>2</b> to control the entire three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> so that the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> outputs sine waves of which phases are offset by 2&#x3c0;/3 from one phase to another, the sine waves having the same peak value, and the output voltages being referenced to the potential of the neutral point, that is, the junction point between the first series-connected capacitor <b>10</b> and the second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b>. In this kind of configuration, the potential of the neutral point is stabilized and there is no fluctuation in a bus line potential of the first DC power supply <b>2</b>. Thus, it is possible to perform an output voltage control operation whereby a desired voltage waveform is obtained with high accuracy and the sum of the output voltages of the three phases becomes zero. For this reason, there is no AC component between the neutral point potential of the three-phase outputs and the potential of one side of the first DC power supply <b>2</b> and, therefore, it is possible to suppress a zero-phase-sequence current which may flow through the stray electrostatic capacitance <b>17</b> of the first DC power supply <b>2</b>. The zero-phase-sequence current is normally detected as a leakage current flowing through a earth leakage breaker which is disposed in an upstream stage of the load <b>7</b>. Since the zero-phase-sequence current can be suppressed, however, it is possible to prevent malfunction of the earth leakage breaker and, in addition, power conversion efficiency of the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> can be improved because the leakage current can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Also, since the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> outputs voltages obtained by adding the output voltages of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> and the output voltages of the respective single-phase inverters <b>4</b>, the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> can output voltages higher than the voltage of the first DC power supply <b>2</b> which is the DC input voltage of the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b>. Additionally, since each phase of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> is operated to produce one pulse per half cycle, there occurs almost no switching loss. Since DC voltages of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> which are controlled by PWM at a high frequency are set at a relatively small value, switching losses caused by the PWM control operation are small and, thus, the smoothing filter <b>6</b> may be of a type having a small capacity. For this reason, the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> may be produced to have a system configuration which is compact and low-cost, yet featuring high conversion efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Moreover, since the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> is controlled in such a fashion that the power balance during half cycle or one cycle of the individual single-phase inverters <b>4</b> becomes zero, it is possible to achieve a simple configuration in which the DC capacitor <b>5</b> of each single-phase inverter <b>4</b> does not have a DC power supply for transmitting and receiving electric power to and from the outside.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">While the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> is configured to determine the pulse width (or the phase of the leading edge) of the primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>so as to output electric power that is equivalent to electric power output in response to the phase voltage commands <b>20</b> with the aid of the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>in the above-described first embodiment, it is possible to determine the pulse width by another method. In the present embodiment, the pulse width of the primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>is determined by calculating a watt-hour value per half cycle or one cycle of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> and ensuring that the calculated watt-hour value becomes zero.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">A relationship between the pulse width of the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>output from the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> and output power of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> is described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a case of a comparative example in which the watt-hour value per half cycle of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> is positive and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a case in which the pulse width of each primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>is broadened as compared to the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and the watt-hour value per half cycle of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> is made equal to 0. For the sake of explanation, the Figures depict waveforms per half cycle only.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>a</i>) and <b>7</b>(<i>a</i>), the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> outputs the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>at a rate of one pulse per half cycle in one-to-one correspondence with output voltage waveforms <b>24</b> of individual phases of the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Then, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>b</i>) and <b>7</b>(<i>b</i>), each of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> outputs an average voltage <b>22</b><i>d </i>by performing PWM control operation so that a voltage waveform corresponding to the difference between the primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> and the output voltage waveform <b>24</b> of each phase is obtained. For example, if the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> is a photovoltaic power conditioner, it is often the case that output currents to the load <b>7</b> are supplied at power factor 1. In the case of power factor 1, a current waveform of each output current <b>25</b> becomes a sine wave having the same phase as the output voltage waveform <b>24</b> of each phase.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Then, output power <b>26</b> of each single-phase inverter <b>4</b> that is the product of the output voltage <b>22</b><i>d </i>and the output current <b>25</b> has waveforms as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6(</figref><i>c</i>) and <b>7</b>(<i>c</i>). Since the watt-hour value per half cycle of the output power <b>26</b> of each single-phase inverter <b>4</b> becomes positive as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6(</figref><i>c</i>), it is necessary to externally provide a power supply for the DC capacitor <b>5</b> of each single-phase inverter <b>4</b>. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>c</i>), the pulse width of each primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>is broadened and, in this case, negative parts of the output power <b>26</b> of each single-phase inverter <b>4</b> increase so that the watt-hour value per half cycle becomes zero.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In this embodiment, the pulse width of each primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>is determined such that the watt-hour value per half cycle or one cycle of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> becomes zero. Since the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> is controlled in such a fashion that the power balance during half cycle or one cycle of the individual single-phase inverters <b>4</b> becomes zero, it is possible to achieve a simple configuration in which the DC capacitor <b>5</b> of each single-phase inverter <b>4</b> does not have a DC power supply for transmitting and receiving electric power to and from the outside.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the foregoing first and second embodiments, the pulse width of each primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>is determined such that the watt-hour value per half cycle or one cycle of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> becomes zero. In the present embodiment, an arrangement for performing fine adjustment of the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>is described.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this case, there are provided voltage detectors <b>32</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) for measuring voltages of the DC capacitors <b>5</b> of the individual single-phase inverters <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">First, as in the foregoing first and second embodiments, the pulse width of each primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>is determined such that the watt-hour value per half cycle or one cycle of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> becomes zero to thereby control outputs of the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b>. If a power balance of any one of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> is disrupted by one cause or another, such as a sudden change in an input DC voltage or a sudden change in the load <b>7</b> during this output control operation, the voltage of the DC capacitor <b>5</b> of the relevant single-phase inverter <b>4</b> fluctuates.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The individual voltage detectors <b>32</b> detect voltages of the DC capacitors <b>5</b> of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> and voltage values of the individual DC capacitors <b>5</b> are transmitted to the output control unit <b>13</b>. The output control unit <b>13</b> controls the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> by shortening the pulse width of the primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>of a corresponding phase when the voltage value of any DC capacitor <b>5</b> is larger than a preset reference value, and by lengthening the pulse width when the voltage value is smaller than the reference value, so that the voltage values of the DC capacitors <b>5</b> become closer to the reference value.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As explained in the foregoing second embodiment, the watt-hour value per half cycle or one cycle of the single-phase inverter <b>4</b> increases when the pulse width of the primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>is shortened and decreases when the pulse width of the primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>is lengthened. Accordingly, when the voltage value of any of the DC capacitors <b>5</b> is larger than the reference value, the pulse width of the primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the corresponding phase is shortened to thereby increase the watt-hour value of the pertinent single-phase inverter <b>4</b> and thus decrease the voltage of the DC capacitor <b>5</b>. Also, when the voltage value of any of the DC capacitors <b>5</b> is smaller than the reference value, the pulse width of the primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the corresponding phase is lengthened to thereby decrease the watt-hour value of the pertinent single-phase inverter <b>4</b> and thus increase the voltage of the DC capacitor <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The single-phase inverters <b>4</b> are controlled by feedback so that the voltage of the DC capacitor <b>5</b> of each single-phase inverter <b>4</b> matches the reference value by adjusting the pulse width of the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>output from the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> in the above-described fashion. This control operation makes it possible to control the power balance during half cycle or one cycle of the individual single-phase inverters <b>4</b> to become zero in a reliable fashion. For this reason, it is possible to prevent shortage of the output voltages of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b>, overcharging of the DC capacitors <b>5</b>, and insulation breakage of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> caused by the overcharging, for instance, and this makes it possible to obtain a three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> whose outputs are stabilized.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Since each single-phase inverter <b>4</b> can not output a voltage <b>36</b> exceeding the output voltage limit value <b>35</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> is caused to generate shortages of output voltages of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> during a period when the voltage <b>36</b> exceeding the output voltage limit value <b>35</b> is required. Specifically, the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> outputs a partial PWM voltage <b>38</b> which is a voltage generated by PWM control operation during the periods at around the leading edge portion of each primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>and at around the trailing edge portion thereof in order to output amounts of voltage corresponding to the shortages of the output voltages of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">It is to be noted that the partial PWM voltage <b>38</b> is output according to the voltage values <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the first and second series-connected capacitors <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and the voltage value <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the DC capacitor <b>5</b>. Specifically, in a case where voltage waveforms expressed by sine waves are obtained by only a combination of the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> and the output voltages of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> because the voltages of the first and second series-connected capacitors <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> are not so high or the voltages of the DC capacitors <b>5</b> are sufficiently high, the present embodiment employs the same control operation as in the foregoing first embodiment, and when necessary, the power converting apparatus is switched to a control operation capable of outputting the partial PWM voltage <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">As discussed in the foregoing, it is made possible to output the partial PWM voltage <b>38</b> during the periods at around the leading edge portion and at around the trailing edge portion of each of the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>which are output at a rate of one pulse per half cycle from the individual phases of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> in the present embodiment. For this reason, even when the voltage of either of the first and second series-connected capacitors <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> increases as a result of an increase in the voltage of the first DC power supply <b>2</b>, voltage waveforms having like sine waves to the phase voltage commands <b>20</b> are obtained. Therefore, the potential of the neutral point is stabilized and there is no fluctuation in a bus line potential of the first DC power supply <b>2</b> and, thus, desired voltage waveforms are obtained with high accuracy in a yet stabler fashion. Consequently, it is possible to reliably achieve suppression of a zero-phase-sequence current which may flow through the stray electrostatic capacitance <b>17</b> of the first DC power supply <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">While the period during which the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> outputs the partial PWM voltage <b>38</b> has been explained as the period during which the single-phase inverter <b>4</b> is required to produce the voltage <b>36</b> exceeding the output voltage limit value <b>35</b> in the above-described embodiment, the power converting apparatus is controlled in a below-described fashion to give some allowance in actuality. Specifically, the partial PWM voltage <b>38</b> is output during each period when a value obtained by subtracting the absolute value of a differential voltage between the phase voltage command <b>20</b> (output voltage waveform of each phase) and the three-phase three-level inverter voltage <b>21</b> made up of only the primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>from the voltage value <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the DC capacitor <b>5</b> becomes equal to or smaller than a specified value. This arrangement makes it possible to output the differential voltage between the phase voltage command <b>20</b> (output voltage waveform of each phase) and the three-phase three-level inverter voltage <b>21</b> made up of only the primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>in a reliable fashion and, thus, voltage waveforms having like sine waves to the phase voltage commands <b>20</b> are obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Also, the pulse width of the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>output from the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> and the output period of the partial PWM voltage <b>38</b> are controlled in such a fashion that an output power balance during half cycle or one cycle of the aforementioned single-phase inverters becomes zero in this embodiment as well.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Furthermore, the individual single-phase inverters <b>4</b> may be controlled by feedback in such a manner that the voltage of the DC capacitor <b>5</b> of each single-phase inverter <b>4</b> matches the reference value by finely adjusting a voltage output period of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> as in the above-described third embodiment. In this case, the voltage output period of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> involves the pulse width of each primary voltage pulse <b>21</b><i>a </i>and the output period of the partial PWM voltage <b>38</b> and, thus, when the voltage value of any DC capacitor <b>5</b> is larger than the reference value, the voltage output period of the corresponding phase of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> is shortened, and when the voltage value of any DC capacitor <b>5</b> is smaller than the reference value, the voltage output period of the corresponding phase of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> is lengthened.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">This arrangement makes it possible to control the power converting apparatus in such a manner as to cause the power balance to quickly return to zero even when the power balance during half cycle or one cycle of any of the individual single-phase inverters <b>4</b> deviates from zero in such an event that the power converting apparatus is switched between control operation performed by use of the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>alone and control operation performed by generating the partial PWM voltage <b>38</b>. For this reason, it is possible to prevent shortage of the output voltages of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b>, overcharging of the DC capacitors <b>5</b>, and insulation breakage of the single-phase inverters <b>4</b> caused by the overcharging, for instance, and this makes it possible to obtain a three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> whose outputs are stabilized.</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Next, a power converting apparatus according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a diagram illustrating the configuration of the power converting apparatus according to the sixth embodiment of this invention. In this embodiment, a three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> includes a step-up circuit <b>40</b> for boosting a voltage of a first DC power supply <b>2</b>, and an output voltage of the step-up circuit <b>40</b> is used as a DC input voltage of a three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b>. The step-up circuit <b>40</b> is configured with a reactor <b>41</b>, a switch <b>42</b> connected between a high-voltage side bus line and a low-voltage side bus line of the first DC power supply <b>2</b> and a diode <b>43</b> for charging first and second series-connected capacitors <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is otherwise the same as the configuration of the foregoing fifth embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, and the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> and individual single-phase inverters <b>4</b> are controlled in the same fashion as in the foregoing fifth embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In a case where the first DC power supply <b>2</b> is a power supply which utilizes natural energy like a solar battery, an output voltage thereof constantly varies owing to weather changes, for instance. In the case of a solar battery, the output voltage thereof varies morning and night and under cloudy weather. An AC voltage that the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> can output is determined by the voltage value <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the first series-connected capacitor <b>10</b> and the voltage value <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b> which constitute a bus line voltage value of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> is a diagram depicting a relationship between the voltage of the first DC power supply <b>2</b> and the pulse width of the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>output from the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b>. Here, it is assumed that output voltages supplied to the load <b>7</b> are 200 Vrms and of three phases. When the voltage fed from the first DC power supply is a voltage lower than 256.51 V, this voltage is boosted up to 256.51 V by the step-up circuit <b>40</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. When the voltage becomes equal to or higher than 256.51 V, the pulse width of the primary voltage pulses <b>21</b><i>a </i>is shortened, and when the voltage becomes equal to or higher than 362.7 V, the power converting apparatus is switched to control operation performed by outputting the partial PWM voltage <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In this embodiment, the voltage of the first DC power supply <b>2</b> is boosted so that the voltage value <b>30</b><i>a </i>of the first series-connected capacitor <b>10</b> and the voltage value <b>31</b><i>a </i>of the second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b> which together constitute the DC input voltage of the three-phase three-level inverter <b>3</b> are increased up to a voltage which makes it possible to output a desired AC voltage. For this reason, it becomes possible to cause the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> to produce a waveform output from a situation in which the voltage of the first DC power supply <b>2</b> is low and, therefore, an operable range of the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> is made broader.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">While the present embodiment employs the control operation described in the foregoing fifth embodiment, it is possible to implement operation of any one of the foregoing first to fourth embodiments.</p>

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Next, a power converting apparatus according to a seventh embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, there are provided capacitors <b>44</b> which are connected between outputs of individual phases of a three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> and a load <b>7</b> in series therewith, each of the capacitors <b>44</b> having a capacitance sufficient to store an electric charge of which quantity is equal to or larger than the quantity of electric charge output from the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b>. A low-voltage side of output terminals of a first DC power supply <b>2</b> is grounded at a grounding point <b>45</b>. While the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is otherwise the same as the configuration of the foregoing first embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the present embodiment may be applied to the other of the foregoing embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the case where the first DC power supply <b>2</b> is grounded, output voltages of the individual phases of the three-phase inverter circuit <b>1</b> are output in such a fashion that the value of voltage equal to one half of the voltage of the first DC power supply <b>2</b> or the value of voltage of the second series-connected capacitor <b>11</b> becomes the value of a neutral point potential.

The insulating transformer <b>46</b> may have a generally known voltage boosting function achieved in accordance with the ratio of numbers of windings.
