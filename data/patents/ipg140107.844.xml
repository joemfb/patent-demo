<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to an apparatus for managing pet waste.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to pet litter boxes and has particular application as a dog litter box.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A pet litter box comprises a housing, a detachable wall, and a grid. The housing comprises a left wall, right wall, front wall, and back wall that define a well. The left, right, and back walls comprise a plurality of apertures on the top of the walls. The detachable wall comprises three plates. A first plate comprises a plurality of sides, wherein a first side has a plurality of posts that connect to the apertures on the top of the left wall and a second side has at least one tab. A second plate comprises a plurality of sides, wherein a first side has a plurality of posts that connect to the apertures on the top of the right wall and a second side has at least one tab. A third plate comprises a plurality of sides, wherein a first side has a plurality of posts that connect to the apertures on the top of the back wall; a second side has a recess that connects to the one or more tabs on the first plate; and a third side has a recess that connects to the one or more tabs on the second plate. The grid comprises a plurality of holes between grid lines and a locking mechanism. The locking mechanism of the grid attaches to the front wall of the housing. A locking frame with an aperture locks over the grid.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a variant of the pet litter box, the depression in the wall of the housing is disposed below the ridge and the depression and the ridge are disposed in the same walls.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another variant of the pet litter box, a pair of ridges in the housing is spaced apart at an equal height above the bottom of the well and two depressions are spaced apart an equal height above the bottom of the well and below the ridges.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a further variant of the pet litter box, a pair of tabs on the grid is spaced apart at a distance equal to the distance between the depressions in the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In still another variant of the pet litter box, the grid includes a locking mechanism along an edge of the grid that is configured to engage with a mechanism on the locking frame.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In yet a further variant, the pet litter box comprises an absorbent layer between the grid and the locking frame. The absorbent layer is configured in size and shape to completely cover the grid and the locking frame secures the layer to the grid.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a further variant of the pet litter box, a first locking mechanism on an outside wall of the housing engages with a locking mechanism on the grid and a second locking mechanism on the locking frame engages with a locking mechanism on the grid.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In still another variant, the pet litter box comprises an artificial grass layer above the absorbent pad.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet a further variant, the pet litter box comprises a housing, a detachable wall, a grid, an absorbent layer, and artificial grass. The housing comprises a left wall, right wall, front wall, and back wall that define a well. The left, right, and back walls comprise a plurality of apertures on the top of the walls and at least one wall comprises at least one depression and ridge. The detachable wall comprises three plates. A first plate comprises a plurality of sides, wherein a first side has a plurality of posts that connect to the apertures on the top of the left wall and a second side has at least one tab.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as is commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All patents, applications, published applications and other publications referred to herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety. If a definition set forth in this section is contrary to or otherwise inconsistent with a definition set forth in applications, published applications and other publications that are herein incorporated by reference, the definition set forth in this document prevails over the definition that is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention, in some embodiments thereof, relates to a pet litter box. Referring to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-14</figref>, the pet litter box <b>10</b> comprises a housing <b>12</b>, a detachable wall <b>14</b>, and a grid <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the housing <b>12</b> comprises a left wall <b>18</b>, a right wall <b>20</b>, a back wall <b>22</b>, and a front wall <b>24</b> that define a well <b>26</b>. The top of the left wall <b>18</b>, the right wall <b>20</b>, and the back wall <b>22</b> further comprise a plurality of apertures <b>28</b>. Each aperture <b>28</b> is sized and dimensioned for receiving a post <b>56</b> in the detachable wall <b>14</b>. The back wall <b>22</b> includes a pair of ridges <b>30</b> and a pair of depressions <b>32</b> below the ridges <b>30</b>. The pair of ridges <b>30</b> may be spaced apart at an equal height above a bottom of the well <b>26</b> and the pair of depressions <b>32</b> may be spaced apart an equal height above the bottom of the well and below the ridges <b>30</b>. The front wall <b>24</b> has a curved cutout <b>25</b> to permit easy ingress and egress to the litter box and a locking mechanism <b>27</b> that engages with the locking mechanism <b>66</b> on the grid. The locking mechanism <b>27</b> is a tab that allows a hook <b>70</b> on the grid <b>16</b> to catch the tab and secure the grid <b>16</b> to the housing <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The bottom of the housing <b>12</b> may comprise anti-skid pads <b>33</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, that allow the pet litter box <b>10</b> to grip to a surface.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The detachable wall <b>14</b> extends the depth of the housing <b>12</b> so that male pets can use the pet litter box <b>10</b> without creating a mess on the floor.
