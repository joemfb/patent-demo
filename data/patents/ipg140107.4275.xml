<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to semiconductor memories and, in particular, in one or more embodiments, the present disclosure relates to sensing data stored in non-volatile memory devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Memory devices are typically provided as internal, semiconductor, integrated circuits in computers or other electronic devices. There are many different types of memory including random-access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), dynamic random access memory (DRAM), synchronous dynamic random access memory (SDRAM), and flash memory.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Flash memory devices have developed into a popular source of non-volatile memory for a wide range of electronic applications. Non-volatile memory is memory that can retain its stored data for some extended period without the application of power. Common uses for flash memory and other non-volatile memory include personal computers, personal digital assistants (PDAs), digital cameras, digital media players, digital recorders, games, appliances, vehicles, wireless devices, mobile telephones and removable memory modules, and the uses for non-volatile memory continue to expand.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Flash memory devices typically use a one-transistor memory cell that allows for high memory densities, high reliability, and low power consumption. Changes in threshold voltage of the cells, through programming (which is sometimes referred to as writing) of charge storage structures (e.g., floating gates or charge traps) or other physical phenomena (e.g., phase change or polarization), determine the data state of each cell. Data can be read from the memory cells by performing a read operation. Memory cells are typically programmed using erase and programming cycles. For example, memory cells of a particular block of memory cells are first erased and then selectively programmed.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Memory cells (e.g., flash memory cells) can be configured as what are known in the art as Single Level Memory Cells (SLC) or Multilevel Memory Cells (MLC). SLC and MLC memory cells assign a data state (e.g., as represented by one or more bits) to a specific range of threshold voltages (Vt) stored on the memory cells. SLC memory permits the storage of a single binary digit (e.g., bit) of data on each memory cell. Meanwhile, MLC technology permits the storage of two or more binary digits per cell, depending on the quantity of Vt ranges assigned to the cell and the stability of the assigned Vt ranges during the lifetime operation of the memory cell. The number of Vt ranges (e.g., levels) used to represent a bit pattern comprised of N-bits might be 2<sup>N</sup>, where N is an integer. For example, one bit may be represented by two ranges, two bits by four ranges, three bits by eight ranges, etc. MLC memory cells may store even or odd numbers of bits on each memory cell, and schemes providing for fractional bits are also known. A common naming convention is to refer to SLC memory as MLC (two level) memory as SLC memory utilizes two Vt ranges in order to store one bit of data as represented by a 0 or a 1, for example. MLC memory configured to store two bits of data can be represented by MLC (four level), three bits of data by MLC (eight level), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example of Vt ranges <b>100</b> for a population of MLC (four level) (e.g., 2-bit) memory cells. For example, a memory cell might be programmed to a Vt that falls within one of four different Vt ranges <b>102</b>-<b>108</b> of 200 mV, each being used to represent a data state corresponding to a bit pattern comprised of two bits. Typically, a dead space <b>110</b> (e.g., sometimes referred to as a margin and might have a range of 200 mV to 400 mV) is maintained between each range <b>102</b>-<b>108</b> to keep the ranges from overlapping. As an example, if the Vt of a memory cell is within the first of the four Vt ranges <b>102</b>, the cell in this case is storing a logical &#x2018;11&#x2019; state and is typically considered the erased state of the cell. If the Vt is within the second of the four Vt ranges <b>104</b>, the cell in this case is storing a logical &#x2018;10&#x2019; state. A Vt in the third Vt range <b>106</b> of the four Vt ranges would indicate that the cell in this case is storing a logical &#x2018;00&#x2019; state. Finally, a Vt residing in the fourth Vt range <b>108</b> indicates that a logical &#x2018;01&#x2019; state is stored in the cell. For a memory cell having a particular data state represented by a bit pattern &#x2018;XY&#x2019;, the &#x2018;X&#x2019; position bit might be considered the Most Significant Bit (MSB) and the &#x2018;Y&#x2019; position bit might be considered the Least Significant Bit (LSB), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Determining the data state of a selected memory cell involves performing a sense (e.g., read) operation on the memory cell. During the sense operation, a sense potential which increases over time can be applied to the selected memory cell. The MSB and the LSB of the data state of a selected memory cell can be determined when the applied sense potential has reached the highest level to be applied to the selected memory cells. However, waiting to determine both the MSB and LSB can result in a delay which can limit how fast data can be read from the memory device during a sense operation, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For the reasons stated above, and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the present disclosure, there is a need in the art for alternate methods for performing data sensing operations in memory devices.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the following detailed description of the invention, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown, by way of illustration, specific embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. In the drawings, like numerals describe substantially similar components throughout the several views. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. Other embodiments may be utilized and structural, logical, and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present disclosure. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Flash memory typically utilizes one of two basic architectures known as NAND Flash and NOR Flash. The designation is derived from the logic used to read the devices. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a NAND type flash memory array architecture <b>200</b> wherein the memory cells <b>202</b> of the memory array are logically arranged in an array of rows and columns. In a conventional NAND Flash architecture, &#x201c;rows&#x201d; refer to memory cells <b>220</b><sub>1-4 </sub>having commonly coupled control gates, while &#x201c;columns&#x201d; refer to memory cells coupled as a particular string of memory cells <b>208</b>, for example. The memory cells <b>202</b> of the array are arranged together in strings (e.g., NAND strings), typically of 8, 16, 32, or more each. Each memory cell of a string are connected together in series, source to drain, between a source line <b>214</b> and a data line <b>216</b>, often referred to as a bit line. The array is accessed by a row decoder (not shown) activating a logical row of memory cells by selecting a particular access line, often referred to as a word line, such as WL<b>7</b>-WL<b>0</b> <b>218</b><sub>7-0</sub>, for example. Each word line <b>218</b> is coupled to the control gates of a row of memory cells.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Memory cells are typically programmed using erase and programming cycles. For example, memory cells of a particular block of memory cells are first erased and then selectively programmed. For a NAND array, a block of memory cells is typically erased by grounding all of the word lines in the block and applying an erase voltage to a semiconductor (e.g., substrate) on which the block of memory cells are formed, and thus to the channels of the memory cells, in order to remove charges which might be stored on the charge storage structures (e.g., floating gates or charge traps) of the block of memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Programming typically involves applying one or more programming pulses to a selected word line (e.g., WL<b>4</b> <b>218</b><sub>4</sub>) and thus to the control gate of each memory cell <b>220</b><sub>1-4 </sub>coupled to the selected word line. Typical programming pulses start at or near 15V and tend to increase in magnitude during each programming pulse application. While the program voltage (e.g., programming pulse) is applied to the selected word line, a potential, such as a ground potential, is applied to the channels of these memory cells, resulting in a charge transfer from the channel to the charge storage structures of memory cells targeted for programming. More specifically, the charge storage structures are typically charged through direct injection or Fowler-Nordheim tunneling of electrons from the channel to the storage structure, resulting in a Vt typically greater than zero, for example. In addition, an inhibit voltage is typically applied to bit lines not coupled to a NAND string containing a memory cell that is targeted (e.g., selected) for programming. Typically a verify operation is performed following each applied programming pulse to determine if the selected memory cells have achieved their target (e.g., intended) programmed state. A verify operation generally includes performing a sense operation to determine if a threshold voltage of a memory cell has reached a particular target value.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A sense operation typically involves applying an increasing (e.g., stepped) potential to the word line of the selected row of memory cells. As the applied sense potential increases, the sense amplifiers, such as sense amplifiers <b>230</b>/<b>330</b>, detect an ON condition of memory cells of the selected row. For example, the sense amplifiers are responsive to a memory cell having a particular threshold voltage which falls within one of the Vt ranges shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, for example. By determining the threshold voltage of a selected memory cell, the data state of the memory cell can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">After the MSB and LSB data has been sensed from the selected memory cells, the MSB and LSB data values are stored (e.g., latched) in a register <b>232</b>/<b>332</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, respectively. After all the MSB and LSB data from each selected memory cell has been latched in the register <b>232</b>/<b>332</b>, control circuitry of the memory device (not shown) facilitates the output of the latched MSB and LSB data from the register and out of the device, such as to a memory access device (not shown) coupled to the memory device, for example. However, as discussed above, having to wait until the all of the MSB and LSB data values have been sensed from all of the selected memory cells and then latched into a register might cause undesirable delays between the read request, such as initiated by a memory access device, and the output of data from the memory device.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to various embodiments, a first portion (e.g., MSB) of a data state of the selected memory cell is determined during a first sense phase of an operation (e.g., a read operation) performed on the selected memory cell (e.g., a multi-level memory cell). The first portion of the data state value is stored (e.g., latched) in register circuitry of the memory device. Following the completion of the first sense phase, control circuitry of the memory device initiates a transfer of the determined MSB data from the register and out of the memory device, such as to a memory access device (e.g., processor), for example. As the MSB data is transferred, a second sense phase occurs to determine a second portion (e.g., LSB) of the data state of the selected memory cell. The data obtained during the second sense phase is also loaded into the register circuitry. The control circuitry of the memory device then initiates a transfer of the second set of determined data (e.g., LSB data) from the register circuitry and out of the memory device once the MSB data has been transferred, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. Thus, the MSB data might be at least partially transferred from the memory device while the LSB data is still being sensed from selected memory cells, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. This might reduce the delay from a memory access device requesting data from the memory device and the memory device beginning to provide the requested data to the memory access device. Thus, a memory device according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure does not need to wait for a complete sense operation of all possible data states of each of the selected memory cells to occur before transferring data.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a plot of a sense potential applied during sensing operations according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. The increasing sense potential <b>802</b> might be applied to a particular word line of a particular row comprising a particular number of selected memory cells, for example. The waveform <b>802</b> is illustrated as a continually increasing potential, however, the various embodiments are not so limited.

During a particular (e.g., first) sense phase according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, the applied sense potential <b>802</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> might have a starting level represented by the point <b>810</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The point <b>810</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> might correspond to the point <b>910</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, for example. The application of the applied sense potential having a starting level illustrated by <b>810</b>/<b>910</b>, might comprise an initial sense operation in that both the MSB and LSB would be known for memory cells having a Vt less than the <b>810</b>/<b>910</b> level.

The LSB data might also be known for a memory cell having a Vt determined during the first sense operation to reside in the range <b>904</b> (e.g., logical &#x2018;10&#x2019;), for example. As discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, LSB data when determined might be stored in a register, such as the register locations <b>618</b> according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, as the first sense phase progresses, the applied sense potential <b>802</b> increases.

Once the applied sense potential <b>802</b> reaches the point <b>812</b>/<b>912</b>, a determination can be made of the MSB (i.e., the &#x2018;X&#x2019; data state bit position) value for each selected memory cell. Thus, more than one sense operation might be performed during the first sense phase, such as two sense operations as represented by the points <b>910</b> and <b>912</b> according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. As discussed above, once a particular portion of a data state of each selected memory cell has been determined and stored, the memory device control circuitry might begin to transfer the stored particular determined data from the memory device. Thus, according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, the control circuitry might begin to transfer the determined MSB data from the memory device as soon as the first sense phase, such as represented by time interval <b>804</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, is complete.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A second sense phase can begin following the completion of the first sense phase according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. This second sense phase might be represented by the time interval <b>806</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for example. The applied sense potential <b>802</b> continues to increase through the second sense phase. The second sense phase might be performed to determine the remaining data state values for the selected memory cells. For example, the second sense phase might facilitate a determination whether either of the threshold voltage distributions, e.g., <b>906</b> and <b>908</b>, apply to a selected memory cell. It should be noted that as discussed above, the MSB data determined during the first sense phase might be transferred from the memory device during at least a portion of the second sense phase according to one or more embodiments of the present disclosure, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Memory devices according to various embodiments of the present disclosure are not limited to two level MLC memory cells (e.g., storing only an MSB and an LSB.) Various embodiments might store additional data (e.g., bits) between an MSB and an LSB stored in the memory cells. For example, a memory cell of a memory device according to one or more embodiments might store three bits per cell (e.g., representing an &#x2018;XYZ&#x2019; bit pattern) such as represented by distributions <b>1002</b>-<b>1016</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for example. The &#x2018;X&#x2019; (e.g., MSB) position bit values for each of the selected memory cells might be determined and stored followed by initiating a transfer operation of the MSB bit values from the memory device. At least partially concurrent with the transfer of the MSB bit values, the &#x2018;Y&#x2019; position bit values might be sensed, stored and transferred from the memory device. Finally, at least partially concurrent with transferring the &#x2018;Y&#x2019; position bit values, the &#x2018;Z&#x2019; (e.g., LSB) position bit values are sensed, stored and transferred following the output of the &#x2018;Y&#x2019; position bit values according to various embodiments of the present disclosure. Thus, as the particular bit values for a particular bit position of data stored in selected memory cells are determined and stored in the register, the memory device might initiate an operation to transfer the data while still performing sense operations on the selected memory cells to determine the remaining bit values (e.g., bit position data) according to various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">By way of example, an increasing sense potential might be applied to a selected row of selected memory cells in an array of memory such as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, for example. The applied sense potential might start at a particular level associated with the point <b>1018</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and increase over time in a ramped or stepped manner As the applied sense potential achieves a particular level associated with the point <b>1020</b>, it can be determined that any memory cells which have not yet been activated have a data state of &#x2018;0&#x2019; in their MSB (i.e., position &#x2018;X&#x2019; of &#x2018;XYZ&#x2019;) position. Thus, at this point <b>1020</b>, the registers storing the MSB data for the selected memory cells might be accessed and the control circuitry of the memory device might begin to transfer the stored MSB data values. This transfer of MSB data might occur while the applied sense potential continues to increase in order to sense the data states of the remaining bit positions, such as positions &#x2018;Y&#x2019; and &#x2018;Z&#x2019;, of the selected memory cells according to various embodiments of the present disclosure, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Continuing with the present example, as the applied sense potential achieves a level associated with point <b>1022</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the data state of the middle bit position (i.e., &#x2018;Y&#x2019; position of &#x2018;XYZ&#x2019;) for all the selected memory cells is known and can be stored in the register and transferred from the memory device following the transfer of the previously determined &#x2018;X&#x2019; data state values as discussed above, for example. This process continues until each portion of each data state of each selected memory cell has been determined and output from the memory device. For example, as the applied sense potential achieves a level associated with point <b>1024</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the data state of the LSB bit position (i.e., &#x2018;Z&#x2019; position of &#x2018;XYZ&#x2019;) for all the selected memory cells is known and can be stored in the register and transferred from the memory device. Thus, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure, a first sense phase might comprise four sense operations to determine data states <b>1002</b>-<b>1008</b>, a second sense phase might comprise two sense operations to determine data states <b>1010</b>-<b>1012</b>, and a third sense phase might comprise one sense operation to determine data states <b>1014</b>-<b>1016</b> of the selected memory cells, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Thus, according to various embodiments of the present disclosure, the memory device might transfer data which has been determined while additional data yet to be determined is still being sensed in the selected memory cells of the memory device.
