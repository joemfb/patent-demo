<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">There is a rising demand to increase fuel economy in a wide range of vehicles, including passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, such as tractor trailers, and off-highway vehicles, such as mining and construction equipment. One of the ways to increase fuel economy is to reduce the size of the engine for any gasoline powered vehicle. Of course, if the engine size is reduced, available power is also reduced unless a supplemental power source for high or increased power demands can be selectively engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Selective engagement opportunities might be during high power demands, such as when the vehicle is going up a grade, passing, starting or other working conditions. A supplemental power source permits an internal combustion engine to be reduced in size so that it can still handle a wide range of power needs of the vehicle, but the internal combustion engine need not be sized to meet every possible need. Instead, the supplemental power source may be used to selectively add power to the vehicle at high demand times. It may also be permissible or desirable for the supplemental power source to recover energy from the vehicle and then use that recovered energy to power the source as well as the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One possible supplemental power source for vehicles may be such as a mechanical flywheel. Flywheel energy storage systems work by accelerating a rotor or disc to very high speeds via an external device, such as an internal combustion engine, an electromagnet, or an axle. The available kinetic energy in the system can be transferred into rotational mechanical energy, thus providing a power source to the driveline. The rotating flywheel can also be used as a power sink during braking. When energy is extracted from the flywheel, the rotational speed of the flywheel is reduced as a consequence of the principle of conservation of energy; adding energy to the flywheel correspondingly results in an increase in the speed of the flywheel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one example, a flywheel energy storage system can be connected to the front or rear axle of a vehicle. During periods of deceleration, braking energy is used to speed up the flywheel (up to about 60,000 revolutions per minute, for example). When the vehicle accelerates, the rotational energy from the flywheel is transferred to mechanical energy to the driving wheels of the vehicle via a specially designed device, like a continuously variable transmission, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A known driveline layout for a vehicle driveline <b>100</b> equipped with a flywheel <b>102</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As shown in the figure, a power source <b>104</b> (such as an internal combustion engine or an electric motor, for example) is connected to a clutch <b>106</b>, which is connected to a transmission <b>108</b>, which is connected to an axle <b>110</b> and a pair of wheels <b>112</b>. The flywheel <b>102</b> is schematically depicted as being connected to an output <b>114</b> of the power source <b>104</b>. The vehicle driveline <b>100</b> layout has several disadvantages that must be overcome.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first disadvantage of the driveline layout shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is synchronizing a varying speed of the flywheel <b>102</b> with a varying speed of a vehicle (not shown) the vehicle driveline <b>100</b> is incorporated in. The varying speed of the flywheel <b>102</b> is dependent on an amount of energy stored therein. Accordingly, if a portion of the amount of energy stored in the flywheel is transferred to the vehicle driveline <b>100</b>, a speed of the flywheel <b>102</b> drops. Each of the speeds in the vehicle driveline (a speed of the power source <b>104</b>, a speed of an input <b>116</b> of the transmission <b>108</b>, a speed of an output <b>118</b> of the transmission <b>108</b>, for example) is related to a road speed of the vehicle. As a non-limiting example, the power source <b>104</b> may have a rotational speed that varies between about 1000 revolutions per minute and about 3000 revolutions per minute; resulting in a spread factor of about 3. The flywheel <b>102</b> may have a rotational speed that varies between about 30,000 revolutions per minute to about 60,000 revolutions per minute; resulting in a spread factor of about 2. The rotational speed of the power source <b>104</b> is linked to the road speed of the vehicle, and the flywheel <b>102</b> must be able to be drivingly engaged therewith. Therefore, a device capable of providing a total spread factor of about 6 (a spread factor of about 2 multiplied by a spread factor of about 3) would be required to drivingly engage the flywheel <b>102</b> with the vehicle driveline <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A second disadvantage is a difficulty in smoothly connecting the vehicle driveline <b>100</b> with the flywheel <b>102</b>. If the flywheel <b>102</b> was infinitely rigidly connected to the driveline with an appropriate ratio, at a later point the ratio between the flywheel <b>102</b> and the road speed of the vehicle would not be valid anymore and the flywheel <b>102</b> would provide either too much torque or not enough torque. Further, pairing the vehicle driveline <b>100</b> and the flywheel <b>102</b> influences the rotational speed of the flywheel <b>102</b> and thus the amount of torque provided by the flywheel <b>102</b>. Accordingly, for the vehicle driveline <b>100</b> to be capable of engaging the flywheel <b>102</b>, the vehicle driveline <b>100</b> must permit small errors in the ratio set to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It would be advantageous to develop a driveline and a method for transferring energy from a flywheel, that increases a fuel efficiency of a vehicle the driveline is incorporated in, permits a primary power source to be selectively supplemented using the flywheel, and permits the flywheel to store and capture excess energy present in the driveline.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Presently provided by the invention, a driveline and a method for transferring energy from a flywheel, that increases a fuel efficiency of a vehicle the driveline is incorporated in, permits a primary power source to be selectively supplemented using the flywheel, and permits the flywheel to store and capture excess energy present in the driveline, has surprisingly been discovered.</p>

The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes similar components to the vehicle driveline <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Similar features of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are numbered similarly in series, with the exception of the features described below. The vehicle driveline <b>200</b> includes a power source <b>204</b> having a power source output <b>214</b>. A continuously variable transmission <b>220</b> is drivingly engaged with the power source output <b>214</b>. Next, a flywheel <b>202</b> is drivingly engaged with the continuously variable transmission <b>220</b>. Thus, through the operation of the continuously variable transmission <b>220</b> a rotational speed of the flywheel <b>202</b> can be synchronized with a rotational speed of the power source output <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">More particularly, by varying a ratio of the continuously variable transmission <b>220</b>, synchronization is achieved between the flywheel <b>202</b> and the power source <b>204</b>. In one exemplary, non-limiting example, the continuously variable transmission <b>220</b> is a pulley-belt style continuously variable transmission. The pulley-belt style continuously variable transmission comprises of a pair of variable-diameter pulleys, each shaped like a pair of opposing cones, with a belt running between them. The pulley-belt style continuously variable transmission is conventional and well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A first pulley (not shown) is then connected to the power source output <b>214</b> and a second pulley (not shown) is connected to a flywheel shaft <b>222</b>. The halves of each pulley are moveable, and as the halves of each of the pulleys are moved towards one another the belt is forced to ride higher on the pulley, effectively making a diameter of the pulley larger. Changing the diameter of the each of the pulleys varies the ratio between the power source output <b>214</b> and the flywheel shaft <b>222</b>. Making the first pulley diameter smaller and the second pulley diameter larger gives a low ratio (a large number of revolutions of the power source <b>204</b> produce a small number of output revolutions of the flywheel shaft <b>222</b>). As the rotational speed of the flywheel <b>202</b> increases (by capturing a kinetic energy of the vehicle driveline <b>200</b>), a controller <b>224</b> of the continuously variable transmission <b>220</b> varies the diameters of the first pulley and the second pulley so that the rotational speed of the power source <b>204</b> can remain substantially constant while the rotational speed of the flywheel <b>202</b> varies. The diameters of the first pulley and the second pulley are changed by altering the applied forces on the moveable halves of each pulley. The flexibility of the continuously variable transmission <b>220</b> allows the power source <b>204</b> to maintain the rotational speed appropriate for the vehicle driveline <b>200</b> over a wide range of rotational speeds of the flywheel <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is also understood that the continuously variable transmission <b>220</b> and the flywheel <b>202</b> may be drivingly engaged with another portion to the vehicle driveline <b>200</b>. As non-limiting examples, the continuously variable transmission <b>220</b> may be drivingly engaged with the transmission output <b>218</b>, a drive shaft <b>226</b>, or an axle <b>210</b> of the vehicle driveline <b>200</b>. When the continuously variable transmission <b>220</b> and the flywheel <b>202</b> are drivingly engaged with one of the transmission output <b>218</b>, the drive shaft <b>226</b>, and the axle <b>210</b>, power losses that may occur between the power source <b>204</b> and the axle <b>210</b> may be reduced.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The flywheel <b>302</b> permits energy to be captured from or supplied to the vehicle driveline <b>300</b> during typical operation of the vehicle or to supplement the power source <b>304</b> when operation of the vehicle requires a greater amount of power than the power source <b>304</b> is capable of supplying. Further, it is understood that the flywheel <b>302</b> permits energy to be supplied to the vehicle driveline <b>300</b> in amounts the power source <b>304</b> may not be capable of supplying.

The vehicle driveline <b>400</b> includes a power source <b>404</b> having a power source output <b>414</b>, a flywheel transmission <b>440</b>, and a flywheel clutch <b>442</b>. The flywheel clutch <b>442</b> connects the power source output <b>414</b> and the flywheel transmission <b>440</b>.

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The flywheel transmission <b>440</b> is a fixed step transmission. Fixed step transmissions are commonly known in the art.

<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a vehicle driveline <b>500</b> according to another embodiment of the invention. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes similar components to the vehicle driveline <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Similar features of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> are numbered similarly in series, with the exception of the features described below. The vehicle driveline <b>500</b> includes a power source <b>504</b> having a power source output <b>514</b>, a planetary distribution gearset <b>544</b>, and a torsional damper <b>546</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The planetary distribution gearset <b>544</b> includes a carrier assembly <b>548</b>, a ring gear <b>550</b>, and a sun gear <b>552</b>. The carrier assembly <b>548</b> is drivingly engaged with the power source output <b>514</b> and includes a plurality of carrier pinions <b>554</b> rotatably disposed thereon; however, it is understood that gearing (not shown) disposed between the carrier assembly <b>548</b> and the power source output <b>514</b> may be used to adjust a rotational speed of the carrier assembly <b>548</b>.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The torsional damper <b>546</b> connects the planetary distribution gearset <b>544</b> and the flywheel <b>502</b>. The torsional damper <b>546</b> may comprise a pair of coaxial member having a plurality of biasing member interposed therebetween; however, it is understood that the torsional damper <b>546</b> may be any other type of torsional damper. Compression of the biasing member permits angular deviation between the coaxial members. The torsional damper <b>546</b> may be conventional torsional damper that is well known in the art; however, it is understood that the torsional damper <b>546</b> may be configured to store a greater amount of energy than a conventional torsional damper and may accommodate large angular deviations between the coaxial members. Further, it is understood that the torsional damper <b>546</b> may be a slipping clutch. The slipping clutch is conventional and well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The vehicle driveline <b>500</b> permits a rotational speed of the power source <b>504</b> to be adjusted to permit energy to be captured from or supplied to the vehicle driveline <b>500</b> during typical operation of the vehicle or to supplement the power source <b>504</b> when operation of the vehicle requires a greater amount of power than the power source <b>504</b> is capable of supplying. The planetary distribution gearset <b>544</b> of the vehicle driveline <b>500</b> may be placed in a powered neutral position when the carrier assembly <b>548</b> (which is drivingly engaged with the power source output <b>514</b>) and the sun gear <b>552</b> (which is drivingly engaged with the flywheel <b>502</b>) rotate in similar directions in proportion equal to a split ratio of the planetary distribution gearset <b>544</b>. Depending on an amount of energy stored in the flywheel <b>502</b> (a minimum amount is needed for the planetary distribution gearset <b>544</b> to be placed in the powered neutral position), the rotational speed of the power source <b>504</b> is adjusted by the controller <b>524</b> to place the planetary distribution gearset <b>544</b> in the powered neutral position.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With the vehicle driveline <b>500</b> drivingly engaged with the ring gear <b>550</b>, the flywheel <b>503</b> has an opposite speed compared to the power source <b>504</b>. The flywheel <b>503</b> is connected through the torsional damper <b>546</b> to the sun gear <b>552</b>. The torsional damper <b>546</b> is used to assist in control over the power source <b>504</b>, which typically cannot adjust a rotational speed immediately in response to the controller <b>524</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For a given speed of the vehicle driveline <b>500</b>, a rotational speed of the power source <b>504</b> is set to a calculated value using the controller <b>524</b> so that a rotational speed of the vehicle driveline <b>500</b> and a rotational speed of the flywheel <b>503</b> are substantially equal. The vehicle driveline <b>500</b> may always be placed in such a condition when a rotational speed of the vehicle driveline <b>500</b> is above a certain positive value.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When a rotational speed of the power source <b>504</b> is a positive speed, and because the power source <b>505</b> provides a positive power, a torque vector of the power source <b>504</b> is positive. Since the vehicle driveline <b>500</b> absorbs power through the planetary distribution gearset <b>544</b>, the torque vector acting on the planetary distribution gearset <b>544</b> is negative, hence a torque vector applied on the sun gear <b>552</b> is also negative by operational constraints of planetary gearsets. Thus, if a rotational speed of the flywheel <b>502</b> is opposite to a rotational speed of the power source <b>504</b>, the flywheel <b>502</b> can deliver positive power to the vehicle driveline <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The vehicle driveline <b>500</b> described above requires active control using the controller <b>524</b>. By delivering power to the vehicle driveline <b>500</b>, the flywheel <b>502</b> will decrease in rotational speed and the vehicle increase in speed. By delivering power to the vehicle driveline <b>500</b>, a speed gap between the vehicle driveline <b>500</b> and the torsional damper <b>546</b> is reduced until a torque delivered by the flywheel <b>502</b> will about equal zero. Without active control of a rotational speed of the power source <b>504</b>, when a rotational speed of the power source <b>504</b> synchronizes with a rotational speed of the flywheel <b>502</b>, torque stops being transferred from the flywheel <b>502</b>. Accordingly, active control over a rotational speed of the power source <b>504</b> is needed to always maintain a speed gap over the torsional damper <b>546</b> so that torque may continue to be transferred from the flywheel <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Using similar control of the rotational speed of the power source <b>504</b>, the vehicle driveline <b>500</b> permits energy to be captured from the vehicle driveline <b>500</b> and stored in the flywheel <b>502</b>. Such a condition occurs when a rotational speed of the ring gear <b>550</b> is greater than the rotational speed of the carrier assembly <b>548</b>, and the sun gear <b>552</b> is driven through the carrier pinions <b>554</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As a non-limiting example, the flywheel <b>502</b> may capture or supply between about 10% and about 30% of the power requirements of the vehicle the vehicle driveline <b>500</b> including the planetary distribution gearset <b>544</b>, the torsional damper <b>546</b>, and the flywheel <b>502</b> are incorporated in.</p>

Each of the fluid couplings <b>664</b>, <b>666</b> include two coaxial members which define a fluid cavity.

As a number of gear ratios included with the flywheel transmission <b>772</b> increases, losses that occur by joining the transmission input <b>716</b> with the flywheel decrease. The flywheel transmission <b>772</b> may be combined with the transmission <b>708</b> to reduce a cost of the vehicle driveline <b>700</b>; the flywheel transmission <b>772</b> and the transmission <b>708</b> may share a housing, lubrication systems, gearing, or other transmission components. Alternately, it is understood that in embodiments of the invention not shown similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the flywheel transmission <b>772</b> or the transmission <b>708</b> may be a continuously variable transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The flywheel <b>702</b> and the flywheel transmission <b>772</b> may be used to start the power source <b>704</b>. By placing the transmission <b>708</b> into a neutral position and partially engaging the clutch <b>706</b>, energy stored in the flywheel <b>702</b> is transferred to the power source <b>704</b>. When the power source <b>704</b> is an internal combustion engine, energy transferred thereto when the power source <b>704</b> is not operating may be used to start the power source <b>704</b>. It is also understood that the clutch <b>706</b> may be utilized as a heat sink to dissipate heat generated when the clutch <b>706</b> is partially engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It is also understood that in embodiments of the invention not shown similar to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> having a flywheel and a flywheel transmission connecting to a vehicle driveline between a power source and a primary clutch that the flywheel may also drivingly engage the vehicle driveline between the primary clutch and the vehicle transmission to permit energy stored in the flywheel to be used to start the power source.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As a non-limiting example, the flywheel <b>702</b> may capture or supply between about 3% and about 10% of the power requirements of the vehicle the vehicle driveline <b>700</b> including the flywheel transmission <b>772</b> and the flywheel <b>702</b> are incorporated in.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a vehicle driveline <b>800</b> according to another embodiment of the invention. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> includes similar components to the vehicle driveline <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Similar features of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> are numbered similarly in series, with the exception of the features described below. The vehicle driveline <b>800</b> includes a switching clutch assembly <b>874</b>, a torsional damper <b>846</b>, and gearing bypass <b>876</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The flywheel <b>802</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is geared to permit driving engagement with the switching clutch assembly <b>874</b> with a gearing assembly <b>878</b>. The gearing assembly <b>878</b> comprises a series of gears and shafts that reduce a rotational speed of the flywheel <b>802</b> to a rotational speed that permits the switching clutch assembly <b>874</b> to drivingly engage therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The switching clutch assembly <b>874</b> includes a first switching clutch <b>880</b>, a second switching clutch <b>882</b>. The first switching clutch <b>880</b> and the second switching clutch <b>882</b> are fast acting clutches and are each in communication with the controller <b>824</b>. During operation of the vehicle driveline <b>800</b>, either the first switching clutch <b>880</b> or the second switching clutch <b>882</b> is engaged.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The first switching clutch <b>880</b> may comprise a plurality of friction plates that engage a geared portion of the first switching clutch <b>880</b> with a switching clutch assembly output <b>884</b>. The geared portion of the first switching clutch <b>880</b> is drivingly engaged with an output of the gearing assembly <b>878</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The second switching clutch <b>882</b> may comprise a plurality of friction plates that engage a geared portion of the second switching clutch <b>882</b> with the switching clutch assembly output <b>884</b>. The geared portion of the second switching clutch <b>882</b> is drivingly engaged with the power source output <b>814</b>, and may be geared to permit driving engagement therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The torsional damper <b>846</b> connects the switching clutch assembly output <b>884</b> and the transmission input <b>816</b>. The torsional damper <b>846</b> may be geared to permit driving engagement with the transmission input <b>816</b>. The torsional damper <b>846</b> may comprise a pair of coaxial member having a plurality of biasing member interposed therebetween; however, it is understood that the torsional damper <b>846</b> may be any other type of torsional damper. Compression of the biasing member permits angular deviation between the coaxial members. The torsional damper <b>846</b> may be conventional torsional damper that is well known in the art; however, it is understood that the torsional damper <b>846</b> may be configured to store a greater amount of energy than a conventional torsional damper and may accommodate large angular deviations between the coaxial members.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The gearing bypass <b>876</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a mechanical connection linking the power source output <b>814</b> to the transmission <b>808</b> of the vehicle driveline <b>800</b>. The gearing bypass <b>876</b> may be selectively engaged using a clutch (not shown). The gearing bypass <b>876</b> may also reduce a rotational speed of the power source <b>804</b> to a rotational speed that permits the transmission <b>808</b> to drivingly engage therewith. Further, it is understood that in place of the gearing bypass <b>876</b>, the vehicle driveline <b>800</b> may include a ground (not shown) which the transmission <b>808</b> may be partially engaged with, to brake at least a portion of the vehicle driveline <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">When energy is supplied to the vehicle driveline <b>800</b> from the flywheel <b>802</b>, such as when operation of the vehicle requires a greater amount of power than the power source <b>804</b> is capable of supplying, the controller <b>824</b> directs the first switching clutch <b>880</b> to engage, which results in a transfer of energy from the flywheel <b>802</b> to the torsional damper <b>846</b>. The controller <b>824</b> also monitors an amount of energy stored in the torsional damper <b>846</b>. When an appropriate amount of energy is stored in the torsional damper <b>846</b>, the controller <b>824</b> engages the second switching clutch <b>882</b> and disengages the first switching clutch <b>880</b>. Upon engagement of the second witching clutch <b>882</b>, the energy stored in the torsional damper is transferred to the transmission input <b>816</b>, thus assisting the power source <b>804</b>. In embodiments of the invention including the ground instead of the gearing bypass <b>876</b>, the second switching clutch <b>882</b> may be engaged with the ground, and the energy stored in the torsional damper is transferred to the transmission input <b>816</b>. Upon sensing a torque in the vehicle driveline <b>800</b> dropping below a predetermined level, the controller <b>824</b> engages the first switching clutch <b>880</b> and disengages the second switching clutch <b>882</b> to transfer more energy from the flywheel <b>802</b> to the torsional damper <b>846</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The vehicle driveline <b>800</b> reduces energy transformation losses and thus increases an efficiency of the vehicle driveline <b>800</b> by using the first switching clutch <b>880</b> and the second switching clutch <b>882</b> and by using the torsional damper <b>846</b> having a decreased mass. The torque delivered by the vehicle driveline <b>800</b> varies within threshold parameters set by the controller <b>824</b> at the switching frequency of the first switching clutch <b>880</b> and the second switching clutch <b>882</b>. If a frequency of switching is low, a second torsional damper (not shown) could be inserted to militate against vibrations traveling from the transmission <b>808</b> into remaining portions of the vehicle driveline <b>800</b>. Further, it is understood that the second torsional damper could be a dual mass flywheel or a portion of the vehicle driveline <b>800</b> having an increased mass.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts one embodiment for implementing the method and apparatus discussed above, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments. Instead, there may be many variations in architecture as well as choices in controls that will result in similar improvements in efficiency of the vehicle driveline. Further, while the use of torsional damper <b>846</b> to temporarily store energy at a given speed and release that stored energy at another speed with limited energy loss is depicted in one embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the same use of the torsional damper <b>846</b> can be utilized in any of the other embodiments depicted and described herein in essentially the same manner.</p>
