<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention provides an improved host-vector system to clone and express target protein-coding genes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The expression of recombinant proteins for commercial production and biomedical research is a major undertaking in molecular biology. Recent efforts towards the development of &#x201c;structural genomics,&#x201d; in which protein structures for entire genomes are to be determined, create increased demand for simple, high-throughput cloning/expression systems (Walhout et al., 2000; Chandonia and Brenner, 2006; Blow, 2008).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">While a variety of host organisms have been used to produce foreign proteins, the most commonly employed microorganism is the gram-negative bacterium, <i>Escherichia coli</i>. A common limitation of recombinant protein expression in <i>E. coli </i>is the toxicity of overexpressed proteins (Chen, 1994; Miroux and Walker, 1996).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Inducible Expression of Recombinant Proteins in <i>E. coli </i>Plasmid Vectors:</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Host-vector systems that allow tightly regulated, inducible gene expression in <i>E. coli </i>are greatly preferred. Many different strains of <i>E. coli </i>and several DNA cloning vectors for protein expression have been developed (Bolivar et al., 1977; Yannisch-Perron et al., 1985; Denhardt and Colasanti, 1988; Godiska et al., 2005). The most widely used recombinant DNA cloning systems for regulated expression of proteins in <i>E. coli </i>rely upon transcription using bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (Studier and Moffatt, 1986; Rosenberg et al., 1987).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">T7 Expression Systems:</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">T7 plasmid expression systems take advantage of (1) the specificity of binding of T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase to its cognate DNA promoter (Rong et al., 1998) and (2) the high efficiency of T7 RNA polymerase-catalyzed transcription (Davanloo et al., 1984). In order to minimize synthesis of potentially toxic gene products, expression vectors are constructed so that transcription of target genes is under the control of T7 promoters on multi-copy plasmids (U.S. Pat. No. 4,952,496 to Studier et al., 1990; U.S. Pat. No. 5,693,489 to Studier et al., 1997). Transcription from T7 promoters occurs only in bacterial strains engineered to overproduce T7 RNA polymerase.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To minimize expression of deleterious gene products, cloning of DNA fragments under the control of a promoter for T7 RNA polymerase is performed in <i>E. coli </i>host strains that lack the gene for the T7 RNA polymerase, T7 gene 1 (T7gpl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>). For downstream protein expression, the recombinant plasmid carrying the T7 promoter upstream of the target gene can be introduced into a second host strain which expresses T7 RNA polymerase. Although this dual-host strategy helps to limit unwanted expression of potentially toxic proteins, it also imposes a significant effort in terms of time and labor.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is theoretically possible to design an improved plasmid host-vector system in which a single <i>E. coli </i>T7gpl<sup>+</sup> host strain is used for both DNA transformation and subsequent expression of target genes. However, such a cloning/expression vector system is practical only if gene expression can be maintained under tight repression prior to induction, and if such repression can be overcome effectively upon induction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">State-of-the-Art T7 Expression Systems are Leaky:</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><i>E. coli </i>systems used for T7-based expression place the target genes in recombinant plasmids under transcriptional control of T7 RNA polymerase (Dubendorff and Studier, 1991; U.S. Pat. No. 4,952,496 to Studier et al., 1990; U.S. Pat. No. 5,830,694 to Studier and Dubendorff, 1998). Commonly used strains such as <i>E. coli </i>BL21(DE3) are lysogens of the bacteriophage &#x3bb; derivative &#x3bb;DE3 (Studier and Moffatt, 1986). In these lysogenic strains, T7 gene 1 (encoding bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase) is expressed from the lacUV5 promoter, a highly active variant of the <i>E. coli </i>lac promoter. If lac repressor protein (lacI gene product) is bound to the lac operator DNA, then transcription of T7gpl by <i>E. coli </i>RNA polymerase is prevented. However, upon binding to an inducer, such as allolactose, isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG), etc., the conformationally altered repressor-inducer complex dissociates from operator DNA, allowing RNA transcription to proceed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In principle, expression of T7 RNA polymerase from lacUV5 promoters is selectively de-repressed upon addition of inducer to bacterial cells (Studier and Moffat, 1986; Rosenberg et al., 1987). However, in practice, the lacUV5 promoter is subject to considerable &#x201c;leaky&#x201d; expression&#x2014;even in the absence of inducer. This leakiness can lead to buildup of toxic gene products and instability of T7 expression vectors in host <i>E. coli </i>strains prior to induction (Studier et al., 1990; Chen, 1994; FIG. 1).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Strategies to Minimize Leaky Expression in T7 Plasmid Cloning Vectors:</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">One strategy employed to limit &#x201c;leaky&#x201d; expression of T7 promoter-dependent target genes is to augment transcriptional control by positioning a lac operator sequence adjacent to plasmid T7 promoters. Transcription from such T7-lac hybrid promoters is largely inhibited when the lac repressor protein occupies the operator (Dubendorff and Studier, 1991).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Unfortunately, the introduction of multi-copy plasmids containing T7-lac promoters into <i>E. coli </i>cells increases the number of lac operator DNA sequences. As a result, endogenous lac repressor protein, which is normally present at about ten copies per cell, is titrated. In the absence of sufficient lac repressor protein, both the lacUV5 promoter controlling T7 RNA polymerase and the T7-lac promoter controlling the expression of the target protein become derepressed.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In order to ensure that sufficient lac repressor is available to maintain repression of T7-lac and lacUV5 promoters, several strategies have been employed to increase lac repressor expression in the host cell. One strategy of increasing lac repressor expression is by incorporating high-expressing alleles of the lacI gene into the T7-lac expression vector (Dubendorff and Studier, 1991; Peranen et al., 1996). Mutant alleles of the lacI promoter have been described which express elevated levels of lac repressor protein. One such allele, lacI<sup>q</sup>, contains a single point mutation in the &#x2212;35 promoter element of lacI which increases the amount of lac repressor protein by 10-fold, as compared to wild-type <i>E. coli </i>(Calos, 1978; U.S. Pat. No. 6,569,669 to Raleigh). For low-copy vectors maintained at &#x2dc;20 copies/cell, the combination of increased transcriptional activity of the lacI<sup>q </sup>promoter and increased copy number of the repressor gene is expected to result in a level of lac repressor that is &#x2dc;200-fold higher than is normally produced from a single chromosomal copy of wild-type lacI. This increased level of repressor protein is expected to provide for tighter repression of target genes under control of a T7-lac promoter.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, increasing the expression of the lac repressor protein to minimize background expression can be detrimental to protein production under certain modes of induction. Studies have shown that high levels of lac repressor protein resulting from the lacI<sup>q </sup>allele reduce the ability to induce protein expression through auto-induction (Blommel et al., 2007 and U.S. Pub. No. 2008/0286749 to Fox et al.).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Thus, a delicate balance between the lac repressor expression level and the number of lac operator sites must be attained for a system to both minimize background expression under uninduced conditions and permit acceptable expression levels upon induction for use with a variety of modes of induction.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A preferred version of the invention includes an <i>E. coli </i>host. The host includes a T7 RNA polymerase gene comprising a T7gpl coding sequence operationally linked to a lacUV5 promoter, the latter of which comprises a lac operator. The host further includes a lacI gene comprising a lacI coding sequence with an ATG start codon, wherein the lacI gene is operationally connected to a promoter from the lac<sup>ql </sup>allele and a translational enhancer derived from a 5&#x2032; RNA leader sequence of T7 gene 10, and wherein the lacI gene includes transcriptional terminators derived from the tonB gene. This lacI gene is referred to herein as the lacI<sup>ql+en </sup>allele (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). The preferred version of the invention further includes a low-copy plasmid vector comprising a T7 promoter upstream of a target gene insertion site and a lac operator operationally linked to the T7 promoter (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention effectively prevents the leaky background expression present in conventional T7 systems. Controlling factors involved in T7-lac expression systems is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, tight control of T7gpl and target gene expression is achieved when sufficient lac repressor (lacI) is present in cells, so that chromosomal lacUV5 and plasmid T7-lac promoters are turned off. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, if insufficient lac repressor is present in the cells, limited transcription from lacUV5 promoter results in expression of the T7gpl gene and production of T7 RNA polymerase. The expressed T7 RNA polymerase binds to T7-lac promoters on the plasmid, resulting in limited synthesis of plasmid-encoded gene products. This &#x201c;leaky&#x201d; expression of target genes is an unwanted property of many T7 expression systems. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, induction involves binding of an inducer (IPTG) to the lac repressor, resulting in an altered lac repressor conformation that inhibits binding of the lac repressor to DNA. The repressor-IPTG complex dissociates from lac operator DNA, thereby activating transcription from lacUV5 and T7-lac promoters.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The tight control of gene expression as achieved by the present system is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the genetic composition of the present system results in production of lacI repressor at sufficiently high levels to tightly inhibit transcription of T7gpl and target genes in the absence of an inducer. Specifically, in the absence of inducer (depicted as IPTG), the abundant intracellular lac repressor binds to the lac operators controlling expression from the lacUV promoter and the T7 promoter. As a result, neither T7 RNA polymerase nor the target protein is produced in uninduced cells. If sufficient inducer is present, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, then the conformationally altered lac repressor-inducer complex dissociates from the lacUV5 promoter, allowing synthesis of T7 RNA polymerase and transcription of target genes from T7-lac promoters.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition to preventing background expression, the present invention also permits sufficient protein production after induction, particularly in the case of auto-induction.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, the present invention produces an amount of lac repressor to properly balance between repression of expression in the uninduced state and induction of protein expression in the induced state, particularly with auto-induction.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The objects and advantages of the invention will appear more fully from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment of the invention made in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.</p>

Preferred hosts include &#x3bb;DE3 lysogens of <i>E. coli</i>, such as BL21(DE3). The same host in the present invention can preferably be used for both recombinant DNA cloning and protein expression.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The host preferably comprises a T7 RNA polymerase gene configured to produce a T7 RNA polymerase protein. The T7 RNA polymerase gene preferably includes a T7 RNA polymerase coding sequence, a promoter operationally linked to the T7 RNA polymerase coding sequence, and a lac operator operationally linked to the promoter. The T7 RNA polymerase gene is preferably incorporated into the host's chromosomal DNA or contained on a single-copy vector.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">&#x201c;T7 RNA polymerase gene&#x201d; refers to any gene that expresses the T7 RNA polymerase enzyme or variants thereof which are capable of polymerizing RNA after binding to the T7 promoter. Exemplary coding sequences of a T7 RNA polymerase are provided by GenBank Accession No. M38308.1, the coding sequence for the T3/T7-like RNA polymerase encoded by T7 gene 1 (T7gpl; SEQ ID NO:8 for nucleic acid sequence and SEQ ID NO:9 for protein sequence), and variants thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">&#x201c;Promoter&#x201d; refers to a DNA sequence, normally located upstream of a protein-coding sequence, which contains a binding site for an RNA polymerase. The promoter for the T7 RNA polymerase is preferably structured to enable transcription by machinery comprised within the host. The promoter may include, for example, the <i>E. coli </i>lac promoter. A preferred promoter is the lacUV5 promoter or variants thereof, an exemplary version of which is provided by SEQ ID NO:1.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">&#x201c;Operationally linked&#x201d; generally refers to the association of nucleic acid sequences on a single nucleic acid fragment so that the function of a first sequence is regulated by the a second sequence. In the context of a promoter being operationally linked to a coding sequence, the promoter is capable of regulating the expression of that coding sequence, i.e., the coding sequence is under the transcriptional control of the promoter. Coding sequences can also be operationally linked to regulatory sequences (such as enhancers) in a sense or antisense orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">&#x201c;Lac operator&#x201d; refers to a DNA sequence that binds to the lac repressor. Sequences of lac operators are well known in the art. Exemplary lac operator sequences are provided by SEQ ID NO:2; nucleotides 22-43 of SEQ ID NO:1, and nucleotides 71-88 of SEQ ID NO:7. &#x201c;Operationally linked&#x201d; in the context of a lac operator being operationally linked to a promoter refers to the ability of the lac operator to regulate the ability of the promoter to control expression of the coding sequence under specific conditions, such as ability of the lac operator to inhibit promoter-dependent expression of the T7 RNA polymerase gene when lac inhibitor protein is bound thereto. The lacUV5 promoter as depicted provided by SEQ ID NO:1 includes a lac operator (nucleotides 22-43 of SEQ ID NO:1).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The host also preferably includes a lacI gene. &#x201c;LacI gene&#x201d; refers to any gene that expresses the lac repressor protein or any variants thereof which are capable of binding to the lac operator. In a preferred version, the lacI gene includes a lacI coding sequence, a promoter operationally linked to the lacI coding sequence, and a translational enhancer sequence. A schema of an exemplary lacI gene (i.e., lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>allele) is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. An exemplary nucleic acid sequence of a lacI gene (i.e., lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>allele) is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and is included herein as SEQ ID NO: 4. Variants of the lacI gene of SEQ ID NO:4 are also included in the invention. The lacI gene is preferably incorporated into the host's chromosomal DNA or contained on a single-copy vector.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The lacI coding sequence may begin with any initiation codon, including the GTG found in the native <i>E. coli </i>lacI coding sequence or ATG. The preferred version of the lacI coding sequence includes an ATG initiation codon. An exemplary lacI coding sequence is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (nucleotides 87-1169 of SEQ ID NO:4). Variants of the lacI coding sequence in SEQ ID NO:4 are also included in the invention. The polypeptide product encoded by the coding sequence of SEQ ID NO:4 is provided by SEQ ID NO:5.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The promoter for the lacI coding sequence may include the native lacI initiation codon or any variants thereof, such as the promoter (SEQ ID NO:6) of the lacI<sup>q </sup>allele (Glascock and Weickert, 1998). The lacI<sup>q </sup>promoter includes a point mutation in the promoter region upstream of the native lacI gene, resulting in a 10-fold increase in mRNA transcription. A preferred version of the invention includes the promoter (nucleotides 1-56 of SEQ ID NO:4) on the lacI<sup>ql </sup>allele. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The lacI<sup>ql </sup>promoter comprises a deletion in the &#x2212;35 regions upstream of the lacI gene. The resulting substitution of upstream sequences into the &#x2212;35 region results in a 100- to 200-fold increase in mRNA transcription.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">&#x201c;Translational enhancer&#x201d; refers to any sequence known or discovered in the art that increases the efficiency of translation of protein from mRNA. The translational enhancer sequence is preferably derived from the translational enhancer derived from the 5&#x2032; RNA leader sequence of T7 gene 10. An exemplary version of the translational enhancer sequence is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and is provided by nucleotides 62-71 of SEQ ID NO:4. Variants of the translational enhancer sequence shown in SEQ ID NO:4 are included in the present invention. Exemplary variants include TTAACTTTA, TTAACTT, TTAACT, ACTTTA, AATTTTA, GGCTTT, AACTTTG, AACTTT, and TAACTTTA. The translational enhancer is preferably disposed in the lacI gene between the promoter and the coding sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Some versions of the lacI gene include transcriptional terminators derived from specific sources. In a preferred version, the lacI gene includes a transcriptional terminator derived from the tonB gene of <i>E. coli</i>. An exemplary version of a tonB terminator is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and provided by nucleotides 1170-1208 of SEQ ID NO:4.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The T7 RNA polymerase gene and the lacI gene are preferably integrated into the host's chromosomal DNA or harbored on a single-copy plasmid such as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Integration of the genes into the host's chromosomal DNA can be introduced by restriction enzyme-mediated cloning strategies, PCR-based cloning strategies, or allele replacement methods (e.g., Angrand et al., 1999, Payne et al., 1999, and Posfai et al., 1997). Introduction of the BAC into the host can be performed as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,569,669.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The genetic elements included in a single copy of the lacI gene of the present invention preferably provide for increased expression of the lac repressor protein compared to the wild-type <i>E. coli </i>lacI gene. Various versions of the lacI genes of the present invention, when present in a host in a single copy, increase lac repressor protein expression of at least about 2-fold, 5-fold, 10-fold, 50-fold, 100-fold, 200-fold, 300-fold, or 400-fold compared to the wild-type <i>E. coli </i>lacI gene. The degree of the increase in a particular version, however, may vary according to downstream uses. The amount of lac repressor protein in the cells is preferably high enough to substantially inhibit background expression of the recombinant gene in uninduced conditions while permitting a significant increase in expression of the recombinant gene upon induction. This is structurally a result of lac repressors being bound to substantially all (or at least a large majority) of lac operators in the uninduced state (i.e., in the absence of inducer) and lac repressors dissociating from substantially all (or at least a large majority) of the lac operators in the induced state (i.e., in the presence of inducer). The amount of lac repressor protein in the cells preferably permits an increase in expression of the recombinant gene of at least about 10 fold, 25 fold, 50 fold 100 fold, 200 fold, 300 fold, 400 fold, 500 fold, 600 fold, 800 fold, 1000 fold or more upon induction.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In some versions, the system further includes a T7 plasmid vector. &#x201c;T7 plasmid vector&#x201d; refers to any extrachromosomal DNA molecule capable of replicating independently from chromosomal DNA, capable of harboring a recombinant target gene, and capable of expressing the recombinant target gene under the control of a T7 promoter. The target gene includes, without limitation, any gene intended to be cloned, recombined, and/or expressed in the host. The gene product produced from the target gene is referred to herein as &#x201c;target protein.&#x201d; The T7 plasmid vectors of the present invention preferably include a target gene insertion site, a T7 promoter operationally linked to the target gene insertion site, a lac operator operationally linked to the T7 promoter, and/or an antibiotic-resistance marker gene. A schematic illustration of an exemplary T7 plasmid vector (&#x201c;pETite&#x201d;) is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. An exemplary sequence of a T7 plasmid vector (&#x201c;PETite&#x201d;) is provided in SEQ ID NO:7. A T7 promoter operationally lined to a lac operator is referred to herein as a &#x201c;T7-lac&#x201d; promoter.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The target gene insertion site includes a nucleotide sequence suitable for incorporation of a target gene. Sequences suitable for incorporation of target genes are known in the art and include but are not limited to multiple cloning sites. Exemplary gene insertion sites include between nucleotides 145 and 146 and between nucleotides 163 and 164 in SEQ ID NO:7, depending whether a C-terminal His6 tag or an N-terminal His6 tag, respectively, is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The T7 promoter of the present invention preferably comprises the sequence as provided in SEQ ID NO:3, nucleotides 51-70 of SEQ ID NO:6, or variants thereof, and is disposed upstream of the target gene insertion site. Any variants of the T7 promoter must maintain the ability of the T7 RNA polymerase to bind thereto. &#x201c;Operationally linked&#x201d; used with reference to the T7-lac promoter being operationally linked to the recombinant gene insertion site refers to the ability of the T7-lac promoter to drive expression of a gene inserted in the recombinant gene insertion site through activity of the T7 RNA polymerase.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The lac operator operationally linked to the T7 promoter preferably includes the lac operator sequences as described herein, or variants thereof. &#x201c;Operationally linked&#x201d; used with reference to the lac operator being operationally linked to the T7 promoter refers to the ability of the lac operator to regulate the ability of the promoter to control expression of the coding sequence under specific conditions, such as ability of the lac operator to inhibit promoter-dependent expression of the target gene when lac inhibitor protein is bound thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">&#x201c;Antibiotic resistance marker gene&#x201d; refers to a gene whose encoded gene product confers resistance to one or more antibiotics when expressed in a host cell (and its progeny). The definition explicitly includes any antibiotic resistance marker now known or developed in the future, including (without limitation) markers that confer resistance to ampicillin (e.g., beta-lactamase [bla, TEM-1]), hygromycin (e.g., hygromycin phosphotransferase [aphIV, hpt, hph]), kanamycin and/or neomycin (e.g., neomycin phosphotransferase II [nptII, APH(3&#x2032;)-II]), chloramphenicol (e.g., chloramphenicol acetyltransferase [cm<sup>R</sup>, cat]), tetracycline (tet<sup>R</sup>), and the like. Inclusion of an antibiotic resistance marker gene on the T7 plasmid vector permits selection of hosts harboring the plasmid with the appropriate antibiotics. In the preferred version of the invention, the T7 plasmid vector includes the nptII neomycin phosphotransferase gene, which confers resistance to neomycin and kanamycin (Beck et al., 1982).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The T7 plasmid vector may further comprise transcriptional terminators between the vector backbone and the target gene to prevent read-through transcription from the vector backbone, or may contain other elements as necessary (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,709,861 to Mead and Godiska).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The T7 plasmid vector preferably comprises fewer than about 4000, fewer than about 3000, or fewer than about 2500 base pairs in the absence of an inserted recombinant gene. Increased expression of lac repressor protein resulting from the engineered lacI allele separately maintained in the host strain described herein provides a sufficient amount of lac repressor protein for control of T7 RNA polymerase and target gene expression in the absence of additional copies of the lacI gene. Thus, in a preferred version of the invention, the T7 plasmid vector does not carry a copy of the lacI gene. The absence of a lacI gene on the T7 plasmid vector allows the vector to be reduced by about 1.2 kb. The resulting streamlined cloning vector facilitates biochemical manipulations of DNA in vitro. Because PCR-based manipulations tend to lose fidelity as the size of the amplicon increase, the relatively small size of the vector in the present system lends itself to PCR-based cloning procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The T7 plasmid vector is preferably structured to be a low-copy number vector. &#x201c;Low-copy number&#x201d; refers to plasmid copy numbers fewer than about 300 copies of the plasmid within a cell, including less than about 200 copies, 50 copies, 25 copies, 10 copies, or 5 copies. Plasmids containing the ColE1 origin of replication are maintained at a low copy number (&#x2dc;20-40 copies per cell) when the rop gene is present on the plasmid. Plasmids containing the ColE1 original of replication are maintained at about several hundred copies in the absence of the rop gene.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The invention includes variants of any of the sequences disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Variants of the sequences described herein include homologs. Homologs can be identified by homologous nucleic acid and polypeptide sequence analyses. Known nucleic acid and polypeptide sequences in one organism can be used to identify homologous polypeptides in another organism. For example, performing a query on a database of nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences can identify homologs thereof. Homologous sequence analysis can involve BLAST or PSI-BLAST analysis of databases using known polypeptide amino acid sequences (see, e.g., Altschul et al., 1990). Those proteins in the database that have greater than 35% sequence identity are candidates for further evaluation for suitability in the systems and methods of the invention. If desired, manual inspection of such candidates can be carried out in order to narrow the number of candidates that can be further evaluated. Manual inspection is performed by selecting those candidates that appear to have conserved domains. Determining nucleic acid sequences from discovered homologous amino acid sequences or amino acid sequences from discovered homologous nucleic acid sequences can be deduced using the genetic code.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Variants of the coding sequences described herein include degenerate variant sequences that encode the same polypeptides as disclosed herein. Such degenerate variants can be deduced with the genetic code.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Variants of the sequences described herein also include conservative amino acid substitutions of the sequences described herein. A &#x201c;conservative substitution&#x201d; means the replacement of one amino acid by an amino acid having a similar side chain. Families of amino acid residues having similar side chains have been defined in the art. These families include amino acids with basic side chains (e.g., lysine, arginine, histidine), acidic side chains (e.g., aspartic acid, glutamic acid), uncharged polar side chains (e.g., asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, tyrosine, cysteine), nonpolar side chains (e.g., glycine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, phenylalanine, methionine, tryptophan), beta-branched side chains (e.g., threonine, valine, isoleucine) and aromatic side chains (e.g., tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, histidine).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Variants of the sequences described herein include fragments of the sequences described herein. &#x201c;Fragment&#x201d; means a portion of the full length sequence. For example, a fragment of a given polypeptide is at least one amino acid fewer in length than the full length polypeptide (e.g. one or more internal or terminal amino acid deletions from either amino or carboxy-termini). Fragments therefore can be any length up to, but not including, the full length polypeptide. Suitable fragments of the polypeptides described herein include but are not limited to those having 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or more of the length of the full length polypeptide.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Variants of the sequences described herein also include repeating units of the sequences described herein. &#x201c;Repeating units&#x201d; means a repetition of a given sequence in tandem. Also included are polypeptides having repeating units of fragments of the sequences described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The variant sequences include sequences with about 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or more identity to the sequences described herein. The term &#x201c;identity&#x201d; and grammatical variations thereof, mean that two or more referenced entities are the same. Thus, where two protein sequences are identical, they have the same sequence. The extent of identity between two sequences can be ascertained using a computer program and mathematical algorithm known in the art. Such algorithms that calculate percent sequence identity (homology) generally account for sequence gaps and mismatches over the comparison region. For example, a BLAST (e.g., BLAST 2.0) search algorithm (see, e.g., Altschul et al., 1990) has exemplary search parameters as follows: Mismatch &#x2212;2; gap open 5; gap extension 2. For polypeptide sequence comparisons, a BLASTP algorithm is typically used in combination with a scoring matrix, such as PAM100, PAM 250, and BLOSUM 62.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Suitable variants of the nucleic acid or polypeptide sequences disclosed herein have the same type of activity (without regard to the degree of the activity) as the nucleic acid or polypeptide to which the sequence corresponds. Such activities may be tested according to the assays described in the Examples below and according to methods known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In addition to providing the aforementioned system, the invention also provides methods of using the system.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">One method includes a method of ligase-free cloning of a recombinant gene. The method includes the steps of linearizing a plasmid vector and a target gene into a linearized plasmid and a linearized target gene, respectively, and transforming the mixture into a host. In the context of the methods described herein, &#x201c;target gene&#x201d; comprises any component of the genes described herein, including a coding sequence, a promoter, operators, enchancers, etc., either alone or in various combinations. Thus, &#x201c;linearized target gene&#x201d; may refer to a linearized promoter, operator, and coding sequence as individual linearized nucleic acid molecules. Alternatively, &#x201c;linearized target gene&#x201d; may refer to a linearized promoter, operator, and coding sequence together on one nucleic acid molecule. Similarly, &#x201c;linearized plasmid&#x201d; may include several individual fragments which together comprise the plasmid.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The step of linearizing a plasmid and a target gene into a linearized plasmid and a linearized target gene can occur by several methods. In one method of linearization, the plasmid and/or the target gene is linearized with restriction enzymes. With respect to the plasmid, the linearization typically occurs after the plasmid has been amplified by growth of a host harboring the plasmid followed by purification of the amplified plasmid. With respect to the target gene, the linearization typically occurs by enzymatically digesting a cDNA encoding the target gene. In another method of linearization, the plasmid and/or target gene is amplified by PCR. See Sambrook et al. (1989) for a discussion of the procedures relating to restriction digestion and PCR. For insertion of the target gene in the plasmid, it is preferred that that plasmid is linearized within the target gene insertion site.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">&#x201c;Transforming&#x201d; refers to any method used to cause the uptake of DNA by living cells. The invention includes any known method of introducing DNA into living cells known or hereafter discovered. Various methods include chemical transformation (e.g., calcium chloride-mediated transformation), electroporation, sonication, macroinjection, microinjection, and viral infection. See Sambrook et al., eds., <i>Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual</i>, Cold Spring Harbor Lab Publ., 11.51, (1989) for various transformation methods.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Once the linearized plasmid and linearized target gene are introduced within the host, the host's internal machinery produces a recombinant DNA molecular comprising the plasmid and the target gene.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A specific method of carrying out ligase-free cloning includes incomplete PCR (iPCR). In iPCR, the 5&#x2032;&#x2192;3&#x2032; polymerase-catalyzed extension of a template is unfinished, so that 5&#x2032; single-stranded DNA ends remain available for base-pairing. Methods of performing iPCR are described in Li and Elledge, 2007, and U.S. Pub. No. 2007/0292954 to Elledge. A schematic for iPCR and cloning therewith is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. If a plasmid vector is small enough to be efficiently PCR-amplified (&#x3c;5,000 bp long), as with the T7 plasmid vectors described herein, it can be converted into a linear DNA molecule with 5&#x2032; single-stranded ends by iPCR. Incomplete 5&#x2032;&#x2192;3&#x2032; elongation during PCR amplification results in a substantial portion of linearized plasmid molecules which contain 15- to 100-nt 5&#x2032; single-stranded DNA ends. Target genes are iPCR-amplified using 5&#x2032; tagged primers which contain &#x2dc;20 nt vector sequences (marked in bold in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>; see forward and reverse His6 primers in SEQ ID NO:7). One way of introducing complementarity between the iPCR-amplified plasmid and the target gene is to use primers in the plasmid iPCR reaction that have portions complementary to the primers used in the target gene iPCR reaction. iPCR-amplified target gene and plasmid DNAs, which contain complementary 5&#x2032; single-stranded overhangs, are mixed together, and the resulting gapped DNA duplexes are transformed into the host. This is followed by selection on nutrient plates with an appropriate antibiotic.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Another method of carrying out ligase-free cloning includes in vivo homologous recombination. See Bubeck et al., 1993. This method exploits the natural intracellular enzymatic machinery in the host to produce recombinant DNA molecules. In the method, the plasmid and the target gene are amplified with primers in complete PCR that result in blunt-ended terminal ends of the plasmid having homologous overlap with blunt-ended terminal ends of the target gene. Homologous overlap from about 5 bp to about 42 and greater is acceptable. Homologous overlap of about 10 bp is preferred. The linearized plasmid and linearized target gene with homologous terminal ends are cotransformed into the host. Maximum yields are obtained with about equimolar concentrations of linearized plasmid and linearized target gene. In some cases, only the target gene must be linearized, such as when a circular plasmid contains homologous regions with a distance spanning the homologous regions that is similar to the length of the target gene.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Other methods of ligase-free cloning are described in Aslanidis and de Jong, 1990; Kuijper et al., 1992; Oliner et al., 1993; and Klock et al., 2008.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The removal of the lacI gene from the plasmid described herein and the resulting reduction in plasmid size render the plasmid described herein particularly suited for ligase-free cloning using the PCR-based methods described above.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Methods of using the system described herein also include expressing either a target gene using the same host used for cloning. The method includes inducing expression of the target gene in the host. The ability to clone DNA and express protein therefrom in the same host is achieved by the tight, inducible control of the target gene in the present system, wherein expression of the target protein (potentially a toxic protein) is substantially prevented or minimized prior to induction, and wherein induction is sufficient to induce a substantial increase in expression of the target gene.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">One method of induction includes the direct addition of an inducer to cell media that is either not sufficiently produced by the cell itself or is not produced by the cell at all. Such inducers that may be added to the cell media to induce target gene expression include but are not limited to allolactose, isopropylthiogalactoside (IPTG), methyl-&#x3b2;-D-thiogalactoside, phenyl-&#x3b2;-D-galactose, and ortho-Nitrophenyl-&#x3b2;-galactoside (ONPG). The inducers are preferably added to the cells after growth to mid-log phase at concentrations of about 0.5 mM to 1.0 mM. Other concentrations may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Other methods of induction rely on processes within the host under specific conditions to generate the inducer as an internally produced metabolite. This type of induction is referred to herein as &#x201c;auto-induction.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The auto-induction method of inducing gene expression in conventional T7 systems has been used for production of recombinant proteins in <i>E. coli </i>(Studier, 2005; U.S. Pat. No. 7,560,264 to Studier). Auto-induction of transcription of cloned DNA in cultures of bacterial cells is an approach that employs different carbon sources to support cell growth and protein expression without the requirement to monitor the culture growth state. Auto-induction arises from a complex set of changes in growth conditions and host regulatory responses.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Auto-induction protocols were originally formulated for T7 promoter-based expression, and are based on the function of lac operon regulatory elements in mixtures of glucose, glycerol, and lactose under diauxic growth conditions. During the initial growth period, glucose is preferentially used as a carbon source and protein expression is low due to catabolite repression of alternative carbon utilization pathways and binding interactions between lac repressors and lac operators. As glucose is depleted, catabolite repression is relieved, leading to a shift in cellular metabolism toward the import and consumption of lactose and glycerol. Lactose import results in the production of allolactose from lactose by a reaction of &#x3b2;-galactosidase. Allolactose then acts as the physiological inducer.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">An inducible T7 expression system is highly effective and is used for production of proteins from cloned coding sequences in <i>E. coli</i>. Although IPTG has typically been used to induce expression of target proteins in the inducible T7 expression system, lactose will also cause induction through auto-induction and, being much cheaper than IPTG, may be preferable for large-scale production (Hoffman et al., 1995).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Methods for carrying out auto-induction in the present system can be performed as described in Studier, 2005; U.S. Pat. No. 7,560,264 to Studier; Blommel et al., 2007; and U.S. Pub. No. 2008/0286749 to Fox et al.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Blommel et al. provide evidence that increasing lacI expression is detrimental to target protein production in inducible systems. Blommel et al. show that increasing expression of lac repressor protein by employing the lacI<sup>q </sup>allele in a T5-lac expression system significantly reduced protein expression through auto-induction. Conversely, Blommel et al. also show that manipulation of the lacI promoter to decrease expression of lac repressor protein lead to increased target protein expression through auto-induction. Blommel et al. additionally show that auto-induction using the T7-lac system resulted in even lower target protein expression levels than with the T5-lac system. These teachings suggest that manipulating the lacI promoter to increase lac repressor protein expression, especially in the T7-lac system, would further reduce target protein expression through auto-induction.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The T7-based system described herein produces the unexpected result that the various modifications engineered into the lacI gene in the T7 system of the present invention results not only in extremely low background expression levels but in a significant increase in target expression upon auto-induction. These modifications include placing the lacI coding sequence under the control of a stronger promoter, i.e., lacI<sup>ql </sup>allele, adding a translational enhancer, and employing an ATG start codon. Without being limited by mechanism, it is believed that the low background expression levels and increase in target expression upon auto-induction is achieved by the system's particular balance among the amount of lac repressor protein produced in the system, the number of available lac operators available for binding, and the amount of inducer produced upon auto-induction. The distances between the various genetic elements on the nucleic acid also play a role in the amount of lac inhibitor produced in the current system to achieve the particular balance.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Thus, the amount of the lac repressor protein expressed in the current system is sufficiently high to substantially inhibit background expression of the recombinant gene when uninduced but sufficiently low to permit induction by auto-induction. The amount of lac repressor protein in the cells preferably permits an increase in expression of the recombinant gene of at least about 10 fold, 100 fold, 200 fold, 300 fold, 400 fold, 500 fold, 600 fold or more upon auto-induction.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Construction of a New lacI Allele for High-Level Expression of lac Repressor Protein in <i>E. coli </i></heading>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The chromosomal wild-type lacI gene is transcribed from a promoter characterized by a weak &#x2212;35 element, and is normally expressed at an intracellular concentration of &#x2dc;10 nM, or 10 molecules/cell of tetrameric repressor protein. A mutant promoter allele, lacI<sup>ql </sup>(Calos and Miller, 1981; Glascock and Weickert, 1998) contains a deletion of 15 DNA base pairs in the &#x2212;35 region of the lac promoter. A consensus &#x2212;35 element replaces the weak &#x2212;35 element, resulting in 170-fold higher transcription than wild-type lacI, and 17-fold higher than the point mutant promoter, lacI<sup>q </sup>(Calos, 1978).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">To achieve even higher levels of lac repressor protein, a novel allele of lacI was constructed that combines the strong (170-fold&#x2191;) lacI<sup>ql </sup>promoter with two additional features that increase the efficiency of lacI mRNA translation. The first of these elements is a translational enhancer derived from the 5&#x2032; RNA leader sequence of T7 gene 10. The second feature, designed to increase the translation of lacI mRNA, is the substitution of the non-canonical GTG initiation codon with an ATG codon. The combination of the inclusion of the gene 10 translational enhancer and substitution of ATG for GTG as the initiation codon is expected to further increase the level of repressor protein expression by at least 2- to 4-fold. Finally, the strong transcriptional terminator from the tonB gene of <i>E. coli </i>was introduced downstream of the lac repressor coding region to ensure efficient termination and to prevent the high level of transcription from the lacI<sup>ql </sup>promoter from interfering with other plasmid functions. These features were generated using standard molecular biological techniques. This allele is designated here as lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>and is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">When harbored on a BAC plasmid vector or integrated into the <i>E. coli </i>chromosome, the lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>construct is maintained at 1 copy/cell. The level of lac repressor produced from the resulting single-copy construct is expected to be at least 300-fold higher than the amount produced from wild-type lacI, or about 30-fold higher than the amount produced by a single-copy of lacI<sup>q</sup>. This level of repressor is also at least 50% higher than that produced from lacI<sup>q </sup>harbored on a multi-copy plasmid maintained at &#x2dc;20 copies/cell.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Tight Repression of Target Genes Cloned Under a T7-lac Promoter</heading>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A DNA polymerase gene was cloned under the control of the T7-lac promoter in the pET28a vector (Merck, Whitehouse Station, N.J.) and in the pETite vector (Lucigen, Madison, Wis.). The pET28a vector is a &#x2dc;5.4 kb plasmid having a lac operator adjacent to a T7 promoter and bearing a copy of lacI to provide for increased expression of lac repressor protein. The pETite vector is a &#x2dc;2.2 kb plasmid with a lac operator adjacent to a T7 promoter but with no lacI gene. The plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells not harboring lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>or into BL21(DE3) cells harboring lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>on a BAC plasmid. Transformants were selected on YT plates containing 30 &#x3bc;g/ml kanamycin. Transformants with the pETite vector could not be obtained in BL21(DE3) cells lacking the lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>BAC plasmid but were readily obtained in BL21(DE3) cells containing the lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>BAC plasmid. Single colonies of transformants were inoculated into LB+kanamycin and grown at 37&#xb0; C. until they reached an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.6-0.8. Samples of uninduced cells were harvested by centrifugation. The remainder of the culture was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG, and incubation was continued for an additional 3 hours. Induced cells were harvested as above, and both uninduced and induced cell samples were lysed by heating to 95&#xb0; C. in SDS gel loading buffer. Equivalent samples (0.05 OD<sub>600 </sub>units) were separated by electrophoresis on a 4-20% denaturing gel and stained with Coomassie blue.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The lane marked M contains molecular weight markers. Lanes marked &#x2212; and + contain uninduced (&#x2212;IPTG) and induced (+IPTG) samples, respectively. The uninduced sample from pET28a-transformed cells without the lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>allele showed significant accumulation of the DNA polymerase. By contrast, uninduced samples from pET28a- or pETite-transformed cells containing the lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>allele (BL21(DE3)+placI<sup>ql+En</sup>) showed very low background levels of expression. Upon treatment with 1 mM IPTG for 3 hours, all samples were induced to express high levels of the DNA polymerase (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). However, the samples containing the lacI both within the host and on the vector, i.e., pET28a-transformed cells containing the lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>allele (BL21(DE3)+placI<sup>ql+En</sup>), showed slightly lower expression upon induction.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Despite the having a lac operator adjacent to the T7 promoter and an additional copy of the lacI gene, pET series vectors such as in the pET28a vector allow leaky expression of target proteins in the uninduced state. An example of such leaky expression is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Improved control of this leaky expression has been achieved by incorporating the overexpressing lac repressor allele, lacI<sup>ql+En</sup>, in the BL21(DE3) host strain on a single-copy BAC plasmid. The level of lac repressor protein produced from the lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>allele harbored on a BAC plasmid in BL21(DE3) cells was sufficient to allow elimination of lacI from the T7 expression vector while still achieving low background levels under uninduced conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). In addition, further removing the lacI gene from the vector provided for the highest dynamic range of expression between uninduced and induced conditions (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Expression of a Fluorescent Protein in BL21(DE3) Harboring lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>Upon IPTG Induction</heading>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">A gene encoding a yellow fluorescent protein was cloned under the control of a T7-lac promoter in the pET28a vector, which harbors a copy of lacI. The plasmid was transformed into four different T7 host strains and expression of the fluorescent protein after induction with IPTG was evaluated. The strains tested were BL21(DE3) with no additional lacI, BL21(DE3) harboring lacI<sup>ql+En</sup>, NEB T7 Express (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, Mass.) harboring lacI<sup>q </sup>on a single copy mini F plasmid, and NEB T7 Express harboring both lacI<sup>q </sup>and lysY. The lysY gene encodes a variant form of T7 lysozyme, an inhibitor of T7 RNA polymerase (WO 2008/073746 to Samuelson et al. and Cheng et al., 1994). Transformants were inoculated into LB+kanamycin and grown at 37&#xb0; C. until they reached an OD<sub>600 </sub>of 0.6-0.8. Samples of uninduced cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the remainder of the culture was induced by the addition of 1 mM IPTG. Induced samples were harvested after 1 hour and 3 hours of induction at 37&#xb0; C. Uninduced and induced cells were resuspended in water, and samples (200 &#x3bc;l) containing equivalent OD<sub>600 </sub>units were analyzed on a fluorescence plate reader with excitation at 428 nm and emission detected at 528 nm. Aliquots of the samples were also analyzed by electrophoresis on a 4-20% denaturing gel and staining with Coomassie blue.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> shows the relative fluorescence of uninduced and induced samples of the four host strains. The BL21(DE3) cells with or without lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>and the NEB T7 Express lacI<sup>q </sup>cells all produced similar levels of fluorescence after induction for 1 hour. After 3 hours of induction, the BL21(DE3) cells harboring lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>showed slightly higher fluorescence than the standard BL21(DE3) and NEB T7 Express lacI<sup>q </sup>cells. The NEB T7 Express lacI<sup>q </sup>lysY cells developed fluorescence at a much slower rate, with significantly less fluorescence than the other 3 strains at both 1 hour and 3 hours of induction. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> shows the Coomassie blue-stained denaturing polyacrylamide gel, with lanes 1, 4, 7, and 10 showing uninduced samples; lanes 2, 5, 8, and 11 showing samples induced for 1 hr; and lanes 3, 6, 9, and 12 showing samples induced for 3 hrs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> B confirms the similar yields of induced protein in all but the NEB T7 Express lacI<sup>q </sup>lysY cells, which produced significantly less of the induced protein. Thus, the high level of lac repressor expression in BL21(DE3) cells harboring lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>does not interfere with rapid, high-level expression of a gene under the control of a T7-lac promoter.</p>

<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Enhanced Expression of a Fluorescent Protein in BL21(DE3) Harboring lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>During Auto-Induction</heading>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The T7 host strains described in Example 3 harboring the yellow fluorescent protein gene cloned into pET28a were also subjected to auto-induction. Colonies were inoculated into LB medium containing kanamycin and supplemented with &#x201c;OVERNIGHT EXPRESS&#x201d;-brand auto-induction solutions (Novagen, EMD, Darmstadt, Germany) as recommended by the manufacturer. Cultures were grown at 37&#xb0; C. for 16 hours, and samples containing equivalent OD<sub>600 </sub>units were harvested by centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in water, and fluorescent protein expression was quantitated using a fluorescence plate reader as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The BL21(DE3) strain without lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>and the NEB T7 Express lacI<sup>q </sup>strains produced comparable levels of fluorescence, while the NEB T7 Express lacI<sup>q </sup>lysY strain failed to develop fluorescence. Surprisingly, the BL21(DE3) cells harboring lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>allele exhibited approximately 2-fold more fluorescence than the BL21(DE3) strain without lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>or the NEB T7 Express lacI<sup>q </sup>strain.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The increase in target protein expression upon auto-induction in strains harboring the lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>allele compared to strains harboring the lacI<sup>q </sup>allele or the wild-type lacI allele was unexpected, and is contrary to results obtained with a lac-regulated promoter derived from bacteriophage T5 (Blommel et al., 2007 <i>Biotechnol. Prog. </i>23: 585-598). Blommel et al. found a negative correlation between the dosage of lac repressor protein and the yield of target fluorescent protein during auto-induction. The presence of a lacI<sup>q </sup>allele on the T5 promoter expression plasmid severely reduced the expression of a target fluorescent protein in comparison to a plasmid-harbored wild-type lacI allele.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Thus, the lacI<sup>ql+En </sup>allele and/or the expression system taught herein are exceptionally suited for the auto-induction method of inducing target protein expression.</p>
