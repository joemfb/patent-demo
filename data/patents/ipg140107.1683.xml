<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A differential with torque distribution comprises two differentials. The two differentials can be connected in serial with one of the side gear of the first differential driving the housing of the second differential, and one of the side gear of the second differential being connected to the other side gear of the first differential, and vise versa. Hence the torque on the two output shafts of the differential with torque distribution are different. The rotational speeds on the respective two output shafts are independent of the change of torque on the two output shafts.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates generally to the automotive differential and torque distribution on its output shafts.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The conventional open differential of automotive distributes driving torque evenly to its two output shafts. Various torque-vectoring designs are attempted and approached. Some of them are based on varying gear ratio as means to vary torque, as is disclosed in the patent U.S. Pat. No. 7,491,147 B2, and U.S. Pat. No. 7,708,665 B2. However such means of varying torque for particular shafts will cause the change of the rotational speed of the shafts accordingly.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a design and implementation of differential with torque distribution for automotive vehicles. It comprises two regular differentials familiar to those in the field. The two differentials are coupled in serial. In one aspect of the present invention, it can distribute driving torque to its two output shafts with differential amplitude relative to the driving torque at its input. In another aspect of the present invention, it varies torque on its two output shafts without changing rotational speeds of the output shafts correspondingly.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the differential with torque distribution in one embodiment <b>20</b> comprises differentials <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. The differential <b>1</b> comprises a housing <b>3</b>, two side gears <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, a set of pinion gears <b>4</b>. The side gear <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and the set of the pinion gears <b>4</b> are pivotally positioned in the housing <b>3</b>. The set of pinion gears <b>4</b> mesh with the side gears <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>. The differential <b>2</b> comprises a housing <b>7</b>, two side gears <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, a set of pinion gears <b>8</b>. The side gear <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, and the set of pinion gears <b>8</b> are pivotally positioned in the housing <b>7</b>. The set of pinion gears <b>8</b> mesh with the side gears <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>. The differentials <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> are pivotally positioned about an axis A, next to each other. A coupling element <b>11</b> connects the side gear <b>6</b> to the housing <b>7</b> such that the side gear <b>6</b> and the housing <b>7</b> rotate together. A shaft <b>12</b> is connected to the side gears <b>5</b> and <b>9</b> such that the shaft <b>12</b>, the side gears <b>5</b> and <b>9</b> rotate together. A shaft <b>13</b> is connected to the side gear <b>10</b> such that the shaft <b>13</b> and the side gear <b>10</b> rotate together. A gear <b>14</b> is firmly connected to the housing <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The driving torque b is applied to the gear <b>14</b>, and is transferred to and equally shared by the side gears <b>5</b> and <b>6</b> through the housing <b>3</b> and the set of pinion gears <b>4</b>. The torque c on the side gear <b>5</b>, the torque d on the side gear <b>6</b> are about 50% of the driving torque b each. The torque c on the side gear <b>5</b> is transferred onto the shaft <b>12</b>. The torque d on the side gear <b>6</b> is transferred to and equally shared by the side gear <b>9</b> and <b>10</b> through the coupling elements <b>11</b>, the housing <b>7</b>, the set of pinion gears <b>8</b>. The torque e on the side gear <b>9</b>, the torque f on the side gear <b>10</b> are about 50% of the torque d each. The torque e on the side gear <b>9</b> is transferred onto the shaft <b>12</b>. The torque f on the side gear <b>10</b> is transferred onto the shaft <b>13</b>. Thus the torque on the shaft <b>12</b> is the addition of the torque c and e, and is about 75% of the driving torque b; the torque f on the shaft <b>13</b> is about 25% of the driving torque b. The shaft <b>12</b>, <b>13</b> can rotate at the same or different speed, which is independent of the torque c, e f.</p>

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the mode 1 of the differential with torque distribution <b>50</b>, the driving torque is evenly distributed to its two output shafts, and the two output shafts can rotate with the same or different speed. In the mode 2, the driving torque is evenly distributed to its two output shafts, and the two output shafts rotate together. In the mode 3 and 4, the driving torque is distributed 100% to one output shaft with the other output shaft rotates freely. In the mode 5 and 6, the torque is distributed unevenly to its two output shafts by putting the two differentials in serial with one of the side gear of one differential driving the other differential, and the other side gear of the first differential being connected to the side gear of the second differential of the same side. The two output shafts are still connected to the two differentials, thus their rotating speed can be different from each other as well as independent of the torque they transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Switching modes among the mode 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 makes the torque on the shafts <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> change. Switching modes among the mode 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 does not necessarily make the speed of the shaft <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> change. The change of the torque on the shafts <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> is independent of the speed or speed change of the shafts <b>32</b> and <b>33</b> during the mode switching. This is due to the nature of the differential, and the application along with arrangement of differentials in the differential with torque distribution. This is different than varying torque by switching gear ratio. In the mechanism of switch gear ratio, power=torque*rotational speed=constant. Thus increase of torque causes decrease of rotational speed and vise versa.</p>
