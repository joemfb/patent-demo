<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A lightweight radio/CD player for vehicular application is virtually &#x201c;fastenerless&#x201d; and includes a case and frontal interface formed of polymer based material that is molded to provide details to accept audio devices such as playback mechanisms (if desired) and radio receivers, as well as the circuit boards required for electrical control and display. The case and frontal interface are of composite structure, including an insert molded electrically conductive wire mesh screen that has been pre-formed to contour with the molding operation. The wire mesh provides EMC, RFI, BCI and ESD shielding and grounding of the circuit boards via exposed wire mesh pads and adjacent ground clips. The PCB architecture is bifurcated into a first board carrying common circuit components in a surface mount configuration suitable for high volume production, and a second board carrying application specific circuit components in a wave soldered stick mount configuration. The major components and subassemblies are self-fixturing during the final assembly process, eliminating the need for dedicated tools, fixtures and assembly equipment. The major components and subassemblies self-interconnect by integral guide and connection features effecting &#x201c;slide lock&#x201d; and &#x201c;snap lock&#x201d; self-interconnection. The radio architecture includes improved push buttons employing 4-bar living hinge linkage and front loaded decorative trim buttons.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to apparatus for enclosing electrical subassemblies, and more specifically relates to apparatus for efficiently securing subassemblies to a chassis of an electrical assembly such as an automobile radio, compact disc playing mechanism, cassette tape playing mechanism, navigational aid, personal computer, personal and telematic communication devices or disk drive mechanism.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Devices such as automobile radios or personal computers contain subassemblies such as cassette playing mechanisms or disk drives that are attached to the chassis using threaded fasteners. The chassis provides structural support for the subassemblies and also provides electromagnetic shielding to limit electromagnetic interference (EMI) experienced by, and/or created by the device. The fasteners ensure that each subassembly within the chassis is properly located and securely retained within the chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of such fasteners can have numerous drawbacks, particularly in a high volume production setting. The process for applying or installing fasteners can vary, but there is usually some degree of automation required, ranging from manually loading a screw into a bit on a pneumatic driver to using self-feeding automated machines. Typically, the torque applied by the device used to drive the fasteners must be monitored regularly and adjusted in order to assure proper seating of the fasteners. When fasteners are used, sheet metal tolerances, as well as tolerances of the fasteners themselves, have to be maintained at tight levels to allow for the minimization of stress in the assembly when aligning multiple fasteners with corresponding holes in the chassis and in the subassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When threaded fasteners are used to assemble an electrical device, the assembly cycle time can be very long especially in high volume production. An operator assembling the device must typically first obtain the threaded fastener, orient and position it in alignment with the driver bit, then manipulate or actuate the machine to drive the threaded fastener. Furthermore, using threaded fasteners presents a risk of any one of the following upstream failures occurring: stripping of fastener threads; insufficient torque resulting in an unseated fastener; excessive torque resulting in distension/deformation of the fastener or adjacent electrical components; installation of the wrong fastener type or size; foreign object damage due to fasteners and/or metal shavings dropping onto the assembly and/or subassembly; and stripping of the head of the threaded fastener. Also, a fastener installation tool such as a driver and bit can slip off the fastener and impact an electrical component resulting in a damaged assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">If self-tapping fasteners are used, the process of driving the self-tapping fasteners into sheet metal often causes shavings of sheet metal to disperse into the assembly. Such shavings have been known to cause electrical failures, such as shorts or corruption of magnetic components that can permanently damage the product. If self-tapping fasteners are not used, an extra production step is required to pre-form threads in the sheet metal of the chassis and/or the subassembly to be installed within the chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Fasteners further require an additional inventory burden on the production line in that the production line must be continuously stocked with part numbers (fasteners) other than the integral components that add value to the assembly. Also special tools specifically required for assembly, using fasteners, such as drivers and bits, must be continuously monitored and maintained for proper performance, wear and torque specifications. Typically, the top and/or bottom surface of the chassis must be secured in place after the subassembly is attached to the chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Special fixtures are often required on the production line to secure a subassembly in a proper location and orientation while it is mounted within the chassis with fasteners. Such fixtures can be very complex, and the use of such fixtures usually requires extra handling of both the subassembly and of the resulting assembly thereby adding to the production cycle time and potentially compromising quality of the final product.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the construction of a typical prior art automotive radio/compact disc (CD) player <b>10</b>. Radio/CD player <b>10</b> comprises a radio subassembly whose principle circuit components are carried on a circuit board <b>12</b> and a CD player subassembly <b>14</b>. The circuit board <b>12</b> and the CD player <b>14</b> are encased within a common chassis <b>16</b> made up of sheet metal components. Chassis <b>16</b> includes a wraparound housing <b>18</b> defining a back and sidewalls, a top cover <b>20</b>, a bottom cover <b>22</b> and a front plate <b>24</b> which are interconnected by numerous threaded fasteners to collectively enclose the subassemblies. The top and bottom covers <b>20</b> and <b>22</b>, respectively, are provided with large arrays holes or openings for airflow and ventilation of heat generated within the radio/CD player <b>10</b>. A convector or heat sink <b>26</b> is carried on an outer surface of one of the chassis sidewalls and is interconnected through a port/window <b>28</b> to a power device assembly <b>30</b>. A trim plate assembly <b>32</b>, along with a support pad <b>34</b> and CD dust cover <b>36</b> are affixed to the front plate <b>24</b>, providing an operator control interface with the radio/CD player <b>10</b>. Circuit board <b>12</b> is electrically in-circuit with the CD player subassembly <b>14</b> through an intermediate flex wire cable <b>38</b> and with the power device assembly <b>30</b> through a jumper cable <b>40</b>. Information bearing labels <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> are provided for future reference by the operator and service technicians. The radio/CD player <b>10</b> is electrically interconnected with an antenna, power supply, speakers and other related systems of a host vehicle by rear-facing connectors <b>46</b> carried on the circuit board <b>12</b> which are registered with openings <b>48</b> in the rear wall of wraparound housing <b>18</b>. The radio/CD player <b>10</b> is mounted within a host vehicle by threaded fasteners passing through openings in mounting features <b>50</b> extending from front plate <b>24</b> and a rearwardly directed mounting bushing <b>52</b> which is threadably affixed to a stud <b>54</b> carried on the outer surface of the rear wall <b>56</b> of wraparound housing <b>18</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, the shank of the stud <b>54</b> extends outwardly through a hole <b>58</b> disposed concentrically with a localized recess <b>60</b> and the stud <b>54</b> is seated within the recess <b>60</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 90</figref> illustrates another known stud design including a threaded shank secured to the rear wall <b>53</b> of a radio set <b>51</b> by a set nut <b>55</b> and receiving a molded rubber, plastic or vinyl stud <b>57</b> thereover. Note the large number of threaded fasteners <b>59</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The radio/CD player <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is of ordinary complexity and may require fifty or more threaded fasteners to complete the manufacturing process. Installation of that many fasteners may require that the in-process chassis be re-positioned/re-fixtured ten to fifteen times as it passes along an assembly line of eight to ten skilled workers/work stations.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Vehicle entertainment systems usually include an audio component such as a radio to enable receiving signals from antennas, contain various forms of playback mechanisms, and have the capacity to accept data from user devices like MP3 players. Typically, the radio has a decorative assembly that provides man-machine interface as well as displaying pertinent data relative to the selected media and audio settings. Also, the back-end or chassis is constructed of metal to provide various functions to ensure the performance of the radio in the vehicular environment. The structure to contain the mass from playbacks, the heat conductive properties, and the electrical shielding and grounding are just a few of the advantages to using the metal construction. Unfortunately, with the density of the metal, the disadvantage of added weight is a side effect of the typical construction. In a vehicle, added weight impacts fuel economy, as well as other hidden costs during assembly that can effect the cost of the product, like sharp edges of metal can be a potential hazard for assemblers in the manufacturing plant as well as added weight can limit the packaging of multiple parts in containers for inter and outer plant distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thermal Management System</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Devices such as automobile stereos, audio amplifiers, home stereo systems, two-way radios, computers, signal conditioners/amplifiers, compact disc playing mechanisms, and cassette tape playing mechanisms are examples of products that typically require electrical components to amplify signals and regulate power. Accordingly, such devices typically contain numerous electrical components such as single in-line package (SIP) amplifiers and regulators that are typically soldered into printed circuit boards. Such electrical components generate heat in use. The heat must be dissipated away from the electrical components to avoid damage that can be caused by excessive temperatures in the electrical components. For example, excessive temperatures can cause delicate electrical leads to fail or insulating materials to melt, thereby causing a short circuit resulting in damage to, or even failure of, the entire electrical device.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A convector is often mounted to an outer surface of such a device to dissipate heat generated by components by transferring the heat away from the components and the device to the convector and then to the air through radiation. In order to accomplish this, it is preferable that the convector be physically in contact with the component. The components and the convector can be pressed together to allow even better heat conduction from the components to the convector. Sometimes an intermediary material such as a thermal pad or silicon grease is used between the component and the convector to assist in creating an adequate heat transfer junction.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Many convectors are made from aluminum due to the high heat conductivity of that material. Convectors often include a plurality of fins to increase the effective surface area of the convector and thereby increase the rate at which the convector can dissipate heat. Typically, aluminum, convectors are formed by an extruding process, during which the fins can also be formed integrally therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Convectors are usually assembled to the component or components during final assembly of the overall device in which they are used. At final assembly, components such as SIP amplifiers are already soldered into a printed circuit board. The order of assembly can vary as to which component is assembled into the chassis first. The printed circuit board can be installed into the chassis before the convector is mounted to the printed circuit board and the chassis. Alternatively, the convector can be mounted to the chassis before the printed circuit board is mounted to the convector. Sometimes, the convector is assembled to the printed circuit board to form a subassembly before being assembled to the chassis.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Typically, components are attached to the convector using a clip and one or more threaded fasteners that extend through a hole in the clip and into a hole in the convector. The clip, component and convector must all be simultaneously held in a fixture and then be fastened together with a threaded fastener. If the component includes a hole to accept a threaded fastener, it can be mounted directly to the convector using a threaded fastener that extends through that hole, without using a clip.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The use of such fasteners can have numerous drawbacks, particularly in a high volume production setting. Often, each hole in the convector that receives a fastener must be separately drilled or punched. This is especially true for an extruded convector if the axis of the hole is not aligned with the direction in which the convector is extruded. The fastening process can vary, but there is usually some degree of automation required, ranging from manually loading a screw into a bit on a pneumatically or electrically powered driver to using self-feeding screw machines. Typically, the torque applied by the device must be monitored regularly and adjusted in order to assure proper seating of the fasteners.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The clamping force between the convector and the component should be at a proper level to ensure sufficient heat transfer to the convector. When fasteners are used to attach the convector to the component, clamping force is a function of the type of fastener and its condition and degree of assembly (e.g. the level of torque applied during installation of the fastener). Thus, a threaded fastener that is not seated all the way will give less clamping force than one that is seated all the way. Or, a stripped or improper type of fastener may provide an insufficient clamping force.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Special fixturing is often required to hold a component in the proper location while it is mounted to the convector using one or more fasteners. Such fixturing can be very complex and use of such fixturing usually requires extra handling of both the component and of the resulting assembly, thereby adding to the production cycle time and potentially compromising quality of the final product.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">When threaded fasteners are used, the assembly cycle time can be very long, especially in high volume production. The operator must specifically obtain the threaded fastener, bring it in contact with the driver bit, then drive the threaded fastened. If self-tapping fasteners are used, the process of driving the self-tapping fasteners into metal often causes metal shavings to disperse into the assembly. Such shavings have been known to cause electrical failures that can permanently damage the product. If self-tapping fasteners are not used, an extra production step is necessary to form threads in the metal of the convector.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Accordingly, there is a need for electrical assemblies that do not require fasteners or tooling for securing a component to a convector.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Electrostatic Discharge Device</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Static electricity (electrostatics) is created when two objects having unbalanced charges touch one another, causing the unbalanced charge to transfer between the two objects. This phenomenon commonly occurs in homes, vehicles and other environments when the air is dry (i.e. has a characteristic relatively low level of humidity). For instance, when a person slides onto a car seat, electrons may transfer between the two, causing the surface of the person's body to store a charge. When the person, then, touches a vehicle component, the charge may travel (discharge) from the body to the component, thus creating static electricity. If the object touched is an electronic device, such as a home stereo, home theatre system, computer, vehicle entertainment system or other electronic media system, this electrostatic discharge can be harmful to the sensitive electronic components of the device. For instance, when a person slides onto a vehicle seat and inserts a disc into the car stereo, a charge may travel from the body through the disc to the sensitive electronic components in the vehicle stereo. Similar problems may occur when using DVD and other magnetic media and disc players.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Accordingly, problems with the drainage of a static electric charge impacting sensitive electronic components continue to persist.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Living Hinge Button Switch Linkage</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A variety of automotive accessories, e.g., an automotive radio, within a motor vehicle employ button switches. Traditionally, buttons for the button switches have been fabricated and decorated (i.e., painted and laser trimmed) individually. The buttons are then set in a separate housing that includes a plurality of integrally formed guides for accepting the buttons. Unfortunately, each of the buttons has required individual fabrication and decoration, which significantly increases the total cost of an end product so designed. Further, as the individual buttons are actuated, they can produce a squeaking noise due to the fact that each of the individual buttons includes a number of posts that mate with integrally formed guides in the housing. Various automotive accessories, such as an automotive radio, also receive inputs from rocker switches, which, similar to button switches, have been painted and laser trimmed and also may create noise when a user actuates the rocker switch as the switch may engage a separate housing or trim plate. Additionally, both button and rocker switches have generally required additional components (e.g., springs) to provide a desired tactile feel.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Thus, what is needed is a parallel guide mechanism for a switch that provides noiseless actuation and guided movement and allows for material and/or component design that provides a desired actuation tactile feel without increased component cost.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Integrated Vehicle Display Lighting Assembly</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Vehicle display assemblies often use a backlit liquid crystal display (LCD) so that the display can be viewed easily by the user. Fluorescent light is the most common backlight source for LCDs. To ensure that the display can be read in daytime ambient light, the display backlighting is relatively intense.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The display assemblies may also include buttons for operating, for example, a radio or a CD player. Current assemblies illuminate each button with its own incandescent light source, providing backlighting and color for any graphics on the button. Each light source may include a colored boot to produce a desired light color for the button graphics.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As vehicles incorporate more features that require more buttons, the number of light sources also increases. The heat generated from the incandescent lights, however, elevates the temperature of the buttons by as much as 20&#xb0; C., enough to be noticeable by a user. Further, the increased temperature may place undesirable thermal stress on the display components. Thermal protection algorithms may be used to monitor the assembly temperature and reduce the light intensity if the temperature reaches a selected threshold until the temperature drops to an acceptable level. Unfortunately, these systems require additional, cumbersome circuitry for turning the button light sources on and off.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">There is a need for a display assembly lighting system that can illuminate a main display and adjacent buttons while keeping the assembly temperature within a desirable range.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It is known in the art that illuminated display systems, such as those found in radio receivers, compact discs, and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) controllers, include a back-lit display panel. Typically, it has been common practice to locate light pipes between a printed circuit board and the display panel to direct light from a light source to a portion of the display panel for controlled illumination. However, because this location of the light pipe is typically shared by other electrical components and mechanical structures (i.e. button bodies, potentiometers, plastic ribs, LCD displays, etc.), the design of the light pipe may become complex, which may affect the efficiency of the lighting system.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Accordingly, a final design of the light pipe has often included complex structures that weave between the electrical components and mechanical structure. Once light is provided to an entrance port of the light pipe, gradual changes in direction of light propagation by means of total internal reflection on non-parallel light pipe walls tend to introduce losses as collimation decreases. Losses in collimation also increase the difficulty in directing light exiting the light pipe to the specific areas of the display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The complexity of such light pipe designs makes computer simulation difficult and time consuming, which lends to prevention of design optimization by means of iterative prototyping and expensive design cycles drawn out with proof of concept often being delayed until injection molded light pipe prototypes can be produced. As such, a need exists for improving the collimation effects and efficiency of light pipes applied in an illuminated display system.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Self-Aligned Button Retainer</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">There are numerous types of switch mechanisms in use today for operating and regulating systems and components of vehicles and other devices. The switch mechanisms can be on-off type switches, switch mechanisms which regulate the volume, amplitude and/or intensity of various systems, switch mechanisms which are available only for emergency-type usage, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In automobiles and other vehicles, there are numerous types of switch mechanisms which are used for the various electronic components and systems that are available and in use in the vehicles. These electronic components include windshield wipers, emergency lights, turn signals, cruise control, power seats, power windows, heated seats, four-wheel drive systems, overdrive systems, navigation systems, timing systems, clocks, mileage, trip or travel systems, and the like. Many of these mechanisms have dual functions, such as being used not only to control, for example, the on-off status of the component or system, but also to adjust one of its functions, such as amplitude, balance, base, treble, etc. Many such switches utilize rocker-type buttons which pivot or rotate around a central point or section and have two ends which are adapted to operate or actuate certain switches or systems. Automotive entertainment systems such as radios and CD players frequently use push button type switches in space-saving compact arrays, with packaging space being a premium.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Switch mechanisms are typically designed to meet various criteria and considerations other than function. The considerations include appearance, aesthetics, ease of assembly, positioning, ease of use, versatility of function, and design. These considerations can affect the size, color, type, and method of activation of the switch mechanism. The switch mechanisms are also made from various types of materials, including plastic, acrylic, and metal materials. In this regard, cost and durability factors can be significant in the final selection of the switch mechanisms to be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although there are numerous switch mechanisms in use today which operate satisfactorily, there is a constant need to improve the operation, versatility and appearance of various switches, as well as to correct problems with existing switches. For example some of the switch mechanisms provide excess freedom of movement, have undesirable noise problems, are too expensive, have alignment problems in the socket or housing in which they are positioned, do not operate with the requisite tactile &#x201c;feel&#x201d;, or are simply too difficult to operate for the desired function. Thus, a need exists for improved switch mechanisms, particularly those which minimize noise problems, have improved alignment, have the desired &#x201c;feel&#x201d; or can be adjusted to achieve the desired feel, and which can be easily and simply actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Interface with Personal Entertainment Devices</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Vehicle entertainment systems usually include an audio component such as a radio to enable receiving signals from antennas, contain various forms of playback mechanisms, and have the capability to accept data from user devices such as MP3 players. Typically, the radio has a decorative assembly that provides man-machine interface as well as displaying pertinent data relative to the selected media and audio settings.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Many consumer electronic devices like the popular iPod from MacIntosh have become mainstream must-haves for certain demographic groups of consumers. Automobile manufacturers are developing methods to allow the consumer to connect to the automobile's entertainment system with their personal music device, whether it be an iPod, a memory stick via a USB port, or a similar device. Several automobile manufacturers such as BMW and VW/Audi have provided a pig-tail or wired connection for an iPod in their glove box.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 127</figref>, alternative prior art approaches are illustrated wherein a personal device is directly interconnected with the vehicle entertainment system through a cable and phone jack plugged into an auxiliary (aux) input in the front face of the entertainment system, or, alternatively, plugged into a pig-tail connector located in the vehicle glove compartment.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">This arrangement enables the consumer to connect the vehicle audio system with their personal device. Some automobile radios have an auxiliary jack on the front of the radio. The auxiliary jack allows playing the music, but does not necessarily allow for player control through the radio. This requires the device be accessible for control of the music.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The problems with the glove box approach are the potential for damage to the device from other contents in the glove box, and the cable connection offers no flexibility for connecting to another device. Damage may occur to the cable as well through normal use.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The auxiliary jack method allows more flexibility for devices, but limits the control and may incur damage through impact while a plug is connected.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Some aftermarket radios offer a USB (Universal Serial Buss) port on the front panel thereof, but may also incur damage due to the potential leverage on the face of the unit when a flash memory is connected, not to mention vehicle occupant impact issues resulting from braking and collisions. Furthermore, connection interfaces open to the vehicle passenger compartment environment risk system damage from foreign objects and air-borne contamination, not to mention being aesthetically unattractive.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">With most automotive suppliers, the present generation of radios are typically designed to fit a standard frontal area size. Typically, the DIN standard (issued by the Deutsches Institut f&#xfc;r Normung, or German Institute for Standardization) is used for either a &#x201c;2DIN&#x201d; or a single &#x201c;DIN&#x201d; size in most radios. 2DIN radios typically have larger displays and contain multiple disc changers integrated into the package.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">With the advent of music storage devices, like flash memory and devices like the iPod&#x2122;, there is less dependency on multiple disc changers and more desireability for the radio to communicate with the personal music storage or music device carried by the consumer. The rapidly changing customer market has initiated a drive to feature content on OEM (original equipment manufacturer) supplied radios for automobiles to provide those wants and that has an impact on interchangability and potential safety issues.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The present invention provides numerous product and process advantages which collectively result in substantial cost and labor savings. By way of example, the preferred design optimizes the assembly process. It minimizes the required handling of major components and subassemblies during the assembly cycle. Final assembly is optimized, wherein only seven major components and subassemblies are involved. This minimizes the number of work stations and fixtures, in-process transfers between work stations and total assembly cycle time. The inventive design permits selection of the optimal mechanical product configuration for a given receiver family. Furthermore, it permits idealized electrical and mechanical building block partitioning for common and unique elements.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The preferred embodiment of the invention contemplates screwless final assembly without the use of tools, fixtures and assembly machines. This greatly enhances in-process product flow in the factory, improves scheduling of final assembly, and allows labor intensive processes such as stick lead assembly to be largely moved off-line. This greatly reduces both direct and indirect labor requirements. Furthermore, inventory control is simplified inasmuch as position part proliferation is deferred to or near the end of process.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">These and other features and advantages of this invention will become apparent upon reading the following specification, which, along with the drawings, describes preferred and alternative embodiments of the invention in detail.</p>

<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Although the drawings represent varied embodiments and features of the present invention, the drawings are not necessarily to scale and certain features may be exaggerated in order to illustrate and explain the present invention. The exemplification set forth herein illustrates several aspects of the invention, in one form, and such exemplification is not to be construed as limiting the scope of the invention in any manner.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">The present invention can be applied in its broadest sense to electronic devices and systems where shielding from radio frequency interference (RFI), electromagnetic interference (EMI), bulk current injection (BCI) and/or electrostatic discharge (ESD) is required. In addition to vehicle based radios and audio entertainment systems, the invention can be advantageously applied in &#x201c;infotainment&#x201d; and telematic systems. Furthermore, the present invention employs virtually &#x201c;fastenerless&#x201d; design architecture to facilitate low-cost, high volume production techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">A telematics product is a two-way communication/receiver system that enables access by a vehicle occupant to vehicle related information like geographic position/location through the use of a GPS module with antenna, vehicle diagnostics, crash sensors and air bag deployment. It also contains a phone module that is linked through a microphone in the vehicle and the radio speaker system for hands free calling via voice recognition and links to a call center for a variety of services, including but not limited to emergency help, concierge, vehicle theft recovery, turn-by-turn route guidance, vehicle diagnostics and vehicle unlock.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">For convenience of understanding, the following description will be focused primarily upon an automotive radio/CD player system.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Lightweight Radio/CD Player for Vehicular Application</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">(1)</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The present invention reflects an improved design to reduce the overall weight of an automotive radio/CD player without compromising the strength of the unit. The present invention employs a polymer based material that can be molded to provide the necessary features for the chassis as well as the frontal interface to the decorative front-end assembly described for the man-machine interface. By molding a case with the necessary details to accept the playback mechanisms (if desired) as well as the circuit board(s) needed for the electrical control, the required functionality of the unit is maintained as compared to the typical metal box. The necessary shielding and grounding is accomplished by insert-molding a mesh screen wire that has been pre-formed to contour with the molding operation. The grounding of the circuit boards may be accomplished by using ground clips attached directly to the ground pads of the circuit board that would interface directly with exposed screen wire mesh of the molded part. While metal is also a good conductor for the thermal load inside the unit, openings must be incorporated to allow airflow for additional cooling. The same openings can compromise the shielding. With in-molded mesh screen wire, the mesh acts as a Faraday cage to shield the electronics, but the open weave allows airflow to promote the dissipation of the thermal load from inside the unit, to the exterior. Besides the reduction of mass offered by the molded polymer material for the unit chassis and front plate, the hidden benefits include ease of handling in the assembly process as well as less container and shipping weight.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">To facilitate assembly, the molded polymer chassis and front plate can use integral or molded in guideways and snaps, thereby eliminating the typical screw fastener assembly method previously used for these components. To enhance the rigidity, the component parts that comprise the assembly are sandwiched at the common vehicle instrument panel attachment points such that when the mounting screws are driven, they firmly clamp the component pieces to the host vehicle. In the event a playback mechanism of substantial mass and volume is required, the sub-assembly structure for the mechanism would utilize formed attachment tabs that would be an intermediate layer in the aforementioned component part sandwich. Another benefit for the mounting at the back of the radio is often vehicles have a receptive hole or slot in the inner cavity of the instrument panel carrier that accepts a mounting bushing or &#x201c;bullet&#x201d; shaped extension that is screwed to a mounting stud that is typically swaged to the back of the metal enclosure of the radio. The mounting &#x201c;bullet&#x201d; can be molded directly in the polymer-based case eliminating the additional part and the assembly of that additional part.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">To replace the metal structure of the vehicle radio, a galvanized (or appropriately coated) steel mesh wire screen will be cut, formed, and molded with a polymer resin to provide necessary details for assembly of components required for the functionality of the radio including, but not limited to, a circuit board assembly, a heat sink for audio power and switching components, a playback mechanism, and a man-machine interface or trim plate assembly, as well as vehicle mounting features. While the polymer or plastic provides the majority of the mechanical structure for the radio, the in-molded mesh screen wire provides the needed protection from various electrical anomalies including electromagnetic contamination, radio frequency interference, bulk current injection, and electrostatic discharge, to name a few. The screen mesh also allows openings necessary for air passage or venting of heat from the radio by molding the radio back end or case and front plate. The many details and features needed in a typical assembly can be incorporated directly into the parts, eliminating the need for fasteners and separate additional parts often required with parts fabricated in metal.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">The specific materials selected for fabricating the radio case and front plate will vary depending upon the application, including the contained mass of the mechanisms employed as well as the severity of the contemplated environment (esp. temperature and vibration). Examples of materials that could be employed for typical automotive applications are:</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Case: Glass-filled polyester, Glass-filled polypropylene, Polycarbonate, ABS.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Front Plate: Polycarbonate, ABS, PC/ABS and Noryl.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Major components which contact one another or are mechanically interconnected preferably are formed from material having substantially differing surface finish and hardness characteristics to minimize the possibility of resulting squeaks, rattles and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Although presently viewed as cost prohibitive for automotive applications, it is contemplated that nano carbon tube filler can be employed within the plastic material forming the case and front plate to provide effective shielding and enhance the structural strength of the case assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">In addition to weight savings, which may amount to well over one pound (0.4536 Kg), the part handling is improved to reduce the amount of fasteners as well as separate component parts. Often a radio may be constructed from a wrap-around, a cover and the fasteners along with a mounting bushing or &#x201c;bullet&#x201d; screwed to a &#x201c;swaged&#x201d; threaded stud in the metal case. Also, the metal pieces require assembly personnel to wear gloves during handling to avoid any cuts or damage to their hands as well as protection from any metal fabrication fluid residue. Molded plastic does not require any special gloves, or the concerns of cuts to the skin. Aside to the benefit to the vehicle by reducing the radio weight by over one pound (0.4536 Kg), the savings for a manufacturer include reduced shipping cost through the weight reduction and potential container efficiency improvements. Product labeling can be improved through laser engraving the plastic with the desired number, customer logos, etc. Metal typically requires a stamping detail (not easily changed) and/or a printed label that is adhesively applied. This offers greater flexibility and eliminates additional parts (like labels) to use the plastic, as well as better durability than a label.</p>

<p id="p-0267" num="0266">The rear mounting bushing for current radios is typically attached by welding a threaded stud to the back wall of the wrap around and then the bushing is screwed on. With the plastic box receiver, the mounting bushing can be molded as an integral part of the receiver box, eliminating two part numbers and the labor to install them.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, a typical prior art stud <b>54</b> is illustrated as part of a conventional radio/CD player <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-10</figref>, <b>13</b> and <b>14</b>, a feature of the present invention is illustrated wherein the stud <b>92</b> is integrally formed with the housing case <b>68</b>, such as through injection molding. The stud <b>92</b> functions to support the rear portion of the radio/CD player assembly <b>62</b> when installed in the host vehicle. Upon installation of the radio/CD player assembly, the rearwardly directed stud <b>92</b> registers with an opening <b>196</b> in a vehicle structural support member <b>198</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">The stud <b>92</b> is elongated and has a characteristic cross or &#x201c;+&#x201d; shaped cross-section along its axial length. The cross-section configuration of the stud <b>92</b> has intersecting vertical and horizontal portions <b>200</b> and <b>202</b>, respectively. The outwardmost surfaces of the vertical and horizontal portions <b>200</b> and <b>202</b> are dimensioned to establish an interference fit within the opening <b>196</b> of the support member <b>198</b>. Because the stud <b>92</b> is constructed of softer material (plastic) than the support member <b>198</b> (steel), the outer surfaces of the vertical and horizontal portions will tend to deform locally upon insertion into opening <b>196</b> and thereby assure a tight, rattle free connection. Rearwardly directed edges <b>206</b> are configured with a sharp transition which will scarf the plastic material of the stud <b>92</b> upon any withdrawal from the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">As is best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 93</figref>, vertical and horizontal bosses <b>208</b> and <b>210</b>, respectively, are located directly interiorly of the stud <b>92</b> to reinforce the rear wall portion <b>86</b> of the case <b>68</b> to prevent &#x201c;oil-canning&#x201d; and allows use of relatively thin wall section for enhanced weight saving.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 93-95</figref> illustrate an alternative construction of the case <b>68</b> and front plate <b>70</b> of the housing assembly <b>76</b> wherein both elements of the case assembly <b>76</b> are formed of a composite of relatively rigid polymer material and electrically conductive material operable to shield the audio components (such as the circuit board subassembly <b>64</b> and the CD player subassembly <b>66</b>) from electrical anomalies including radio frequency interference (RFI), electromagnetic interference (EMI), bulk current injection (BCI) and electrostatic discharge (ESD). The electrically conductive material comprises substantially continuous planer sheet portions applied to surfaces of or within polymer housing assembly wall portions as discrete elements, electrically conductive paint, foil or electrostatic or vacuum deposition applied material. Alternatively, the electrically conductive material comprises a wire mesh screen <b>212</b> which has been cut and folded to net shape and inserted within a mold cavity whereby it is effectively insert molded within the polymer based material. Preferably, the wire screen <b>212</b> is centered within the wall portions of the case and front plate whereby electrically insulating polymer material effectively covers the wire screen <b>212</b>, both inside and out, to prevent inadvertent grounding of the housing assembly to interior or exterior structures.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Through empirical testing and development, the inventors have found that it is preferable to locate the wire screen <b>212</b> near the inside surface of the case <b>68</b> and the outside surface of the front plate <b>70</b>. Openings <b>214</b> are provided in the case <b>68</b> by locally eliminating the polymer material but leaving the wire screen intact, whereby judiciously positioned openings <b>214</b> provide natural convection cooling to the ambient without having a break or gap in the electrical anomaly protection provided by the wire screen <b>212</b>.</p>

When the PCB <b>680</b> assumes its installed position, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 139</figref>, the rended portions of the wire screen <b>700</b> are compressively fit between the contact pads <b>688</b> and <b>690</b> and the adjacent edges of the window <b>698</b>, ensuring continued continuity of the electrical connection between the exposed wire screen <b>700</b> and the PCB contact pads <b>688</b> and <b>690</b>. It is contemplated that a single (one side of the PCB) contact pad can also be employed. However, the redundancy afforded by the dual contact pads <b>688</b> and <b>690</b> is preferable.</p>

Edges and corners of the case <b>472</b> formed at the intersection of two or three adjacent wall portions can be locally thickened to increase structural rigidity of the case <b>472</b> as well as to provide internal and external mounting and interface ports. The intersecting edges of the top wall portion <b>476</b> and the left and right side wall portions <b>480</b> and <b>482</b>, respectively, form thickened left and right upper edge frames <b>484</b> and <b>486</b>, respectively. Likewise, the intersecting edges of the bottom wall portion <b>478</b> and the left and right side wall portions <b>480</b> and <b>482</b>, respectively, form thickened left and right lower edge frames. Lower edge frames <b>488</b> and <b>490</b> are locally vertically extended openings <b>492</b> and <b>494</b> for exposing the wire screen <b>474</b> to establish electrical contact with contact clips <b>496</b> and <b>498</b> carried by PCBs <b>500</b> and <b>502</b>, respectively, interconnected by pin connectors <b>504</b> within the case <b>472</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0323" num="0322">This concept is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,384,355 B1 to M. Murphy et al. entitled &#x201c;Parallel Guide Mechanism for a Switch&#x201d; which is commonly assigned to the assignee of interest of this application. The specification of U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0324" num="0323">Living Hinge Button Linkage (11)</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">The basis of 4-bar button linkage is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,384,355, the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference. It utilizes thin walls on each end of a base and top plate to control the motion of a button. However, this approach allows the button to slightly rotate if someone presses on the extreme left or right edge of the button. The living hinge is an improvement/modification of the idea where the thin walls are replaced with relatively thick walls, which are necked down at the intersection with the button and the top plate to form a living hinge and complete the 4-bar linkage. This concept can be applied in a treed button system.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">In essence, the thin wall approach results in flexing or deformation of the wall, which will produce variations in the spacing between the associated hinges of each link. This can cause wobble or relative motion between the portion of the button extending through an opening in the user access panel. If the spacing tolerance between the button and the adjacent access panel opening is excessively small, the button can jam and cease to function. If the spacing tolerance is too great, it can result in undesirable squeaks and rattles.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0326">In the present invention, the links are relatively inflexible (except in the integral hinge area), resulting in the spacing between the adjacent hinges to remain substantially constant. This will provide a smooth, substantially linear motion of the button, mitigating the under and over tolerance problems of certain prior art approaches described herein above.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0327">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44-47</figref>, an example of prior flexible molded linkage for rear loaded pushbuttons is illustrated. A pushbutton linkage system <b>530</b> includes a base member <b>532</b> and a top plate <b>534</b> spaced above the base member <b>532</b> and integrally interconnected thereto by front and rear vertical members <b>536</b> and <b>538</b>, respectively. The front and rear vertical members <b>536</b> and <b>538</b> have a thin wall section along their vertical extent and are relatively flexible. The top plate <b>534</b> has an extension <b>540</b> formed therein which, in application, extends through an opening <b>542</b> within a panel <b>544</b> such as a radio trim panel to provide operator access by manual actuation as indicated by arrows <b>546</b>, <b>548</b> and <b>550</b>. The push button linkage system <b>530</b> is typically nested within a switch housing assembly <b>552</b> consisting of a rigid housing portion <b>554</b> and resilient, non-conductive material <b>556</b> which maintains spacing between a fixed electrical contact and a movable electrical contact (not illustrated). When the extension <b>540</b> is depressed by an operator, the top plate <b>534</b> moves to the left, momentarily closing the two electrical contacts. When released, the top plate <b>534</b> returns to its illustrated position, opening the electrical contacts. When actuated along the centerline of the top plate <b>534</b> designated by axis X-X as indicated by arrow <b>546</b>, it will translate left and right, without pitch or yaw. However, if actuated from an off center direction as depicted by arrows <b>548</b> and <b>550</b>, it will pitch and/or yaw, as illustrated by axis X&#x2032;-X&#x2032; due to the flexure of the distributed displacement of members <b>536</b> and <b>638</b> as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref>. As a result, the associated switch mechanism can malfunction due to binding between the extension <b>540</b> and the panel <b>544</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0328">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48-50</figref>, a simplified embodiment of the present invention is illustrated. A push button linkage system <b>558</b> comprises an elongated, horizontally disposed base member <b>560</b> and an elongated, horizontally disposed top plate <b>562</b> positioned above and parallel to the base member <b>560</b>. Front and rear vertical links <b>564</b> and <b>566</b> interconnect the front and rear ends of the base member <b>560</b> and the top plate <b>562</b>, respectively. The base member <b>560</b>, top plate <b>562</b> and interconnecting links <b>564</b> and <b>566</b> are integrally molded or extruded as a single component from homogeneous, relatively rigid material such as nylon. The front link <b>564</b> defines a relatively thick sectioned middle portion <b>568</b>, upper and lower end portions <b>570</b> and <b>572</b>, respectively, and intermediate transition portions <b>574</b> and <b>576</b>. Likewise, the rear link <b>566</b> defines a relatively thick sectioned middle portion <b>578</b>, upper and lower end portions <b>580</b> and <b>582</b>, respectively, and intermediate transition portions <b>584</b> and <b>586</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0329">The upper end portion <b>570</b> of the front vertical link <b>564</b> integrally transitions into the bottom front corner of the top plate <b>562</b> as a web or first flexible living hinge. The upper end portion <b>580</b> of the rear vertical link <b>566</b> integrally transitions into the bottom rear corner of the top plate <b>562</b> as a web or second flexible living hinge. The lower end portion <b>572</b> of the front vertical link <b>564</b> integrally transitions into the top front corner of the base member <b>560</b> as a web or third flexible living hinge. The lower end portion <b>582</b> of the rear vertical link integrally transitions into the top rear corner of the base member <b>560</b> as a web or forth flexible living hinge. Thus constituted, the push button linkage system <b>558</b> comprises four rigid links arranged as a parallelogram with their respective adjacent ends attached at hinge points.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0330">In application, the linkage system is nestingly received within a switch assembly <b>588</b> including a housing <b>590</b> which fixedly restrains the linkage base member <b>560</b> and means for continuously urging the linkage top plate rightwardly toward its position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref> such as a resilient, elastomeric foam block <b>592</b>. A pair of switch contacts <b>594</b> and <b>596</b> are aligned within the switch housing <b>590</b>, with one contact <b>594</b> fixed to an inner surface <b>598</b> of the housing <b>590</b>, and the other contact <b>596</b> carried on a rear edge surface <b>599</b> and movable with the linkage top plate <b>562</b> between an open position, spaced from contact <b>594</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 48</figref>) and a second position engaging the other contact <b>594</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>) to establish an electrical interconnection therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0331">The front end of the linkage top plate <b>562</b> forms an integral rightwardly directed extension <b>600</b>, which passes through an opening <b>602</b> formed in a panel <b>604</b> such as the trim plate subassembly <b>74</b> described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> hereinabove. Manual displacement of the extension <b>600</b> indicated by arrow <b>606</b> causes the living hinges to affect pure rotation about their mutually parallel axes, transitioning the top plate <b>562</b> (and movable contact <b>596</b>) to the position indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 49</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0332">Empirical development and analysis has demonstrated that a switch assembly <b>588</b> with the linkage system <b>558</b> described herein is substantially impervious to off-angle actuation.</p>

<p id="p-0341" num="0340">Partitioned Main Board into Common and Unique (15)</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">Using the principle of communization and modularity, the receiver main board has been divided into a common board and a unique board. This is counterintuitive because a single board is less expensive than two boards performing the same function. However, the common board contains all surface mount components (no stick lead or wave solder) and very large volumes can be produced without reconfiguring the assembly/production line. This will substantially reduce the manufacturing cost of this portion of the main board.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, automotive audio systems are unique in that they are typically designed in modular form and, in response to the requirements of individual customers, are produced by assembling individual units from varied combinations and permutations of modularized subcomponents. This, however, can be contrary to the manufacturing doctrine of large enterprises wherein large volume production of common designs is preferred for its inherent efficiencies. In the practice of the present invention, the individual electrical components to be assembled on the circuit board subassembly <b>64</b> are segregated into those which will be employed in each specie and sub-specie in a given product family. The commonly employed circuit elements (typically surface mount devices) are assembled on the &#x201c;common&#x201d; PCB <b>98</b>. The application specific circuit elements (typically &#x201c;stick&#x201d; mount devices) are assembled on the &#x201c;unique&#x201d; PCB <b>100</b>. The common PCB <b>98</b> is assembled employing highly automated manufacturing techniques for maximum efficiency, while the unique PCB <b>100</b> are assembled employing a different mix of labor and automation to maximize overall efficiency.

<p id="p-0347" num="0346">In the present invention, a form of &#x201c;self test&#x201d; is employed and the normal in-circuit test with its expensive fixtures, long test cycle time on_expensive equipment is replaced by a simple fixture that powers up the_microprocessor and activates embedded test codes that asks the micro to communicate with each of the other ICs on the board and return any fault codes. This is a much lower cost approach, which will accomplish most of the benefit of an in-circuit test.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 55</figref>, prior manufacturing of automotive audio devices typically employed dedicated test equipment located at the end of an assembly line which serially initiated, ran, completed and recorded performance tests for each unit before initiating testing of the next-in-line unit. Such prior art testing sequences typically followed the following process steps. The test is initiated at step <b>744</b>, the tester performs a fault test at step <b>746</b> for a first integrated circuit (IC) <b>748</b>. After waiting for and recording the IC#1 test results, the tester advances to step <b>750</b> and performs a fault test for a second IC <b>752</b>. After waiting for and recording the IC#2 test results, the tester advances to step <b>754</b> and performs a fault test for a third IC <b>756</b>. After waiting for and recording the IC#3 test results, the tester advances to step <b>758</b> and performs a fault test for a forth IC <b>760</b>. After waiting and recording the IC#4 test results, the tester proceeds serially to test every additional IC in the unit under test. Once all of the ICs have been tested and the results recorded, the test is terminated at step <b>762</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 56</figref>, the present invention saves substantial time in end-of-line testing by embedding the test routines within the memory and microprocessor contained within the audio unit being tested. This allows simultaneous testing of multiple audio units and virtually eliminates &#x201c;wait-time&#x201d;. The testing sequence of the present invention follows the following process steps. The test is initiated at step <b>764</b> and the tester sends a &#x201c;start test&#x201d; message to the audio product at step <b>766</b> which initiates a subroutine in an on-board microprocessor for fault testing other ICs within that audio product at step <b>768</b>. The on-board testing performs fault tests and collects results for each IC <b>770</b>, <b>772</b>, <b>774</b> and <b>776</b> within the audio product at step <b>778</b>. Thereafter, the accumulated test results for the audio product are sent to the production line tester at step <b>780</b>. Immediately following step <b>766</b>, the tester immediately sends a &#x201c;start test&#x201d; message to the next audio unit in the production queue at step <b>782</b> without waiting for the results of previously initiated tests.

<p id="p-0350" num="0349">WWV Time Set for Radio (17)</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">In the alignment of a radio, one of the steps taken is to calibrate the local oscillator. This is done by comparing the natural frequency of the oscillator to a known standard and recording the difference as an offset, which is stored in memory and is used to make sure the clock is accurate.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 57</figref>, a typical prior art process for calibrating the local oscillator of an automotive radio comprises the steps of measuring the resonator frequency at the point of manufacture at step <b>786</b>. Thereafter, an offset value reflecting the difference between the radio oscillator and a known standard is calculated at step <b>788</b>. Finally, the calculated offset value is programmed into memory of the specific automotive radio at step <b>790</b>. Thereafter, once the automotive radio is installed in a host vehicle and is in the field, the radio reads the offset value from its internal memory at step <b>792</b>. Lastly, the automotive radio periodically updates its time of day display based upon the read offset value at step <b>794</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0353" num="0352">In the present invention, the need for a known standard and running this test at all in the factory is eliminated. The radio will be programmed to tune to WWV on 100 KHz periodically and use their calibration frequency as the known standard for calculating the offset. The correct time will also be updated when this takes place.</p>
<p id="p-0354" num="0353">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 58</figref>, a simplified process for easily and reliably updating the time of day indication for an automotive radio is described, involving receiving a time of day signal from a World Time Clock at step <b>796</b> and then periodically updating the time of day indication of the automotive radio in response to the time of day signal from the World Time Clock.</p>
<p id="p-0355" num="0354">Devices such as automotive radios/CD players use a low cost resonator circuit to provide a reference frequency for the Time of Day (TOD) Clock. Due to inherent inaccuracies in this resonator frequency, periodic adjustments must be made to the TOD to retain it's accuracy. Previously, during the production process, the frequency of the resonator is measured and it's actual value is compared to an expected value. This difference is then stored into product memory and the TOD clock is periodically updated. This method requires a special process during production (i.e. a high capital investment) to measure the resonator frequency. In the present invention, during normal operation, the receiver can periodically tune to the World Time Clock (WWV) and receive a time signal. This time signal can then be used to update the TOD clock. This inventive method does not require a special manufacturing process and can be accomplished using existing product hardware design.</p>
<p id="p-0356" num="0355">The accuracy of a free running clock is limited by accuracy of the underlying crystal. A 25 ppm (parts per million) error in crystal frequency results in over a minute error per month for a clock. The traditional solutions are to either purchase expensive high accuracy crystals or to align the crystal circuit for each individual unit. Alignment can be by either physically adjusting the crystal circuit or by providing a frequency offset to software. Either case requires highly accurate measurement of the actual circuit frequency. Additionally, alignment only corrects the nominal crystal error. It does not compensate for temperature or age drift.</p>
<p id="p-0357" num="0356">An alternate solution is to use a cheaper, lower accuracy, unaligned circuit to maintain the running time and to periodically correct the time setting by referencing an external highly accurate clock. WWV provides such an external signal on multiple radio frequencies. The unique part of this solution is the shared use of a general purpose AM/FM receiver block with a method to avoid the disruption of the use of the tuner and minimize the use of standby current.</p>
<p id="p-0358" num="0357">The algorithms illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 87-89</figref> collectively allow a single tuner to be used both as a general purpose AM/FM receiver and to maintain the accuracy of a free running time of day clock. It also affects minimal current draw when the unit is battery powered.</p>
<p id="p-0359" num="0358">The controlling factors for determining when to update the clock are the minimum update time and the maximum update time. For a typical clock that displays minutes, these two times should be less than the time for the worst case drift of the running timer to accumulate 15-20 seconds of error. The minimum update time limits the rate of updates to minimize potential disruptions and current usage. The time limit should be set based on the time for the free running timer to accumulate significant error (e.g., 5 seconds of drift). If the radio is already in a high current operational state and the timer is not in use (for example, the radio is in CD mode), an attempt to update the time occurs immediately. The update is also delayed, if the tuner is currently being used (i.e., the user is listening to an AM or FM broadcast). If the radio is in a low current state, a time update attempt is delayed until the maximum update time is exceeded.</p>
<p id="p-0360" num="0359">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 87</figref>, a process for updating the time of day indication of an automotive radio comprises the steps of initiating a time of day indication update at step <b>800</b>. Initially, a logical step <b>802</b> determines if a minimum time since the last update has expired. If no, the process is ended at step <b>804</b>. If yes, process moves to a logical step <b>806</b> which determines if the ignition in &#x201c;on&#x201d;. If no, the process moves to a logical step <b>808</b> which determines if the maximum time since the last update has expired. If no, the process is ended at step <b>804</b>. If yes, the tuner is powered up at step <b>810</b>. If the ignition is on, the process determines if the tuner is presently in use at logical step <b>812</b>. If yes, the process is ended at step <b>804</b>. If no, the radio tunes to a known WWV frequency at step <b>814</b>. Thereafter, the process moves to a logical step <b>816</b> which determines if a valid time signal is present. If no, it determines if there are alternative frequencies left and there is no user request at the tuner at logical step <b>818</b>. If yes, the process returns to the input of step <b>814</b>. If no, the process is ended at step <b>804</b>. If a valid time signal is present, the process updates the free running time at step <b>820</b>. If the free running time update is successful, the process saves the time of the last update at step <b>822</b>. If the free running time update is not successful, the process is aborted and ended at step <b>804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0361" num="0360">A dual level of service can be provided. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 88</figref>, the first level requires the user to manually set the time and simply corrects for drift of the free running timer. This requires the tuner only to be able to detect a 440-600 Hz tone present at the top of the minute. The update of the free running timer simply rounds the current time value to the nearest minute. This provides equivalent functionality as a clock based upon either a high accuracy or aligned crystal based system.</p>

<p id="p-0363" num="0362">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 89</figref>, the second level of service is to actually set the clock based on BCD encode time information in the WWV signal. This method requires a more sophisticated decoder to detect the 100 Hz sub-carrier and decode the time information encoded in the sub-carrier. On each update, non-volatile offsets for hours and minutes would be added to the received values to compensate for time zones and user &#x201c;adjustments&#x201d;. The user would still have to have a method to adjust the hours for setting the time zone. Optionally, the system could allow the user to adjust the minutes offset, for people who wish to run their clocks fast or slow on purpose. The primary advantage of this approach is that if the running time value is lost (for example, after a battery disconnect), the clock will recover with the correct time at the next update. Furthermore, the clock will automatically adjust for daylight savings changes.</p>

<p id="p-0365" num="0364">Guillotine Heat Sink (18)</p>
<p id="p-0366" num="0365">The guillotine heat sink uses a flat aluminum plate as a heat sink. It slides down a slot on each side of the plastic box until it comes to rest on the quad bridge amplifier (QBA) IC and the power supply IC. Each IC will have a silpad on top to provide compliance and facilitate heat transfer. A downward force will be applied to the heat sink through a molded leaf spring in the lid of the plastic bob when it is snapped into place. An additional feature of the plastic box is to provide pillars under the FR-4 board in the location of the power ICs to provide a backstop for the leaf spring force.</p>

<p id="p-0373" num="0372">Button Tree Concept (19)</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0373">In the button tree concept, as many buttons as possible are treed together in the molding process to reduce handling of buttons in subsequent operations. The paint fixture will be placed on a machine that singulates the tree and transfers the buttons to the trim plate. Buttons are currently molded one-up and must be placed in the paint fixture one at a time and then transferred to the trim plate one at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0375" num="0374">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 51-54</figref> and <b>170</b>, a method and apparatus for efficiently fabricating push buttons and assembling the push buttons on associated individual actuator devices, such as the switch assemblies described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48-50</figref> herein, as part of an automotive audio system assembly is described hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">Overall, the inventive process is outlined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref> in a number of process steps including initiating the process at step <b>922</b>, molding a plurality of buttons as a set or subset on a common tree or gate with the individual buttons positionally juxtaposed in an end-application orientation at step <b>924</b>, inserting the button (sub)set into a paint fixture in an end-application orientation in step <b>926</b>, painting selected surfaces of each button of the (sub)set of buttons while in the fixture at step <b>928</b>, trimming extraneous material from each button at step <b>930</b>, singulating the buttons of the (sub)set by removing the common tree while maintaining them in fixed juxtaposition at step <b>932</b>, simultaneously front loading the (sub)set of buttons through assigned end-application apparatus trim plate openings associated with the associated individual actuator devices at step <b>934</b>, and ending the process at step <b>936</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0376">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52-54</figref>, a simplified application of the present inventive concept is described for the sake of clarity. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> represents a standard automotive radio receiver <b>938</b> including a front trim plate <b>940</b> and various operator controls and displays such as an on-off-volume and treble-bass control <b>942</b>, a tuning and speaker balance control <b>944</b>, an liquid crystal (LCD) display <b>946</b> and a ganged array of push buttons <b>948</b>-<b>958</b>. Each of the push buttons <b>948</b>-<b>958</b> are front mounted (i.e. applied to trim plate <b>940</b> of the radio receiver <b>938</b> from the front) engaging individual associated actuator devices (not illustrated) located behind the trim plate <b>940</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0378" num="0377">The typical prior approach of producing such a receiver would entail either individually injection molding each of the push buttons or molding them on a common tree, but with no regard to their relative juxtaposition during the molding process vis-&#xe0;-vis their relative juxtaposition in their end application. This is because the individual push buttons are typically immediately separated from their common tree and thereafter handled and processed separately.</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0378">The present invention, in essence, maintains a set or subset of buttons destined for a common end application in a fixed juxtipositional relationship corresponding to their end application design arrangement from their initial formation during the molding process, through trimming, decorating, painting, finishing, singulation (i.e. removal from their tree/gate) and installation in an end-application apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0379">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 52-54</figref>, for purposes of the present example, it is assumed that the dimensional constraints and layout of the push buttons <b>948</b>-<b>958</b> in the radio receiver <b>938</b> prohibit simultaneous molding of all six push buttons <b>948</b>-<b>958</b>. A preferred option, then, is to separately injection mold two subsets of push buttons. A first subset <b>960</b> containing alternating push buttons <b>948</b> (&#x201c;A&#x201d;), <b>952</b> (&#x201c;C&#x201d;) and <b>956</b> (&#x201c;E&#x201d;), connected by a common tree/gate <b>962</b>, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 53</figref>. A second subset containing alternating push buttons <b>950</b> (&#x201c;B&#x201d;), <b>954</b> (&#x201c;D&#x201d;) and <b>958</b> (&#x201c;F&#x201d;), connected by a common tree/gate, is not illustrated. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 54</figref>, the two subsets of push buttons are interdigitated to assume their end-application orientation when placed in a processing fixture <b>964</b>. The push buttons remain in the fixture in their relative end-application orientation through all of the above-described processing steps. As a final step, automated equipment simultaneously removes the six push button set from the processing fixture <b>964</b> and simultaneously installs them in the radio receiver <b>938</b>. In addition to substantially reducing labor cost, this novel process virtually eliminates improper assembly of the push buttons and many other common quality related issues.</p>
<p id="p-0381" num="0380">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 170</figref>, a single front loaded color shifting push button <b>966</b> is illustrated in an installed position on a back loaded actuator control member <b>968</b> extending through an opening <b>970</b> in a trim panel <b>972</b> of an audio device <b>974</b>. The core <b>976</b> of push button <b>966</b> is formed of clear material suitable for back-illumination by a light emitting diode (LED) <b>978</b> mounted axially within the control member <b>968</b>. Prior to final assembly, the push button <b>966</b> is processed as described hereinabove, including the application of overlayments of a light diffusing layer <b>980</b>, a light fluorescing layer <b>982</b>, a coloration under-layer <b>984</b>, and a decorative opaque topcoat <b>986</b> forming decorative indicia and clear or translucent light transmitting regions <b>988</b>. It is also contemplated that other related process steps, such as dual or tri-shot, multi color injection molding techniques and second surface decorative finishing can be employed within the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0382" num="0381">Screwless Power Clip (20)</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0382">The screwless power clip is an extension of a clip that Grundig uses in automotive radios produced in Europe today. The Grundig clip uses a long lever arm that must be snapped after the PCB is assembled into the metal wrap around. This requires an operator to reach in with a tool and snap (distend and release) the clip.</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">In the present invention, the long lever arm is eliminated. The present invention uses the assembly action of hooking the bottom of the heat sink into plastic stirrups and rotating the top of the heat sink until it snaps at the top of the plastic box to provide the lever action. This assembly technique can be accomplished by an operator without the use of expensive or specialized tools.</p>
<p id="p-0385" num="0384">An additional approach to this idea is to eliminate the clip altogether and to employ a spring material as part of the lead frame.</p>
<p id="p-0386" num="0385">Refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 41-43</figref>, described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0387" num="0386">Adjustable Shelf Case</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">In this mechanical configuration the case starts out as a sheet metal sleeve. Plastic inserts for the left and right side are then snapped into place that contain/define slides for the circuit boards and for a plastic shelf that would hold the CD mechanism at the proper height for registering with its associated CD slot. The back of the receiver would be an aluminum plate guillotine heat sink that slides in slots in the back of the plastic inserts.</p>
<p id="p-0389" num="0388">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59-69</figref>, an automotive audio system <b>990</b> is configured to be hand assembled and is virtually fastener-less. Furthermore, this embodiment is easily reconfigurable, both at the time of original manufacture and later in service life to facilitate field repairs and change-over to upgraded technology. The audio system comprises a simple sheet metal housing sleeve <b>992</b> defining left and right side walls <b>994</b> and <b>996</b>, respectively, a bottom <b>998</b>, a top <b>1000</b>, and front and rear openings <b>1002</b> and <b>1004</b>, respectively. Plastic inserts <b>1006</b> and <b>1008</b> are snap-engaged adjacent the inner surface of the left and right walls <b>994</b> and <b>996</b>, respectively, within the sleeve <b>992</b> by a system of resilient tabs <b>1010</b> integrally formed as cantilevers within inserts <b>1006</b> and <b>1008</b> and cooperating locking holes <b>1012</b> formed in the top <b>1000</b> and bottom <b>998</b> of the sleeve <b>992</b>. Each resilient tab <b>1010</b> includes a vertically extending pin <b>1011</b> integrally formed thereon. The inserts <b>1006</b> and <b>1008</b> have a plurality of vertically spaced, longitudinally extending mirror-image slots and grooves <b>1014</b> formed therein for receiving audio components such as a radio receiver circuit <b>1016</b> carried on a PCB assembly <b>1018</b>, and a CD player subassembly <b>1020</b> carried within a vented inner sleeve <b>1022</b>. The sleeve has a vertically disposed heat shield <b>1024</b> affixed to the rear surface thereof which, in assembly, bifurcates the cavity defined by the sleeve <b>992</b> into a relatively warm rear portion containing the heat generating electrical power devices <b>1026</b> on the PCB assembly <b>1018</b>, and a relatively cool front portion containing the CD player subassembly <b>1020</b> as well as the low power electrical components on the PCB assembly <b>1018</b>. A trim plate subassembly <b>1028</b> snap engages the sleeve <b>992</b> to close the open front end <b>1002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0390" num="0389">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59-66</figref>, a modified &#x201c;guillotine&#x201d; type heat sink <b>1030</b> closes the open rear end <b>1004</b> of sleeve <b>992</b> by sliding vertically downwardly through a recess <b>1034</b> formed in the rear portion of the sleeve <b>992</b> and edge engaging vertical slots <b>1036</b> formed in the inserts <b>1006</b> and <b>1008</b>. The heat sink <b>1030</b> forms convection air cooling openings <b>1038</b>, audio system interconnection ports <b>1040</b>, and electrical power device attachment passages <b>1042</b> therein. The attachment passages <b>1042</b> register with their respective electrical power devices <b>1026</b> whose profile outlines are indicated in phantom at <b>1044</b>. The electrical power devices are attached to the inside surface <b>1040</b> of the heat sink <b>1030</b> by screws (not illustrated) extending inwardly through passages <b>1042</b> or alternatively, by other screw-less resilient means as described elsewhere herein. Ports <b>1040</b> register with audio system connecter assemblies <b>1048</b> carried on the rear portion of the PCB assembly <b>1018</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0391" num="0390"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 60-64</figref> illustrate the structural detail of the right side insert <b>1008</b>. The slots <b>1014</b> are equally dimensioned and equally vertically spaced whereby the side edges of the PCB assembly can longitudinally slide therein. The CD player subassembly retaining inner sleeve <b>1022</b> has convection cooling passages <b>1050</b> in the top surface thereof and parallel, longitudinally extending guide bosses <b>1052</b> projecting laterally outwardly from the sleeve left and right side walls to engage the slots <b>1014</b> in the inserts <b>1006</b> and <b>1008</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0392" num="0391">The heat sink <b>1030</b> form left and right vertical edge surfaces <b>1054</b> and <b>1056</b>, respectively. The edge surfaces <b>1054</b> and <b>1056</b> define opposed upper steps <b>1058</b> and <b>1060</b>, respectively, and opposed lower steps <b>1062</b> and <b>1064</b>, respectively. The heat sink is manually installed by orienting its lateral edges <b>1054</b> and <b>1056</b> within the opposed vertical slots <b>1036</b> formed in the inserts <b>1006</b> and <b>1008</b>, and lowering in into its installed position. Refer <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>. As the heat sink <b>1030</b> descends, the lower step <b>1064</b> in the edge surface <b>1056</b> will initially slidingly engage a retention tab <b>1006</b> (refer <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 66</figref>) which is integrally formed with insert <b>1008</b> and extends (in the relaxed condition) downwardly and laterally inwardly, forming a downwardly facing catch or abutment surface <b>1068</b>. As the heat sink <b>1030</b> further descends, the lower step <b>1064</b> will momentarily displace the free end of the retention tab <b>1066</b> laterally outwardly. Refer <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 67</figref>. As the heat sink <b>1030</b> approaches its design intent installed position, the upper step <b>1061</b> will vertically align with the abutment surface <b>1068</b> of the retention tab <b>1066</b>, which will snap back into its relaxed position, thereby positively locking the heat sink <b>1030</b> in the installed position. Refer <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 68</figref>. The heat sink <b>1030</b> assumes its installed position when the lower step <b>1064</b> contacts a base surface <b>1070</b> of the insert <b>1008</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0393" num="0392">The PCB assembly <b>1018</b> and the CD player subassembly <b>1020</b> are installed like drawers, and can be conveniently exchanged and repositioned within the confines of the sleeve <b>992</b>, requiring only the replacement of the trim panel <b>1028</b> to accommodate any new configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0394" num="0393">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref>, an alternative method of interconnecting a CD player subassembly inner sleeve <b>1072</b> with a left side insert <b>1074</b> and a PCB assembly <b>1076</b> within a housing sleeve <b>1078</b> of an alternative automotive audio system <b>1080</b> is illustrated. The only material difference of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 69</figref> contrasted with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 59-68</figref>, is the insert <b>1074</b> forms vertically spaced longitudinal slots <b>1082</b> and the inner sleeve <b>1072</b> forms cooperating laterally outwardly extending longitudinal guide bosses <b>1084</b> which are of a dovetail configuration to laterally interlock the two.</p>
<p id="p-0395" num="0394">Fold-Up Case</p>
<p id="p-0396" num="0395">In this mechanical configuration, the case starts out as a flat set of plastic sides with molded in metal mesh to act as the hinges for folding the case into a three-dimensional structure. This approach allows for bottom-up assembly that starts by snapping the board to molded features in the bottom plate. The heat sink is snapped to features in the back plate and the CD mechanism is attached to the front plate with two screws. The box is then folded up and snapped together.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0396">The common edges of adjacent case panels define living hinges extending partially or entirely along the length thereof. The living hinge can consist of wire mesh only, where there is a gap in the plastic material, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>. Alternatively, the living hinge can comprise a thin web of plastic only, wherein the wire mesh has been interrupted. In another embodiment, the plastic-wire mesh composite can be molded to define a thin web as the living hinge, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 71</figref>. In another embodiment, the plastic-wire mesh composite can be crushed or deformed to define the living hinge, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>. Finally, a portion of the plastic and/or wire mesh can be scribed or machined away to expose the wire mesh to define the living hinge. If the case material is thin enough at the hinge point, the hinge can be segmented, rather than continuous.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 70-77</figref>, several variants of a housing assembly <b>1086</b> for an automotive audio system <b>1088</b> are illustrated. This version of the audio system <b>1088</b> is configured to be hand assembled and is nearly fastener-less. The fasteners which are employed are extremely elemental and require only the most rudimentary of hand tools to affect assembly. In essence, the audio system housing assembly <b>1086</b> comprises a case portion <b>1090</b> and a closure member or front plate <b>1092</b>. The case <b>1090</b> is presented to the assembler in an unfolded, two-dimensional arrangement whereby he/she can easily complete the final assembly process on a table top, eliminating complex and expensive tooling fixtures and multiple work stations.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0398">The case portion <b>1090</b> is initially created as a sheet-like preform <b>1094</b> consisting of a number of flat panels interconnected along their adjacent edges. As best viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref>, the preform <b>1094</b> defines five distinct panels, which will constitute a bottom or lower wall portion <b>1096</b>, a right side wall portion <b>1098</b>, a left side wall portion <b>1100</b>, a top or upper wall portion <b>1102</b> and a rear wall portion <b>1104</b>. The adjacent panels are commonly joined or integrally interconnected by living hinges <b>1106</b>, enabling the panels to be repositioned normally to one another to form a three-dimensional box-like case <b>1090</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">The preform <b>1094</b> can be die cut from a continuous sheet of source material or, alternatively, injection molded in a net shape as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 70</figref>. In either case, the material employed to make the preform is a composite of at least one layer of relatively rigid polymer based material and at least one layer of electrically conductive material capable of shielding audio components, such as a radio receiver circuit <b>1108</b> or a CD player subassembly <b>1110</b> from electrical anomalies such as radio frequency interference (RFI), electromagnetic interference (EMI), bulk current injection (BCI), and electrostatic discharge (ESD). Cooperating engagement features such as tabs <b>1112</b> and catches <b>1114</b> are affixed to or integrally formed with the preform <b>1094</b>. Refer <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 72 and 73</figref>. By way of example, after installation of the internal subcomponents, the case preform is folded to assume its ultimate box-like configuration. This places cooperating associated pairs of tabs <b>1112</b> and catches <b>1114</b> in an assembly orientation with the tab <b>1112</b> carried on the edge of one panel (the right side wall portion <b>1098</b>, for example) and the catch <b>1114</b> carried adjacent the edge of a now adjoining panel (the rear wall portion <b>1104</b>, for example). Final structural fixation of the preform <b>1094</b> in the form of the housing case <b>1086</b> is completed by simply snap-engaging the tab <b>1112</b> with the catch <b>1114</b> from the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref> to the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>. After all of the tab <b>1112</b>/catch <b>1114</b> pairs are interconnected, the formation of the case <b>1090</b> is complete.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">Prior to folding up the case <b>1090</b>, the radio receiver circuit <b>1108</b> is positioned and affixed to the exposed surface of the lower wall portion <b>1096</b>.

The positioning and attachment of the internal components can be accomplished by features integrally formed in the formation of the preform <b>1094</b> (such as snaps, locating guides and the like), adhesives, discrete attachment and guide elements or inter-engagement with the various wall portions and other assembly elements within the case <b>1090</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">After formation of the case <b>1090</b>, the CD player subassembly <b>1110</b> can be pre-assembled with the closure member <b>1092</b> via screws <b>1118</b> or other interconnecting features described herein. A rear bracket <b>1124</b> secured to the back side of the CD player subassembly <b>1110</b> by screws <b>1122</b> includes a rearwardly extending threaded post <b>1124</b> which, upon final assembly extends through registering passageways <b>1126</b> in the heat sink <b>1116</b> and rear wall portion <b>1104</b> and engages a mounting bushing <b>1128</b>.

<p id="p-0411" num="0410">In this mechanical configuration, the case starts out as a &#x201c;I-beam&#x201d; allowing the CD mechanism to be attached (bottom-up) to the top of the I-beam for high slot designs then the unit can be flipped over and the board installed (bottom-up) on the bottom of the I-beam. The rectangular solid nature of the I-beam allows it to sit squarely on a table top no matter what the orientation eliminating the need for expensive fixtures at each work station.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 78 and 79</figref>, an automotive audio system <b>1192</b> is configured to be hand assembled and is virtually fastener-less. Furthermore, this embodiment provides a partition structure providing upper and lower (reversible) assembly surfaces with integral closure members. The audio system <b>1192</b> comprises a simple sheet metal housing sleeve <b>1194</b> defining left and right side walls <b>1196</b> and <b>1198</b>, respectively, a bottom <b>1200</b>, a top <b>1202</b>, and front and rear openings <b>1204</b> and <b>1206</b>, respectfully. An H-shaped (when viewed from the side) partition member <b>1208</b> is configured and dimensioned to establish a slip-fit within the sleeve <b>1194</b>. The partition member <b>1208</b> is constructed of upper and lower U-shaped sheet metal channel portions <b>1210</b> and <b>1212</b>, respectively. The upper channel portion <b>1210</b> comprises a horizontal base portion <b>1214</b>, a laterally extending vertically upwardly directed front panel <b>1216</b> and a laterally extending vertically upwardly directed rear panel <b>1218</b>. The lower channel portion <b>1212</b> comprises a horizontal base portion <b>1220</b>, a laterally extending vertically downwardly directed front panel <b>1222</b> and a laterally extending vertically downwardly directed rear panel <b>1224</b>. When the partition <b>1208</b> is in the installed position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 79</figref>, the two front panels <b>1216</b> and <b>1222</b> are substantially co-planer and close the front sleeve opening <b>1204</b>. Likewise, when the partition <b>1208</b> is in the installed position, the two rear panels <b>1218</b> and <b>1224</b> are substantially co-planer and close the rear sleeve opening <b>1206</b>. Accordingly, the sleeve <b>1194</b> and the partition member co-act to define a substantially closed housing assembly <b>1226</b>, which is subdivided into upper and lower chambers or cavities. A trim plate subassembly <b>1228</b> snap engages the sleeve <b>1194</b> to complete the assembly of the audio system <b>1192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">In addition to serving as a closure member, the partition member <b>1208</b> is configured to facilitate the installation of audio system subcomponents such as a radio receiver circuit subassembly <b>1234</b> (illustrated in phantom) and a CD player subassembly <b>1236</b> (illustrated in phantom). Prior to its insertion into the sleeve <b>1194</b>, the partition member <b>1208</b> serves as a reversible assembly fixture that can be conveniently applied on a flat work surface, without dedicated, expensive hard fixtures and tools. For example, with the partition member <b>1208</b> disposed in the illustrated, upright position, the radio receiver circuit subassembly <b>1234</b> can be manually installed on the horizontal base portion <b>1214</b> and/or the inner surfaces of the vertical panels <b>1216</b> and <b>1218</b> from above via self-positioning, self-engaging attachment features (not illustrated) of the types described elsewhere herein. Thereafter, the partition member <b>1208</b> can be inverted and the CD player subassembly <b>1236</b> can be manually installed on the horizontal base portion <b>1220</b> and/or the inner surfaces of the vertical panels <b>1222</b> and <b>1224</b> from above via self-positioning, self-engaging attachment features (not illustrated) of the types described elsewhere herein. Note that, in this scenario, the CD player subassembly would be installed from above, but in the inverted position.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">The vertical height (H<b>2</b>) of the panels <b>1222</b> and <b>1224</b> of the lower U-channel portion <b>1212</b> are dimensioned approximately 150% greater than the vertical height (H<b>1</b>) of the panels <b>1216</b> and <b>1218</b> of the upper U-channel portion <b>1210</b>. This relationship permits the audio system <b>1192</b> to be easily reconfigured between a top-mount CD player or a bottom-mount CD player (by way of example only) either in the factory or in the field, merely with the replacement of the trim panel subassembly <b>1228</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">The U-channel portions <b>1210</b> and <b>1212</b> can be formed as a single integral unit, can be fabricated separately and subsequently joined such as by welding, or can be pre assembled with their respective audio component subassemblies and separately installed within the sleeve <b>1194</b>. Certain details, such as the heat sink, electrical connectors, and the like have been deleted here to avoid redundancy. It is contemplated that such features, as described elsewhere herein, can be applied in the present embodiment.</p>

<p id="p-0417" num="0416">In this mechanical configuration, the bottom of the case is plastic and contains slots for the assembly of the boards. The sides of the case bottom provide a shelf for the CD mechanism to sit on. The back of the case contains a vertical slot for a guillotine heat sink to be installed. The top of the box, also plastic, then slides over the CD mechanism and heat sink and snaps to the bottom trapping all of the components in place. A plastic molded leaf spring in the back of the top would apply a controlled down force on the heat sink for good thermal transfer from the power devices.</p>
<p id="p-0418" num="0417">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 80-82</figref>, an automotive audio system <b>1238</b> is configured to be hand assembled and is virtually fastener-less.

The audio system <b>1238</b> comprises a housing assembly <b>1240</b> including upper and lower case halves <b>1242</b> and <b>1244</b>, respectively. With the exception of specifics described hereinbelow, the case halves <b>1242</b> and <b>1244</b> are substantially symmetrical. The upper case half <b>1242</b> is shaped generally as an inverted &#x201c;U&#x201d;, including a top wall portion <b>1246</b> and left and right downwardly extending integral half-walls <b>1248</b> and <b>1250</b>. The lower case half <b>1244</b> is shaped generally as a &#x201c;U&#x201d;, including a bottom wall portion <b>1252</b> and left and right upwardly extending half-walls <b>1254</b> and <b>1256</b>. Collectively, the case halves <b>1242</b> and <b>1244</b> form front and rear openings <b>1257</b> and <b>1259</b>. A trim plate subassembly <b>1258</b> serves as a front case closure member and a &#x201c;guillotine type&#x201d; heat sink <b>1260</b> serves as a back closure member.</p>
<p id="p-0419" num="0418">The upper case half <b>1242</b> has a number of integrally formed downwardly directed snap tabs <b>1262</b> extending from the half-walls <b>1248</b> and <b>1250</b> thereof which are configured to self-locate and self-engage a like number of mating snap receiving recesses <b>1264</b> integrally formed in the half-walls <b>1254</b> and <b>1256</b> of the lower case half <b>1244</b>. Similarly, the half-walls <b>1248</b>, <b>1250</b>, <b>1254</b> and <b>1256</b> each have an integral forwardly extending snap tab <b>1266</b> which self-locates and self-engages corresponding snap receiving recesses <b>1268</b> integrally formed in left and right integral mounting flanges <b>1270</b> (only the right flange is illustrated) in the trim plate subassembly <b>1258</b> for the retention thereof with the audio system <b>1238</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0420" num="0419">The half walls <b>1254</b> and <b>1256</b> of the lower case half <b>1244</b> integrally form lower longitudinally extending guideways in the form of opposed, laterally facing slots <b>1272</b> and <b>1274</b> for slidably receiving the PCB of a radio receiver circuit subassembly <b>1272</b> and upper longitudinally extending guideways in the form of opposed stepped guide surfaces <b>1278</b> and <b>1280</b> for slidably guiding the bottom surface of a CD player subassembly <b>1282</b>. Resilient localized spring fingers <b>1284</b> are cantilevered from the half-walls <b>1254</b> and <b>1256</b> to continuously bias the CD player subassembly <b>1282</b> upwardly against an upper stop <b>1286</b> integrally formed in the upper case half <b>1230</b> to prevent vibration and rattles. The snap tabs <b>1262</b> extend laterally inwardly sufficiently to laterally embrace the CD player subassembly <b>1282</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0421" num="0420">The lower case half <b>1244</b> has a longitudinally spaced pair of cross-support members <b>1288</b> and <b>1290</b> integrally formed therewith defining and framing a vertically extending slot <b>1292</b> therebetween.

<p id="p-0426" num="0425">The CD player subassembly <b>1304</b> includes a generally rectangular self-contained enclosure including top and bottom panels <b>1308</b> and <b>1310</b>, respectively, left and right side panels <b>1312</b> and <b>1314</b>, respectively, a front panel <b>1316</b> and a rear panel (not illustrated). The side panels <b>1312</b> and <b>1314</b> are extended vertically above the top panel <b>1308</b> and below the bottom panel <b>1310</b>. Furthermore, the side panels <b>1312</b> and <b>1314</b> are extended longitudinally forward or the front panel <b>1316</b> and rearward of the rear panel. Thus constituted, the CD player subassembly <b>1304</b>, when viewed by itself from the front or rear, is configured to approximate an &#x201c;H&#x201d;. The side panels <b>1312</b> and <b>1314</b> can be integral extensions of traditional configuration side panels formed at the time of manufacture of the CD player subassembly <b>1304</b> as an off-line process, or can be formed as discrete elements and affixed to a conventionally configures CD player during final assembly of the audio system.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0426">The housing assembly <b>1306</b> includes an upper closure member <b>1318</b> configured as an inverted &#x201c;U&#x201d; defining a top portion <b>1320</b> and downwardly directed, longitudinally extending left and right skirt portions <b>1322</b> and <b>1324</b>, respectively.

The side panels <b>1312</b> and <b>1314</b> combine with the upper and lower closure members <b>1318</b> and <b>1326</b> to form a box-like case <b>1334</b> defining a front opening <b>1336</b> and a rear opening <b>1338</b>. During final assembly of the audio system <b>1302</b>, the front opening <b>1336</b> is closed by a trim plate subassembly <b>1340</b> and the rear opening <b>1338</b> is closed by a &#x201c;guillotine type&#x201d; heat sink <b>1342</b>.

<p id="p-0428" num="0427">A first or upper cavity <b>1344</b> is formed within the case <b>1334</b> extending vertically between the top panel <b>1308</b> of the CD player subassembly <b>1304</b> and the top portion <b>1320</b> of the upper closure member <b>1318</b>.

<p id="p-0431" num="0430">Laser Labeling of Plastic Case</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0431">Since the material for the receiver case will preferably be black or a relatively dark colored plastic, the paper label that is normally applied prior to shipment to identify the model of the radio and the manufacturer and customer part numbers can be eliminated and the information can be laser ablated onto the surface of the plastic at the software programming station at the end of the production line. This improvement not only eliminates the label (and one or more additional part numbers), but also adhesive and/or pre-application backing material which must be removed prior to label application. Furthermore, such automated labeling directly on an outwardly visible surface of the radio case, virtually ensures against production errors such as non-labeling (producing radios without any label), mislabeling (producing radios with a label bearing incorrect information) and misplaced labeling (proper label incorrectly located so as to render it non-machine readable).</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0432">Filler material of a contrasting color can also be added during the case molding process to render the laser produced label more easily readable. Such filler material can constitute a distinct inner layer extending throughout the entire part as molded, or can be applied only to a localized region of interest on the molded part.</p>
<p id="p-0434" num="0433">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 85 and 86</figref>, the physical assembly the automotive radio/CD player <b>62</b> described hereinabove in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-10</figref> is essentially complete when the trim plate subassembly <b>74</b> is affixed to the closure member <b>70</b> which, in turn, has been previously affixed to the housing case <b>68</b>. For purposes of example, a region <b>1370</b> designated by an outline <b>1372</b> is reserved on the right side wall portion <b>84</b> of the case <b>68</b> for the application of permanent product and customer related information in both human and machine readable forms. The information is typically in textual/numerical form <b>1374</b> and in bar code form <b>1376</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0435" num="0434">The laser labeling or ablating is affected in accordance with the following process. The process is initiated at step <b>1378</b>, either manually or automatically. The process then flows to a step <b>1380</b> of confirming the presence of a production unit <b>62</b> at a software programming station on or adjunct to the production line. The process then flows to a step <b>1382</b> of performing final programming and calibration of the production unit <b>62</b>. The process then flows to a step <b>1384</b> of performing an operation functionality test. Next, the process flows to a step <b>1386</b> of assigning unit specific data to that specific production unit <b>62</b>. Next, the process flows to a step <b>1388</b> of laser calibrating unit specific and generic data in textual and/or bar code form, <b>1374</b> and <b>1376</b>, respectively, within the outline <b>1372</b> in the designated region <b>1370</b> on the external surface of the case <b>68</b>. Next, the process flows to a step <b>1390</b> of recording the data in a memory device. Finally, the process flows to a step <b>1392</b> of ending the program and awaiting the next in line production unit.</p>
<p id="p-0436" num="0435">Hybrid Case</p>
<p id="p-0437" num="0436"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 97-119</figref> describe several variants of hybrid case structures for radio/CD players adapted for automotive applications. A hybrid case is constructed of different materials with disparate properties, such as molded plastic portions in assembly with structurally supportive (stamped) metal frame elements. All or portions of the plastic case, including the faceplate, may have wire mesh insert molded therein to shield against electrical anomalies. The metal frame elements primarily serve to structurally reinforce the plastic portions and can also define internal component and sub-assembly positioning/mounting features. Typically, one or more localized regions of embedded wire screen are exposed, either during the molding/formation process, or thereafter, employing secondary operations. In assembly, the exposed regions are in contact with the metal frame elements to ensure continuity of the shielding effect. The hybrid cases illustrated if <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 97-119</figref> are modified I-beam (refer <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 78 and 79</figref>) and interlocking block/clam-shell (refer <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 80-82</figref>). The embodiment of the automotive audio system described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 83 and 84</figref> elsewhere herein is deemed to be of hybrid construction.</p>

<p id="p-0442" num="0441">Faceplate with Integral Lightpipe</p>
<p id="p-0443" num="0442">Additional part count reduction and assembly simplicity can be achieved by integrally forming light pipes within the front plate of the radio/CD player employing a two-shot molding process. This eliminates or substantially reduces the number of light pipes and fasteners. Refer <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 120</figref>. Overall quality is also improved by the elimination of the possibility of misassembled and loose or misplaced parts.</p>
<p id="p-0444" num="0443">The integrally molded light pipes facilitate the subterranean lighting method currently used with side firing surface mount LEDs (5 total) that are attached to the back of the keyboard. Typically, a blue LED distributed light through a clear polycarbonate light pipe and passes the light through the pushbutton which is painted and laser etched for the nighttime viewability of the graphics on the pushbuttons of the radio. The LEDs are preferably mounted on the back of the keyboard. The forward facing extensions depending from the light pipes typically extend through registering holes (not illustrated) in the keyboard to specifically illuminate a particular button or device on the keyboard.</p>
<p id="p-0445" num="0444">The preferred material for the light pipe is polycarbonate as well as the front plate. White polycarbonate would be used for the front plate with an opacifier (to stop light bleed) to enable the light to be more efficient passing there through. Black material would draw light energy from the light pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0446" num="0445">The present invention, now permissible because of the plastic front plate, enables better assembly and better tolerance stack-up of parts. This would take four separate parts and combine them into one. It also opens up possibilities of using acrylic for the light pipe now there is no need for a fastener or snap (acrylic is more brittle than polycarbonate, but offers more preferred light characteristics for different wavelengths of light over long runs).</p>
<p id="p-0447" num="0446">The two-shot front plate with integral light pipes combines four separate parts that must be assembled into one multi-functional part. Typically, the light pipes must be assembled with relative accurate locating features that are aligned to accommodate the minimized air gap required for an efficient light entry from the source leds used to illuminate the push buttons and halo rings of the trim plate assembly for the radio. Often, these parts are fastened with snaps or screws or a combination thereof to enable retention of the assembly under a multitude of environmental and driving conditions. Due to the relative brittleness of the better light pipe materials, screws may be required for the material of the light pipe may not be robust enough to survive the stress of a snap. These characteristics often make light pipe assembly a tedious task for the assembler and the designer to provide the optimal light delivery without degradation from misalignment or damage during the assembly process.</p>
<p id="p-0448" num="0447">The two shot plastic process enables combining two different materials into a single piece part which in this case permits the best features of both materials to perform the functions needed to achieve a successful component. The light pipes can be the first shot to be ganged to be consistently located in the most accurate locations needed for optimal light entry from the leds and light exit for the respective delivery points to the backlit areas of the trim plate assembly. The second shot would enable the light blocking and the structural component to provide the snap retention features of the front plate as well as the normal front plate functional items.</p>
<p id="p-0449" num="0448">Often the concern with light pipes might be the close proximity of a black material that may absorb the light energy that travels through the light pipe. This is typically why there is an air gap between any black material component and any adjacent light pipe. To overcome this potential degradation, the front plate can be molded with a white material, even with an opacifier if needed. Another method would be to limit the points of contact between the light pipe material and the structural frame-like material component. This induces an air gap in the areas of illumination and still provides interface between the materials to form a single part.</p>
<p id="p-0450" num="0449">The two shot process typically has a first shot of material into a mold. Next the mold is rotated and the second shot of material is provided to complete the part. In this case, the first shot would be the light pipe portion, followed by the structural portion.</p>
<p id="p-0451" num="0450">This inventive design will also offer greater flexibility for assembling the trim plate and case assembly as well.</p>
<p id="p-0452" num="0451">Although this lighting approach is primarily intended for use on the front plate, it could also be employed in the radio case itself if a controlled light output in non traditional directions from the radio assembly is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0453" num="0452">It is contemplated that screen mesh can be insert molded within the front face simultaneously with the above described subterranean 2-shot light pipe forming process. In this case, the screen mesh would preferably be positioned inwardly of the light pipes within the front plate structure. Alternatively, the screen and light pipe positions can be reversed. However, this would be more complex and require that the light pipe extensions pass through registering apertures in the screen.</p>
<p id="p-0454" num="0453">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 120</figref>, a known trim plate assembly <b>1480</b> is illustrated to highlight the substantial complexity, high part count, and design shortcomings resulting from providing back-illumination using traditional design and assembly techniques. The trim plate assembly <b>1480</b> includes a black plastic front panel <b>1482</b> (with operator controls and displays affixed on the opposed side), a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>1484</b> mounted on the exposed face of the front panel <b>1482</b>, three separate and discrete lightpipes <b>1486</b> mounted on the exposed face of the PCB <b>1484</b> by eight fastening screws <b>1488</b> and five light emitting diodes (LEDs) <b>1490</b> carried on the PCB <b>1484</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0455" num="0454">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 165</figref>, a generic two-shot injection molded article <b>1492</b> is formed from a two-shot molding process wherein the first shot is of clear acrylic and results in a buried light pipe portion <b>1494</b> and an extension portion <b>1496</b> directed toward the viewer (arrow) <b>1498</b>. The second shot is of white acrylic with an opacifier, simultaneously forming a mask and robust structural element <b>1500</b>. The mask/structural element <b>1500</b> is integrally formed with the lightpipe portion <b>1494</b> and extension portion <b>1496</b>. A pocket <b>1502</b> is formed in the mask/structural element <b>1500</b> for receiving an LED <b>1504</b> which is electrically interconnected with a PCB (not illustrated) via leads <b>1506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0456" num="0455">The two shot process eliminates the necessity for using separate fasteners and permits use of optically preferable materials such as acrylics. There are no small parts to come loose or be misassembled.</p>

After final assembly with the trim panel subassembly and PCB, five LEDs <b>1516</b>, <b>1518</b>, <b>1520</b>, <b>1522</b> and <b>1524</b> will be arranged in respective pockets <b>1526</b>, <b>1528</b>, <b>1530</b>, <b>1532</b> and <b>1534</b> for illuminating the lightpipes <b>1510</b>, <b>1512</b> and <b>1514</b>. Multiple extensions <b>1536</b> extend outwardly (toward the trim plate assembly). The closure member further includes a mask/structural portion <b>1538</b> formed as a second shot of white acrylic material, including an opacifier.

<p id="p-0462" num="0461">Media Drawer for Automotive Audio System</p>
<p id="p-0463" num="0462">With the 2DIN radio or audio system configuration, there exists enough internal volume within the housing assembly to configure the pushbuttons and display layout to accommodate a front accessible area that can enable a platform or drawer to hold multiple devices such as an iPod&#x2122; or similar player, and also a flash memory stick. This platform or drawer would then be pushed and seated within the radio to enable a secure mechanical retention as well as making an electrical connection to allow the devices to be powered and communicate with the audio system radio, even when the drawer is closed and secured.</p>
<p id="p-0464" num="0463">The front of the platform or drawer matches the opening of the radio chassis both aesthetically and structurally, and be of a style that could be detached and applied to an updated or alternative platform or drawer, should the desired devices change or evolve during the lifetime of the host vehicle. The electrical and mechanical interconnects are largely standardized and, thus, would be the same, enabling the consumer to change the platform or drawer at any time depending upon his/her personal requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0465" num="0464">Presently, detachable faceplates for single DIN radios exist that have both the electrical connection and mechanical retention that could be used in this format. However single DIN radios are not large enough to accommodate multiple audio subassemblies such as a radio receiver circuit subassembly and a CD player subassembly while reserving enough contiguous internal volume to accommodate a flush-mount media drawer.</p>
<p id="p-0466" num="0465">The present invention allows the existing radio to be updated or modified according to the wants and desires of the customer regarding the preferred music device without having to remove the radio from the instrument panel or impacting the normal production run of the radio. The size of the platform or drawer would be a standard as well as the electrical and mechanical interfaces to enable continuous offerings as dealer and after-market stock for customizing the radio.</p>
<p id="p-0467" num="0466">The nature of the component having electrical connection capability enables incorporation of other desired features like &#x201c;Bluetooth&#x2122;&#x201d; connectivity as yet another option that could be incorporated into the platform or drawer.</p>
<p id="p-0468" num="0467">With front panel accessability, there would be the capability for the radio manufacturer to provide reflash programming capability with minimal service impact (like having to remove the radio from the instrument panel), by using the electrical interconnect and to the access provided to the radio by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0469" num="0468">The present invention eliminates the need for costly harness attachment through the glove box. It would maintain the device location within the confines of the audio system/radio housing to prevent contamination or damage and eliminate any issue with vehicle occupant impact during a braking event or crash. Furthermore, when installed within the drawer, the device is relatively secreted from view from outside the host vehicle, and is thus less likely to attract unwanted attention from a prospective miscreant. With the connection flexibility due to the interchangeable platform or drawer, virtually any known device can be accommodated to permit direct control through the radio, enhancing driver/passenger convenience and safety as opposed to trying to control a separate device away from the immediate driver view.</p>
<p id="p-0470" num="0469"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 127</figref> illustrates known approaches for configuring ports within an automobile <b>1546</b> for interfacing a personal portable digital device (PPDD) <b>1548</b> with the an audio system <b>1550</b> embedded within the vehicle's instrument panel <b>1551</b> to access the vehicle's electrical network. Most typically, such capability is employed for playing pre-recorded music files stored in the PPDD <b>1548</b> through the vehicle's speaker system. Ports or auxiliary jacks <b>1552</b> most often are incorporated in the exposed front face or control panel <b>1556</b> of the vehicle's radio. Interconnection of the PPDD <b>1548</b> is affected by an umbilical cable <b>1558</b> extending therebetween. Unfortunately, the PPDD <b>1548</b> is frequently placed in areas such as a vehicle cup holder, ash tray, arm rest or the like not designed for securing such articles. In addition to being aesthetically undesirable, this can expose the PPDD to damage or theft, and can be distracting to the driver. Furthermore foreign articles placed in vehicle passenger cabins can pose an impact risk or entanglement between the umbilical cable <b>1558</b> and vehicle occupants, controls or other electrical/electronic devices (e.x. cell phones, laptop computers, portable DVDs, television monitors, power/recharging cables, and the like). A partial solution has been proposed of locating the port or auxiliary jack <b>1552</b>&#x2032; within the vehicle's glove box. However, this can exacerbate the distraction issue by locating the PPDD <b>1548</b>&#x2032; further from the driver's field of vision. Furthermore, it can result in the vehicle being operated for sustained periods with the glove box door remaining in the open position. Lastly, PPDDs located in the glove box are subject to damage or inadvertent resetting of their controls by impacting other objects in the glove box. In both traditional locations, the PPDD is not typically secured and is prone to falling or damage.</p>
<p id="p-0471" num="0470">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 128-132</figref>, <b>166</b>A and <b>166</b>B, an exemplary embodiment of this aspect of the invention is illustrated. A large format audio system <b>1562</b> includes a plastic/wire screen composite case <b>1564</b> and a plastic/wire screen composite closure member/front plate <b>1566</b> which combine to form a housing assembly <b>1568</b>. A front trim plate <b>1570</b> is mounted to the closure member <b>1566</b> for installation in a host vehicle passenger compartment or instrument panel for access by an operator or passenger to the controls and displays arranged about the outer visible surface <b>1571</b> thereof. A laterally elongated rectangular opening <b>1572</b> in the lower portion of the front trim panel subassembly <b>1570</b> provides access to a cavity <b>1574</b> within the housing assembly <b>1568</b>. A media drawer <b>1576</b> is configured and dimensioned to be longitudinally inserted into said cavity <b>1574</b> through the trim panel opening <b>1570</b> and, in application, is manually operable for displacement between a &#x201c;closed&#x201d; position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 130</figref> and an &#x201c;open&#x201d; position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 129 and 129</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0472" num="0471">The media drawer <b>1576</b> is configured to approximate a relatively shallow, open-top box including a vertical front panel <b>1578</b>, a bottom panel or platform <b>1580</b>, parallel left and right vertical side panels <b>1582</b> and <b>1584</b>, respectively, and a vertical rear panel <b>1586</b>. The panels <b>1578</b>, <b>1580</b>, <b>1582</b>, <b>1584</b> and <b>1586</b> are integrally formed from injection molded polymer material or, preferably, a polymer/wire screen composite. Laterally outwardly projecting, longitudinally extending bosses <b>1588</b> are integrally formed on the outer walls of the left and right side walls <b>1582</b> and <b>1584</b> to define drawer guide surfaces which mate with cooperating guideways <b>1590</b> formed on the inner surfaces of the audio system case sidewalls <b>1592</b>, or other suitable internal housing assembly structure. When the media drawer <b>1576</b> is closed, a front surface or face <b>1594</b> of the front panel is substantially flush with the front face <b>1571</b> of the front trim panel <b>1570</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0473" num="0472">The faces <b>1571</b> and <b>1595</b> are aesthetically stylized to mask or obfuscate the presence of drawer <b>1576</b>. Unobtrusive instructional indicia <b>1596</b> may be added on the front drawer surface <b>1594</b> as an aid for the user. The bosses <b>1588</b> and cooperating guideways also include integral features (not illustrated) to establish longitudinal stops, preventing the media drawer <b>1576</b> from inward longitudinal displacement beyond the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 130</figref> and outward longitudinal displacement beyond the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 128 and 129</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0474" num="0473">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 129 and 130</figref>, the audio system <b>1562</b> includes audio components such as a radio receiver circuit assembly <b>1598</b> and a CD player subassembly <b>1600</b> mounted within the housing assembly <b>1568</b>. As described in greater detail elsewhere herein, the radio receiver circuit assembly <b>1598</b> has its circuit components mounted on a unique PCB <b>1602</b> or a common PCB <b>1604</b>. A flexible, elongated cable <b>1606</b> is connected to the common PCB via a plug <b>1608</b> at one end and to the rear panel <b>1586</b> via a port <b>1610</b>. The cable <b>1606</b> is routed above and behind the media drawer <b>1576</b>, entirely within the housing assembly <b>1568</b>, so as to be hidden from the operator, and is long enough to maintain continuity between the common PCB and the port <b>1610</b>, independent of the position of the media drawer <b>1576</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0475" num="0474">The cable <b>1606</b> can provide an electrical ground path between the wire screen embedded within the media drawer to the wire screen embedded within the housing assembly case <b>1564</b> and closure member <b>1566</b>. Alternatively, exposed adjacent wire screen portions in the media drawer <b>1576</b> and case <b>1564</b> can provide a direct, continuous ground path.</p>
<p id="p-0476" num="0475">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 166A and 166B</figref>, additional convenience can be provided in the operation of the media drawer <b>1576</b>, by providing a &#x201c;push-push&#x201d; type latching and unlatching mechanism <b>1612</b>, which is known in other unrelated applications such as push-button electrical switches. For example, refer U.S. Pat. No. 5,727,675, the specification of which is incorporated herein by reference. In essence, the push-push mechanism <b>1612</b> selectively interconnects the media drawer <b>1576</b> and the housing assembly <b>1568</b> and provides a slight &#x201c;lost motion&#x201d; to the media drawer <b>1576</b> longitudinally inwardly of the position depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 130</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 130</figref>, the media drawer <b>1576</b> is latched in the closed position, whereby vehicle operation will not result in unintended opening. Whenever an operator desires to gain access to the media drawer, he/she need merely momentarily push the drawer slightly longitudinally inwardly. The inward movement of the drawer will release the latch <b>1614</b> and a compression spring <b>1616</b> will displace the drawer <b>1576</b> to the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 128 and 129</figref>. Conversely. Whenever an operator desires to close the media drawer <b>1576</b>, he/she need merely again push the drawer <b>1576</b> longitudinally inwardly to a position slightly inwardly of that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 130</figref> and thereafter release the drawer <b>1576</b>. This motion will cause the latch <b>1614</b> to self engage and the drawer will again be fixed in the closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 130</figref>. Alternatively, a handle or finger catch (not illustrated) can be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0477" num="0476">The media drawer <b>1576</b> is dimensioned and configured for flexibility for receiving all known (current and future) PPDDs. However, as new technologies emerge, it is envisioned that the drawer <b>1576</b> can be easily exchanged for a newly configured design without modifying the host audio system <b>1562</b> and vehicle. As described herein, many current PPDDs can be interfaced with a host vehicle audio system simply by opening the media drawer, plugging a PPDD <b>1618</b> into the port <b>1610</b> via a PPDD supplied interface cable <b>1620</b>, placing the PPDD <b>1618</b> and its cable <b>1620</b> into the drawer <b>1576</b> and closing the drawer <b>1576</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0478" num="0477">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 131</figref>, an alternative media drawer <b>1642</b> is illustrated. The media drawer <b>1642</b> includes integrally formed front panel <b>1644</b>, a bottom panel <b>1648</b>, side panels <b>1650</b> and a rear panel <b>1652</b> similar to those of media drawer <b>1576</b> described hereinabove. In some applications, an application specific interface electronic device <b>1654</b> may be required to establish compatibility between a PPDD <b>1656</b> and the host audio system. The electronic device <b>1654</b> can be built into the media drawer <b>1642</b> and interconnected to the PPDD via a cable <b>1658</b> as well as the host audio system as described elsewhere herein. Multiple, supplemental non dedicated ports <b>1655</b> and <b>1657</b> can also be provided within the media drawer <b>1642</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0479" num="0478">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 132</figref>, a second alternative media drawer <b>1660</b> is viewed from the rear, and includes a front panel <b>1662</b> and a bottom panel <b>1664</b>. The front panel <b>1662</b> has interface wiring embedded therein and provides multiple ports, such as a &#x201c;memory stick&#x201d; port <b>1666</b>, a large format connector (such as USB type) <b>1668</b> for attaching large, out-size peripheral devices, as well as a port (not illustrated) for connecting with a PPDD <b>1670</b>. Hold-down features, such as integrally formed resilient self-latching tabs depend from the platform/bottom panel <b>1664</b>. Laterally outwardly directed, longitudinally extending guide bosses <b>1674</b> can be integrally formed in the bottom panel <b>1664</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0480" num="0479">Squirts</p>
<p id="p-0481" num="0480">To further the innovative construction of the present invention, &#x201c;squirts&#x201d; or screwless retention features are employed. Restated, squirts are a drawn feature from a structural element, or a styled protrusion at the interface of two structural elements. Although applicable broadly, squirts are principally applied in the preferred embodiment of the invention to secure the CD player subassembly to the left and right CD player guide brackets. This allows the elimination of six additional screws.</p>
<p id="p-0482" num="0481">A squirt is a retention feature which is integrally formed in a typically planer region of a structural member, such as a CD player guide bracket, which extends above one surface thereof and, during assembly, self-engages within an opening formed in an adjacent structural element, such as a hole in the outer case of the CD player subassembly. Squirts permit assembly of the guide brackets to the CD player assembly by hand without the need for special fixtures and power tools.</p>
<p id="p-0483" num="0482">The squirts are formed from stock material during formation of the brackets themselves and do not add significant cost to the finalized bracket component. Similarly, mating holes can be easily punch formed in the adjacent case panels of the CD player subassembly.</p>
<p id="p-0484" num="0483">In addition to reduced cost and ease of assembly, the squirt self-aligns the respective components during the attachment process, thereby ensuring their precise juxtaposition. Furthermore, the squirt is permissive of lower tolerances in the forming and assembly of its associated elements. In fact, the presence of slightly misshapen features or metal flash resulting from low tolerance punching operations can actually result in enhanced retention performance.</p>
<p id="p-0485" num="0484">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 140-143</figref>, the application of &#x201c;squirts&#x201d; <b>1676</b> to affix the left and right side mounting brackets, <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, respectively to the multi-disc CD player unit <b>104</b> to form the CD player subassembly <b>66</b>, is illustrated. The squirts are preferable die-punch formed simultaneously with the formation of the mounting brackets <b>106</b>/<b>108</b> themselves. It is noted that the brackets <b>106</b>/<b>108</b> can be configured symmetrically, whereby one design can be used for both sides of the CD player unit <b>104</b>, thereby further reducing the overall part count. The squirts <b>1676</b> are preferably formed on relatively regions <b>1678</b> of their associated bracket <b>106</b>/<b>108</b>. A single through passage <b>1680</b> if formed in the planer region <b>1678</b>. Two or more substantially symmetrical forms <b>1682</b> extend radially inwardly from the edge of the through passage <b>1680</b>. Each form <b>1682</b> has a neck region <b>1684</b> and a tapered region or sector <b>1686</b>. The tapered region <b>1686</b> is supported as a cantilever by the neck region <b>1684</b>. The tapered regions <b>1686</b> collectively co-act to define (in the case of two forms) a bisected frustoconical form, wherein each tapered region <b>1686</b> defines an outside peripheral surface <b>1688</b> which are acutely converging upon an axis normal to the planer region <b>1678</b>. The taper of an imaginary cone <b>1700</b> extended from surfaces <b>1688</b> is designated by the angle &#x3c9;. As illustrated by alternative phantom depictions, the overall shape of the imaginary cone <b>1700</b> can be parabolic or hyperbolic. The outer peripheral surface <b>1688</b> of each tapered region or sector <b>1686</b> has a circumferential range designated by the angle &#x3b8;, which with two forms is preferably in the range of 90&#xb0;-120&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0486" num="0485">In application, the collective outer peripheral surface of the sectors <b>1686</b> engage a surface forming the outer diameter of a recess or through hole <b>1702</b> in an adjacent structure <b>104</b> to which the bracket <b>106</b>/<b>108</b> is to be attached. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 141</figref>, the maximum diameter edge surface <b>1704</b> sectors <b>1686</b> effect line contact to maximize pull-out performance.</p>
<p id="p-0487" num="0486">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 143</figref>, localized radially outwardly projecting knurls, ridges or extensions <b>1706</b> to provide point contacts with the adjacent structures.</p>
<p id="p-0488" num="0487">Attachment of the squirt <b>1676</b> to an adjacent structures is affected simply by aligning the sector <b>1686</b> with the through hole <b>1702</b> and pressing inwardly, as indicated by the phantom finger tip and resultant force arrow <b>1708</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0489" num="0488">Plug-In Satellite Communication Module</p>
<p id="p-0490" num="0489">Satellite radio is enabled through three primary approaches in the OEM radio market. There is an auxiliary box that plugs in-line to the radio. There is a separate shielded and enclosed module that is attached mechanically and electrically to the inside of the radio on the main circuit board. They are typically enclosed by two die cast halves or a sheet metal enclosure. There is also a component block of electrical parts that is soldered to the main circuit board inside the radio that may require a shield for electrical protection.</p>
<p id="p-0491" num="0490">While these approaches enable satellite radio, the shortcomings are they may require distinction of either XM or Sirius as the provider and with the exception of the separate in-line auxiliary box, are not upgradable should the provider change or hardware updates become available.</p>
<p id="p-0492" num="0491">The present invention employs a plug-in module enabling the OEM radio to be configured at either end of the assembly area to accommodate any satellite radio provider or hardware upgrade. Because it is a direct plug-in to the radio, there is less reliability concerns than the in-line auxiliary box and less real estate required in the vehicle. With the module plugging into the rear of the radio, the module can be easily changed or upgraded at the vehicle dealer or an aftermarket retailer by simply extracting the radio, disconnecting the existing module, and replacing it with a new module. The module has the integrated in-molded mesh in plastic technology described elsewhere herein to provide any required shielding/grounding. The plastic allows for slide lock, snap lock assembly to the radio chassis. The electrical connection can be through a docking style connector or even a ziff format ribbon cable (similar to the CD mechanism). With internal attachment modules, there is not the flexibility to interchange modules or upgrade without disassembling the radio and desoldering the unit.</p>
<p id="p-0493" num="0492">Another advantage of the plug-in module is the ease of assembly of the module itself. The in-molded mesh in plastic approach allows for a screwless assembly and provides less handling concerns over a die cast or sheet metal enclosure. The cost should be substantially less than the die cast and equal to or less than that of the sheet metal.</p>
<p id="p-0494" num="0493">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 146-149</figref>, an automotive audio system <b>1710</b> includes a housing assembly <b>1712</b> enclosing one or more audio system subassemblies, such as a radio receiver circuit assembly <b>1714</b>. The housing assembly <b>1712</b> includes a box-like housing case <b>1716</b> and a front closure member (not illustrated) which enclose the audio system subassemblies <b>1712</b>. The housing case <b>1716</b> and the closure member are each preferably formed as a composite including wire screen insert molded within a polymer based material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 147</figref> illustrates a left side wall portion <b>1718</b>, a rear wall portion <b>1720</b> and a bottom wall portion <b>1722</b> of the audio system case <b>1716</b>. All of the constituent wall portions of the case <b>1716</b> are preferably injection molded as a single part to simplify assembly, minimize part cost and to maximize the wire screen's effectiveness in shielding the audio components from electrical anomalies including RFI, EMI, BCI and ESD.</p>
<p id="p-0495" num="0494">One of the wall portions (e.g. the rear wall portion <b>1720</b>) has an opening <b>1724</b> formed therein for receiving a plug-in module <b>1726</b> for affecting satellite radio reception capability for the otherwise terrestrial radio receiver <b>1714</b> within the audio system <b>1710</b>. The radio receiver circuit assembly <b>1714</b> includes a PCB <b>1728</b> carrying a docking type connector <b>1730</b> aligned with the opening <b>1724</b> whereby an electrical plug (not illustrated) carried on the plug-in module <b>1726</b> engages the docking connector <b>1730</b> upon insertion of the plug-in module <b>1726</b> within the opening <b>1724</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 146 and 147</figref>. Alternatively, an elongated, flexible ribbon-type connector can be affixed the radio circuit PCB <b>1728</b> which, when a plug-in module <b>1726</b> is to be installed, is first manually drawn out of the case <b>1716</b> through the opening <b>1724</b>, attached to the module electrical plug, and reinserted back through the opening <b>1724</b> in assembly with the module <b>1726</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0496" num="0495">The plug-in module <b>1726</b> includes a housing <b>1732</b> which is generally rectangular in shape. The module housing <b>1732</b> has upper and lower wall portions, <b>1734</b> and <b>1736</b>, respectively, left and right side wall portions (as viewed from the bask of the housing assembly <b>1712</b>) <b>1738</b> and <b>1740</b>, respectively, a front wall portion (facing outwardly) <b>1742</b> and a back wall portion <b>1744</b> (facing inwardly) <b>1744</b>. The housing <b>1732</b> is preferably formed as a composite including wire screen insert molded within a polymer based material and has a &#x201c;clam-shell&#x201d; type architecture. The housing can be assembled from two discrete elements, one including the upper wall portion <b>1734</b> integrally formed with top half-wall portions of the side walls <b>1738</b> and <b>1740</b>, the front wall <b>1742</b> and the back wall <b>1744</b>, and the other including the lower wall portion <b>1736</b> integrally formed with bottom half-wall portions of the side walls <b>1738</b> and <b>1740</b>, the front wall <b>1742</b> and the back wall <b>1744</b>. Each of the two discrete elements can include self-aligning, self-guiding and self-engaging features integrally formed therewith. Alternatively, the two elements can be molded as a single element with one set of opposed edges interconnected via an integral web or living-hinge. For example, refer <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 161-163</figref>. Upon assembly of the plug-in module <b>1726</b>, the electrical plug is supported at and extends from the back wall portion <b>1744</b>. A connector (co-axial) <b>1746</b> extends outwardly from the front wall portion which is adapted for interconnection with a host vehicle satellite antenna system.</p>
<p id="p-0497" num="0496">The wire screen contained within the plug-in module <b>1726</b> can be grounded to the wire screen contained within the audio system housing assembly <b>1712</b> by either providing adjacent exposed portions of wire screen that are configured to remain in intimate contact or, alternatively, they can be grounded remotely via mating conductors in the associated radio connector and module plug.</p>
<p id="p-0498" num="0497">The plug-in module <b>1726</b> is retained in its installed position within the audio system <b>1710</b> by two, opposed snap-acting retention arms <b>1748</b> and <b>1750</b> integrally formed with the module housing <b>1732</b>. Retention arm <b>1748</b> includes a base portion <b>1752</b> integrally formed with the right sidewall portion <b>1740</b> of the module housing <b>1732</b> and extending laterally outwardly therefrom. The retention arm <b>1748</b> also includes an elongated lever arm portion <b>1754</b> which is integrally formed with its associated base portion <b>1752</b> and extends longitudinally rearwardly therefrom as a cantilever beyond both the exterior wall portion <b>1742</b> of the module housing <b>1732</b>, and the housing case rear wall portion <b>1720</b>. The rearwardmost end of the lever arm portion <b>1754</b> is exposed and defines a finger grip surface <b>1756</b>. The lever arm portion <b>1754</b> forms a localized laterally outwardly directed upset <b>1758</b> therein forming a forwardly facing ramp surface <b>1759</b> and a rearwardly facing abutment surface <b>1760</b>. When assembled, the rearwardly facing abutment surface <b>1760</b> on the lever arm <b>1754</b> longitudinally aligns with a forwardly facing abutment surface <b>1762</b> formed in the case opening <b>1724</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0499" num="0498">The other retention arm <b>1750</b> is a minor-image of retention arm <b>1748</b> and functions as described hereinabove. Retention arm <b>1750</b> has a cantileverlever arm portion <b>1764</b> which extends rearwardly beyond both the exterior wall portion <b>1742</b> of the module housing <b>1732</b>, and the housing case rear wall portion <b>1720</b>. The rearwardmost end of the lever arm portion <b>1764</b> is exposed and defines a finger grip surface <b>1766</b> laterally opposite finger grip surface <b>1756</b> of lever arm portion <b>1754</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0500" num="0499">When the plug-in module is installed, guideways (not illustrated) within the audio system housing assembly <b>1712</b> adjacent the opening <b>1724</b> cooperate with guide surfaces defined by outer surfaces of the module housing <b>1732</b> to affect self-location, self-guiding and self-engagement of the plug-in module <b>1726</b> within the audio system housing assembly <b>1712</b>. As the module enters into the opening <b>1724</b>, the ramp surfaces <b>1759</b> cause the lever arms <b>1754</b>/<b>1764</b> to be laterally displaced toward one another. Once the abutment surfaces <b>1760</b> and <b>1762</b> align, the natural resiliency of the lever arms will result in their snapping back into their illustrated positions, thereby interlocking the module <b>1726</b> in its design location. The module can be removed simply by simultaneously gripping the two surfaces <b>1756</b> and <b>1766</b> and squeezing them together, thereby releasing the respective pairs of abutment surfaces <b>1760</b> and <b>1762</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0501" num="0500">Although much of the forgoing description has been focused on automotive audio based entertainment systems, the explosive growth of communications and navigation technologies have somewhat blurred their traditional distinctions. This issue is particularly acute in automotive systems and personal portable digital devices. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 161-163</figref>, as an example, a telematic device, i.e. a device employed for one or two way communications is illustrated. The telematic device <b>1768</b>, when packaged for automotive application, employs design methodologies which overlap into traditional, purely passive automotive entertainment systems. The telematic device <b>1768</b> of the present invention includes a one-piece housing <b>1770</b> molded as a composite of polymeric material with a wire screen insert such as described elsewhere herein in the context of other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0502" num="0501">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 167-169</figref>, the &#x201c;slide-lock&#x201d; and &#x201c;snap-lock&#x201d; aspect of the inventive features described elsewhere herein is also applied to assembly of a closure member or front plate <b>1772</b> with trim plate subassembly <b>1774</b> including a display/control panel PCB <b>1776</b>, a trim plate bezel <b>1778</b> and a trim plate facia <b>1780</b>. The front plate <b>1772</b> is injection molded of relatively rigid polymer based material, and includes features integrally formed therewith for affecting fastener-less interconnection with the housing case (not illustrated) of a lightweight automotive audio system <b>1782</b>. Although the closure member <b>1772</b> is depicted as being formed entirely of polymer based material, it is contemplated that it could have a composite structure of polymer and electrically conductive material such as wire screen. Furthermore, the closure member could also be injection molded of optically optimized material such as acrylic in a two-shot process for integrating light pipes therein to provide back illumination of trim plate controls and displays. In this case, the light pipes would include a number of integral, longitudinally outwardly directed extensions passing through registering apertures in the display/control panel PCB <b>1776</b> (not illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0503" num="0502">Preferably, the closure member <b>1772</b> includes several split snap-catches <b>1782</b> extending forwardly from the closure member front surface <b>1786</b>. The snap-catches <b>1784</b> extend through registering apertures <b>1788</b> in the display/control panel PCB <b>1776</b>. Each of the snap-catches <b>1784</b> also include an integral standoff <b>1790</b> which functions to space the PCB from the closure member front surface <b>1786</b> to provide component clearance and enhance cooling. The closure member <b>1772</b> includes a number of outwardly extending ramped tabs <b>1792</b> distributed about the exposed periphery <b>1794</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0504" num="0503">The trim plate bezel <b>1778</b> is constructed of substantially opaque molded polymer material suitable for decorative finishing by painting or a deposition process. The bezel <b>1778</b> has openings/through holes (not illustrated) therein registering with an array of rear loaded actuator devices and displays carried on the display/control panel PCB <b>1776</b>, and associated front loaded pushbuttons. The bezel <b>1778</b> also forms openings or transparent/translucent windows for back lighting of the push buttons, displays and informational indicia (not illustrated). The bezel <b>1778</b> has a peripherally extending step <b>1796</b> formed on the inside surface <b>1798</b> thereof which abuts the outer surface <b>1800</b> of the PCB <b>1776</b> to ensure precise spacing and registration between the control devices/displays and their respective openings/through holes. Tab engaging extensions <b>1802</b> including abutment recesses <b>1804</b> are integrally formed with the bezel step <b>1796</b> and extend rearwardly therefrom to engage corresponding ramped tabs <b>1792</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0505" num="0504">The bezel <b>1778</b> has a longitudinal riser defining a peripheral edge <b>1806</b> extending between the step <b>1796</b> and the bezel front face <b>1810</b>. The bezel <b>1778</b> includes a number of circumferentially arranged outwardly extending ramped tabs <b>1810</b> integrally formed on the peripheral edge <b>1806</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0506" num="0505">The trim plate facia <b>1780</b> can be employed in certain applications to comply with extremely high color and finish requirements and to avoid aesthetically objectionable distortions sometimes inherently resulting from the bezel <b>1778</b> injection molding process. The facia <b>1780</b> has a very thin section and is preferably injection molded of high quality polymer based material suitable for decorative finishing or a deposition process. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 168 and 169</figref>, the facia has an abbreviated peripheral side wall portion <b>1812</b> forming circumferentially arranged tab receiving recesses <b>1814</b> on the inside surface <b>1816</b> thereof. The facia <b>1780</b> has openings/through holes (not illustrated) therein registering with corresponding openings/through holes in the bezel <b>1778</b>. The facia also has openings or transparent/translucent windows for back lighting of the push buttons, displays and informational indicia. When installed, the inside face <b>1818</b> of the facia is disposed in intimate contact with the outside face <b>1820</b> of the bezel <b>1778</b>.</p>
