<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to valves, and more particularly, to a valve release mechanism with improved discharge performance for fire suppression and other high mass flow applications.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">High speed and high mass flow valve release mechanisms operate to rapidly open valves for fire suppression and other applications. For fire suppression, high speed valves allow pressurized gas to be released to suppress a fast developing fires or explosions. To achieve rapid valve opening, conventional high speed valves commonly use a large solenoid driven at high current (generally greater than 10 amps). Additionally, several components such as a collet that restrains a poppet must be fabricated to exacting tolerances and placed with precise separations relative to other components to allow for rapid opening of the valve. To achieve such precise separation of components, several critical manual adjustments must be performed during manufacture. Considering the above requirements, conventional high speed valves are expensive to manufacture and can be bulky.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A valve release mechanism has an actuator, a ring, a plurality of ball bearings, and a retainer. The retainer is positioned adjacent an inner diameter of the ring and has a plurality of circumferentially spaced holes therein.

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an exploded view of one embodiment of a high speed valve <b>10</b>. The valve <b>10</b> includes a valve body <b>12</b> that has a main body <b>14</b> and a cover <b>16</b>. Valve <b>10</b> also includes a ring <b>18</b>, ball bearings <b>20</b>, actuator <b>22</b>, a lid <b>24</b>, a retainer <b>26</b>, a bumper <b>28</b> and a poppet <b>30</b>. Main body <b>14</b> includes an aperture <b>32</b> and a circumferential groove <b>34</b>. Ring <b>18</b> includes an actuation pin <b>36</b>. Retainer <b>26</b> includes holes <b>38</b> and indexing pin <b>40</b>. Poppet <b>30</b> includes a groove <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, valve body <b>12</b> of high speed valve <b>10</b> comprises main body <b>14</b> and cover <b>16</b>. Cover <b>16</b> is fastened to main body <b>14</b> to enclose ring <b>18</b> and ball bearings <b>20</b> and other components therebetween. Ring <b>18</b> rests on main body <b>14</b> and is free to rotate through a predetermined angle relative to main body <b>14</b> and cover <b>16</b> when actuated. Similarly, ball bearings <b>20</b> are capable of movement via contact with ring <b>18</b>. Ball bearings <b>20</b> move radially and axially relative to axis of symmetry of main body <b>14</b> and cover <b>16</b>. Actuator <b>22</b> is disposed within cover <b>16</b> and enclosed by lid <b>24</b>. Actuator <b>22</b> is disposed adjacent ring <b>18</b> so as to make contact with pin <b>36</b> when actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Retainer <b>26</b> is disposed within main body <b>14</b> and a portion of retainer <b>26</b> extends upward from main body <b>14</b> into cover <b>16</b>. Retainer <b>26</b> is disposed radially inward of ring <b>18</b>. Ring <b>18</b> is capable of rotation with respect to retainer <b>26</b>. Bumper <b>28</b> contacts an inner portion of retainer <b>26</b> within the main body <b>14</b>. Retainer <b>26</b> and bumper <b>28</b> are adapted with apertures to receive poppet <b>30</b>. Poppet <b>30</b> is able to translate linearly with respect to the retainer <b>26</b>, bumper <b>28</b> and main body <b>14</b> to restrict the flow of fluid through a flow passage (not shown) of main body <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Poppet <b>30</b> is received by apertures in retainer <b>26</b> and bumper <b>28</b> and by aperture <b>32</b> in main body <b>14</b>. The upper portion of poppet <b>30</b> extends from the aperture <b>32</b> and is received in a corresponding aperture (not shown) in cover <b>16</b>. Circumferential groove <b>34</b> extends into the upper portion of main body <b>14</b> around aperture <b>32</b>. Circumferential groove <b>34</b> receives a lower lip portion of ring <b>18</b>, which rides therein. Actuator pin <b>36</b> extends from ring <b>18</b> in both upward and downward directions parallel to poppet <b>30</b> and is received in slots (not shown) in main body <b>14</b> and cover <b>16</b>. Actuator pin <b>36</b> is disposed adjacent actuator <b>22</b> such that it can be contacted thereby when actuator <b>22</b> is actuated.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Retainer <b>26</b> includes a plurality of holes <b>38</b> spaced around the circumference thereof and indexing pin <b>40</b>. As will be discussed subsequently, indexing pin <b>40</b> is received in a clocking hole (not shown) in main body <b>14</b> to align the plurality of holes <b>38</b> relative to ring <b>18</b>. The plurality of holes <b>38</b> receive ball bearings <b>20</b> therein and allow ball bearings <b>20</b> to move to contact either ring <b>18</b> alone or to simultaneously contact ring <b>18</b> and poppet <b>30</b> when poppet <b>30</b> is in a first closed position blocking flow through the flow passage (not shown) of main body <b>14</b>. In particular, when poppet <b>30</b> is in the first closed position, circumferential groove <b>42</b> is vertically aligned with the plurality of holes <b>38</b> in retainer <b>26</b>. Ball bearings <b>20</b> are pressed into groove <b>42</b> by portions of the inner diameter of ring <b>18</b>.

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, aperture <b>32</b> extends vertically through main body <b>14</b> and receives retainer <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) therein. Although not required in all embodiments, optional circumferential groove <b>34</b> extends around aperture <b>32</b> and is sized to receive the lower lip portion of ring <b>18</b>. The bottom of circumferential groove <b>34</b> is disposed below upper surface <b>44</b>. Upper surface <b>44</b> interfaces with cover <b>16</b>. Clocking hole <b>46</b> extends vertically upward adjacent aperture <b>32</b> from an inner portion of main body <b>14</b> into slot <b>48</b>. Clocking hole <b>46</b> receives indexing pin <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of retainer <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) therein. Slot <b>48</b> is sized to receive the lower portion of actuator pin <b>36</b> and allow for travel of actuator pin <b>36</b>. Slot <b>48</b> extends below circumferential groove <b>34</b> to a depth that enables actuator pin <b>36</b> to be received therein. The length of slot <b>48</b> can vary from embodiment to embodiment enabling greater or decreased rotation of ring <b>18</b> between a first position and a second position. When the ring <b>18</b> is in the first position a portion of actuator pin <b>36</b> contacts stop <b>50</b>A. When ring <b>18</b> is actuated, actuator pin <b>36</b> travels along slot <b>48</b> to contact stop <b>50</b>B in the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In the embodiment shown, actuator pin <b>36</b> extends both vertically upward and downward parallel to the axis of symmetry of ring <b>18</b>. Ring <b>18</b> is sized so that the inner diameter thereof is disposed about retainer <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and poppet <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The inner diameter has an array of channels <b>52</b> and lands <b>54</b> interposed thereon. Channels <b>52</b> are sized to act as detents to receive ball bearings <b>20</b> when ring <b>18</b> is actuated to the second position. Lands <b>54</b> are spaced between channels <b>52</b> and project radially further inward toward the axis of symmetry of ring <b>18</b> than channels <b>52</b>. When the ring <b>18</b> is in the first position, lands <b>54</b> contact ball bearings <b>20</b> to press ball bearings <b>20</b> into interference with poppet <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Bottom surface <b>56</b> of cover <b>16</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. Bottom surface <b>56</b> interfaces with upper surface <b>44</b> of main body <b>14</b>. Aperture <b>32</b>A extends into cover <b>16</b> and interfaces with aperture <b>32</b> in main body <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). Aperture <b>32</b>A receives the upper portion of poppet <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and has sufficient depth to allow poppet <b>30</b> to move from the first closed position to the second position. Optional circumferential grooves <b>34</b>A and <b>34</b>AA extend inward from bottom surface <b>56</b> at varying distances. Circumferential groove <b>34</b>A receives an upper portion of ring <b>18</b>, while groove <b>34</b>AA receives an upper portion of retainer <b>26</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) allowing those components to be disposed between the main body <b>14</b> and cover <b>16</b>. Slot <b>48</b>A extends to a greater depth than circumferential groove <b>34</b>AA. This depth enables the upward extending portion of actuator pin <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) to be received therein. Like slot <b>48</b>, the length of slot <b>48</b>A can vary from embodiment to embodiment enabling greater or decreased rotation of ring <b>18</b> between the first position and the second position depending on the number of ball bearings <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). More particularly, when the ring <b>18</b> is in the first position a portion of actuator pin <b>36</b> contacts stop <b>50</b>AA. When ring <b>18</b> is actuated, actuator pin <b>36</b> travels along slot <b>48</b>A to contact stop <b>50</b>BB in the second position.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> illustrate high speed valve <b>10</b> assembled and in the first closed position and a second open position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows high speed valve <b>10</b> with poppet <b>30</b> in the first closed position blocking flow through flow passage <b>43</b>. The piston portion of poppet <b>30</b> can include one or more gaskets <b>58</b> that interface with the sides of flow passage <b>43</b> to provide for better sealing. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, poppet <b>30</b> is positioned so that circumferential groove <b>42</b> is vertically aligned with the plurality of holes <b>38</b> in retainer <b>26</b>. Ball bearings <b>20</b> (only one is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) are pressed into groove <b>42</b> by lands <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) on the inner diameter of ring <b>18</b>. The resulting interference of the ball bearings <b>20</b> with poppet <b>30</b> locks poppet <b>30</b> in the first closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Lands <b>54</b> are aligned to interface with the plurality of holes <b>38</b> and contact ball bearings <b>20</b> by locating ring <b>18</b> precisely relative to retainer <b>26</b>. In particular, indexing pin <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is received in clocking hole <b>46</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) upon installation of retainer <b>26</b> about poppet <b>30</b> in main body <b>14</b>. Indexing pin <b>40</b> acts to fix retainer <b>26</b> with holes <b>38</b> in a stationary position relative ring <b>18</b>. Ring <b>18</b> is located in the first predetermined position adjacent actuator <b>22</b> with lands <b>54</b> aligned to interface the plurality of holes <b>38</b> by stops <b>50</b>A and <b>50</b>AA on the main body <b>14</b> and cover <b>16</b>, respectively. In particular, in the first position actuator pin <b>36</b> contacts stops <b>50</b>A and <b>50</b>AA to position ring <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment, actuator <b>22</b> comprises a pyrotechnic piston actuator as is known in the art. Upon electrical actuation, the pyrotechnic piston actuator undergoes a controlled explosion to quickly extend a piston <b>60</b> at high velocity to contact actuator pin <b>36</b> and drive ring <b>18</b> from the first position to the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, piston <b>60</b> drives actuator pin <b>36</b> along slots <b>48</b> and <b>48</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2C</figref>) to contact stops <b>50</b>B and <b>50</b>BB in the second position. Slots <b>48</b> and <b>48</b>A are sized so as to allow ring <b>18</b> to travel a predetermined angle of rotation to align channels <b>52</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) to interface with the plurality of holes <b>38</b> and receive ball bearings <b>20</b> therein. The predetermined angle may very from embodiment to embodiment. In particular, with lands <b>54</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) removed from contact with ball bearings <b>20</b> in the second position, ball bearings <b>20</b> are moved out of interference with poppet <b>30</b> by pressure within flow passage <b>43</b> from pressurized container. This pressure forces poppet <b>30</b> upward vertically, which ramps ball bearings <b>20</b> downward out of contact with poppet <b>30</b> through the plurality of holes <b>38</b> into channels <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Compared with conventional high speed valves, high speed valve <b>10</b> disclosed herein maintains important design criteria such valve opening time but has a reduced part count and reduced size and weight. High speed valve <b>10</b> eliminates the need for manual adjustment during manufacture associated with the prior art. Additionally, features such as the indexing pin <b>40</b> and stops <b>50</b>A, <b>50</b>B, <b>50</b>AA, and <b>50</b>BB reduce the chances of assembly error and increase reliability of valve <b>10</b>.</p>
