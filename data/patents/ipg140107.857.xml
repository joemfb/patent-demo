<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to engine valvetrain control, and more specifically to control of engine valvetrain systems including cylinder deactivation mechanisms.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This section provides background information related to the present disclosure which is not necessarily prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Engine assemblies may include hydraulically actuated components such as deactivating valve lifters. When air is present in an oil supply passage that provides pressurized oil to the hydraulically actuated device the response time of the device may be effected due to the compressibility of the air-oil mixture within the passage. When the hydraulically actuated device is operated during conditions where air is present within the oil passage, engine operation may be adversely effected.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This section provides a general summary of the disclosure, and is not a comprehensive disclosure of its full scope or all of its features.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method is provided for operating an engine assembly having a hydraulically actuated component. The engine assembly may include an engine structure supporting the hydraulically actuated component and defining an oil passage in fluid communication with the hydraulically actuated component. The method may include providing pressurized oil from a pressurized oil source to the oil passage and determining a first oil pressure measurement within the oil passage a first predetermined time after the providing. The method may further include preventing operation of the hydraulically actuated component when the first oil pressure measurement is below a first predetermined limit, isolating the oil passage from the pressurized oil source after the providing, and determining a second oil pressure measurement within the oil passage a second predetermined time after the isolating when the first oil pressure measurement is above the first predetermined limit. Operation of the hydraulically actuated component may be prevented when the second oil pressure measurement is above a second predetermined limit.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An alternate method is provided for operating an engine assembly having a hydraulically actuated component. The engine assembly may include an engine structure supporting the hydraulically actuated component and defining an oil passage in fluid communication with the hydraulically actuated component and an oil control valve (OCV). The OCV may be in fluid communication with the oil passage and displaceable between first and second positions. The OCV may provide fluid communication between the oil passage and a pressurized oil source when in the first position and may provide fluid communication between the oil passage and an engine oil sump when in the second position. The method may include providing pressurized oil from the pressurized oil source to the oil passage. The providing may include the OCV being in the first position. The method may further include determining a first oil pressure measurement within the oil passage a first predetermined time after the providing, preventing operation of the hydraulically actuated component when the first oil pressure measurement is below a first predetermined limit, and isolating the oil passage from the pressurized oil source after the providing. The isolating may include displacing the OCV being in the second position. A second oil pressure measurement within the oil passage may be determined a second predetermined time after the isolating when the first oil pressure measurement is above the first predetermined limit. Operation of the hydraulically actuated component may be prevented when the second oil pressure measurement is above a second predetermined limit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An alternate method is provided for operating an engine assembly having a deactivating lifter assembly. The engine assembly may include an engine structure supporting the deactivating lifter assembly and defining an oil passage in fluid communication with the lifter assembly, a first cam lobe engaged with the lifter assembly, rotatably supported by the engine structure and including a base region and a lift region, and a first valve supported by the engine structure.

The lifter assembly may be switched from an activated mode to a deactivated mode by the pressurized oil provided to the oil passage by the pressurized oil source. The activated mode may include the first valve being in the seated position when the base region engages the lifter assembly and being displaced from the seated position by the lifter assembly when the lift region engages the lifter assembly. The deactivated mode may include the first valve remaining in the seated position when the lift region of the first cam lobe engages the lifter assembly. The method may include providing pressurized oil from the pressurized oil source to the oil passage and determining a first oil pressure measurement within the oil passage a first predetermined time after the providing. The method may further include preventing operation of the lifter assembly in the deactivated mode when the first oil pressure measurement is below a first predetermined limit, isolating the oil passage from the pressurized oil source after the providing and determining a second oil pressure measurement within the oil passage a second predetermined time after the isolating when the first oil pressure measurement is above the first predetermined limit.

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Examples of the present disclosure will now be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings. The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an engine assembly <b>10</b> may include an engine block <b>12</b>, first and second cylinder heads <b>14</b>, <b>16</b>, and a valvetrain assembly <b>18</b>. The engine block <b>12</b> may define a plurality of cylinder bores <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>e</i>, <b>20</b><i>f</i>, <b>20</b><i>g</i>, <b>20</b><i>h </i>having pistons <b>22</b> disposed therein. The valvetrain assembly <b>18</b> may include deactivating lifter assemblies <b>24</b>, non-deactivating lifter assemblies <b>26</b>, valve actuation assemblies <b>28</b>, intake and exhaust valves <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, a camshaft <b>34</b>, a cylinder deactivation assembly <b>36</b>, and a control module <b>38</b> (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The valve actuation assemblies <b>28</b> may each include a pushrod <b>40</b> and a rocker arm <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">While illustrated as a V-engine with a cam-in-block configuration including eight cylinders, it is understood that the present disclosure applies equally to inline engines, as well as overhead camshaft configurations. In the present non-limiting example, the cylinders <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>f</i>, <b>20</b><i>g </i>may be selectively deactivated. As discussed further below, the cylinder deactivation system <b>36</b> may selectively deactivate the cylinders <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>f</i>, <b>20</b><i>g </i>via the deactivating lifter assemblies <b>24</b>. While four (or half) of the cylinders <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>e</i>, <b>20</b><i>f</i>, <b>20</b><i>g</i>, <b>20</b><i>h </i>are illustrated as being capable of deactivation, the present disclosure applies equally to arrangements where fewer or more of the cylinders <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>, <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>e</i>, <b>20</b><i>f</i>, <b>20</b><i>g</i>, <b>20</b><i>h </i>are capable of deactivation. The present disclosure applies equally to configurations where as few as one and as many as all of the cylinders are capable of being deactivated. Further, it is understood that the present disclosure applies equally to engines having any number of cylinders. The cylinder deactivation assembly <b>36</b> may include valves <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>d</i>, <b>44</b><i>f</i>, <b>44</b><i>g </i>associated with each of the cylinders <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>f</i>, <b>20</b><i>g </i>capable of deactivation. The valves <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>d</i>, <b>44</b><i>f</i>, <b>44</b><i>g </i>may be in fluid communication with a pressurized oil source <b>46</b>. By way of non-limited example, the pressurized oil source <b>46</b> may include an oil pump providing a pressurized oil flow.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref>, the engine block <b>12</b> may define an engine structure defining an opening <b>48</b> housing the deactivating lifter assembly <b>24</b> therein and a passage <b>50</b> providing fluid communication between the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>and the opening <b>48</b>. As discussed above, the present disclosure applies equally to overhead cam configurations. In such configurations, an opening similar to opening <b>48</b> may be located in an engine structure defined by the cylinder head to house a deactivating lifter assembly similar to deactivating lifter assembly <b>24</b>. A single deactivating lifter assembly <b>24</b> and valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>for the intake valve <b>30</b> associated with the cylinder <b>20</b><i>a </i>are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-5</figref> for simplicity. However, it is understood that the description applies equally to the deactivating lifter assemblies <b>24</b> and valves <b>44</b><i>d</i>, <b>44</b><i>f</i>, <b>44</b><i>g </i>associated with each of the other cylinders <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>f</i>, <b>20</b><i>g </i>capable of deactivation, as well as the deactivating lifter assembly <b>24</b> of the cylinder <b>20</b><i>a </i>associated with the exhaust valve <b>32</b>. The engine block <b>12</b> may define an additional opening (not shown) housing the deactivating lifter assembly <b>24</b> associated with the exhaust valve <b>32</b> therein and may additionally include a passage <b>52</b> (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) providing fluid communication between the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>and the lifter assemblies <b>24</b> of both intake and exhaust valves <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of a common cylinder <b>20</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The deactivating lifter assembly <b>24</b> may include a first housing <b>56</b>, a second housing <b>58</b>, a hydraulic lash adjuster <b>60</b>, a locking pin assembly <b>62</b>, a lost motion mechanism <b>64</b>, and a cam follower <b>66</b> coupled to the first housing <b>56</b>. The first housing <b>56</b> may include a first opening <b>68</b> in fluid communication with the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>via the passage <b>50</b> in the engine block <b>12</b> and a second opening <b>70</b> in fluid communication with an additional passage <b>72</b> in the engine block <b>12</b>. The passage <b>72</b> may provide a pressurized oil flow to the second opening <b>70</b>. The second opening <b>70</b> may be in fluid communication with the hydraulic lash adjuster <b>60</b> to maintain engagement between the pushrod <b>40</b> and the deactivating lifter assembly <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The locking pin assembly <b>62</b> may include first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and a biasing member <b>78</b>. The biasing member <b>78</b> may force the locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> away from one another in radially outward directions relative to the first housing <b>56</b>. The second housing <b>58</b> may define an opening <b>80</b> containing the locking pin assembly <b>62</b> therein. The first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may be displaceable between engaged and disengaged positions. In the engaged position (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>), the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> extend radially outward from the second housing <b>58</b> and may be engaged with the first housing <b>56</b>. More specifically, the first locking pin <b>74</b> may extend into the first opening <b>68</b> of the first housing <b>56</b>. In the engaged position, the locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may couple the first and second housings <b>56</b>, <b>58</b> for displacement with one another. In the disengaged position (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>), the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may be displaced radially inward from the first housing <b>56</b> and disengaged therefrom, allowing relative displacement between the first and second housings <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The lost motion mechanism <b>64</b> may include a retaining member <b>82</b> and a biasing member <b>84</b>. The retaining member <b>82</b> may be axially fixed to the second housing <b>58</b> and the biasing member <b>84</b> may engage the retaining member <b>82</b> and the first housing <b>56</b>, biasing the cam follower <b>66</b> into engagement with the camshaft <b>34</b>. A lobe <b>86</b> of the camshaft <b>34</b> may displace the first housing <b>56</b> toward the retaining member <b>82</b> against the force of the biasing member <b>84</b> as a peak <b>88</b> of the lobe <b>86</b> engages the cam follower <b>66</b>. The first housing <b>56</b> may be returned to an initial position by the biasing member <b>84</b> as a base region <b>90</b> of the cam lobe <b>86</b> engages the cam follower <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">When the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are in the engaged position, the lobe <b>86</b> of the camshaft <b>34</b> may displace the second housing <b>58</b>, and therefore the pushrod <b>40</b>, with the first housing <b>56</b> (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) to open the intake valve <b>30</b> based on an engagement between the peak <b>88</b> of the lobe <b>86</b> and the cam follower <b>66</b>. When the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are in the disengaged position, the first housing <b>56</b> may be displaced relative to the second housing <b>58</b> (as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) when the cam follower <b>66</b> is engaged with the peak <b>88</b> of the cam lobe <b>86</b>, preventing opening of the intake valve <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>may selectively switch the deactivating lifter assembly between activated and deactivated modes. In the activated mode, the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are in the engaged position. In the deactivated mode, the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are in the disengaged position. The valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>may selectively switch between the activated and deactivated modes by controlling a fluid supply to the first opening <b>68</b> via the passage <b>50</b>. The valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>may include a solenoid <b>92</b> in communication with the control module <b>38</b> to control valve position based on engine operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When the deactivated mode is desired, the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>may be opened to provide fluid communication between the pressurized oil from the pressurized oil source <b>46</b> and the first opening <b>68</b>. The pressurized oil may force the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> to the disengaged position. When the activated mode is desired, the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>may be closed to isolate the pressurized oil from the first opening <b>68</b> and may provide fluid communication between a vent passage <b>94</b> and the first opening <b>68</b>. When the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>is in fluid communication with the vent passage <b>94</b> (such as an engine oil sump), the force from the oil pressure may be removed from the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>, allowing the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> to be returned to the engaged position by the biasing member <b>78</b>. However, due to the positioning of the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>relative to the passages <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, a volume of oil may remain within and fill the passage <b>50</b> when the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>is in the closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">During engine start-up conditions, the passage <b>50</b> in the engine block <b>12</b> may contain air. Air may be located in the passage <b>50</b> due to the volume of oil discussed above escaping through a radial clearance between the deactivating lifter assemblies <b>24</b> and the opening <b>48</b> after the engine has been shut down. The valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>may be cycled to eliminate the air in the passage <b>50</b>. More specifically, the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>may be actuated between the open and closed positions to force the air out of the passage <b>50</b> using the pressurized oil from the oil pump. The valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>may be actuated to the open position, providing pressurized oil to the passage <b>50</b> in the engine block <b>12</b> to purge air therefrom when the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are unable to be displaced to the disengaged position and/or when the displacement of the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> to the disengaged position does not effect engine operation. The pressurized oil provided to the passage <b>50</b> may force trapped air from the passage <b>50</b> through the radial clearance between the first housing <b>56</b> and the opening <b>48</b> in the engine block <b>12</b> containing the deactivating lifter assembly <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As indicated above, the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may be unable to be displaced to the disengaged position during certain engine operating conditions even when the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>is in the open position providing a pressurized oil supply to the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b>. These engine operating conditions where the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> are unable to be displaced to the disengaged position may include partial lift conditions. The partial lift condition may include an engagement between the lobe <b>86</b> of the camshaft <b>34</b> and the cam follower <b>66</b> corresponding to a lobe region between the base <b>90</b> and the peak <b>88</b>. By way of non-limiting example, a starting point <b>96</b> on the lobe <b>86</b> past the base <b>90</b> may form a starting point for a lift region of the lobe <b>86</b> where disengagement cannot occur and an end point <b>98</b> on the lobe <b>86</b> may form an ending point for a lift region of the lobe <b>86</b> where disengagement cannot occur. The first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may be unable to be displaced from the engaged position to the disengaged position as the lobe <b>86</b> engages the cam follower <b>66</b> from the starting point <b>96</b> to the ending point <b>98</b> in the rotational direction (R).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The starting and ending points <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> may provide a lift condition of the deactivating lifter assembly <b>24</b> that imparts a locking axial force on the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> by the first housing <b>56</b>. The locking axial force may generally produce a frictional engagement between the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> and the first housing <b>56</b> that is unable to be overcome by the force applied to the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> by the pressurized oil source <b>46</b>. As the lobe <b>86</b> engages the cam follower <b>66</b> from the starting point <b>96</b> to the ending point <b>98</b>, the axial force imparted on the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may be greater than or equal to the locking axial force. Therefore, the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>may be actuated to the open position during this time to purge air from the passage <b>50</b> without deactivating the deactivating lifter assembly <b>24</b>. However, as the lobe <b>86</b> engages the cam follower <b>66</b> from the ending point <b>98</b> to the starting point <b>96</b> in the rotational direction (R), the axial force imparted on the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may be below the locking axial force. Therefore, the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> may be displaced to the disengaged position during this time.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As further indicated above, engine operating conditions may exist where the displacement of the first and second locking pins <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> to the disengaged position does not effect engine operation. By way of non-limiting example, these conditions may include non-lift conditions, such as when the base <b>90</b> of the lobe <b>86</b> is engaged with the cam follower <b>66</b>. When the base <b>90</b> is engaged with the cam follower <b>66</b>, there is no lift, regardless of whether the first and second locking pins are in the engaged or disengaged positions. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> graphically illustrates a non-limiting example of conditions where the passages <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> associated with the cylinder <b>20</b><i>a </i>may be purged of air through actuation of the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>to the deactivated mode without deactivating the deactivating lifter assemblies <b>24</b> associated with the intake and exhaust valves <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of cylinder <b>22</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> generally illustrates the intake and exhaust lift stroke for the intake and exhaust valves <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> of cylinder <b>22</b><i>a</i>. The x-axis corresponds to crank angle and the y-axis corresponds to valve lift. The region illustrated as CA<sub>1 </sub>to CA<sub>2 </sub>represents the opportunities for actuating the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>to the deactivated mode to purge air from the passages <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> without deactivating the deactivating lifter assemblies <b>24</b> associated with the intake and exhaust valves <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The engine assembly <b>10</b> may additionally include a pressure sensor <b>100</b> associated with the passages <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. The pressure sensor <b>100</b> may be located in passages <b>50</b> or <b>52</b> associated with the deactivating lifter assemblies <b>24</b> associated with the intake and exhaust valves <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and the valve <b>44</b><i>a</i>. The pressure sensor <b>100</b> may be in communication with the control module <b>38</b> and may provide a signal thereto indicative of the oil pressure within the passages <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. A separate pressure sensor <b>100</b> may be used for each of the cylinders <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>f</i>, <b>20</b><i>g </i>or a single pressure sensor <b>100</b> may be used for one of the cylinders <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>f</i>, <b>20</b><i>g</i>. By way of non-limiting example, a single pressure sensor <b>100</b> may be used for the one of the cylinders <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>f</i>, <b>20</b><i>g </i>having the greatest passage volume between the valve <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>d</i>, <b>44</b><i>g</i>, <b>44</b><i>f </i>and the deactivating lifter assemblies <b>24</b> associated therewith. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> graphically illustrates the pressure conditions sensed by the pressure sensor <b>100</b> to determine the hydraulic stiffness of the passages <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> to ensure the deactivating lifter assembles <b>24</b> are able to produce desired response times, as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, control logic <b>110</b> is illustrated for purging air from the passages <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> by providing oil flow from the valves <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>d</i>, <b>44</b><i>f</i>, <b>44</b><i>g </i>to the deactivating lifter assemblies <b>24</b> associated therewith. Control logic <b>110</b> may be used during a start-up condition of the engine assembly <b>10</b>. For simplicity, the following description of control logic <b>110</b> is directed to the cylinder <b>20</b><i>a</i>, with the understanding that the description applies equally to the cylinders <b>20</b><i>d</i>, <b>20</b><i>f</i>, <b>20</b><i>g</i>. Control logic <b>110</b> may begin at block <b>111</b> where an engine start-up condition is evaluated. If the engine is not in a start-up mode, control logic <b>110</b> may terminate. The start-up mode may generally include conditions such as an initial engine start, as well as conditions where the engine has not operated for a predetermined time and/or conditions where the engine temperature has not reached a predetermined limit.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">If the engine is in a start-up mode, control logic <b>110</b> may proceed to block <b>112</b> where the control module <b>38</b> disables a fuel management mode of the engine assembly <b>10</b>, preventing the engine assembly <b>10</b> from transitioning to the deactivated mode. Control logic <b>110</b> may then proceed to block <b>114</b> where a number of purge cycles (n) stored in the control module <b>38</b> is initialized to zero (n=0). Once the number of purge cycles has been initialized, control logic <b>110</b> may proceed to block <b>116</b> where lift parameters are determined.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The lift parameters may include one or more of engine speed, engine crank angle, and a purge window (W) duration. The purge window (W) duration may generally correspond to a time period and/or crank angle range where actuation of the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>to the open position does not effect engine operation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Control logic <b>110</b> may then determine if the engine assembly <b>10</b> is operating within the purge window (W) at block <b>118</b>. If the engine assembly <b>10</b> is not operating within the purge window (W), control logic <b>110</b> may return to block <b>116</b>.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Once the lift parameters are determined, control logic <b>110</b> may determine if the purge cycle is complete at block <b>124</b>. By way of non-limiting example, the determination may include evaluation of an elapsed operating time and engine speed and/or evaluation of a current crank angle relative to a crank angle range within the purge window (W). If the purge cycle is not complete, control logic <b>110</b> may proceed to block <b>126</b> where the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>is maintained in the open position and then back to block <b>122</b> where lift parameters are again determined. If the purge cycle is complete, control logic <b>110</b> may proceed to block <b>128</b> where the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>is commanded to the closed position, venting the passages <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>. Control logic <b>110</b> may then increment the number of purge cycles (n=n+1) at block <b>130</b>. Control logic <b>110</b> may then evaluate the number of purge cycles (n) relative to a predetermined limit (LIMIT<sub>CYCLE</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">If the number of purge cycles (n) is less than the limit (LIMIT<sub>CYCLE</sub>), control logic <b>110</b> may return to block <b>116</b>, where lift parameters are determined for a subsequent purge cycle. If the number of purge cycles (n) is greater than or equal to the limit (LIMIT<sub>CYCLE</sub>), control logic <b>110</b> may proceed to block <b>134</b>, where the fuel management mode is allowed. Control logic <b>110</b> may then terminate.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the accumulated purge time may be monitored rather than the number of purge cycles to determine whether a sufficient amount of air has been purged from the system. Using the accumulated purge time may generally account for variation in engine speeds where the duration of a purge cycle is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Control logic <b>210</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, may be used during a start-up condition of the engine assembly <b>10</b>.

Control logic <b>310</b> may begin at block <b>312</b> where pressurized oil is provided to the passages <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> at a predetermined time within the engine cycle so as not to change the normal valvetrain sequence. As discussed above, pressurized oil source <b>46</b> may be provided to the passages <b>50</b>, <b>52</b> by actuating the valve <b>44</b><i>a </i>to the open position. Control logic <b>310</b> may then wait a first predetermined time (t<b>1</b>) as indicated at block <b>314</b>.
