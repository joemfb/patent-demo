<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a 371 of PCT/DE2008/001432 filed Aug. 27, 2008, which in turn claims the priority of DE 10 2007 042 254.9 filed Sep. 6, 2007, the priority of both applications is hereby claimed and both applications are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a measurement apparatus for the analysis of a lubricant of a bearing, in particular of a roller bearing or journal bearing, to a bearing, to a seal for a bearing, and to a method for detection and monitoring of the state of a lubricant of a bearing, in particular of a roller bearing or journal bearing.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is known from practice to detect and monitor the state of a lubricant of a bearing, in particular of a roller bearing or journal bearing, and specifically the chemical composition of the lubricant. Changes in the chemical state of the lubricant provide indications of aging processes in the lubricant and indicate when the lubricant must be replaced or replenished.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Within the scope of this application, a &#x201c;lubricant&#x201d; is any lubricating substance which is used for lubrication in a bearing, reduces friction and wear and, in some cases, can also be used to carry out further functions, for example for power transmission between the bearing components, for cooling of the bearing, as corrosion protection, for vibration damping, or else as a sealant.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is known for capacitance measurements to be carried out on the lubricant. However, in this case, layer thicknesses have a major influence on the measurement result. Furthermore, it has been found that the measurement results are widely scattered and are difficult to reproduce. In addition, capacitance measurements provide only an indirect indication of the chemical composition of the lubricant, for example, the measurement results of capacitance measurements are influenced by metallically conductive particles located in the lubricant.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is also known for a sample of the lubricant to be taken from the bearing and to be irradiated by means of electromagnetic radiation, in order to record and to analyze a spectrum of the sample. Particularly known is the IR-spectroscopic analysis of lubricant grease samples outside the bearing, in the spectral range of the middle and/or near infrared (MIR and NIR). The measurement is carried out outside the bearing, that is to say not subject to the specific physical or chemical constraints in the bearing interior. Furthermore, it is complex to take samples, particularly if access to the bearing is difficult and/or the bearing must be shut down for the sample to be taken. Furthermore, the location within the bearing at which the sample has been taken has an influence on the measurement result of the spectroscopy, since the lubricant is a mixture of components which are distributed within the bearing interior during operation of the bearing. Another problem that has been found is that the lubricant ages to a different extent at different locations within the bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">DE 35 10 408 A1 describes an apparatus for monitoring the operating state of bearings. In this case, the instantaneous state of the lubricant of the bearing is determined by providing a trapping device in the immediate vicinity of the bearing, which traps and analyzes lubricant emerging from the bearing. The analysis is restricted to verification of metallic particles which are contained in the lubricant of the bearing, and to the detection of the temperature of the lubricant. No provision is made for any statement relating to the chemical composition of the lubricant in the interior of the bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">DE 93 11 938 U1 describes an apparatus for taking a sample of lubricant, in particular lubricating grease, from a roller bearing. In this case, bores are introduced into the bearing rings of the roller bearing, through each of which lubricating grease samples can be taken. In this case as well, immediate in-situ measurement of the state of the lubricant is impossible.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The object of the invention is to specify a measurement apparatus of the type mentioned initially for a bearing, which apparatus allows real-time information to be obtained about the state of the lubricant located in the bearing.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the invention, this object is achieved for the measurement apparatus mentioned initially for a bearing and for a seal for a bearing and facilitates an exemplary implementation of a method for detection and monitoring of the state of the lubricant of the bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Because the sample area is arranged in the interior of the bearing, there is no need for time-consuming taking of samples; in fact, it offers the opportunity to measure the lubricant in situ, that is to say in the physical or chemical conditions of the bearing interior. This avoids the measurement result being corrupted when samples are taken, and are subsequently transported to the analysis unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The bearing can be monitored continuously during its operation; this monitoring can be carried out in an automated form, for example with an alarm being triggered as soon as the detected spectra depart from a predetermined norm.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The recording of spectra of the electromagnetic radiation originating from the sample quickly provides information about the chemical state of the lubricant. The electromagnetic radiation does not itself influence or change the lubricant; in addition, in contrast to frequent sampling, there is no longer any loss of lubricant which must be replaced. The spectrum itself provides chemical information about the composition of the lubricant, which is largely independent of foreign bodies such as particles contained in the lubricant.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The sample area is preferably arranged on an inner wall of the bearing, in particular on a section of the inner wall of the bearing which is mechanically loaded and for which lubrication is imperative, in order to allow and to maintain the functionality of the bearing. In the case of roller bearings, it is advantageous, for example, to arrange the sample area in the raceway or in the immediate vicinity of the raceway of the roller bodies on one of the two bearing rings, since exactly in the contact zone between the roller bodies and the bearing ring lubrication is required. The arrangement of the sample area is a governing factor for direct information about the actual state of the lubricant; in addition, it is also possible to detect the situation in which there is no longer any lubricant present, or in any case not or no longer where the lubricant is required.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is preferable for reflection, in particular total internal reflection, of the electromagnetic radiation emitted from the transmitter to take place in the sample area. In this case, the reflection spectrum, for example the spectrum in the case of diffuse reflection or the spectrum in the case of total internal reflection, provides the information about the chemical composition of the lubricant. Reflection or total internal reflection as measurement principles for recording spectra has the advantage that it is surface-sensitive and it is possible to reliably detect even only small amounts of the lubricant to be verified. Furthermore, it is possible to prevent electromagnetic radiation from entering the interior of the bearing. In the case of reflection or total internal reflection, it is also possible to arrange the transmitter and receiver adjacent to one another, thus allowing the measurement arrangement to be designed to be physically small.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is preferable for the transmitter, the receiver and the sample area to be combined to form a physical unit, and for the sample area to comprise a boundary surface to the interior of the bearing, on which reflection or total internal reflection occurs. The physical unit can easily and quickly be fitted to and replaced on the bearing; the contact surface between the physical unit is formed only by the boundary surface, whose geometric design or boundary surface material may be optimized for its function for reflection or total internal reflection of the electromagnetic radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The receiver preferably detects and spectrally analyzes the electromagnetic radiation in the infrared range, in particular in the near or middle infrared range. The measurement apparatus is therefore designed in the form of an IR spectrometer. In this case, it has been found to be advantageous for the IR radiation, in particular in NIR or MIR, to excite molecular vibrations in the lubricant, which provide precise information about the chemical condition of characteristic, IR-active groups in the lubricant; on the other hand, in contrast to UV or X-ray beams, IR-beams do not influence the chemical composition of the lubricant. It is also advantageous that a large number of IR-permeable substances have a refractive index which is considerably greater than 1 in the IR range, in particular in the NIR and MIR range, as a result of which the glancing angle at which total internal reflection occurs on a boundary surface, is not very high. In particular, an IR-beam can be injected into an optically dense medium such that total internal reflection occurs on the boundary surfaces to the optically thin medium, for example the interior of the roller bearing with the lubricant, in which case an evanescent field enters the optically thinner medium, and therefore the lubricant, from the optically denser medium, in such a way that the sample area is located in the interior of the bearing and the optically denser medium, specifically the optically denser medium which is in the form of a type of window, is located outside the interior of the bearing. Since neither the optically denser medium nor other parts of the measurement apparatus extend into the interior of the bearing, these do not interfere with the bearing during operation, but allow measurement of the chemical conditions in the interior of the bearing, specifically a chemical analysis of the state of the lubricant, by means of the evanescent field which extends into the interior of the bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">It is particularly preferable for the receiver to detect and analyze the electromagnetic radiation in the region of the combination modes of the C&#x2014;H vibrations. This takes account of the fact that C&#x2014;H vibrations, in particular C&#x2014;H stretching vibrations, have a high absorption coefficient, as a result of which even small amounts or thin layers cause virtually complete absorption in the relevant wavelength range, as a result of which the downstream receiver no longer receives a signal which can be utilized. In the process, especially details of the spectrum, for example the position and strength of individual absorption peaks, drop out for evaluation of the spectrum, as a result of which the information must essentially be restricted to the verification of the C&#x2014;H bonds as such. The absorption coefficient is considerably lower in the range of the C&#x2014;H combination modes; details of the spectrum can be identified here and, if appropriate, the thickness of the layer of the lubricant can be deduced from the magnitude of the absorption. In this case, &#x201c;combination modes&#x201d; means combination modes in the relatively narrow sense as well as harmonic vibrations. For example, for C&#x2014;H stretching vibrations, it is feasible to evaluate the C&#x2014;H combination mode in the range from about 2000 to about 2450 nm, or the first harmonic of said combination mode in the range from about 1350 to about 1450 nm. The range of the first harmonic of the C&#x2014;H stretching vibration can also be evaluated in the range from about 1630 to about 1800 nm, in the same way as the range of the second harmonic of the C&#x2014;H stretching vibration in the range from about 1200 nm. Each of the abovementioned combination modes, harmonic of a combination mode or first or harmonic, offers the advantage of only a low absorption coefficient.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The range of the C&#x2014;H combination modes is therefore particularly appropriate for a method for detection and monitoring the state, specifically the chemical composition, of the lubricant in the bearing. In one preferred embodiment, the method can continuously detect and spectrally analyze the range of the C&#x2014;H combination modes for a bearing at specific times, for example before starting up the bearing or during the operation of the bearing. The spectra therefore offer a time series whose profile corresponds to the aging and degradation of the lubricant. Changes in the chemical composition of the lubricant are reflected in the time series; for example, there may be provision for relating spectra which have been recorded successively in time to one another or to compare them with the spectrum which was recorded before the bearing was started up. By way of example, said method can be carried out using a measurement apparatus as described above; however, it is self-evident that it is likewise possible to provide for samples of the lubricant to be taken from the bearing and for these to be examined spectroscopically outside the bearing, provided that the spectra are recorded and evaluated in the range of the C&#x2014;H combination mode.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The transmitter of the measurement apparatus preferably comprises a diode, in particular an IR diode, which is physically small and has no significant losses resulting from heat emission.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Said measurement apparatus can be arranged both in a bearing and in a seal for a bearing. For example, if the bearing is in the form of a roller bearing, the measurement apparatus may be accommodated as a physical unit in a bore in one of the bearing rings of the roller bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further advantages and features of the invention will become evident from the description of one exemplary embodiment of the invention and from the dependent claims.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The invention will be described and explained in more detail in the following text using one preferred exemplary embodiment and with reference to the attached drawing.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a measurement apparatus for analysis of the chemical composition of a lubricant <b>1</b> of a bearing, part of which is illustrated, and which is in the form of a roller bearing <b>2</b>. The roller bearing <b>2</b> comprises an outer ring <b>3</b>, part of which is illustrated, as well as roller bodies <b>4</b> which are arranged in the interior <b>5</b> of the roller bearing <b>2</b> and roll on a raceway <b>6</b> on the inside of the outer ring <b>3</b>. The lubricant <b>1</b> is located at least partly in the area of the raceway <b>6</b> for the roller bodies <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The measurement apparatus comprises a transmitter <b>7</b> which is in the form of IR-diodes, as well as a sample area <b>8</b>, on an IR-permeable window <b>10</b> which forms a boundary surface <b>9</b> with the interior <b>5</b> of the roller bearing <b>2</b>. The lubricant <b>1</b> lies partially on the boundary surface <b>9</b> in the area of the sample area <b>8</b>. The boundary surface <b>9</b> is curved, with the curvature of the boundary surface <b>9</b> corresponding to the inside of the outer ring <b>3</b> in the area of the raceway <b>6</b>. The boundary surface <b>9</b> represents a section of an inner wall of the roller bearing <b>2</b>. That area of the boundary surface <b>9</b> which is coated with the lubricant <b>1</b> and faces the interior <b>5</b> of the roller bearing <b>2</b> forms the sample area <b>8</b>, which is interspersed with the IR radiation. The roller bodies <b>4</b> cross over from the raceway <b>6</b> onto the boundary surface <b>9</b> and then again over to the raceway <b>6</b>, whereby they are conveying lubricant <b>1</b> on the boundary surface <b>9</b>. The lubricant <b>1</b> on the boundary surface <b>9</b> prevents excessive friction of the roller bodies <b>4</b> on the boundary surface <b>9</b> and compensates for differences in the coefficient of friction between the area of the raceway <b>6</b> and of the boundary surface <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The input of the transmitters <b>7</b>, two of which are illustrated, is coupled to an outward-facing side <b>11</b> of the window <b>10</b>. The transmitters <b>7</b> are arranged in an annular shape around a receiver <b>12</b>. The FIGURE also shows a unit for signal processing <b>13</b>, which is connected downstream from the receiver <b>12</b>. In particular, the signal processing may comprise electronic correction of the temperatures amongst which various spectra were recorded, and for this purpose process the signal from a temperature measurement unit, which is not illustrated. The receiver <b>12</b> is designed such that it can respond in the NIR and MIR ranges, and can produce a spectrum of the lubricant <b>9</b> that is located in the sample area <b>8</b>. In particular, said spectral range also includes the range of the combination modes of C&#x2014;H vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The transmitters <b>7</b>, the receiver <b>12</b> and the window <b>11</b> having the boundary surface <b>9</b> which is adjacent to the sample area <b>8</b> in the interior <b>5</b> of the roller bearing <b>2</b> form a physical unit <b>14</b>, which is essentially in the form of a rod and is arranged in a bore in the wall surface of the outer ring <b>3</b> such that the boundary surface <b>9</b> terminates essentially flush with the inside of the outer ring <b>3</b>, such that the sample area <b>8</b> of the measurement apparatus, that is to say the area between the transmitter <b>7</b> and the receiver <b>12</b>, which area has the sample to be analyzed, is arranged in the interior <b>5</b> of the roller bearing <b>2</b>, specifically on an inner wall of the outer ring <b>3</b> of the roller bearing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The invention now functions as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The transmitters <b>7</b> transmit electromagnetic radiation which also has a component in the MIR and NIR. The output of the transmitters <b>7</b> is coupled to the inside <b>11</b> of the window <b>10</b>, and is reflected back and forth between the inside <b>11</b> and boundary surface <b>9</b>. In this case, the material of the window <b>10</b> is chosen such that the beam which is located in the window <b>10</b> strikes the boundary surface <b>9</b> at an angle of about 45&#xb0;, thus resulting in total internal reflection. When it is totally internally reflected, the beam does not enter the interior <b>5</b> of the roller bearing <b>2</b> but, in the area of the lubricant, forms an evanescent field, which decays exponentially as the distance from the boundary surface <b>9</b> increases. In the area of the evanescent field, that is to say in the subsection of the interior <b>5</b> of the roller bearing <b>2</b> which is directly adjacent to the boundary surface <b>9</b>, the evanescent field is partially absorbed by C&#x2014;H bonds in the lubricant <b>1</b>. In particular, the evanescent field covers the sample area <b>8</b> in the interior of the roller bearing <b>2</b>. The field which is received by the receiver <b>12</b> on the outward-facing side <b>11</b> of the window <b>10</b> is thus attenuated by the amount absorbed in the sample area <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The receiver <b>12</b> analyzes the beam spectroscopically; in this case, virtually complete absorption occurs in the range of the C&#x2014;H stretching vibration, which does not indicate any spectral details. In the range of the C&#x2014;H combination modes, individual absorption lines can be seen which make it possible to deduce the chemical composition of the lubricant <b>1</b>. In particular, the receiver <b>12</b> determines a spectrum of the beam passing through the sample area <b>8</b> in the range of the combination modes, specifically the second harmonic of the C&#x2014;H stretching vibration, that is to say for wavelengths of about 1200 nm in the range of the NIR (wavelength range from 800 to 2500 nm; with MIR corresponding to a wavelength range from 2500 to 50 000 nm).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When the receiver <b>12</b> records a spectrum at different times, the aging of the lubricant <b>1</b> can be tracked spectroscopically, and the state of the lubricant <b>1</b> in the interior <b>5</b> of the roller bearing <b>2</b> can be monitored. On the basis of the intensity of the characteristic absorption lines of the C&#x2014;H vibrations, and of their combination modes as well, it is possible to determine whether there is sufficient lubricant <b>1</b>, and furthermore, the chemical composition of the lubricant <b>1</b>. Changes in the spectra can be determined by comparison of the spectra, for example by matching norm spectra, making it possible to deduce the time when the lubricant <b>1</b> will be consumed and/or its chemical composition is changed, and when it must be replaced at the latest.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the case of the exemplary embodiment described above, the boundary surface <b>9</b> of the window <b>10</b> was curved, while the outward-facing side <b>11</b> of the window <b>10</b> was flat. It is self-evident that the boundary surface <b>9</b> can likewise be flat and it can be parallel to the outward-facing side <b>11</b> of the window <b>10</b>, such that the reflection of the IR beam in the window <b>10</b> takes place between two plane-parallel surfaces <b>9</b>, <b>11</b>. An arrangement of the surfaces <b>9</b>, <b>11</b> such as this corresponds to a typical ATR geometry. In this case, &#x201c;ATR&#x201d; (attenuated total reflection) means a measurement principle based on frustrated total internal reflection with a sample structure in which a beam is injected into an optically denser material and is totally internally reflected in the optically denser material between boundary surfaces to an optically thinner material, in which case, whenever total internal reflection occurs, a sample, which is located in the area of the optically thinner material adjacent to the boundary surface, is measured. The window <b>10</b> with the two plane-parallel surfaces <b>9</b>, <b>11</b> may in this case be arranged in the raceway of the roller bodies <b>4</b> or at the side, alongside the raceway of the roller bodies <b>4</b>, with the latter arrangement offering the advantage that the roller bodies <b>4</b> do not mechanically load the window <b>10</b>, but at the same time, by means of the lubricant which is forced sideways onto the window <b>10</b>, offers the capability to chemically analyze the lubricant.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the case of the exemplary embodiment described above, the curved boundary surface <b>9</b> terminated essentially with the adjacent inner surface of the outer ring <b>3</b>. It is self-evident that the boundary surface may be at a distance from the adjacent surface of the outer ring or inner ring, thus creating a depression in which the lubricant can gather, and the lubricant, which is located in the depression, can be chemically analyzed at the window <b>10</b>, which then has a flat boundary surface <b>9</b>. The depression may be arranged in the raceway of the roller bodies <b>4</b> or&#x2014;preferably&#x2014;at the side alongside the raceway of the roller bodies <b>4</b>, with the roller bodies <b>4</b> continuously feeding lubricant into the depression. The sample area <b>8</b> is then located in the depression, that is to say in the interior <b>5</b> of the roller bearing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the case of the exemplary embodiment described above, the physical unit <b>14</b> which is formed from the transmitter <b>7</b>, the receiver <b>12</b> and the window <b>10</b> together with the boundary surface <b>9</b> was arranged fixed in a bore in the body of the outer ring <b>3</b>. It is self-evident that the physical unit <b>14</b>, or only the window <b>10</b> together with the boundary surface <b>9</b>, may also be displaceably arranged in the bore, for example such that whenever a roller body <b>4</b> rolls over the unit <b>14</b> or the window <b>10</b>, this presses away from the interior <b>5</b> of the bearing <b>2</b> in the bore while, for example, the unit <b>14</b> is prestressed by a spring means in the direction of the interior <b>5</b> of the bearing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The design described above not only allows ATR measurements, but likewise diffuse reflection measurements. In this case, the transmitters <b>7</b> irradiate the sample area <b>8</b> through the window <b>10</b>, with absorption taking place in the lubricating grease, with diffuse reflection. The reflected radiation is gathered in the receiver <b>12</b>, to be precise with that area of the sample area <b>8</b> in particular being evaluated which is immediately opposite the receiver <b>12</b>. Optics may be provided in the receiver <b>12</b>, which gather the reflected radiation and focus it onto an evaluation unit.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The invention was explained above with reference to a measurement apparatus which is physically integrated in the roller bearing <b>2</b>. It is self-evident that the measurement apparatus can likewise be provided for a journal bearing or a joint bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is likewise self-evident that the measurement apparatus may also be fitted in a seal of a bearing. In this case, it is also possible for the transmitter and/or the receiver to be fastened in the body of the seal. In particular, it is possible for the physical unit comprising the transmitter, the receiver and the window together with the boundary surface to be integrated all together in the body of the seal, such that the sample area is arranged in the interior <b>5</b> of the bearing. As an alternative to this, it is possible for said physical unit to be provided in the interior of the bearing, close to the seal and possibly attached to the seal. As another alternative to the two abovementioned arrangements, it is also possible to provide a unit comprising the transmitter and the receiver outside the seal and to provide a light-conducting connection in the body of the seal, such that the radiation of the transmitter is passed through the light-conducting connection into the sample area into the interior <b>5</b> of the bearing, and is passed from the interior <b>5</b> of the bearing through the light-conducting connection to the receiver, where the chemical analysis of the spectrum is carried out. Said unit may in this case be attachable to the seal, but since it is arranged outside the seal, it is independent of the specific configuration of the seal and is suitable for different types of seals. The fastening of the unit to the seal may be detachable, for example as a clip which is fitted to the bearing seal as required. The light-conducting connection may comprise an optical conductor onto whose outward-facing connections said unit may be detachably plugged in the form of a plug module. It is also self-evident that said options for the arrangement of the transmitter and of the receiver on the seal may also be combined, for example such that the transmitter is arranged internally and the receiver externally on the seal, or such that, although the transmitter is attached to the body of the seal, the receiver may, however, be fitted replaceably to the seal, in particular for the situation in which different spectral ranges can be analyzed by means of the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Furthermore, it may be provided to arrange an optical conductor between the sample area <b>8</b> and the transmitter <b>7</b>; the transmitter or the transmitters <b>7</b> may then be provided outside the bearing. An optical conductor may likewise be provided between the sample area <b>8</b> and the receiver <b>12</b>. The sample area <b>8</b> is then formed by the area of the interior <b>5</b> of the bearing which is provided between the output of the optical conductor associated with the transmitter <b>7</b> and the input of the optical conductor associated with the receiver <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is also self-evident that not just C&#x2014;H vibrations but also other modes, such as those of water or, more generally, of O&#x2014;H groups or functional groups of additives, can be detected and analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Where the above text has referred to &#x201c;combination modes&#x201d; it is self-evident that the term &#x201c;combination modes&#x201d; is intended to cover not only combination modes in the direct sense but also harmonic vibrations, be these fundamental vibrations or else combination modes.</p>
