<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">This invention discloses a method of building concrete walls, columns and other vertical or sloped structures using a vertically oriented vibrating screed and utilization of the thixotropic properties of wet concrete. The vertical screed is a simple, inexpensive and highly flexible apparatus that may be used for a wide variety of applications that involve the applying of cementicious material in the construction of a vertical structure. By using highly thixotropic concrete, the vertical screed is able to place concrete and other cementicious materials in a vertical plane much like concrete is placed with vibrating screeds in the horizontal plane. The vertical screed's applications range from applying a thin cementicious coating to placing concrete in a vertical plane to construct a wall or column. The various configurations of the vertical screed range from a small hand held device to a much larger mechanically controlled apparatus.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention discloses a method of casting concrete walls, columns and other vertical or sloped structures using a vertically oriented vibrating screed and utilization of the thixotropic properties of wet concrete. The vertical screed is a simple, inexpensive and highly flexible apparatus that may be used for a wide variety of applications and may be either a hand held or mechanically controlled device. By using a highly thixotropic cementicious material such as concrete, the vertical screed is able to place concrete and other cementicious materials in a vertical plane much like concrete is placed with vibrating screeds in the horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Vibratory screeds are well known in the art for spreading wet concrete in horizontal casting applications such as roads, sidewalks and floor slabs. These screeds are simple devices that have a vibrator attached to a metal plate or tube and are moved horizontally to spread, level and consolidate the wet concrete placed ahead of their forward movement. These screeds are inexpensive, easy to use and come in a variety of sizes and features. However, such a simple vibrating screed does not exist for casting concrete vertically to build a vertical structure.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Walls and other vertical concrete structures have been built with cast-in-place concrete either by using forms, into which wet concrete is cast, or by shotcrete&#x2014;the spraying a concrete mix against a form backboard. In the case of forms, the wet concrete is placed, vibrated and left to set or harden inside the forms. In some forming systems the forms permanently remain in place while in other systems the forms are removed at some point after the concrete has sufficiently hardened. In those systems where the forms are removed, some are removed after a day or two while in other systems the forms are moved in a matter of minutes which is a process known as slip forming. In most slip forming processes and in the shotcrete process the finished concrete is exposed well before it reaches its final set.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the slip forming process forms are moved by being &#x201c;slipped&#x201d; along the freshly placed concrete and thereby exposing the concrete within a matter of minutes or hours after being cast. This may be done in either a horizontal or a vertical movement and the prior art discloses either one or the other but not the flexibility to switch from a horizontal to vertical movement as may be desirable from application to application. In addition, the slip form prior art are also highly inflexible apart from casting a specific type of wall within limited dimensions and shapes. For example an apparatus capable of casting a tapered road barrier wall is incapable of casting a tall and thin building wall.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is no prior art that is capable of casting a wide variety of vertical structures ranging from thin walls to thick columns and irregular shapes. There is no prior art that can vary the thickness of the cementicious material applied to these structures and ranging from a thin coating to a reinforced concrete thickness of 24&#x2033; or more. Moreover there is no slip form prior art flexible enough to cast composite structures such as insulated concrete walls and that can also be used to apply concrete to thin shelled, ferrocement structures. Nor is there any prior art slip forming apparatuses with the flexibility to cast from only one-side or from multiple sides or in a sloped position in order to cast vertical walls, columns and sloped roofs.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The prior art slip forming systems for casting building walls are large, expensive and cumbersome forming machines or systems with a multitude of jacks or winches. Most of the prior art requires two or more forms that must be used in unison and further require either applying pressure to the concrete, utilizing accelerators for rapid hardening or keeping the forms in place for a short period of time to allow the concrete to set. In addition, the prior art that discloses slip forms for road barrier walls depend, primarily upon casting short and stocky or taller tapered walls and it is the wall's profile that enables the wet concrete to retain its shape as the slip form passes by.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">None of the prior art discloses a reliance upon the thixotropic properties of no-slump concrete as a basis to the concrete retaining its shape as the slip form passes by. And none of the prior art can be downsized to an inexpensive hand held apparatus that can perform the same functions as a much larger mechanically operated apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The prior art slip forms that are based upon a one-sided forming system either require the cementicious material to sufficiently hardened before the forms are moved or uses the shotcrete process. The shotcrete process of placing concrete uses air pressure and a gun or nozzle to impinge wet concrete in thin layers against a vertical form/backstop with successive layers built-up to the desired thickness. The thin layers and air pressure dissipates most of the hydrostatic pressure that is ordinarily created with vertical stacking of wet concrete. The result is minimal sagging and the ability to hand trowel it to a smooth, vertical surface within minutes after the final layer has been applied. Shotcrete is a more expensive system due to the material waste caused by the rebounding sprayed concrete, safety precautions related to a spraying operation and the hand labor required to work the sprayed concrete into an acceptable finish.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">While there is no prior art of vertical vibrating screeds, there are vibrating trowels that are used to finish either vertically or horizontally placed concrete. The vibrating trowels do not place the concrete or vibrate the full depth of the concrete, but rather vibrate the surface area to produce a better finish and appearance.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is a simple, low cost and highly flexible alternative to slip forms and shotcrete. It can be used to cast any type, size and shape of solid or composite vertical or sloped concrete structure. In its most simplified design, the present invention is a small, inexpensive handheld vibrating screed that places, consolidates, shapes and finishes concrete or other cementicious material in a vertical manner so as to construct building walls or to apply a thin coating to a wall or other vertically oriented structure. In its more elaborate design, the present invention does these same activities, although in a larger and highly mechanized apparatus. Such a large mechanical device can place hundreds of square feet of area per hour to build walls, columns and other vertical structures or place concrete on roofs, embankments and other sloped structures.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention is able to screed concrete vertically while being vibrated because it utilizes the thixotropy of low-slump concrete. Thixotropy is a material property that describes a material as being in a solid state when at rest and becoming liquefied while being agitated. Thixotropy is a property of freshly mixed zero-slump, no-slump or low-slump concrete in that this type of concrete is in a solid state, similar to moist, clumpy dirt, when at rest and becomes liquefied when vibrated. Therefore, concrete and other cementicious materials with a zero-slump, no-slump or low-slump are said to be highly thixotropic. Relative to the present invention, this material property enables the no-slump or low slump concrete to be consolidated, spread, shaped and molded in a liquefied state through vibration by the screed and then to immediately revert to a solid state once the vibration ceases as the moving screed passes by. When in a solid state, the no-slump, concrete exerts no hydrostatic pressure which enables it to hold its shape while other wet concrete is being stacked vertically above it, no matter what the wall height or thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">An important aspect of this invention is that it is the only concrete placing machine that enables concrete to be inexpensively placed in a vertical plane much like concrete is inexpensively placed in a horizontal plane. In both applications, a vibrating screed liquefies, consolidates, spreads and levels the fresh concrete against a stay-in-place or removable form. The primary difference is at the concrete used in the vertical application must have a high degree of thixotropic behavior that is found in low or no-slump concrete whereas the concrete used in horizontal castings typically uses a much higher slump of concrete. This difference in the concrete slump requires certain modifications to the vibration to ensure the no-slump concrete is adequately consolidated, shaped and finished.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment of this invention, the vibrating screed is vertically oriented and is used to place highly thixotropic concrete, in a vertical plane to cast walls, columns and other vertical structures in a wide variety of thicknesses, shapes and sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another embodiment of this invention the vertical screed is a simple, inexpensive and highly flexible apparatus that can be configured for use as either a small hand held device or a larger, mechanically operated apparatus capable of placing several hundred square feet of area per hour.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In another embodiment of this invention, the vertical screed may be mounted on tracks or a mechanical arm and used to stabilize and move the screed in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In another embodiment of this invention, sensors and other mechanical or manual means are used to guide the vertical screed in a predetermined path and apply the appropriate thickness of material needed for a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In another embodiment of this invention the vertical screed is used to place concrete to cast a sloped structure such as a sloped roof or embankment.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In another embodiment of this invention, the vertical screed has a degree of flexibility that it can be used to place concrete on one side of a vertical structure such as a composite wall or on multiple sides of a vertical structure such as a column.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In another embodiment of this invention a mesh is used to support the cementicious material and the use of several layers of wire mesh enables the construction of thin walled ferrocement structures by using this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In another embodiment of this invention additives may be added prior to or during the placement of the cementicious material to achieve a variety of desired effects.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Other objects, advantages and features of my invention will be self evident to those skilled in the art as more thoroughly described below.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION ACCORDING TO THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The present invention discloses a method of casting concrete walls, columns and other vertical structures or sloped structures such as roofs, by use of a vertically oriented screed and utilization of the thixotropic properties of wet concrete. Freshly mixed concrete and other cementicious materials that have a zero-slump, no-slump or low-slump all contain a high degree of thixotropy and are thereby highly thixotropic. Throughout the following detailed description the term low-slump concrete shall include zero-slump and no-slump concrete and shall also refer to other highly thixotropic cementicious materials. In addition, the term vertical shall include anything sloped so that a vertical structure includes a sloped structure such as a sloped roof and vertically oriented includes a slope.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the vertical screed <b>10</b> placing low-slump concrete <b>11</b> into a vertically oriented casting area <b>26</b> bordered by a vertically oriented screed face <b>15</b> of the vertical screed <b>10</b> on the open side and a vertically oriented form <b>12</b> positioned a predetermined space apart from the vertical screed <b>10</b> on the opposite side. The concrete <b>11</b> is cast into a hopper <b>14</b> that is generally above the screed face <b>15</b> and is used to feed concrete <b>11</b> into the casting area <b>26</b>. The hopper <b>14</b> has one or more openings to receive the concrete <b>11</b> and one or more openings to feed the concrete <b>11</b> into the casting area <b>26</b>. The hopper <b>14</b> may also have one or more movable sides not shown) to enable an adjustable width to accommodate different pass widths.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As the vertical screed <b>10</b> is moved, the concrete <b>11</b> falls from the hopper <b>14</b> into the casting area <b>26</b> and against the form <b>12</b> that provides a backstop, and fills the casting area <b>26</b> between the screed face <b>15</b> and the form <b>12</b>. Once the low-slump concrete <b>11</b> is in the casting area <b>26</b>, it is vibrated by a vibrator <b>20</b> attached to the backside of the screed face <b>15</b> as a means for liquefying, consolidating and spreading the concrete <b>11</b> to fill the casting area <b>26</b> between the screed face <b>15</b> and the form <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The vertical screed <b>10</b>, with its screed face <b>15</b> and vibrator <b>20</b> acts to liquefy, consolidate and spread the low-slump concrete <b>11</b> against the form <b>12</b> and around the steel reinforcement <b>19</b> to produce a solid concrete structure with an outside face <b>17</b> of a concrete wall <b>18</b>. Immediately below the vertical screed <b>10</b> is a slip-form <b>16</b> that extends and finishes the forming function of the screed face <b>15</b>. The slip form <b>16</b> is in the same plane as the screed face <b>15</b> and does not vibrate or has minimal vibrations so as to allow the recently cast low-slump concrete <b>11</b> to revert to its solid state while retaining the shape produced by the screed face <b>15</b>. The slip form <b>16</b> provides the concrete <b>11</b> a transition from its liquefied state, as caused by the intense vibrations on the concrete <b>11</b> produced by the screed face <b>15</b>, to its exposed, unsupported and finished solid state. The slip form <b>16</b> also provides the desired finish to the outside face <b>17</b> and may be directly or indirectly attached to the vertical screed <b>10</b> or it may be a separate device that trails the vertical screed <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">One embodiment of the invention is to utilize the thixotropic properties of low-slump concrete. Thixotropy is a material property that describes a material that is in a solid state when at rest and a liquid state while being agitated. The thixotropic property of freshly mixed low-slump concrete is such that it is in a solid state after mixing, liquefies during vibration and immediately reverts back to a solid state when the vibration ceases. Specifically, upon mixing and during placement, the low-slump concrete is similar to moist clumpy dirt and, as it is vibrated by the screed, it is liquefied into a cookie dough-like material that flows and fills the contained space. When vibration ceases, the concrete immediately reverts back to its solid state, which is now a consolidated, shaped and solid structure. In addition, the low-slump concrete exerts little or no hydrostatic pressure when in its solid state which enables it to hold its post-vibration shape despite additional wet concrete stacked on top of it. Additives may be added to the concrete and/or heat, pressure or other mechanical means may by used by the vertical screed <b>10</b> or form <b>12</b> to induce an even faster set time.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a hand held configuration of the invention which is a vertical screed <b>10</b> consisting of a generally rectangular, flat surfaced screed face <b>15</b> positioned perpendicular to the ground and parallel to the face of the wall or column to be cast with cementicious material. The screed face <b>15</b> has a vibrator <b>20</b> or similar mechanical device attached to it's backside so that it will vibrate or otherwise cause motions to the screed face <b>15</b> that can be transmitted to the concrete <b>11</b> as it comes into contact with the screed face <b>15</b>. The vibrator <b>20</b> may be any type of mechanical device that vibrates, tamps, packs, rolls, spins, oscillates, compresses or otherwise provides a means for liquefying, consolidating and spreading the concrete <b>11</b> as it comes into contact with the screed face <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In one embodiment the means for liquefying, consolidating and spreading the concrete is caused by directional vibrations extending from the screed face <b>15</b> into the adjacent concrete <b>11</b> and continuing through the concrete <b>11</b> until reaching the form <b>12</b> against which the concrete <b>11</b> is vibrated. The concrete <b>11</b> cast into the casting area <b>26</b> is vibrated to liquefy, consolidate and spread only within the casting area <b>26</b>. There are a variety of directional vibrators that may be attached to the screed face <b>15</b> and are well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">While the entire screed face <b>15</b> vibrates, the vibrations may be stronger at some locations and less or even minimal in others. For example, the vibrations at the bottom of the screed face <b>15</b> may be minimal so as to facilitate the transition of the concrete from the screed face <b>15</b> to the trailing slip form <b>16</b> or the slip form <b>16</b> may be a non-vibrating or minimally vibrating area of the screed face <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition the vibrations at the top of the screed face <b>15</b> may have a different amplitude or frequency than the vibrations at the bottom of the screed face <b>15</b>. This could be accomplished by having vertically stacked directional vibrators attached to the screed face <b>15</b> (not shown) A frame <b>25</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may be used to hold the hopper <b>14</b>, screed face <b>15</b> and slip form <b>16</b> together while providing a means for minimizing or eliminating the vibrations to the hopper <b>14</b> and/or slip form <b>16</b>. The minimally or non-vibrating slip form <b>16</b> provides a transition of the vibrated concrete immediately above to the formless concrete immediately below.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows the edge barrier <b>23</b> which extends perpendicular from the edge of the screed face <b>15</b> and slip form <b>16</b> a set distance toward the form <b>12</b>. The edge barrier <b>23</b> provides a side form against which the concrete <b>11</b> is vibrated so as to facilitate better consolidation and complete spreading of the concrete along the edge of the pass.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is the vibrator <b>20</b> attached to a frame <b>25</b> that is attached to the back side of the screed face <b>15</b> such that the vibrations extend through the frame <b>25</b> to the screed face <b>15</b>. In the hand held configuration, the handle <b>21</b> is used as a means for supporting and guiding the vertical screed <b>10</b>, in a predetermined direction and a predetermined distance from the form <b>12</b>. An optional laser or other positioning sensor <b>24</b> may be attached to the frame <b>25</b> and used to as a means for guiding or otherwise assist in achieving both a proper concrete thickness and constructing a straight and plumb or some other type of shaped concrete structure.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is the backside of one configuration of the vertical screed <b>10</b> and shows two vibrators <b>20</b> that are attached to the frame <b>25</b> of the vertical screed <b>10</b>. One or more vibrators <b>20</b> are necessary for each vertical screed <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the front of the vertical screed <b>10</b> and the screed face <b>15</b> with the slip form <b>16</b> at the bottom. In this configuration the hopper <b>14</b> is open to the top, to receive concrete <b>11</b> and also open to the front to allow the concrete <b>11</b> to be gravity fed as a means for casting the concrete into the casting area <b>26</b> between the vertical screed <b>10</b> and the form <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> is the seam form <b>22</b> that is an extension of the screed face <b>15</b> and the slip form <b>16</b> beyond one side of the hopper <b>14</b>. This lateral extension consolidates the concrete from the present pass with the adjoining concrete from the previous pass and thereby provides a means for eliminating seams between the two adjacent screed passes to produce a monolithic structure. As the vertical screed <b>10</b> makes a successive pass, the seam form <b>22</b> overlaps the edge of the concrete <b>11</b> placed in the previous pass to vibrate, consolidate and slip form the still plastic concrete with and into the fresh concrete being placed in the present pass and thereby eliminate any seam between the two passes. When the seam form <b>22</b> is used, it extends the screed face <b>15</b> laterally which causes the casting area <b>26</b> to be enlarged.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In another configuration of this invention one or more variable speed vibrators may be used to increase the flexibility of the invention. For example one vibrator of a multi-vibrator screed may be set to produce a high amplitude and/or frequency to vibrate a deeper area of a wall while an adjacent vibrator may be set with lower amplitude and/or frequency to vibrate a much thinner adjacent wall section. In addition, the seam form <b>22</b>, edge barrier <b>23</b>, hopper <b>14</b> and slip form <b>16</b> may be disconnected from the vertical screed <b>10</b> to provide it with greater flexibility to place and finish the concrete. For example the vertical screed <b>10</b>, after disconnecting some or all of the above parts, may be used as a vibrating trowel to work the surface area of the vertical structure or fill concrete into small voids.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The screed face <b>15</b> may have a flat, concave or convex surface or it may have a moving object built into it so as to shape the concrete <b>11</b> as the screed face <b>15</b> passes by. The screed face <b>15</b> may also be three dimensional with curved or rectangular shapes as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5C</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> a rectangular protrusion <b>30</b> is shown on the outside face <b>17</b> of the wall <b>18</b> as created by the vertical screed <b>10</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows a curved protrusion <b>31</b> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref> shows a rectangular indentation <b>32</b> both created by the screed face <b>15</b> on the outside face <b>17</b> of the wall <b>18</b>. The screed may also provide any type of finished surface including smooth, textured or rough depending upon at least a portion of the screed face <b>15</b> and the trailing slip form <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">To cast a wall, column or similar vertical structure, a vertically oriented backstop is positioned on one side of the casting area <b>26</b>. The backstop is a surface against which the concrete is cast and vibrated or otherwise liquefied, consolidated and spread by the vertical screed <b>10</b> and its vertically oriented screed face <b>15</b> positioned opposite the backstop, on the other side of the casting area <b>26</b>. The backstop may be a form <b>12</b> and may be either a stay-in-place or a removable type. For example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the form <b>12</b> is an insulation board <b>13</b> that will remain in place and permanently bond to the concrete <b>11</b> to produce a composite insulated concrete wall <b>18</b>. In other applications the form <b>12</b> may be conventional removable forms well known to the art and adapted to function as one-sided forms.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The hand held configuration of the vertical screed <b>10</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> as making a second vertical pass up the wall <b>18</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a section side view of a wall being cast with the vertical screed and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a front view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the first vertical pass <b>33</b> has been made up the entire height of the wall <b>18</b> and a second, successive vertical pass is in progress with the vertical screed <b>10</b> placing the fresh concrete <b>11</b> adjacent to the first pass <b>33</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the unfinished edge <b>34</b> from the first pass <b>33</b> is being joined together with the concrete <b>11</b> of the second pass by the seam form <b>22</b> that vibrates, consolidates and slip forms the concrete from both passes. In a like manner, if the screed moves horizontally, a successive horizontal pass is consolidated and finished with the top edge of the prior horizontal pass to produce a seamless monolithic wall slab.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> also show the concrete reinforcement <b>19</b> which may be welded wire fabric or steel rebar, although any type of reinforcement, including fibers, may be used. Concrete <b>11</b> may be fed into the hopper <b>14</b> or in front of the vertical screed <b>10</b> by any means that can move low slump concrete <b>11</b> including a scope, bucket, auger, conveyor and a pump. In addition, the concrete may be spread inside the hopper <b>14</b> to achieve a more even distribution by any means including manually, with an auger or with some other mechanical spreading device.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The vertical screed <b>10</b> may be used vertically as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> from the bottom up with a single pass to complete a section of the wall. The vertical screed <b>10</b> may be used to dispose a single layer of the cementicious material or it may be used to place multiple layers of the same or different cementicious material in one or more passes. The screed may also be used with different screed faces <b>15</b> or trailing slip forms <b>16</b> to produce different cementicious surface finishes. The vertical screed <b>10</b> may also be used to cast straight, curved or tapered profiles of almost any thickness and can accommodate any type of cementicious reinforcement material.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As a means for supporting and guiding the vertical screed <b>10</b> in a predetermined direction while maintaining a predetermined distance from the from <b>12</b>, it may be hand held or it may be mechanically supported and guided by one or more tracks or other mechanical means including cables, mechanical arms, cylinders and platforms. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a vertical track <b>51</b> to which the vertical screed <b>10</b> is attached. In this configuration there are two tracks <b>51</b>, one on either side of the vertical screed <b>10</b> which slides up and down the tracks <b>51</b> by manually guiding the handle <b>21</b>. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> the tracks <b>51</b> may have a means for attaching to the foundation or slab <b>53</b> at the bottom and at the top to a form <b>40</b> through mounts <b>54</b>. These secured mounts <b>54</b> or other means for attaching the tracks <b>51</b> at the top and the bottom of the concrete structure will ensure a straight and rigid support to the tracks <b>51</b> on which the vertical screed <b>10</b> is guided.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows another configuration of this invention whereby a four-legged vertical track <b>51</b> is used to support and guide the vertical screed <b>10</b>. A top support frame <b>48</b>, a bottom support frame <b>49</b> and a screed frame <b>25</b> are all mounted on two pairs of tracks <b>51</b>, a pair one each side of the vertical screed <b>10</b>. The vertical screed <b>10</b> assembly slides up and down the vertical tracks <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The vertical screed must be guided in terms of both its direction and in maintaining a predetermined distance between the vertical screed and the form. The means for supporting and/or guiding the vertical screed in this manner may be done manually or mechanically with tracks or a mechanical arm and may include the use of a sensor <b>24</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a string line, visually and the use of a depth meter.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows another configuration of this invention with a much larger vertical screed <b>10</b> positioned by being attached to vertical support frames. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the top support frame <b>48</b> and the bottom support frame <b>49</b> hold the tracks <b>51</b> together at the top and bottom while the frame <b>25</b> enable the vertical screed <b>10</b> to be mounted upon the tracks <b>51</b> for vertical movement. The tracks <b>51</b> may be of any size and shape and of any material that supports the frame <b>25</b>, vertical screed <b>10</b> and hopper <b>14</b>, either combined or separate, as it is guided in a predetermined direction along the tracks <b>51</b> using various means including manually, winches, cylinders, screw, cogs, crank or other means known to the art. For example an electric winch may be used to pull the vertical screed <b>10</b> and hopper <b>14</b> up one or more round pole tracks <b>51</b>. The track drive mechanism may be powered by any number of means known to the art or operated manually.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In another configuration, the vertical screed <b>10</b> and hopper <b>14</b> may be mounted on one or more tracks <b>51</b> and intermittently repositioned to place the concrete <b>11</b>. For example, instead of placing concrete <b>11</b> in a continuous directional movement, the vertical screed <b>10</b> and hopper <b>14</b> may be held in a predetermined location while the concrete <b>11</b> is placed and once that location is fully placed, then the vertical screed <b>10</b> and hopper <b>14</b> are repositioned to the next location for concrete placement and repeating the process.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The vertical screed <b>10</b> apparatus may also have horizontal tracks <b>52</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> with one or more horizontal tracks <b>52</b> at the base and the top of the structure being cast. The top and bottom support frames <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> respectively, may be mounted on the horizontal tracks <b>52</b> to enable fast and accurate horizontal repositioning to support and guide the vertical screed <b>10</b> and frame <b>25</b> to facilitate the next concrete placement pass. Once a vertical pass is completed, the support frames <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> are unlocked from the horizontal tracks <b>52</b>, and the supporting frames <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> along with the vertical screed <b>10</b> and screed frame <b>25</b>, are slid on the horizontal tracks <b>52</b> to the new position, at which location the support frames <b>48</b> and <b>49</b> are locked or otherwise secured to the track <b>52</b> to support and guide the next pass of the vertical screed <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">To obtain finished and well compacted corners or edges, top forms <b>40</b> and edge forms <b>41</b> may be placed at the outside and top corners or edges and at the window, door and other openings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a top form <b>40</b> and the edge form <b>41</b>. These optional forms act as a barrier against which the concrete <b>11</b> is compacted by the vertical screed <b>10</b> to produce straight, plumb and finished corners and edges.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The present invention may also be used in a configuration that has a slip form or a second vibrating screed as the backstop instead of the form <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows two sets of tracks <b>51</b>A and <b>51</b>B positioned on either side of a wall <b>18</b>. The tracks <b>51</b>A and <b>51</b>B both have top support frames <b>48</b>A and <b>48</b>B and bottom support frames <b>49</b>A and <b>49</b>B respectfully. The vertical screed <b>10</b> and hopper <b>14</b> are attached to a frame <b>25</b>A which is mounted on tracks <b>51</b>A to support and guide vertical movement of the vertical screed <b>10</b>. In this configuration a second slip form <b>58</b> is attached to frame <b>25</b>B which is mounted on tracks <b>51</b>B. This second slip form <b>58</b> and frame <b>25</b>B replaces the form <b>12</b> that was used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and moves vertically in unison with the vertical screed <b>10</b> and frame <b>25</b>A. The concrete <b>11</b> is cast into the casting area <b>26</b> which is bordered by the screed face <b>15</b> on one side and the second slip form <b>58</b> on the opposite side. The concrete <b>11</b> is liquefied, consolidated and spread by the vertical screed <b>10</b> as frames <b>25</b>A and <b>25</b>B move vertically upward and each side of the wall <b>18</b> is respectively finished by the slip form <b>16</b> on one side and the second slip form <b>58</b> on the other side.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Frames <b>25</b>A and <b>25</b>B may be moved separately or together and manually or mechanically with winches, cylinders, screw, cogs, crank or other means know to the art. For example a single hoist may be used to raise both sides or separate hoists may be used to raise each side. In addition, the two tracks <b>51</b>A and <b>51</b>B and their respective support frames may be connected at the top or sides or they may be totally separated as may be desirable in certain situations.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition to being a second slip form <b>58</b>, the backstop of this invention may also be any apparatus that affects the concrete from the second side of the vertical structure. For example the backstop may provide heat to speed the concrete setup and curing or a packing mechanism that packs the concrete from one side while it is vibrated from the other side of the wall or column.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows another configuration where a second vertical screed <b>10</b>B is used as the backstop. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the first screed frame <b>25</b>A has a vertical screed <b>10</b>A, a hopper <b>14</b>A and a slip form <b>16</b>A attached and a second and opposite screed frame <b>25</b>B has a screed <b>10</b>B and a slip form <b>16</b>B attached and may also have an optional hopper attached (not shown). The two screed frames <b>25</b>A and <b>25</b>B are mounted on their respective tracks <b>51</b>A and <b>51</b>B such that the two vertical screeds <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B are positioned with their respective screed faces <b>15</b>A and <b>15</b>B facing each other and bordering the casting area <b>26</b> into which concrete <b>11</b> is cast. In this configuration, the concrete <b>11</b> is fed into the hopper <b>14</b>A from which it is cast into the casting area <b>26</b> between the two vertical screeds <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B and the concrete <b>11</b> is liquefied, consolidated and spread by the vibration motions from both sides. This configuration permits much thicker concrete walls, columns and other vertical structures since the vibrations from each vertical screed need only to affect about half of the concrete <b>11</b> and from only one side of the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The hopper <b>14</b>A is also optional and as an alternative the concrete <b>11</b> could be cast directly into the casting area <b>26</b> between the two vibrating screeds <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B. The purpose of the hopper <b>14</b>A is to cast the concrete <b>11</b> into the casting area <b>26</b> and in some applications the width of the casting area may be sufficiently large to eliminate the need for a hopper.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows a finished wall <b>18</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> with the vertical tracks <b>51</b>A and <b>51</b>B and their respective support frames and vertical screeds moved away from the concrete wall <b>18</b>. Another embodiment of this invention is that the vertical screed has significant flexibility in both the type of vertical structures it can construct and how the vertical structures are cast. For example, the vertical screed can be positioned on one side of the wall only with some type of insulating foam board <b>13</b> positioned on the second side to cast a composite insulated wall as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The vertical screed can also be positioned on two or more sides of a wall or column with the sides all connected to one another to cast a solid concrete structure. Finally, the vertical screed can be positioned independently of the other side(s) with each side positioned separate and apart from the other such as in high walls or columns where the rebar makes it impractical to connect the vertical screed or slip form sides. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the two tracks <b>51</b>A and <b>51</b>B separate and apart, the tracks and respective frames could also be connected to each other at the top or sides.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Another embodiment of this invention is its high degree of flexibility in casting a variety of types, sizes and shapes of vertical structures. In addition to straight walls, columns of all shapes and sizes can be cast from the vertical screed of this invention. For example, one or more vertical screeds <b>10</b> may be positioned on one or more sides of a column with or without forms <b>12</b> set opposite or between the screeds. When done without forms <b>12</b>, the vertical screeds <b>10</b> opposite one another provide another means for providing the backstop. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a top view of a round column <b>55</b> being cast with a single vertical screed <b>10</b> that has eight vibrators <b>20</b> surrounding the column <b>55</b>. The vertical screed <b>10</b> and the vibrators <b>20</b> are supported and guided by a support frame <b>50</b> which travels up the vertical tracks <b>51</b>. The support frame <b>50</b> is anchored at the bottom (not shown) to secure the frame and screed in alignment. The invention may also be used to cast unusually shaped columns such as octagons, crosses, etc., whereby the shape of the screed face(s) <b>15</b> determines the shape of the column or other vertical or sloped structure.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a top view of the vertical screed <b>10</b> used to cast a rectangular shaped column <b>55</b>. In this configuration two vertical screeds <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B are positioned opposite each other and two second slip forms <b>58</b>A and <b>58</b>B are also positioned opposite each other to comprise the four sides of the rectangular column <b>55</b>. As the support frame <b>50</b> moves up the vertical tracks <b>51</b> the concrete (not shown) is vibrated, liquefied, consolidated and spread and a finished rectangular column emerges from the bottom as the vertical screed <b>10</b> moves upward.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In all of the above configurations, the concrete vibration was caused by a vibrating screed that is well known in the art as an external vibrator. In another configuration of the invention, the concrete vibrations are caused by an internal vibrator which is also well known in the art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> shows an internal vibrator <b>56</b> attached to the hopper <b>14</b> that is above a slip form <b>16</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>, concrete <b>11</b> is deposited between slip form <b>16</b> and a second slip form <b>58</b> and the internal vibrator <b>56</b> liquefies, consolidates and spreads the concrete between the slip form <b>16</b> and the second slip form <b>58</b>. As the slip forms travels upward, the exposed finished concrete wall <b>18</b> emerges from below.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The internal vibrators <b>56</b> may be mounted anywhere on the vertical screed <b>10</b> or support frame or on another mechanical apparatus or they may be manually held and used to consolidate the concrete or otherwise work in concert with the slip forms which acts to shape and texture the concrete in this configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In another configuration of the invention, a cylinder <b>57</b> is situated above the concrete and used to deposit, consolidate and spread the concrete <b>11</b>. The cylinder <b>57</b> may simply spin or it may also vibrate or otherwise agitate the concrete. The cylinder <b>57</b> may also have protrusions that extend into the concrete (not shown). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a configuration of a cylinder <b>57</b> located between slip form <b>16</b> and second slip form <b>58</b> and a means by which the cylinder <b>57</b> spreads and consolidates the concrete <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">There are any number of additives that can be used with the concrete and the invention. For example, the additives can be used to lubricate the concrete, as a water reducer or to induce a fast set. The additives may also be added to the concrete mix or injected, sprayed or otherwise applied to the concrete at any time prior to, during or after the vertical screed has placed the concrete.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The vertical screed may be designed such that it performs more than one function as it passes by the concrete. For example the top section of the screed may provide the vibration stage whereby the concrete is liquefied and consolidated. The lower part of the vertical screed or an attachment thereto may provide a second stage such as a mechanical device that packs the concrete and a third part of the screed may act as a slip-form to shape the concrete. Other functions that may be used with the vertical screed include: mixing concrete, placing additives, heating or dehydration and applying concrete finishes.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In another configuration of this invention, wire or plastic mesh or similar materials may be used to support the wet concrete in its vertical position while curing or to construct ferrocement structures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows the wire mesh <b>60</b> attached to the rebar steel reinforcement <b>19</b> by a means for attachment <b>61</b>A that restrains the mesh <b>60</b> and prevents it from moving away from the rebar steel reinforcement <b>19</b>. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> is the mesh <b>60</b> attached to the insulation board <b>13</b> by a means for attachment <b>61</b>B that extends through the insulation board <b>13</b> to which a clip <b>62</b> is attached to prevent the means for attachment <b>61</b>B from being pulled out.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows a front view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> with the addition of the vertical screed <b>10</b> and concrete <b>11</b> that has been placed by the vertical screed <b>10</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> the mesh <b>60</b> has a means for being secured to the rebar <b>19</b>, or the form <b>12</b> and/or the top form and the bottom foundation or other rigid object (not shown). For example mesh <b>60</b> may be attached by a means for attachment to the rebar <b>19</b> and/or the form <b>12</b> such that the mesh <b>60</b> is secured away from the form <b>12</b> and near the front face of the wall <b>18</b> to be cast. As the vertical screed <b>10</b> makes it's pass, concrete <b>11</b> is fed from the hopper <b>14</b> through the opening in the mesh <b>60</b> to fill the casting area <b>26</b> between the form <b>12</b> and the vertical screed <b>10</b> and the concrete <b>11</b> is liquefied, consolidated and spread embedding the mesh <b>60</b>. As the vertical screed <b>10</b> passes by and only the concrete and the embedded mesh <b>60</b> remain, the mesh <b>60</b> acts to support the concrete <b>11</b> in its final vertical position. The inclusion of the mesh <b>60</b> will allow for a higher slump of concrete or provide concrete support and/or reinforcement as may be desired in a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Additionally, the mesh <b>60</b> may be a wire mesh and set in a multitude of layers so as to produce a ferrocement structure when the concrete is applied to it. In this manner, the vertical screed can be used to cast a wire mesh reinforced thin walled concrete structure as is well known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is a section side view of an optional side support <b>70</b> that restrains the wet concrete (not shown) in a vertical position between the mesh <b>60</b> and the form <b>12</b> and provides a means for bonding the concrete placed in one pass to the wet concrete placed in a successive pass. The vertical side support <b>70</b> is a mesh <b>60</b> that supports the side of the concrete <b>11</b> during and after placement to prevent it from falling or slumping to the side. From <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, as the vertical screed <b>10</b> passes, wet concrete <b>11</b> is vibrated against the concrete <b>11</b> being restrained by the first side support <b>70</b>A which has been partially embedded in concrete <b>11</b> from the prior pass. During that same pass, concrete <b>11</b> is also vibrated against the second side support <b>70</b>B that restrains the concrete <b>11</b> from falling to the adjacent open area. As the vertical screed <b>10</b> makes its successive passes, the new concrete <b>11</b> is pushed against the first side support <b>70</b>A and the exposed concrete from the prior pass that is being restrained by the first side support <b>70</b>A is re-vibrated, liquefied and consolidated with the new concrete.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows a vertical screed <b>10</b> placing concrete <b>11</b> to cast a reinforced concrete wall <b>18</b> through a horizontal movement. The horizontal tracks <b>52</b> support the two vertical tracks <b>51</b>A and <b>51</b>B which in turn support the top frame <b>48</b>, the bottom frame <b>49</b> and two screed frames <b>25</b> as the vertical screed <b>10</b> places concrete <b>11</b> while moving in a horizontal direction. After each horizontal pass is completed, the screed frames <b>25</b> are moved up vertically so as to reposition the vertical screed for the next horizontal pass.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In this configuration the screed face <b>15</b> is positioned perpendicular to the ground and parallel to the face of the wall or column being cast with the cementicious material. The only difference is that the vertical screed has been rotated 90 degrees to an upright position so as to more efficiently place the concrete when used in a horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The vertical screeds may be configured to be field modified for use in either the vertical direction or in the horizontal direction. When the same vertical screed used in the vertical direction is modified for use in the horizontal direction, the vertical screed and hopper are rotated 90 degrees. This causes the top and one side of the hopper in the vertical direction to change positions when used in the horizontal direction. Therefore, what used to be the open top of the hopper in the vertical direction is now the side of the hopper in the horizontal direction and must be closed to prevent the concrete from falling out of the hopper. Likewise, what was the closed side of hopper in the vertical direction is now the top of the hopper in the horizontal direction and must be opened to allow concrete to be fed into the hopper.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> shows the vertical screed <b>10</b> and the attached hopper <b>14</b> rotated 90 degrees and what was the hopper top <b>71</b> is now a side and must be closed so as to contain the concrete fed into the hopper <b>14</b>. In addition, the hopper side <b>72</b> has also been rotated 90 degrees to the top of the hopper and therefore must be opened to allow concrete to be fed into the hopper <b>14</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, the concrete <b>11</b> is being fed into the hopper <b>14</b> through the hopper side <b>72</b> by way of an elephant truck <b>73</b>, which is well known in the art, and constitutes another means for casting concrete into the casting area.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">From the above it is apparent that the vertical screed can also be moved in a diagonal direction as the application may require or otherwise may be desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">From the description above, a number of advantages of some embodiments of my vertical screed and method of casting vertical structures with a vertical screed become evident:
