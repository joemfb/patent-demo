No. 8,312,761, which claims the benefit of U.S. Patent Application No. 61/075,241, filed Jun. 24, 2008, which are both hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to test equipment. More particularly, the present invention relates to test equipment for protective gas masks and respirators.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many organizations that own and use respirators and/or protective masks have a need to periodically test the equipment to confirm their adequate operation. Many such organizations already possess equipment capable of performing certain aspects of a respirator performance test, such as an aerosol detector or a particle counter. The aerosol detectors and particle counters are used in the testing of respirators to &#x201c;challenge&#x201d; the fit and integrity of a respirator mask. The challenge test typically includes subjecting the respirator or portions thereof to a fine aerosol and measuring the concentration of particles that penetrate into the respirator. Accordingly, such organizations may prefer to acquire only the accessory equipment ancillary to the aerosol detector/particle counter to reduce procurement costs.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Respirator testing often utilizes a so-called &#x201c;head form&#x201d; upon which the respirator is mounted to test the performance. The use of an inflatable member to provide a positive seal against the portion of the respirator mask that seats against the user's face is known. The inflatable member provides a seal regardless of the fit of the mask against the head form. Any leaks detected are then known to be due to leaks in the mask, not leaks in the fit.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 5,808,182 to Stumpf, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety except for terms expressly defined therein, discloses a &#x201c;covering&#x201d; that covers a portion of a head form and is inflatable through a port on the head form. The covering of Stumpf comprises a wide, flexible band with transitions areas near the edges of the band that are sealed against the head form. Accordingly, the transition area must be constructed pressure tight to guarantee inflation of the covering. Stumpf does not disclose how these transition areas are to be made pressure tight.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 7,343,783 to Tilley, which is also hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety except for terms expressly defined therein, discloses an &#x201c;inflatable seal&#x201d; that is disposed in a recess on a single portion of a head form. Tilley offers no details on the construction of the inflatable seal, nor how the inflatable seal is secured within the recess. However, an embodiment of the Tilley disclosure is commercially available as part of the TDA-99B Respirator Function Tester, marketed by Air Techniques International of Owings Mills, Md., USA. The inflatable seals used in the TDA-99B comprise a seam that is sealed with an adhesive, and also an inlet tube that is inserted through an opening or slit in the inflatable seal and sealed using a patch and adhesive. The adhesives in the inflatable seal of the TDA-99B necessitates additional curing time in the manufacturing of the inflatable seal, and also additional quality assurance steps to check the integrity of the inflatable seal and the inlet tube.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Various components of a respirator test system require periodic calibration and maintenance to assure competent results. Such calibration and maintenance can require removal of the individual sensors, shipping of the test unit, or switching equipment and/or test fixtures to accommodate field calibration that adds to the bulk of the respirator test system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Organizations involved in the testing of respirators would welcome a respirator test accessory that complements already existing aerosol detection equipment and eases the burdens on equipment and personnel with respect to calibration and maintenance. Manufacturers of such test accessories would welcome an assembly process that reduces the dependence on adhesive seals and the time and quality assurance testing attendant thereto.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various embodiments of the invention include an accessory that may be implemented with a particle counter for testing the fit and seal integrity of gas masks and respirators. The accessory may also include fixtures and instrumentation for testing other parameters related to mask/respirator performance, such as drink train integrity and exhalation valve seating integrity.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some embodiments of the invention include an instrumentation module containing instrumentation and/or other appurtenances that may require periodic calibration or periodic maintenance. In these embodiments, the instrumentation module can be removed to a test facility for calibration and checkout, without need for transporting the entire accessory. The instrumentation module may also contain a microprocessor operatively coupled to a memory device such as a flash memory so that the updated calibrations and upgrades to the firmware may be loaded into the instrumentation module at the test facility. The modularity provided by the instrumentation module enables the use of a second or spare instrumentation module to operate the system while a first instrumentation module is in for calibration.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Certain embodiments of the invention may implement a full head form, as opposed to a partial head form or a face form that emulates only the face portion of a user. The full head form enables the testing of a variety of gas masks and respirators by using the mask harness to mount the mask to the head form, thus eliminating the need for special mounting accessories or the need to otherwise alter the mask for testing purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Some embodiments may be configured to augment testing of masks that are not equipped with a harness. For example, in a production setting, it is often desirable to test a mask for leaks before a harness is fitted to the mask. Certain embodiments of the full head form may be configured to accommodate masks that do not have a harness.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The disclosed head form may utilize a separate bladder member or portion that enables testing of the mask integrity apart from the fit integrity. In certain embodiments, the bladder member can be configured to form a bladder in a way that eliminates several steps in the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Structurally, the head form of the present invention may comprise a front portion and a back portion that compresses the portions of the bladder member therebetween to create the seal during assembly. Thus, formation of the bladder does not require the seam to be sealed before assembly, making the head form easier to manufacture than prior art bladder assemblies. The bladder member may also be configured with a wide registration surface to accommodate a number of sized respirators (e.g. small, medium, large) so that all can be tested on the one size head form. The front and back portions that secures the bladder member to the head assembly may be coupled to each other with conventional fasteners, which enables field replacement of bladders that are damaged or otherwise fail.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various embodiments of the invention include an accessory for testing the integrity of a respirator mask. The accessory may comprise an instrumentation module including instrumentation for determination of integrity of the respirator mask and a head form adapted to accommodate the respirator mask and detachably coupled with the instrumentation module. The system may include a casement for housing the accessory. The instrumentation module may also include an operator interface. The instrumentation module as well as the head form may be configured for detachable mounting to the casement. The accessory may further include an aerosol generator to augment challenge testing of respirator masks.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Within various embodiments of the invention, a head form for respirator testing includes a face portion and a base portion that cooperate to approximate the shape of a human head. The face portion and the base portion may cooperate to define a continuous recess about the face portion. A bladder member defining an inflatable bladder having an interior chamber may be disposed in the continuous recess, a portion of the bladder being compressed between the face and the base portions to secure the bladder member to the head form. Optionally, the head form may further comprise an adhesive disposed proximate the continuous recess and between portions of the bladder member. The portion of the bladder member compressed between the face portion and the base portion of the head form may include first and second flange portions that are compressed together to define the inflatable bladder and interior chamber. The flange portions may also cooperate to form an inlet to the interior chamber of the inflatable bladder. The head form may also include an inlet in fluid communication with a passageway that passes through the head form, the passageway being capable of connection with a pressure source for inflation of the bladder. The head form may also cooperate with the bladder member to define a plenum between the passageway and the inlet to the interior chamber of the inflatable bladder.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Optionally, the head form can include structure for the mounting of clips for mounting a mask to the head form without the use of the harness. Such structure may include snaps, slots and/or fasteners that accommodate the mounting of a clip. An extension device such as a strap may be included for adjustment of the clip position relative to the bladder to accommodate masks of different size.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention may also be configured to interface with the internal portion of the drink tube assembly, and be programmed to perform a drink tube flow test. In this embodiment, standard drink tube adaptors, each specific to a type of respirator being tested, can be readily connected to the drink tube canister connection. In many instances, the drink tube adaptors are available from existing quantitative fit test systems. The interchangeability of the various drink tube adaptors allows a greater variety of respirators to be tested without changing the adaptor permanently attached to the test system.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Various embodiments of the invention may include a bar code scanner for rapid reading of bar code information (e.g. respirator serial numbers, test date, test operator, test conditions) of a specific respirator for review on the accessory itself or for downloading to a computer for processing or documentation purposes.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In operation, the electrical cabling (not depicted) is operatively coupled between the instrumentation interface module <b>30</b> and the components within the casement <b>28</b>. The instrumentation module <b>30</b> may be placed over the portal <b>42</b> so that mating ports (not depicted) within the instrumentation module <b>30</b> are aligned with pneumatic interface connectors <b>44</b>. The pneumatic interface connectors <b>44</b> may include tapered distal end portions that serve to guide the pneumatic connectors into corresponding mating ports within the instrumentation module <b>30</b>. Alternatively, or in addition, dowels (not depicted) may be provided on the console <b>36</b> adjacent the portal <b>42</b> that align with holes in the flanges <b>80</b> to aid in the alignment. The flanges <b>80</b> are brought into contact with the console <b>36</b> and secured in place by fasteners such as conventional screws, wing nuts, spring loaded twist locks, or other quick release fasteners. By securing the instrumentation module <b>30</b> to the console <b>36</b>, the various pneumatic interface connectors <b>44</b> may be secured in positive connection with the components within the instrumentation module <b>30</b>. To detach the instrumentation module <b>30</b>, the flange <b>80</b> is decoupled from the console <b>36</b> and the module <b>30</b> lifted away from the console <b>36</b> for disconnection of the module <b>30</b> with the pneumatic interface connectors <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The system may be arranged so that various instruments and components requiring periodic calibration and maintenance are contained in the instrumentation module <b>30</b>. Accordingly, only the instrumentation module <b>30</b>, and not the entire casement <b>28</b>, is required for calibration and maintenance. Also, for scenarios where the instrumentation module is sent to a remote location for calibration and maintenance, the rest of the accessory <b>22</b> need not be removed from the field. In fact, a spare or &#x201c;roving&#x201d; replacement module may be utilized to keep the accessory <b>22</b> operational while the instrumentation module <b>30</b> is out of service.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Instructions that direct field personnel in the removal of the instrumentation module <b>30</b> and the installation of a replacement module such as outlined above could be provided on a tangible medium that accompanies the unit. The &#x201c;tangible medium&#x201d; may comprise a computer readable medium such as a CD, flash memory or a hard disk. In another embodiment, the tangible medium could reside on a remote computer accessible over the internet. In one embodiment, the tangible medium comprises an instruction sheet that accompanies the respirator testing system <b>20</b> or stickers that are posted on the respirator testing system <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 5B</figref>, the head form assembly <b>24</b> used in the respirator testing system <b>20</b> is depicted in an embodiment of the invention. The head form assembly <b>24</b>, which may be shaped generally in the form of a human head, may comprise a base portion <b>90</b>, a face portion <b>92</b> and a bladder member <b>93</b> that forms an inflatable bladder <b>94</b>, all held together by fasteners <b>96</b>. The inflatable bladder <b>94</b> may be configured to provide a wide registration surface <b>97</b>. The base portion <b>90</b> may include a neck portion <b>98</b> that extends to a base ring <b>100</b>. In one embodiment, a sampling port <b>102</b> is located in the base ring for interfacing with the sampling line <b>62</b><i>a </i>of the particle counter <b>26</b>. In one embodiment, the bladder member <b>93</b> comprises a cast soft urethane or an injection molded silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Functionally, providing the head form assembly <b>24</b> in combination with the inflatable bladder <b>94</b> enables the testing of respirator masks of various types and sizes. The masks may be strapped to the head form assembly <b>24</b> in the same manner as they would be to a human head, without need for accessories to accomplish the coupling. The sealing interface of the mask is seated against the registration surface <b>97</b> of the inflatable bladder <b>94</b>. The inflatable bladder <b>94</b> may then be inflated to provide a seal of high integrity between the head form assembly <b>24</b> and the mask. The width of the registration surface <b>97</b> may be sized large enough to accommodate respirator masks of different sized sealing interface openings. Also, the neck portion <b>98</b> of the head form assembly <b>24</b> enables testing of respirators that seal around the neck of the user&#x2014;again without need for special accessories&#x2014;something a partial head form or a face form may not enable.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The base and face portions <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> may cooperate to define a continuous interface therebetween. In one embodiment, the continuous interface defines a continuous recess <b>104</b>. The bladder member <b>93</b> may include continuous flange portions <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> that are captured in the recess <b>104</b> upon assembly of the base and face portions <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> to compress the flange portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> together, forming an air tight seal and defining an inflatable interior chamber <b>110</b>. The base and face portions <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> may include continuous grooves <b>118</b> and <b>119</b>, respectively, that interface the flange portions <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, respectively (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>). O-rings <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> may be disposed in the grooves <b>118</b> and <b>119</b>, respectively to provide an added measure of sealing integrity between the interior of the head form assembly <b>24</b> and the ambient environment.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Alternatively, the o-ring/groove arrangement may be reversed so that one or both of the grooves are formed on the flange portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> for seating of the o-rings <b>114</b>, <b>116</b> (not depicted). In yet another alternative, the flange portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> may be formed with detents (not depicted) that cooperate with grooves <b>118</b> and/or <b>119</b> formed in the base portion <b>90</b> and face portion <b>92</b>, respectively, to not only provide sealing integrity of the inflatable bladder <b>94</b> but also to secure the bladder member <b>93</b> within the recess <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The flange portions <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> may also cooperate to form an inlet <b>120</b> therebetween (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). The inlet <b>120</b> may be in fluid communication with a passage <b>121</b> formed, for example, in the base portion <b>90</b>. Alternatively, one or both of the flange portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> may have one or more passages extending through the flange portion <b>106</b> or <b>108</b> and in fluid communication with the inflatable interior chamber <b>110</b> and located proximate the passage <b>121</b> (not depicted). In one embodiment, the passage <b>121</b> extends from proximate the inlet <b>120</b> to the base ring <b>100</b>. The base ring <b>100</b> may include a coupling <b>132</b> for connection of the passage <b>121</b> to a pressure source and magnets <b>134</b> that magnetically couple the magnets in the mounting collar <b>46</b>. In one embodiment, the passage <b>121</b> is not directly coupled to the inlet <b>120</b>; rather, fluid communication between the passage <b>121</b> and the inlet <b>120</b> is augmented by a gap or plenum <b>136</b> between the flange portions <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and the base portion <b>90</b>. The fasteners <b>96</b> may implement features that that provide leak tight coupling, such as grommets or o-rings at the shoulders of the fasteners, plyable fastener material, threads doped with sealant or sealing tape, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Functionally, the air tight assembly of the head form assembly <b>24</b> avoids a requirement that the plenum <b>136</b> be air tight. In this embodiment, gas that is pressurized within the plenum <b>136</b> may leak between the interface of the base portion <b>90</b> and the face portion <b>92</b>, but does not depressurize the plenum <b>136</b> or, subsequently, the inflatable bladder <b>94</b>, because the interior of the head form assembly <b>24</b> may be maintained substantially at the inflation pressure of the inflatable bladder <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Alternatively, or in addition, a gasket <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) or other appropriate seal may be disposed between the interface of the base and face portions <b>90</b> and <b>92</b>, effectively making the plenum <b>136</b> air tight. The gasket <b>122</b> can also be adapted to seal various passageways that pass between the face and base portions <b>90</b> and <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The base and face portions <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> of the head form <b>27</b> may be formed of a resin such as epoxy, urethane or a high density plastic, and may be formed by process of pour or injection molding. The base ring <b>100</b> may be constructed of a metal such as aluminum or stainless steel for precision forming of coupling interfaces therein. Anchors (not depicted) may extend into the head form <b>27</b> to provide a way of fastening the base ring <b>100</b> to the neck portion <b>98</b>. Alternatively, fastener anchors (not depicted) may be disposed in the neck portion for use of fasteners to couple the base ring <b>100</b> to the neck portion <b>98</b>. A gasket <b>99</b> may also be disposed between the base ring <b>100</b> and the neck portion <b>98</b> to prevent leakage radially outward at the interface of the base ring <b>100</b> and neck portion <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In assembly, the bladder member <b>93</b> may be positioned on the base portion <b>90</b> with the inlet <b>120</b> substantially aligned with the passage <b>121</b>. The face portion <b>92</b> may then placed over the base portion <b>90</b> and bladder member <b>93</b> sub-assembly and secured to the base portion with the fasteners <b>96</b>. The base portion <b>90</b>, face portion <b>92</b> and flanges <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> may be dimensioned such that the act of fastening the face portion <b>92</b> to the base portion <b>90</b> causes a compression of the flange portions <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> together to form a seal <b>138</b> therebetween, as well as between the flanges <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and the base and face portions <b>90</b> and <b>92</b>, respectively. In one embodiment, the seal <b>138</b> is formed without use of adhesives or binders; that is, the flanges <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> provide a &#x201c;dry seal&#x201d; between each other and with the base and face portions <b>90</b> and <b>92</b>. In other embodiments, an adhesive may be disposed between flanges <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>, and/or between the flanges <b>106</b>, <b>108</b> and the recess <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">An advantage of the above disclosed methods of assembly is that cure time for an adhesive does not delay or extend manufacturing or assembly time. When dry seals are implemented, there is no cure time because there is no adhesive. The inflatable bladder <b>94</b> may be formed without a separate sealing operation between the mating surfaces before installation on the head form assembly <b>24</b>. When adhesives are implemented, the adhesives are not relied upon for structural purposes; that is, the head form <b>27</b> provides structure that holds the components in place while the adhesive(s) cures, so that the head form assembly <b>24</b> may proceed through any remaining steps of manufacturing or packaging without delay.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Another advantage of various embodiments disclosed is that there is no need to undergo separate manufacturing steps to enable access of pressurized gas into the inflatable bladder <b>94</b>. In one embodiment, rough alignment between the inlet <b>120</b> and the passage <b>121</b> enables charging of the inflatable bladder <b>110</b>, without need for insertion of tubing into the inflatable bladder <b>94</b> and without the use of adhesives to provide a seal between the tubing and the inflatable bladder <b>94</b>. In certain embodiments, the plenum <b>136</b> may also be sized so that pressurized gas entering the passage <b>121</b> will find its way into the inflatable interior chamber <b>110</b> without need for any alignment of the inlet <b>120</b> with the passage <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a sectional view of the head form assembly <b>24</b> is depicted in an embodiment of the invention. An inlet passage <b>124</b> and an outlet passage <b>125</b> each pass through the face and base portions <b>92</b> and <b>90</b>, terminating at inlet and outlet ports <b>126</b> and <b>127</b>, respectively. A mask or respirator <b>128</b>, depicted in phantom, is mounted to the head form assembly <b>24</b> and in contact with the inflatable bladder <b>94</b> to form a closed circuit between the inlet and outlet passages <b>124</b> and <b>125</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Representative and non-limiting examples of the flow rate and the vacuum caused thereby is approximately 16 liters per minute (lpm) and &#x2212;6 inches of water column (in. wc). In one embodiment, the flow rate is set or controlled to within &#xb1;&#xbd; lpm of the 16 lpm flow rate, and the vacuum to within &#xb1;&#xbd; in. wc of the &#x2212;6 in. wc vacuum. In another embodiment, a representative and non-limiting flow rate is 14 lpm or higher, and a vacuum of &#x2212;5 in. wc or greater. Matching the desired flow rate and vacuum is discussed further in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In operation, a flow of air can be initiated through the inlet passage <b>124</b> which passes through the mask <b>128</b> and out the outlet passage <b>125</b>. The velocity of the air flow can cause a drop in the static pressure of the closed circuit, thus creating a vacuum relative to the ambient atmosphere. If there are leaks in the mask <b>128</b>, airborne particles that are proximate the leak are drawn into the mask and exit the head form assembly <b>24</b> via the outlet passage <b>125</b>. In one embodiment, the particle counter <b>26</b> draws samples from the outlet passage <b>125</b> via sampling line <b>62</b><i>a</i>, which is plumbed to the sampling port <b>102</b> to measure the concentration of particles passing through the outlet passage <b>125</b>. A sample is also drawn via sampling line <b>62</b><i>b </i>to determine the concentration of ambient particles external to but proximate the head form assembly <b>24</b>. In this embodiment, the ratio of the ambient concentration to the concentration of particles in the outlet passage <b>125</b> is the fit factor.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the head form assembly <b>24</b> is depicted with an adaptor <b>129</b> for testing the integrity of the respirator testing system <b>20</b> in an embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, the adaptor <b>129</b> comprises tubing sections <b>130</b> that cooperate with the inlet and outlet ports <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> to form a closed circuit between the inlet and outlet passages <b>124</b> and <b>125</b>. Seals <b>131</b> such as o-rings may be located near the ends of the adaptor to provide an air-tight coupling between the adaptor <b>129</b> and the inlet and outlet ports <b>126</b>, <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Other configurations can be adapted to serve the function of the adaptor <b>129</b>. For example, instead of the inlet and outlet ports <b>126</b> and <b>127</b> being female, they could be configured as a male structure, i.e. as a port fitted with a stub that accommodates a compression fitting, or as a hose barb that accommodates a flexible tubing. Other structures for accomplishing a closed circuit between the inlet and outlet passages <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> are apparent to the artisan.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Functionally, the closed circuit created by the adaptor <b>129</b> enables the testing of the integrity of the head form assembly <b>24</b>. The low static pressure that causes a vacuum in the mask <b>128</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is generally present throughout the closed circuit. Accordingly, any leaks between the closed circuit (head form assembly <b>24</b> and various lines and fixtures that convey the air flow thereto) will tend to draw ambient particles into the circuit, which can result in an erroneously low fit factor indication. The adaptor <b>129</b> generally isolates the circuit to detect such leaks.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one embodiment, the head form assembly <b>24</b> may be equipped with a plurality of clip assemblies <b>140</b>, each comprising a fastening mechanism <b>142</b> and a clip <b>144</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) Optionally, an adjustable extension <b>146</b> such as a strap is provided between the fastening mechanism <b>142</b> and the clip <b>144</b>. The fastening mechanism <b>142</b> may comprise a snap <b>148</b> having a socket portion <b>148</b>.<b>2</b> that cooperates with a stud portion <b>148</b>.<b>4</b> mounted on the head form assembly <b>24</b> to secure the clip assembly <b>140</b> to the head form assembly <b>24</b>. Alternatively, the clip assemblies <b>140</b> may be attached to the head form assembly <b>24</b> using a standard fastener that couples with a threaded member that is moored in the head form <b>27</b> of the head form assembly <b>24</b>. In another embodiment, slots may be configured to mate with the fastening mechanism <b>142</b> to secure the clip assembly <b>140</b></p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">(Note: <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts only one clip assembly <b>140</b> mounted thereto, with stud portions <b>148</b>.<b>4</b> depicted for two other clip assemblies <b>140</b>.)</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Functionally, the clip assemblies <b>140</b> can be attached to the head form assembly <b>24</b> when it is desired to test a mask that is not fitted with a harness. The adjustable extensions <b>146</b> can be set to a desired length that applies a radial tension on the mask to secures the mask firmly against the inflatable bladder <b>94</b>. The clip assemblies may be detached from the head form assembly <b>24</b> when not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, appurtenances and methods related to the drink train and exhaust valve testing lines <b>60</b> and <b>61</b> are described and depicted in an embodiment of the invention. A respirator mask <b>150</b> is depicted having a face seal surface <b>151</b>, attachment straps <b>152</b>, an exhaust outlet valve <b>153</b>, voicemitters <b>154</b> and a filter port <b>155</b>. The respirator mask <b>150</b> in the depictions also includes a drink train <b>156</b> including a quick disconnect fitting <b>157</b> on a proximate end and a mouth piece <b>158</b> on a distal end.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the drink train testing line <b>60</b> is depicted as having a fitting <b>160</b> operatively coupled to the distal end. The fitting <b>160</b> may be sized to provide an air tight seal when it is coupled with the mouth piece <b>158</b>. A variety of fittings may serve the purpose of the fitting <b>160</b>, because mouth pieces for drink trains tend to be flexible and may conform to the contour of the fitting <b>160</b>. For example, a LUER adaptor of appropriate size may be used. A drink canister adaptor <b>162</b> may also be provided that engages with the quick disconnect fitting <b>157</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In operation, the fitting <b>160</b> is inserted into and seated within the mouth piece <b>158</b> to provide a temporary seal. To test the drink train <b>156</b> for leaks, the drink train testing line <b>60</b> can be pressurized or drawn to a vacuum with the quick disconnect fitting <b>157</b> in a closed position, and the pressure monitored to detect whether there is a decay in the pressure or vacuum. To test the drink train <b>156</b> for obstructions, the drink canister adaptor <b>162</b> is coupled to the quick disconnect fitting <b>157</b> to open the quick disconnect fitting <b>157</b>. Pressure decays and flow rates for these respective tests may be measured with instrumentation within the casement <b>28</b> that are operatively coupled to the drink train testing line <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">An advantage provided by this configuration is that the accessory <b>22</b> does not have to be altered to accommodate different mask types. Various drink canister adaptors <b>162</b> are readily available as the replacement parts for the drink canisters and are implemented independent of the accessory <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an outlet valve adaptor <b>164</b> is depicted as being attached to a distal end of the exhaust valve testing line <b>61</b> in an embodiment of the invention. In the depicted embodiment, the outlet valve adaptor <b>164</b> includes a central tube <b>166</b>, plunger portion <b>168</b> and a biasing spring <b>170</b> operatively coupled with an H-bracket <b>172</b>. The H-bracket <b>172</b> may be formed of a resilient material such as a high density plastic and include detents <b>174</b> at the distal end. A seal member (not depicted) such as an o-ring or gasket may be disposed on the distal face of the plunger portion <b>168</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In operation, the plunger portion <b>168</b> is pressed against the outer surface of the exhaust outlet valve <b>153</b> and the H-bracket <b>172</b> advanced until the detents <b>174</b> engage with an outer perimeter <b>176</b> of the exhaust outlet valve <b>153</b>. The biasing spring <b>170</b> is thereby compressed between the plunger portion <b>168</b> and the H-bracket <b>172</b> to provide an active force that keeps the seal member in sealing engagement with the exhaust outlet valve <b>153</b>. The resiliency of the H-bracket <b>172</b> may enable an operator to flex the legs of the H-bracket <b>172</b> outward to pass over the outer perimeter <b>176</b> of the exhaust valve and to exert a clamping force on the outer perimeter <b>176</b> to hold the plunger portion <b>168</b> over the exhaust valve outlet <b>153</b>. By this arrangement, the outlet valve adaptor <b>164</b> can accommodate a range exhaust outlet valves sizes. Also, outlet valve adaptors having plunger portions and H-brackets of various sizes and dimensions may be provided to accommodate a wide range of exhaust outlet valves. These outlet valve adaptors may be readily coupled/decoupled from the exhaust valve testing line <b>61</b> without need for altering the accessory <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a schematic of the respirator testing system <b>20</b> is depicted in an embodiment of the invention.

Electrical lines (power, signal and computer) are depicted with dashed lines, while pneumatic lines are depicted with solid lines.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A low voltage, DC power supply <b>178</b> and a main power supply <b>180</b> may supply power to the various components of the respirator testing system <b>20</b>. In one embodiment, a blower <b>182</b> is used for driving air through the inlet and outlet passages <b>124</b>, <b>125</b> for drawing a vacuum within the breathing chamber of the mask <b>128</b> to test the mask integrity. In one embodiment, a diaphragm pump <b>184</b> can be utilized for operation of the aerosol generator <b>68</b>, testing of a drink tube and/or drink train <b>181</b>, and for inflating the inflatable bladder <b>94</b>. The aerosol generator <b>68</b> may be operatively coupled to a sprayer <b>183</b> to assist the operator in localizing leaks in the mask or the mask seal.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">A pressure sensor <b>185</b> may be utilized to measure the inflation pressure for the inflatable bladder <b>94</b>.

In another embodiment, the inflation pressure is less than 8 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">A testing volume <b>186</b> instrumented with a temperature sensor <b>185</b>.<b>2</b> and a pressure sensor <b>185</b>.<b>5</b> may be provided to augment a pressure decay measurement of the leak rate of mask exhalation valves. In one embodiment, a pressure sensor <b>185</b>.<b>6</b> is tapped into a blower line <b>185</b>.<b>7</b> that runs between the blower <b>182</b> and the testing volume <b>186</b> and may be used to measure barometric pressure when the blower is not operating.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A pressure sensor <b>185</b>.<b>8</b> may be tapped into the drink train testing line <b>60</b> for measuring the operating pressure during testing of the drink train. The pressure sensor <b>185</b>.<b>8</b> can be used to determine a pressure decay rate for leak detection in the drink train <b>181</b>, and can also be used to establish the pressure drop through the drink train <b>181</b> when a constant flow rate is established through the drink train <b>181</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Another pressure sensor <b>185</b>.<b>9</b> may be used to determine the vacuum level in the outlet passage <b>125</b>, which effectively measures the vacuum in the mask <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Control of the fluid flow may be provided various and sundry solenoid-operated isolation valves <b>187</b>.<b>1</b> and 3-way valves <b>187</b>.<b>2</b>, check valves <b>187</b>.<b>3</b>, restriction orifices <b>187</b>.<b>4</b>, filters <b>187</b>.<b>5</b> and a needle valve <b>187</b>.<b>6</b>.
