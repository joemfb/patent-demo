<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to pest management and in particular to a low cost disposable container for containing and disposing of an electrocuted pest.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Pests such as rodents present both a nuisance and a heath risk at residences, farms, ranches, and recreational areas. Additionally, urban areas, factories, restaurants, etc. often face rodent infestations. Various mechanical traps are available but generally include some type of grasping mechanism which may be difficult to set and cause discomfort or injury if released on a user's hand. Poisons are also commonly used, but may create their own health risks. For these and other reasons, users are often reluctant to use traditional measures.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,269,091 and 5,949,636 disclose portable pest electrocution devices which overcome some of the issues present in mechanical traps and poisons. The '091 and '636 patents describe electrical circuits for sensing the presence of a pest and creating a high voltage signal to electrocute the pest. Unfortunately, both devices require removal of dead pests from the device for disposal. Such removal may involve accidental contact with the dead pest, or an unpleasant experience. Pests are also known to carry diseases, and contact with them may present a heath risk. The '091 and '636 patents are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention addresses the above and other needs by providing a method and apparatus for electrocution and disposal of pests which includes a reusable power source and a low cost disposable container. The reusable power source includes batteries and a circuit to provide a high voltage and low current signal through external leads to the disposable container, to electrocute small pests without presenting a risk to humans or pets. The disposable container is constructed from low cost material, for example, cardboard, and may be packaged for sale in a flat foldable state, and easily configured into a container with a floor including conducting surfaces connected to the external leads. In one embodiment, the conducting surfaces are formed of a conducting material formed or glued on the floor of the disposable container and the conducting material further forms internal leads reaching to a male connector surface configured to cooperate with a female connector of the external leads.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided a method for electrocution and disposal of pests. The method includes providing a power source providing a high voltage and low current signal for electrocution of the pests without presenting risks to humans and a low cost disposable container. Leads are connected from the power source to the low cost disposable container, the leads having a female connector and the low cost disposable container having a male connector. The power supply is switched on and the user waits for a pest to be electrocuted. After the pest has been electrocuted, the power supply is switch OFF and the leads are disconnected from the low cost disposable container. The low cost disposable container containing the electrocuted pest is then disposed of without requiring handling the dead pest.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with another of the invention, there is provided a low cost disposable container disconnectably connectable to a high voltage and low current power source. The low cost disposable container is foldable to a flat form for packaging and configurable into a container for use. The low cost disposable container includes conducting areas for making contact with the pest to electrocute the pest, and in one embodiment, to sense the presence of the pest. The container contacts and extensions connecting the conducting areas to the container contacts are preferably integrally formed as a thin layer of electrically conductive material glued to the interior of the low cost disposable container or formed on the interior of the low cost disposable container. The interior of the low cost disposable container may be formed from a cutout of a flat sheet and is preferably formed from plastic or a paper product and more preferably from a paper product. The low cost disposable container may thus be disposed of after each use.</p>
