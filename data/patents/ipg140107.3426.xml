<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An organic light-emitting device including a first substrate with an array of organic light-emitting pixels formed thereon, and a second substrate is disclosed. A transparent moisture absorption layer is disposed between the first and second substrates. The transparent moisture absorption layer efficiently absorbs moisture and/or oxygen, and thus the lifetime characteristics of the organic light-emitting device are improved. The transparent moisture absorption layer has a transmittance of about 85% or higher with respect to visible light. The layer has a thickness of about 10 to about 60,000 nm and a refractive index of about 1.45 to about 1.65 in an inert and/air atmosphere. The layer is formed on the second substrate by using chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2005-0071720, filed on Aug. 5, 2005, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a display device, and more particularly, to an organic light-emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Organic Light-Emitting Devices (OLEDs) may be vulnerable to moisture permeated into the devices. Thus, an encapsulation structure was proposed to guarantee the stable operating and lifetime of OLEDs. Generally, a metal can or a glass substrate etched in the form of a cap with a groove is used for encapsulation. In such a case, for moisture absorption, a desiccant of a powder type is mounted in the groove or a desiccant of a film type is adhered in the groove be means of a double-sided tape.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei. 9-148066 discloses an organic electroluminescent device including a laminate having a pair of electrodes facing to each other and an organic light-emitting material layer made of an organic compound interposed between the electrodes; an airtight container for preventing the exposure of the laminate to the air; and drying means, disposed in the airtight container, being made of, for example, alkaline metal oxide or alkaline earth metal oxide. However, the bulky shape of the airtight container increases the total thickness of the organic electroluminescent device.

At this time, the refractive index of the transparent moisture absorption layer is a value measured by an ellopsometry method in a visible light wavelength range of 380 to 780 nm, in particular, 632.8 nm, in an inert and/or air atmosphere. For reference, the refractive index of bulk CaO particles is 1.84. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the refractive index of a CaO film measured in a visible light wavelength range of 380 to 780 nm in an air atmosphere.</p>

In particular, the transparent moisture absorption layer may be disposed on an inner surface of the encapsulation substrate, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, schematically illustrates the structure of an organic light-emitting device according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the organic light-emitting device includes a substrate <b>10</b> made of glass or a transparent insulating material; an organic light-emitting unit or array of organic light-emitting pixels <b>12</b>, disposed on a surface of the substrate <b>10</b>, having a sequentially stacked structure of a first electrode, an organic film, and a second electrode; and an encapsulation substrate <b>11</b> being joined to the substrate <b>10</b> to seal a space defined between the substrate <b>10</b> and the encapsulation substrate <b>11</b> in which the organic light-emitting unit <b>12</b> is disposed. This configuration prevents the organic light-emitting unit <b>12</b> from being exposed to the outside moisture. Further, the organic light-emitting device further includes a transparent moisture absorption layer or desiccant layer <b>13</b> on an inner surface located between the substrate <b>10</b> and the encapsulation substrate <b>11</b>. In an embodiment, the encapsulation substrate <b>11</b> may be a flat glass substrate. The substrate <b>10</b> and the encapsulation substrate <b>11</b> are joined by a sealant layer <b>14</b> coated outside the organic light-emitting unit <b>12</b>. Here, the encapsulation substrate <b>11</b>, together with the substrate <b>10</b>, seals the organic light-emitting unit <b>12</b> therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrating the structure of an organic light-emitting device according to another embodiment of the present invention, an encapsulation substrate <b>21</b> is an etched glass substrate, and has a transparent moisture absorption layer or desiccant layer <b>23</b> on an inner surface thereof. A reference numeral <b>20</b> refers to a substrate, a reference numeral <b>22</b> is an array of organic light-emitting pixels, and a reference numeral <b>24</b> refers to a sealant layer. In a certain embodiment, the transparent moisture absorption layers <b>13</b> and <b>23</b> may have thick and transparent films made of CaO nanopaticles.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The arrays of organic light-emitting pixels <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> may be formed by sequentially depositing a first electrode, an organic film, and a second electrode. The first electrode may be a cathode, and the second electrode may be an anode. The organic film may include a hole injection layer, a hole transport layer, an emission layer, an electron injection layer, and/or an electron transport layer. The encapsulation substrates <b>11</b> and <b>21</b> may be of insulating substrates, e.g., glass or transparent plastic substrates. When transparent plastic substrates are used as the encapsulation substrates <b>11</b> and <b>21</b>, a desiccant layer for absorbing of moisture may be formed on inner surfaces of the plastic substrates. The desiccant layer may be resistant to heat, chemicals, and humidity. Like this, an encapsulation substrate made of a transparent material can be applied to a top-emission type device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">For bottom-emission type, the organic light-emitting units <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> may include a first electrode made of a transparent material and a second electrode made of a reflective material. On the other hand, for top-emission type, the organic light-emitting units <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> may include a first electrode made of a reflective material and a second electrode made of a transparent material. The second electrode may include on its upper surface an inorganic protective film for planarization of the organic light-emitting units <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> to allow the organic light-emitting units <b>12</b> and <b>22</b> to be resistant to heat, chemicals, and humidity. The protective film may be made of metal oxide or metal nitride. The spaces defined between the encapsulation substrates <b>11</b> and <b>21</b> and the substrates <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, respectively, may be a vacuum or filled with an inert gas.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an embodiment, provided that the transparency of the transparent moisture absorption layers <b>13</b> and <b>23</b> is assured, it is advantageous to form the transparent moisture absorption layers <b>13</b> and <b>23</b> to have a greater thickness. The thickness of the transparent moisture absorption layers <b>13</b> and <b>23</b> may be about 10 to about 60,000 nm, preferably about 200 to about 2,000 nm. In certain embodiments, the thickness of the layer may be about 30, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1100, 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1700, 1800, 1900, 2000, 2500, 3000, 4000, 5000, 7000, 10000, 15000, 20000, 25000, 30000, 35000, 40000 or 50000 nm. The organic light-emitting device according to embodiments of the present invention can be applied to all of top-emission type, bottom-emission type, and both-direction emission type.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">A method of manufacturing the organic light-emitting device will now be described. First, a first electrode, an organic film, and a second electrode are sequentially stacked on a substrate to form an organic light-emitting unit. Next, alkaline metal or alkaline earth metal is deposited on an encapsulation substrate in an oxygen atmosphere to form a transparent moisture absorption layer made of alkaline metal oxide or alkaline earth metal oxide. Alternatively, alkaline metal oxide or alkaline earth metal oxide is deposited on an encapsulation substrate in a vacuum atmosphere to form a transparent moisture absorption layer made of alkaline metal oxide or alkaline earth metal oxide.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In certain embodiments, the deposition of the transparent moisture absorption layer on the encapsulation substrate may be performed using a physical vapor deposition process at a substrate temperature of about 20 to about 400&#x25a1;. The deposition of the transparent moisture absorption layer on the substrate having thereon the organic light-emitting unit may be performed at a substrate temperature of about 20 to about 100&#x25a1;. The alkaline metal may be potassium (K), and the alkaline earth metal may be barium (Ba), calcium (Ca), or magnesium (Mg). In particular, potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) may be used in the form of their oxides during the deposition. In an embodiment, the flow rate of oxygen varies according to the capacity of a chamber, etc., and may be about 100 sccm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The transparent moisture absorption layer has sufficient moisture and oxygen absorption capability, and thus, can efficiently hermetically seal the organic light-emitting unit. In an embodiment, the transparent moisture absorption layer has a transparency of about 95 to about 98%. In an embodiment, after preparing the encapsulation substrate with the transparent hygroscopic layer as described above, a sealant is coated on a surface area of at least one of the substrate and the encapsulation substrate corresponding to outside the organic light-emitting unit, using a screen printer or a dispenser. Then, the substrate and the encapsulation substrate are joined to complete an organic light-emitting device of the present invention. An internal enclosed space of the organic light-emitting device may be a vacuum or filled with an inert gas. Also, after the joining, the sealant may be cured by UV, visible light, or heat.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to the above-described method of manufacturing the organic light-emitting device of the present invention, in an embodiment, forming a transparent moisture absorption layer may not us a liquid state material, but the desiccant layer can be selectively deposited on a desired area using a mask. Thus, in certain embodiments, there is no need to use an etched glass substrate. Therefore, the manufacturing method is simplified, and the total thickness of the organic light-emitting device is reduced, allowing a more compact size. Furthermore, in an embodiment, since a flat glass substrate is used instead of an etched glass substrate, an enhancement in impact resistance is expected. In addition, in another embodiment, since crystallization is done immediately after vapor-phase deposition, and a film transmittance can be adjusted by controlling process parameters, a transparent moisture absorption layer with no distortion can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The transparent moisture absorption layer formed by the above-described method is maintained transparent before and after moisture absorption. There are no particular limitations on a driving method for an organic light-emitting device of the present invention. Both passive matrix (PM) driving and active matrix (AM) driving are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described more specifically with reference to the following Examples. The following Examples are for illustrative purposes and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Calcium was added to a thermal evaporator with oxygen supply to form a transparent moisture absorption layer made of calcium oxide to a thickness of 102 nm on a soda glass substrate.

An epoxy resin used as a sealant was coated onto a side of the soda glass substrate with the transparent moisture absorption layer and a side of a glass substrate with a first electrode, an organic film, and a second electrode. Then, both the glass substrates were joined to complete an organic light-emitting device.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An organic light-emitting device including a transparent moisture absorption layer according to embodiments of the present invention provides the following advantages. First, the transparent moisture absorption layer efficiently absorbs moisture and/or oxygen, and thus the lifetime characteristics of the organic light-emitting device are improved. In particular, in an accelerated lifetime test (500 hours), the organic light-emitting device maintains good lifetime characteristics. Second, the transparent moisture absorption layer is kept transparent with time and has a transmittance of about 85% or more in a film thickness range of about 10 to about 60,000 nm. Also, it has a refractive index of about 1.45 to about 1.65, and thus is preferable in terms of low refractive index film application. Third, there is no need to use an etched glass substrate as an encapsulation substrate, thereby ensuring a reduction in the total thickness of the organic light-emitting device and allowing the organic light-emitting device to have good impact resistance.</p>
