<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-023176 filed on Feb. 4, 2009. The entire disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-023176 is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a liquid-suctioning tank and a droplet discharge device provided with the liquid-suctioning tank, in which a liquid is suctioned via a liquid-suctioning object and trapped by using a suction device to apply negative pressure to an upper space.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Liquid-suctioning tanks (recovery tanks) known in the art and described as above have a liquid inflow port that is in communication with liquid in the tank, and a gas outflow port that is connected to a suction device and is in communication with the space above the surface of the liquid (see Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application No. 2008-80209).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The liquid inflow port will corrode when submerged in a fluid. For this reason, there is adopted a structure in which the liquid inflow port is disposed (in the space) above the liquid surface in the liquid-suctioning tank, and liquid is allowed to flow from above the liquid surface to be recovered.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, there is a problem with such a configuration in that the liquid disperses (into a mist) when it flows down to the liquid surface, and enters the gas outflow port in the form of a dispersed mist, whereupon the devices (particularly the seal portions and the like) of the suction system corrode. In other words, when the flow rate of the downward-flowing liquid and the falling distance inside the liquid-suctioning tank exceed a certain tolerance range, a problem arises in that the liquid will be more dramatically dispersed. It is possible to consider reducing the distance between the liquid surface and the liquid inflow port as much as possible, but in such a case, the liquid inflow port will be submerged in the fluid when the height of the liquid surface is increased by liquid collection.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One object of the present invention is to provide a liquid-suctioning tank and a droplet discharge device provided with the liquid-suctioning tank in which it is possible to prevent dispersion of the liquid that flows downward to the liquid surface from the liquid inflow port open unto the upper space.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A liquid-suctioning tank according to one aspect of the present invention includes a liquid inflow port, a gas out flow port, a baffle plate, and a guide member. The liquid inflow port communicates with an upper space of a surface of a liquid when the liquid is stored in the liquid-suctioning tank. The liquid inflow port is configured and arranged to be connected to a liquid-suctioning object. The gas outflow port communicates with the upper space, and configured and arranged to be connected to a suctioning device so that a negative pressure is applied to the upper space by the suctioning device to trap liquid from the liquid-suctioning object using suction. The baffle plate is disposed in the upper space so that the liquid flowing from the liquid inflow port collides against the baffle plate. The guide member has a guiding wall configured and arranged to guide the liquid that has collided with the baffle plate from the baffle plate toward the surface of the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with this configuration, liquid that has flowed in from the liquid inflow port collides with the baffle plate and is guided to the liquid surface by the guiding wall. Thus, the falling distance of the fluid that has flowed in from the liquid inflow port can be reduced and the fluid is guided to the liquid surface under a reduced the flow rate. Therefore, dispersion of the liquid to the liquid surface can be minimized. The liquid inflow port will not become submerged in the fluid even when the height of the liquid surface has risen. As used herein, a &#x201c;guiding wall&#x201d; in the present specification refers to a surface or plane without thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the liquid-suctioning tank, the liquid inflow port may be opened in a ceiling of the liquid-suctioning tank, the baffle plate may be horizontally arranged directly below the liquid inflow port, and the guide member may have a cylindrical body that encloses the baffle plate so that an inner surface of the guide member forms the guiding wall.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Also, an upper end of the guide member may be secured to the ceiling of the liquid-suctioning tank.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with this configuration, the liquid inflow port can be prevented from corroding due to the liquid inflow port being provided in the tank ceiling. Since the baffle plate for receiving the fluid from the liquid inflow port is horizontally disposed, the fluid flows down the baffle plate in a radial fashion. Accordingly, the flow rate of the downwardly flowing fluid is dramatically reduced and the fluid can thereafter be guided to the guiding wall. A guiding wall is furthermore provided so as to envelope the baffle plate, whereby the guiding wall serves as a liquid-proofing cover, and liquid that has collided with the baffle plate can be prevented from dispersing over the entire liquid-suctioning tank. Function as the liquid-proofing cover can be enhanced by further securing the guide member to the tank ceiling wall.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally, the lower end of the guide member may extend to a vicinity of a bottom wall of the liquid-suctioning tank.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with this configuration, the lower end of the guide member extends to the vicinity of the tank bottom wall, and thus the fluid that has collided can be slowly guided to the liquid surface at an unchanged speed regardless of the height of the liquid surface.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Additionally, the guide member may include at least one of a through-hole and a notched part.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with this configuration, the pressure inside and outside the guide member can be made uniform by forming in the guide member a through-hole and/or a notched part for placing the interior and the exterior of the guide member in communication.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Additionally, a surface area of a gap between the guide member and the baffle plate may be substantially the same as a cross-sectional area of the liquid inflow port.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with this configuration, the liquid can be smoothly guided to the liquid surface while the dispersion of the liquid is suppressed because the gap area between the guide member and the baffle plate, and the cross-sectional area of the liquid inflow port are formed to be substantially the same, whereby the flow rate from the liquid inflow port and the flow rate from the gap between the guide member and the baffle plate are made to be substantially the same.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Additionally, an inner wall of the liquid-suctioning tank may form a part of the guiding wall.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with this configuration, the liquid-suctioning tank can be provided with a simple configuration because the guide member and the tank inner wall of the liquid-suctioning tank can be integrally formed (i.e., be of dual-purpose construction).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additionally, the baffle plate may be arranged with a slope having a downstream end facing an inner wall of the liquid-suctioning tank with a gap therebetween, and the inner wall of the liquid-suctioning tank may form the guide member.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with this configuration, liquid that has flowed in from the liquid inflow port collides with the baffle plate, is thereafter guided by the baffle plate, is brought to the tank inner wall, and is guided to the liquid surface. Accordingly, the liquid-suctioning tank can be provided with a simple configuration because the tank inner wall is integrally formed with (doubles as) the guide member.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally, the liquid-suctioning tank may further include an annular frame unit provided in a generally vertical intermediate position of an inner wall of the liquid-suctioning tank.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In accordance with this configuration, the strength of the tank can be increased and the capacity of the tank can be increased with a thin plate material.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additionally, the liquid inflow port may be configured and arranged to be connected to a suction cap as the liquid-suctioning object configured and arranged to suction functional fluid from an ink-jet head with the suction cap being selectively detachable from the functional droplet discharging head. The gas outflow port may be configured and arranged to be connected to an ejector as the suctioning device with the ejector having a secondary side connected to the liquid inflow port.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with this configuration, the suction process of the functional droplet discharging head can be carried out with good precision by using the liquid-suctioning tank described above in a suction system of an ink jet head. The suction device can be provided with a simple configuration by configuring the suction device to be an ejector.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A droplet discharge device according to another aspect of the present invention includes the liquid-suctioning tank, the suction cap connected to the liquid-suctioning tank, the functional droplet discharging head from which the suction cap is selectively detached, and the ejector connected to the liquid-suctioning tank.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with this configuration, the suction process of the functional droplet discharging head can be carried out with good precision by using the liquid-suctioning tank described above in a suction system of a droplet discharge device. Consequently, the drawing process of the functional droplet discharging head can be carried out with good precision.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A droplet discharge device in which the liquid-suctioning tank of the present invention has been applied is described below with reference to the attached drawings. The droplet discharge device is incorporated in a manufacturing line for flat panel displays, and is used for forming filter elements or the like of a color filter or a luminous layer that will constitute the pixels of an organic EL device, using a functional droplet discharging head into which a functional fluid (liquid), which is, e.g., an special ink or a luminous resin fluid, has been introduced. In particular, the droplet discharge device can reduce problems brought about by dispersion of the functional fluid by using a drainage tank (liquid-suctioning tank) that can reduce the dispersion of the functional fluid in the suction unit.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A droplet discharge device <b>1</b> is composed of an X-axis table <b>2</b>, a Y-axis table <b>3</b>, and <b>13</b> carriage units <b>4</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. The X-axis table <b>2</b> is disposed on an X-axis support base <b>21</b> supported on a stone base, extends in the X-axis direction as the main scanning direction, and moves a workpiece W in the X-axis direction. The Y-axis table <b>3</b> is disposed on a pair of Y-axis support bases <b>31</b> so as to span and straddle the X-axis table <b>2</b> via a plurality of support columns <b>11</b>, and extends in the Y-axis direction as the sub-scanning direction. The carriage units <b>4</b> are movably suspended on the Y-axis table <b>3</b> and each carriage unit has a plurality (<b>12</b>) of functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b>. The droplet discharge device <b>1</b> furthermore comprises a chamber <b>5</b> for accommodating these devices in a temperature- and humidity-controlled atmosphere; a functional fluid supply unit <b>6</b> for supplying functional fluid to the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b>, being provided through the chamber <b>5</b>; and a control device (not shown) for controlling each unit. A tank cabinet <b>50</b> for accommodating a main tank <b>60</b> and the like that forms the main part of the functional fluid supply unit <b>6</b> is provided to a portion of the sidewall of the chamber <b>5</b>. The droplet discharge device <b>1</b> drives the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> so that discharging/driving is carried out in synchronization with the driving of the X-axis table <b>2</b> and the Y-axis table <b>3</b>, whereby six colors of function droplets supplied from the functional fluid supply unit <b>6</b> are discharged and a predetermined drawing pattern is drawn on the workpiece W.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The droplet discharge device <b>1</b> is provided with a maintenance device <b>7</b> composed of a flushing unit <b>15</b>, a suction unit <b>16</b>, a wiping unit <b>17</b>, and a discharge performance inspection unit <b>18</b>. These units provide maintenance to the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> and maintain and restore function to the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b>. In the droplet discharge device <b>1</b> of the present embodiment, the carriage units <b>4</b> are made to face the area in which the X-axis table <b>2</b> and the Y-axis table <b>3</b> intersect to draw on a workpiece W; and the carriage units <b>4</b> are made to face the area in which the Y-axis table <b>3</b> and the maintenance device <b>7</b> (the suction unit <b>16</b> and the wiping unit <b>17</b>) intersect so as to subject the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> to functional maintenance and functional restoration.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the X-axis table <b>2</b> is provided with a positioning table <b>22</b> for chucking a workpiece W, having a function for making corrections in the &#x3b8;-axis direction; an X-axis first slider <b>23</b> for slidably supporting the positioning table <b>22</b> in the X-axis direction; an X-axis second slider <b>24</b> for slidably supporting the flushing unit <b>15</b> and the discharge performance inspection unit <b>18</b> in the X-axis direction; and a pair of left and right X-axis linear motors (not shown) that extend in the X-axis direction and move the X-axis first slider <b>23</b> and the X-axis second slider <b>24</b> in the X-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The Y-axis table <b>3</b> is provided with 13 bridge plates <b>32</b> from which 13 carriage units <b>4</b>, respectively, are suspended; 13 sets of Y-axis sliders (not shown) for supporting the 13 bridge plates <b>32</b> at the two ends thereof; and a pair of Y-axis linear motors (not shown) for moving the bridge plates <b>32</b> in the Y-axis direction, being disposed on the pair of Y-axis support bases <b>31</b>. The Y-axis table <b>3</b> sub-scans the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> via the carriage units <b>4</b> during the drawing process, and causes the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> to face the suction unit <b>16</b> and the wiping unit <b>17</b>. In this case, the carriage units <b>4</b> can be made independent and moved individually, and the 13 carriage units <b>4</b> can be moved as a single unit.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Each of the carriage units <b>4</b> is provided with a head unit <b>42</b> composed of two (12 total) functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> for each of six colors R, G, B, C, M, and Y; and a head plate <b>41</b> for supporting the 12 functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> in two groups of six (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Each of the carriage units <b>4</b> is provided with a &#x3b8;-rotation mechanism <b>43</b> for supporting the head unit <b>42</b> so as to allow &#x3b8; correction (&#x3b8; rotation), and a suspension member <b>44</b> in which the head unit <b>42</b> is supported by a bridge plate <b>32</b> via the &#x3b8;-rotation mechanism <b>43</b>. Additionally, each carriage unit <b>4</b> has a sub-tank <b>45</b> arranged above each carriage unit (actually arranged on the bridge plate <b>32</b>), and a configuration in which functional fluid is supplied to the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> via a pressure-regulating valve and by using the natural head from the sub-tank <b>45</b>. In the present embodiment, there are 13 carriage units <b>4</b> and 12 functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> mounted on each carriage unit <b>4</b>, but the number of carriage units <b>4</b> and the number of functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> mounted on each carriage units <b>4</b> is arbitrary.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the functional droplet discharging head <b>13</b> is a so-called two-row inkjet head, and is provided with a fluid introduction section <b>51</b> having two connection needles <b>54</b>, as well as a two-row head plate <b>52</b> connected to the fluid introduction section <b>51</b>. A head main unit <b>53</b> for discharging functional fluid is connected below the head plate <b>52</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>a</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The fluid introduction section <b>51</b> has a pair of connection needles <b>54</b>, and is designed to receive a supply of functional fluid from the sub-tank <b>45</b>. The head main unit <b>53</b> has a two-row pump section <b>55</b> composed of piezoelements or the like, and a nozzle plate <b>56</b> having a nozzle surface <b>58</b> on which a plurality of discharge nozzles <b>57</b> is formed. Numerous discharge nozzles <b>57</b> formed in the nozzle surface <b>58</b> of the nozzle plate <b>56</b> constitute two nozzle rows NL aligned parallel to each other yet positionally offset by a half nozzle pitch. The nozzle rows NL are composed of 180 discharge nozzles <b>57</b> aligned at equal pitch (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5(</figref><i>b</i>)). A pair of connectors <b>59</b> is mounted on the head substrate <b>52</b>, and each connector <b>59</b> is connected to the above-described control device via a flexible flat cable (not shown). A drive waveform outputted from the control device is applied to the pump sections <b>55</b> (piezoelectric elements) via the connectors <b>59</b>, whereby functional fluid is discharged from the discharge nozzles <b>57</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The flushing unit <b>15</b> has a pair of pre-drawing flushing units <b>61</b>, <b>61</b> and a periodic flushing unit <b>62</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, and receives waste discharge from the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b>. This action is performed prior to a drawing process and during pauses in the drawing process when a workpiece W is replaced. The suction unit <b>16</b> has 13 cap units <b>71</b>, forcibly suctions functional fluid from the discharge nozzles <b>57</b> of the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b>, and performs a capping process. The wiping unit <b>17</b> wipes the nozzle surface <b>58</b> of the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> after suctioning. The discharge performance inspection unit <b>18</b> inspects for flight curvature and whether there is any discharge from the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The periodic flushing unit <b>62</b> has a periodic flushing box <b>64</b> for receiving functional fluid, and a pair of box support column members <b>65</b> mounted on the X-axis second slider <b>24</b> and used for height-adjustably supporting the two ends of the periodic flushing unit <b>62</b>. The periodic flushing unit <b>62</b> receives the functional fluid of the periodic flushing that is carried out by discharging/driving all the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> of the head unit <b>42</b> when the drawing process is temporarily paused such as when the workpiece W is replaced. As a result, the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> can be prevented from drying out and the nozzles can be prevented from becoming plugged during a pause in the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The pre-drawing flushing unit <b>61</b> is composed of a pair of pre-drawing flushing boxes <b>63</b> that receive functional fluid, and a pair of box support members (not shown) for supporting the pair of pre-drawing flushing boxes <b>63</b> on the positioning table <b>22</b>. The pre-drawing flushing unit <b>61</b> receives the functional fluid of the pre-drawing flushing that is carried out by discharging/driving all the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> of the head unit <b>42</b> immediately prior to discharging functional fluid onto the workpiece W. The discharge of the functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> immediately prior to drawing can thereby be stabilized and the drawing process can be carried out with good precision on the workpiece W.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, the suction unit <b>16</b> is described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 8</figref>. The suction unit <b>16</b> is provided with 13 cap units <b>71</b> in which 12 head caps <b>81</b> that correspond to the 12 functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> are arranged on the cap plate <b>82</b>; 13 elevator mechanisms <b>73</b> for elevating the cap units <b>71</b> via the a support member <b>83</b>; 13 suction flow channel systems <b>74</b> connected to the cap units <b>71</b> and having a functional fluid suction flow channel; and a suction mechanism <b>75</b> connected to the suction flow channel systems <b>74</b> and having two drainage tanks <b>101</b> that correspond to two pressure levels. The suction unit <b>16</b> is also provided with a compressed-air supply apparatus <b>76</b> for supplying compressed air for control to a later-described pressure control mechanism <b>102</b> and the like, an exhaust apparatus <b>77</b> for exhausting air from various sections, and a functional fluid drainage apparatus <b>78</b> connected to the drainage tanks <b>101</b> and used for draining accumulating functional fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The cap units <b>71</b> are composed of head caps (suction caps) <b>81</b>, two colors each, that correspond to the <b>12</b> functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b>; and a cap plate <b>82</b> on which the above are mounted, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The 12 head caps <b>81</b> are mounted on the cap plate <b>82</b> in the same alignment and the same slope orientation as the 12 functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The elevator mechanism <b>73</b> has an elevator cylinder <b>84</b> for directly elevating the head caps <b>81</b> via the support member <b>83</b>, a pair of linear guides <b>85</b> for guiding the elevating performed by the elevator cylinder <b>84</b>, and a base section <b>86</b> for supporting the above, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The support member <b>83</b> has a support member main unit having a support frame <b>72</b> for supporting the cap units <b>71</b> at the upper end, an open-to-atmosphere frame <b>88</b> for collectively opening open-to-atmosphere valves (not shown) of the 12 head caps <b>81</b>, and a pair of air cylinders <b>89</b>, <b>89</b> for moving the open-to-atmosphere frame <b>88</b> downward. The elevator mechanism <b>73</b> moves the cap units <b>71</b> in three steps between a close contact position for suction, a clearance position for flushing, and a replacement position for replacing the head unit <b>42</b> and replacing (maintenance) the consumable parts of the cap units <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The suction flow channel system <b>74</b> is composed of a cap-side flow channel system <b>90</b> connected to the cap units <b>71</b>, and a tank-side flow channel system <b>91</b> connected to the cap-side flow channel system <b>90</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The cap-side flow channel system <b>90</b> is composed of homogenous flow channels <b>92</b> whose upstream ends are connected to the head caps <b>81</b>, as well as individual suction flow channels <b>93</b> in which the downstream side of the homogenous flow channels <b>92</b> are merged in accordance with the color of the functional fluid via a merge joint <b>108</b>, and a primary manifold <b>94</b> in which the downstream end of the merged individual suction flow channels <b>93</b> are connected. In other words, the two homogenous flow channels <b>92</b>, which are connected to the <b>12</b> head caps <b>81</b> that correspond to the two (12 total) functional droplet discharging heads <b>13</b> for the above-noted six colors, merge via the merge joint <b>108</b> and are connected to the six individual suction flow channels <b>93</b>. The downstream ends of the total of six individual suction flow channels <b>93</b> are connected to the primary manifold <b>94</b>. Individual flow channel on-off valves <b>95</b> for opening and closing the individual suction flow channels <b>93</b> in accordance with the color of the functional fluid are disposed in the merged individual suction flow channels <b>93</b> on the downstream side.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The tank-side flow channel system <b>91</b> is composed of a plurality of distribution suction flow channels <b>96</b> in which the upstream ends are connected to the primary manifold <b>94</b>, as well as two secondary manifolds <b>97</b> to which the downstream ends of the plurality of distribution suction flow channels <b>96</b> are connected, and main suction flow channels <b>98</b> in which the upstream ends are connected to the two secondary manifolds <b>97</b> and the downstream end is connected to the drainage tanks <b>101</b>. Two distribution suction flow channels <b>96</b> per cap unit <b>71</b> are connected in correspondence with two pressure levels, and distribution flow channel on-off valves <b>99</b> for selectively switching between the two pressure levels is disposed in the distribution suction flow channels <b>96</b>. A flow meter <b>100</b> for detecting the flow rate of the functional fluid that flows into the drainage tanks <b>101</b> is disposed in each main suction flow channel <b>98</b>. The individual flow channel on-off valve <b>95</b> and the distribution flow channel on-off valve <b>99</b> are simple on-off valves, and the flow channels can be switched by setting one to &#x201c;on&#x201d; and the other to &#x201c;off&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The primary manifold <b>94</b> and the two secondary manifolds <b>97</b> are composed of discoid manifolds formed in the shape of a funnel in which the upper end is closed by a disc-shaped lid unit. In this case, in the primary manifold <b>94</b>, the downstream end of the six individual suction flow channels <b>93</b> are connected to the lid units so as to be uniformly arranged in the circumferential direction of the discoid manifold. Similarly, in the two secondary manifolds <b>97</b>, the downstream end of the 13 distribution suction flow channels <b>96</b> are connected to the lid units so as to be uniformly arranged in the circumferential direction of the discoid manifolds or so as to be uniformly arranged in a double configuration in the circumferential direction.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The suction mechanism <b>75</b> is provided with two drainage tanks (liquid-suctioning tanks) <b>101</b> for draining (storing) functional fluid that has been suctioned away, and a pair of pressure control mechanisms <b>102</b> for controlling the internal pressure of the drainage tanks <b>101</b>. The internal pressure of the drainage tanks <b>101</b> is individually adjusted by the pressure control mechanism <b>102</b>, and a negative pressure (suctioning) is applied to the head cap <b>81</b> via the distribution suction flow channels <b>96</b>. The functional fluid thus suctioned is thereby trapped in the drainage tanks <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The pressure control mechanism <b>102</b> is provided with a communication flow channel <b>109</b> in which the upstream side is connected to the upper space S of the drainage tanks <b>101</b>; an ejector (suction device) <b>110</b> connected to the communication flow channel <b>109</b>, the compressed-air supply apparatus <b>76</b>, and the exhaust apparatus <b>77</b>; an electropneumatic regulator <b>111</b> is disposed in the flow channel between the ejector <b>110</b> and the compressed-air supply apparatus <b>76</b> and is used for regulating the pressure of the compressed air supplied to the ejector <b>110</b>; and a flow rate sensor <b>112</b> disposed in the line adjacent to the electropneumatic regulator <b>111</b>. In other words, the ejector <b>110</b> introduces compressed air from the compressed-air supply apparatus <b>76</b> to the primary side and connects the secondary side to the upper space S of the drainage tanks <b>101</b>. The pressure is regulated by the electropneumatic regulator <b>111</b>, and the interior of the drainage tanks <b>101</b> is kept at a reduced pressure in which the air inside the communication flow channel <b>109</b> is drawn to the exhaust apparatus <b>77</b> side by the accompanying flow of the compressed air supplied to the ejector <b>110</b>. The drainage tanks <b>101</b> are thereby individually regulated to a suitable suction pressure by the pressure control mechanism <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">One of the two drainage tanks <b>101</b> is used as a high-pressure (first level) tank, and the other is used as a low-pressure (second level) tank. In other words, the high-pressure drainage tank <b>101</b> and the low-pressure drainage tank <b>101</b> are used in a suitable fashion to carry out the suctioning process in an efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The drainage tanks <b>101</b> are described below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 through 10</figref>. Each drainage tank <b>101</b> is composed of a tank main unit <b>105</b> constituting a so-called sealed tank, a pressure gauge <b>106</b> connected to the upper space S of the tank main unit <b>105</b> and used for detecting the internal pressure, and fluid level detection means <b>107</b> disposed to the side of the tank main unit <b>105</b> and used for detecting the fluid level of the accumulated functional fluid, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 through 10</figref>. Each of the drainage tanks <b>101</b> is connected to the main suction flow channel <b>98</b>, the functional fluid drainage apparatus <b>78</b> (communication flow channel <b>109</b>), and the pressure control mechanism <b>102</b>, as described above. The periodic flushing unit <b>62</b> and the pre-drawing flushing unit <b>61</b> described above are connected to the drainage tanks <b>101</b> via flushing flow channels <b>66</b>. The flushing flow channels <b>66</b> are connected to the high-pressure drainage tank <b>101</b> and the low-pressure drainage tank <b>101</b>, respectively, via a flow channel-switching valve <b>67</b>, and are designed to switch connection to one or the other of the drainage tanks <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The fluid level detection means <b>107</b> is provided with a liquid column <b>120</b> that has a transparent section <b>120</b>a and in which the upper and lower ends are in communication with the tank main unit <b>105</b>; and an upper limit sensor <b>121</b>, a lower limit sensor <b>122</b>, and an overflow sensor <b>123</b> that face the transparent section <b>120</b><i>a </i>of the liquid column <b>120</b>. The upper limit sensor <b>121</b> is arranged in a substantially intermediate position of the tank main unit <b>105</b> and is used for detecting the upper limit fluid level of the stored functional fluid. The lower limit sensor <b>122</b> is arranged below the upper limit sensor <b>121</b> and is used for detecting the lower limit fluid level of the stored functional fluid. The overflow sensor <b>123</b> is arranged above the upper limit sensor <b>121</b> and is used for detecting the overflow fluid level of the stored functional fluid. The control device opens a drainage on-off valve <b>79</b> disposed in the flow channel of the functional fluid drainage apparatus <b>78</b> side when the upper limit fluid level is detected, and drains the functional fluid in the functional fluid drainage apparatus <b>78</b>. Conversely, the drainage on-off valve <b>79</b> is closed and drainage is ended when the lower limit fluid level is detected. When an overflow is detected, it is determined that an error has occurred, the driving of the pressure control mechanism <b>102</b> is halted, and the suctioning process is stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The tank main unit <b>105</b> is formed in a substantially rectangular parallelepiped having a funnel-shaped bottom section <b>131</b>, and is erectly supported by a pair of L-shaped support leg pieces <b>132</b>, <b>132</b>. The tank main unit <b>105</b> is provided with a lid section <b>133</b> that forms the ceiling (tank ceiling) <b>133</b><i>a</i>, and a tank section <b>134</b> that forms the peripheral wall and the bottom section <b>131</b>. The lid section <b>133</b> is secured with a screw to the tank section <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The tank section <b>134</b> is provided with an inward protruding rib-shaped frame unit (annular frame unit) <b>141</b> that is provided in a substantially intermediate position of the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a</i>; and a liquid outflow port <b>142</b> opened in the bottom section <b>131</b> and to which the functional fluid drainage apparatus <b>78</b> is connected. Specifically, the liquid outflow port <b>142</b> is opened the top part of the funnel-shaped bottom section <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The frame unit <b>141</b> is provided with an annular rim frame <b>151</b> that follows the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a</i>, as well as a middle crosspiece <b>152</b> that extends from the rim frame <b>151</b> and transverses the middle of the tank. In this manner, the strength of the tank can be increased and the capacity of the tank can be increased with a thin plate material by providing the annular frame unit <b>141</b> in a substantially intermediate position of the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The lid section <b>133</b> (the ceiling <b>133</b><i>a </i>of the tank main unit <b>105</b>) is provided with a first liquid inflow port (liquid inflow port) <b>161</b> opened in the ceiling <b>133</b><i>a </i>of the tank main unit <b>105</b> and connected to the main suction flow channel <b>98</b>; a second liquid inflow port (liquid inflow port) <b>162</b> opened in the ceiling <b>133</b><i>a </i>of the tank main unit <b>105</b> and connected to the flushing flow channel <b>66</b>; a gas outflow port <b>163</b> opened in the ceiling <b>133</b><i>a </i>of the tank main unit <b>105</b> and connected to the pressure control mechanism <b>102</b>; two circular baffle plates <b>164</b> arranged directly below the liquid inflow ports <b>161</b>, <b>162</b>; and two cylindrical guide members <b>165</b> arranged so as to surround the baffle plates <b>164</b>. In other words, the main suction flow channel <b>98</b>, the flushing flow channel <b>66</b>, and the pressure control mechanism <b>102</b> are in communication with the upper space S of the liquid surface A.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The baffle plates <b>164</b> are plates with which the functional fluid that has flowed in from the liquid inflow ports <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> collides, and are horizontally arranged directly below the liquid inflow ports <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> in the upper space S of the liquid surface A. The baffle plates <b>164</b> are suspended from the ceiling <b>133</b><i>a </i>of the tank main unit <b>105</b> by a pair of support rods <b>166</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The upper ends of the guide members <b>165</b> are secured to the ceiling <b>133</b><i>a </i>of the tank main unit <b>105</b>, and the guide members are composed of a cylindrical body, which envelopes the baffle plates <b>164</b> with a predetermined gap therebetween. In other words, the internal peripheral surface (inner surface <b>165</b><i>a </i>of the guide members <b>165</b> are guiding walls that guide functional fluid that has collided with the baffle plates <b>164</b> to the liquid surface A. The lower ends of the guide members <b>165</b> are located substantially at the position of the overflow sensor <b>123</b> (the fluid level of overflow). A through-hole and/or a notched part (not shown) that places the interior and the exterior of the guide members <b>165</b> in communication may be formed in the guide members <b>165</b>, whereby the pressure inside and outside the guide members <b>165</b> can be made uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The functional fluid that has flowed in from the liquid inflow ports <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> collides with the baffle plates <b>164</b> arranged direction below and is thereafter guided by the guide members <b>165</b> from the baffle plates <b>164</b> to the liquid surface A.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The gap surface area formed by a predetermined gap between the guide members <b>165</b> and the baffle plates <b>164</b> and the cross-sectional surface area of the liquid inflow ports <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> are formed to be substantially the same. Functional fluid can thereby be smoothly guided to the liquid surface A while the dispersion of the functional fluid is suppressed, because the flow rate from the liquid inflow ports <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> and the flow rate from the gap between the guide members <b>165</b> and the baffle plates <b>164</b> are made to be substantially the same.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In accordance with this configuration, the falling distance of the functional fluid that has flowed in from the liquid inflow ports <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> can be reduced and the functional fluid is guided to the liquid surface A at a reduced the flow rate. Therefore, dispersion of the functional fluid to the liquid surface A can be suppressed. The liquid inflow ports <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> will not be submerged below the liquid surface A (in the fluid) even when the height of the liquid surface A has risen.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Corrosion of the liquid inflow ports <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> can be suppressed by providing the liquid inflow ports <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> in the ceiling <b>133</b><i>a </i>of the tank main unit <b>105</b>. Also, since the baffle plates <b>164</b> that receive the functional fluid from the liquid inflow ports <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> are horizontally provided, the functional fluid flows down the baffle plates <b>164</b> in a radial fashion. Accordingly, the flow rate of the fluid that has flowed down is dramatically reduced and can thereafter be guided to the guiding wall. A guiding wall (guide member <b>165</b>) is furthermore provided so as to envelope the baffle plate, whereby the guiding wall serves as a liquid-proofing cover, and the functional fluid that has collided with the baffle plate <b>164</b> can be prevented from dispersing to the entire liquid-suctioning tank <b>101</b>. Function as the liquid-proofing cover can be enhanced by furthermore securing the guide members <b>165</b> to the tank ceiling wall <b>133</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the present embodiment, the guide members <b>165</b> are arranged in the upper space S of the liquid surface A, but it is possible to use a configuration in which the lower end of the guide members <b>165</b> extend to the vicinity of a tank bottom wall (bottom section <b>131</b>). In such a case, functional fluid that has collided with the baffle plates <b>164</b> can be guided at a low speed to the liquid surface A without regard for the height of the liquid surface A because the lower ends of the guide members <b>165</b> extend to the vicinity of the tank bottom wall (bottom section <b>131</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Next, first and second modified examples of the drainage tanks <b>101</b> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, with descriptions only being provided for those portions that differ from the embodiment described above. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a cross-sectional view (a) and a plan view (b) of the drainage tanks <b>101</b> of the first modified example. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a cross-sectional view (a) and a longitudinal sectional view (b) of the drainage tanks <b>101</b> of the second modified example.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The drainage tanks <b>101</b> of the first modified example exclude the cylindrical guide members <b>165</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In the drainage tanks <b>101</b> of the first embodiment, the baffle plates <b>164</b> are quadrangularly formed, and three sides of the baffle plates are formed so as to face the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a </i>with a predetermined gap therebetween. Specifically, excluding the right side, three sides of the baffle plate <b>164</b> of the first liquid inflow port <b>161</b> provided on the left side face the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a</i>; and excluding the left side, three sides of the baffle plate <b>164</b> of the second liquid inflow port <b>162</b> provided on the right side face the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a</i>. On the other hand, two flat guiding plates <b>171</b> secured to the ceiling <b>133</b><i>a </i>are provided as a portion of the guide members <b>165</b>, and the flat guiding plates face with a predetermined gap in the side to which the baffle plates <b>164</b> do not face the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a</i>. Accordingly, the functional fluid that has flowed in from the liquid inflow ports <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> collides with the baffle plates <b>164</b> and is thereafter guided from the baffle plates <b>164</b> to the liquid surface A by the flat guiding plates <b>171</b> and the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a</i>. In other words, the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a </i>is configured to double as a portion of the guide members <b>165</b>. In accordance with this configuration, the drainage tanks <b>101</b> can be provided with a simple configuration because the guide members <b>165</b> and the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a </i>of the drainage tanks <b>101</b> can be integrally formed (double as).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The drainage tanks <b>101</b> of the second modified example have a configuration that excludes the cylindrical guide members <b>165</b> and uses a quadrangular flat plate arranged with a downward slope as the baffle plates <b>164</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The downstream ends of the baffle plates <b>164</b> face the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a </i>with a predetermined gap. Accordingly, the functional fluid that has flowed in from the liquid inflow ports <b>161</b>, <b>162</b> collides with the baffle plates <b>164</b>, and is then guided by the baffle plates <b>164</b> to the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a </i>and afterward to the liquid surface A. In other words, the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a </i>is configured to double as the guide members <b>165</b>. In accordance with this configuration, the drainage tanks <b>101</b> can be provided with a simple configuration because the guide members <b>165</b> and the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a </i>of the drainage tanks <b>101</b> can be integrally formed (i.e., be of dual-purpose construction).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the first and second modified examples, the frame unit <b>141</b> acts to reduce the flow rate of the functional fluid that flows down along the tank inner wall <b>134</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In the present embodiment, a configuration is used in which six functional fluid colors; i.e., R (red), G (green), B (blue), C (cyan), M (magenta), and Y (yellow), are supplied to a functional droplet discharging head <b>13</b>, but the number and color type of the functional fluid can be set as desired.</p>
