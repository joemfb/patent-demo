<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to mining methods and apparatus and relates particularly but not exclusively to mining methods and apparatus suitable for longwall mining applications. The invention has application in other mining applications and is not to be limited to longwall mining exclusively.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Hitherto, it has been known to provide mining methods and apparatus to control mining of product from a seam of product in the mine. One known longwall mining method involves observing infrared (IR) radiation from a fresh cut product face at a position immediately adjacent the cutter at the region where a vertical wall of cut intersects with either an upper or lower wall of cut. Such method determines either an upper or lower limit of the seam of the product in the mine by noting if there is an IR temperature increase at the intersection of the vertical cut wall and either the horizontal cut floor or horizontal cut roof. An IR temperature increase occurs when a cutter cuts into strata in the roof or floor immediately above or below the seam of the product. This is because the strata is usually harder than the production in the seam and therefore the strata heats more during the cutting process than the product. Thus, by noting an IR temperature increase at this region, one can determine the upper and/or lower limits of the seam of the product in the mine. Signals can be generated defining the upper limit or lower limit of the seam so that the mining machine can be controlled to cause the cutter to not cut into the overlying or underlying strata.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such methods and apparatus are useful, however, such methods and apparatus do have their failings and it is possible for the overlying or underlying strata to be mined and cut with the product from time to time. This places undue loadings on the mining equipment, dilutes product content and gives rise to other production problems including an increase in dust within the mine which, in turn, affects personnel safety within the mine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECT AND STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There is a need for an improved method and apparatus.</p>

<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the description that follows, a longwall mining application is discussed. As stated previously, the inventive concepts are not to be limited to longwall mining. The inventive concepts can be practised in other mining applications/techniques and the invention is to be considered to extend to those other mining applications/techniques as well.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagrammatic perspective view showing a seam <b>1</b> of product <b>3</b> in a mine. Typically, the product <b>3</b> is coal but it may be other material. Coal is usually deposited in the seam <b>1</b> in layers. The seam <b>1</b> is bounded by upper strata <b>5</b> and lower strata <b>7</b>. The coal may be deposited in layers of different geological materials such as the coal itself, clay or ash or other material of varying thickness and hardness. This layering may appear as thin horizontal line-like bands in the seam <b>1</b> of the coal. These line-like bands are strongly linked to the profile of the seam <b>1</b>. Because these line-like bands are strongly linked to the profile of the seam <b>1</b>, we have realised that by noting one or more of these line-like bands we can provide a means for setting a datum for mining machine horizon control. Typically, the bands are not always clearly visible with the naked eye and some automated process is required to detect the one or more bands and to provide output signals that can be used by a mining machine conventional horizon control circuit for controlling the horizon position of the mining machine and the cutter carried thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a partly mined mine where a mining machine <b>9</b> carries a rotating cutter drum <b>11</b>. The cutter drum <b>11</b> is carried on an arm <b>13</b> that can swing up and down relative to the mining machine <b>9</b>. The mining machine <b>9</b> is carried on a rail means <b>15</b> that extends across the width of the seam <b>1</b> (or at least across width of the intended mining area of the seam <b>1</b>). The mining machine <b>9</b> moves along the rail means <b>15</b> and the arm <b>13</b> is raised or lowered so the rotating cutter drum <b>11</b> cuts product <b>3</b> from the seam <b>1</b>. In some instances, the mining machine <b>9</b> may have a second arm (not shown) and cutter drum <b>11</b> located at the other end of the mining machine <b>9</b>. In this case one of the cutter drums <b>11</b> cuts product <b>3</b> from seam <b>1</b> up towards a roof <b>17</b> of the mine and the other cutter drum <b>11</b> cuts downwardly towards a floor <b>19</b> of the mine. Typically, the roof <b>17</b> is determined at the interface between the seam <b>1</b> and the upper strata <b>5</b>. Similarly, the floor <b>19</b> is determined at the interface between the seam <b>1</b> and the lower strata <b>7</b>. The overhanging roof <b>17</b> is supported by a plurality of chocks <b>21</b>. Only two chocks <b>21</b> have been shown, but in practice, there are many chocks <b>21</b> spaced adjacent one another along the length of the rail means <b>15</b>. The chocks <b>21</b> connect at their lower foot region with the rail means <b>15</b> and can be manipulated to push the rail means <b>15</b> forwardly towards the seam following passing of the mining machine <b>9</b>. The chocks <b>21</b> can be further manipulated to then draw themselves as a whole towards the rail means <b>15</b> moving the upper supporting arms <b>23</b> close to the fresh cut product face <b>25</b> of the seam <b>1</b>. The technique for moving the mining machine <b>9</b> and swinging the cutter drums <b>11</b> and the movement of the chocks <b>21</b> is considered known in the longwall mining arts per se and will not be detailed further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an exploded perspective view showing the seam <b>1</b> of the product <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> without the upper strata <b>5</b>, lower strata <b>7</b>, mining machine <b>9</b> and chocks <b>21</b>. Here, it is clearly shown that the mining machine cutter drum <b>11</b> has cut a fresh cut product face <b>25</b> which comprises an upright wall <b>27</b> that extends from side to side across the seam <b>1</b>. It also comprises an upright end wall <b>29</b> that has a depth into the seam equal to the depth of the cutter drum <b>11</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows a previously cut product face <b>31</b> that extends parallel to the fresh cut product face <b>25</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> also shows a single band or feature <b>33</b> that extends throughout the seam <b>1</b>. In practice, there may be one or more bands or features <b>3</b>, all approximately extending in planes parallel to one another. The bands or features <b>33</b> are generally planar but there are some falls and other contours present due to the nature of layering of the seam <b>1</b>. Typically, the band or feature <b>33</b> is formed from a material deposit that is of greater hardness than that of the product <b>3</b> itself. In some cases, the band or feature <b>33</b> may be visibly discernible with the naked eye but it may also be non visible to the naked eye.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">We have found that if the IR radiation emitted from the fresh cut product face <b>25</b> adjacent the cutter <b>11</b> is observed, then the band or feature <b>33</b> shows a higher IR radiation level than the level of the surrounding product <b>3</b>. This is presumably because the cutter <b>3</b> heats the material of the band or feature <b>33</b> greater than that of the product <b>3</b> during the cutting/mining process. Accordingly, by observing the IR radiation from the fresh cut product face <b>25</b> at a position immediately adjacent the cutter <b>11</b>, it is possible to note for any temperature contrast regions from the IR observation between an upper limit of observation and a lower limit of observation. In this way, if the upper limit is ideally just below the interface between the seam <b>1</b> and the upper strata <b>5</b> and/or the lower strata <b>7</b>, then any noted contrast regions will be indicative of the presence of a band or feature <b>33</b>. The band or feature <b>33</b> position can then be used for horizon controlling the mining machine <b>9</b>. As the band or feature <b>33</b> is generally parallel to the upper or lower limit of the seam <b>1</b> with regard to the roof <b>17</b> or the floor <b>19</b>, providing a datum based on at least one contrast region permits an ideal mechanism for horizon datum setting for mining machine <b>9</b> control.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the example of the preferred embodiment a PAL long wavelength (8-14 micron) thermal IR video camera at 25 fps is used to provide a digital picture image of the fresh cut product face <b>25</b>. It may also be possible to use a CCD video camera which is sensitive to short wavelength (1-3 micron) thermal IR radiation for visually observing the fresh cut product face <b>25</b>. The image capture device may be appropriately chosen to suit the particular product being mined and the mining environment. When a video camera is used, analysis of the resulting digital picture image may be made at each frame or at selected frames say every 25<sup>th </sup>frame. Alternatively, a thermal IR still camera may be utilised and images generated at predetermined time intervals consequent on the speed of movement of the mining machine <b>9</b> across the face of the seam <b>1</b> during the mining operation. In the present example, the imaging device is a digital thermal IR video camera that observes the fresh cut product face <b>25</b> that extends in a direction across the width of the mining of the seam <b>1</b> and every frame is analysed, as this increases sensitivity of the system to low thermal IR values compared to analysing at say every 25<sup>th </sup>frame. In an alternative arrangement the fresh cut product face may be the upright end wall <b>29</b> representing the depth of cut of the cutter drum <b>11</b>. This alternative is to be considered within the scope of the invention. Desirably, the camera views a region of interest in the fresh cut product face <b>25</b> in the immediate vicinity of the cutter drum <b>11</b>. In this way, the residual IR radiation will be expected to be near a peak level and where the temperature will not have dissipated due to passage of time following the passing of the cutter drum <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The infrared sensitivity of a thermal infrared camera has particular advantage over standard visible-wavelength cameras in mining operations. In particular, long wavelength thermal infrared cameras are highly insensitive to occlusions caused by dust. Thermal IR cameras can also function in total darkness which further makes IR cameras of this type suitable for practical implementation. The field of view <b>34</b> encompassing the region of interest <b>35</b> of the camera is likely to show important features of interest that appear in the thermal domain that may not otherwise appear in the visible domain. A typical position for mounting of the camera is on the body of the mining machine <b>9</b> and oriented such that the camera has a viewable aspect at the region of interest of the cutter drum <b>11</b> and any surrounding seam <b>1</b> or strata <b>5</b>,<b>7</b> and so that it is protected from rough operational conditions of mining.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a field of view <b>34</b> encompassing the region of interest <b>35</b> of the digital video camera. In this case, the region of interest <b>35</b> is somewhat trapezoidal in shape. This is consequent on the angle of inclination of the camera relative to the fresh cut product face <b>25</b>. The region of interest <b>35</b> is selected within the picture image <b>34</b> by selecting particular pixels to define the area of the region of interest. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a single band or feature <b>33</b> but other bands or features <b>33</b> may be present.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the setting of a viewing datum <b>37</b> at a distance &#x201c;a&#x201d; from a zero position on a horizontal axis &#x201c;X&#x201d;. The datum position <b>37</b> extends in a vertical axis direction &#x201c;Y&#x201d; up and down the height of the field of view <b>35</b> of the IR radiation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows that the datum position <b>37</b> has a point of intersection with the band or feature <b>33</b> at a height &#x201c;b&#x201d; in the &#x201c;Y&#x201d; (vertical) direction. Thus, by determining a co-ordinate relating to the intersection of the datum position <b>37</b> with the band or feature <b>33</b>, one can note the position of the band or feature <b>33</b> and use the co-ordinate position to horizon control the mining machine <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should be appreciated that as the mining machine <b>9</b> moves across the seam <b>1</b> the field of view <b>34</b> will also move and the position of the one or more bands or features <b>33</b> will be tracked. Thus, as the seam <b>1</b> moves up or down, the band or feature <b>33</b> would be expected to move in unison, and continual control of the mining machine <b>9</b> can be achieved by noting the height of the intersection position of the datum position <b>37</b> with the band or feature <b>33</b>. Thus, should the height position of the band or feature <b>33</b> change then there will be a corresponding change in the co-ordinate position of the intersection which can be used to provide a signal for controlling the mining machine <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> there is shown a plot of IR pixel intensity value levels determined from the camera with respect to the background in the region of interest <b>35</b> in the field of view <b>34</b>. In the example herein, the datum position <b>37</b> is defined by specific pixel locations in the digital picture image obtained from the digital video camera. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the grey scale pixel intensity value levels of the pixels along the datum position <b>9</b> extending in a direction up and down the height of viewing. The graph shows a peak in the pixel grey scale intensity values at a height distance &#x201c;b&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the height distance &#x201c;b&#x201d; is shown along the horizontal axis. Here, a localised peak <b>39</b> appears in the pixel grey scale intensity values at height &#x201c;b&#x201d;. The magnitude of the localised peak <b>39</b> is shown by ordinate &#x201c;d&#x201d;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> also shows that a threshold value having an ordinate &#x201c;d<sub>min</sub>&#x201d; can be set. Thus, if the localised peak <b>39</b> exceeds the threshold value of d<sub>min</sub>, this then represents a temperature contrast region relative to the surrounding background. This, in turn, represents the height positioning of a band or feature <b>33</b>. Typically, d<sub>min </sub>is set to be just above the background threshold level of IR radiation emitted from the fresh cut product face <b>25</b> for the known composition of the product <b>3</b> such as coal. The threshold value represented by d<sub>min </sub>is necessary to cater for instances where the band or feature <b>33</b> is either not present or poorly discriminated from the background. If the largest value of &#x201c;d&#x201d; of the vertical line grey scale pixel intensity data is equal to or greater than a given minimum band detection threshold d<sub>min</sub>, then the index &#x201c;b&#x201d; (along the horizontal axis) associated with the maximum value &#x201c;d&#x201d; is taken to be a valid location of the temperature contrast region (and the band or feature) in the image. If the value &#x201c;d&#x201d; is less than the threshold value d<sub>min </sub>then no height determination is calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Any tracking of the band or feature <b>33</b> needs to take into account errors and observation noise associated with the detection and/or localisation processes. This is particularly important in cases where the band or feature <b>33</b> appears relatively faint in the IR image. In some cases, the intensity values may be so high with respect to the background that no special processing may be required. In the case where there may be a relatively faint IR localised peak <b>39</b>, then a robust filter tracking feature may be implemented. A &#x201c;Kalman&#x201d; filter represents a particularly useful robust filter and is well known filter for signal processing.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A Kalman filter recursively generates parameter estimates using a state vector, system model, and observation model. For this 1D position-velocity tracking scenario, the state vector is given by a (2&#xd7;1) vector</p>

is the (2&#xd7;2) model matrix describing system evolution, &#x394;T represents the time between adjacent image frames, and where w(t) is a (2&#xd7;1) matrix representing system perturbation to allow tracking of the marker band features. The matrix w(t) is assumed to be distributed as a zero-mean Gaussian noise process with (2&#xd7;2) covariance matrix Q. The observation equation is given by b(t)=H x(t)+u(t), where b(t) is the height estimate generated by the band or feature <b>33</b> detector and location process at time instant t, H=[1 0] is the (1&#xd7;2) vector, x(t) is the state vector as above, and u(t) represents the uncertainty associated with the marker band location algorithm. The value u(t) is assumed to be distributed as a zero-mean Gaussian process with variance R.
</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">During initiation of a tracking process, the respective elements of the state vector are assigned the current band or feature <b>33</b> height and zero velocity, the diagonal elements of the system model covariance matrix Q are assigned to 0.01 representing a good model for the typically slowly evolving dynamics of band or feature <b>33</b>, and the variance associated with observation equation R is set to a relatively large value of 10.0 following current practice to ensure convergence. The Kalman filter is implemented using standard prediction and update steps, the details of which are widely available in open literature.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The Kalman filter-derived estimates provide a superior representation to the observed band or feature <b>33</b> dynamics and show high noise immunity to unfiltered estimates. The Kalman filtering step, though not essential, proves particularly useful in cases where the intensity of the band or feature <b>33</b> is relatively faint (i.e., low SNR) as it represents a robust and deterministic method for dealing with noise and measurement uncertainty.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It should be appreciated that there may be many grey scale pixel intensity level peaks along the datum, each peak representing a different band or feature <b>33</b>. Further, these peaks may have different peak pixel intensity values. These may all be processed to determine if they exceed the threshold, and all of these, or selected ones of these used for horizon control.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a plot of the band or feature <b>33</b>-V-mining machine <b>9</b> position. The actual noting of the height co-ordinate of the band or feature <b>33</b> is inherently a spatial quantity. It is convenient in a mining machine operation to refer the band or feature <b>33</b> height co-ordinate in terms of position instead of time. This is easily done by noting the values of the height of the band or feature <b>33</b> against the mining machine <b>9</b> position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a typical output from a tracking algorithm (to be referred to later) showing the band or feature <b>33</b> height as a function of horizontal face position of the mining machine <b>9</b> across the width of seam <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a block schematic diagram showing components of apparatus used for providing a signal output for mining machine horizon control. Here, the apparatus utilises the concepts hereinbefore described. A thermal IR digital video camera <b>41</b> observes the fresh cut product face <b>25</b> and has a field of view <b>34</b> encompassing a region of interest <b>35</b>. Digital output signals <b>43</b> are supplied to an image acquisition component <b>45</b> for receiving the IR image signals of the fresh cut mined product face <b>25</b> immediately adjacent a mining machine cutter drum <b>11</b>. Signals <b>47</b> are output from the image acquisition component <b>45</b> and supplied to a signal processing component <b>49</b> where the IR image signals in the region of interest <b>35</b> are noted for at least one temperature contrast region between an upper part of the image and a lower part of the image and between an upper limit of the seam and a lower limit of the seam. If at least one temperature contrast region is determined, then signals <b>51</b> are provided to a height position component <b>53</b> where a co-ordinate of the height position is calculated of the at least one noted temperature contrast region. Height position co-ordinate signals <b>55</b> are then provided to a signal output component <b>57</b> to provide an output signal <b>59</b> of the calculated height position of the at least one temperature contrast region so that that output signal <b>59</b> can be used in a mining machine horizon controlling circuit <b>61</b>. The various components referred to in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can be discreet components or can be components within a computer device. Typically, the components are configured within a computer device using software dedicated for the purpose of configuring the computer to perform the functions required. Whilst the height position co-ordinate has been described as 1D, the co-ordinate may be 2D or 3D by appropriately inputting data signals of the absolute position of the mining machine <b>9</b> within the mine. Such signals can be obtained from inertial navigation components associated with the mining machine <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an algorithm of the processes involved. Here, step <b>1</b> determines a mining machine position. A suitable position measurement apparatus is commonly provided on most large coal mining equipment such as longwall shearers or continuous miners. Thus, signals can be derived at step <b>1</b> representing the position of the mining machine <b>9</b>. Independent known mining machine positioning means may be utilised to provide mining machine position signals if required. At step <b>2</b>, the thermal infrared images are received using a direct-digital interface or by applying standard analogue to digital conversion techniques in the event the image is an analogue image. A typical thermal image is one shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> herein. It should be noted that from the point of data acquisition, the output from a thermal IR video camera is analogous to a standard still image camera, that is, a sequence of still images in digital or analogue form. The algorithm shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> processes each image frame sequentially, nominally regardless of acquisition rate. This frame selection is an arbitrary choice and is not meant to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At step <b>3</b> machine position change sensing is determined. This is because unless the mining machine <b>9</b> has advanced across the face of the seam <b>3</b>, there would be no need to reprocess an existing image acquired by the camera <b>41</b>. Thus, signals from the machine positioning are compared to note if the machine <b>9</b> has moved and so that the image signals can be processed at step <b>4</b>. In step <b>4</b>, if a band or feature <b>33</b> is present, then it indicates a regional feature relative to the local background. Thus, a data set is formed by tracking the image pixel value at the datum position <b>37</b>. This results in the generation of a data set similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. At step <b>5</b>, the localised peak <b>39</b> is determined by the intensity levels of the grey scale pixel values along the vertical datum line&#x2014;up and down the height of viewing of the field of view <b>34</b> at the datum position <b>37</b>. The brightest point in the pixel intensity values represents a localised peak <b>39</b>. Step <b>6</b> determines if the peak <b>39</b> exceeds the set threshold represented by d<sub>min </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). At step <b>7</b> a robust tracking filter such as the Kalman filter described previously is applied. At step <b>8</b>, the height of the localised peak <b>39</b> (height &#x201c;b&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) is determined. It may be desirable to express this height value in other co-ordinate systems such as mining machine co-ordinate positions. This can be achieved by direct application of camera calibration techniques knowing the position of the camera on the mining machine <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">It should be noted herein that the description so far relates to detecting a single band or feature <b>33</b> in the field of view <b>34</b> region of interest <b>35</b>. Multiple bands or features <b>33</b> may be detected and the algorithm suitably processed to enable relative tracking of two or more of the noted bands or features <b>33</b>. Thus, one or more of the noted bands or features <b>33</b> may be used to control for mining machine horizon control. This is particularly useful where one or more bands or features <b>33</b> may disappear in the region of interest <b>35</b> whilst other bands or features may remain.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At step <b>9</b> the height co-ordinates determined at step <b>8</b> are transformed as a function of machine position as represented by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> herein. Thus, an output signal <b>63</b> can be provided to a mining machine <b>9</b> for horizon control. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> there is shown a view similar to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> but also showing a IR image second region of interest <b>67</b>. Here, the second region of interest <b>67</b> is arranged to encompass an intersection of the vertical fresh cut face <b>25</b> with the roof <b>17</b> or floor <b>19</b>. The area and position of the second region of interest is defined by pixel locations in the image of the field of view <b>34</b>. Thus, a second region of interest <b>67</b> supplies further IR image signals to note for any temperature contrast region at the intersection of the vertical cut face <b>25</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and either or both the horizontal cut face of the roof <b>17</b> or floor <b>19</b>. Here, any noted IR temperature contrast region defines the intersection of the seam <b>1</b> with the upper strata <b>5</b> and/or the lower strata <b>7</b>. Thus, height position signals can be generated of those further IR image signals from the fresh cut product face to be used with the signals of the band or features <b>33</b> previously described for horizon control. Thus, in this case, the further IR image signals can be processed to provide height positions of the intersection of the vertical cut face <b>25</b> with the roof <b>17</b> or floor <b>19</b> to limit the extent of upward and/or downward movement of the arm <b>13</b> to, in turn, control the upper limit of seam mining and lower limit of seam mining. In this case, a second output signal is provided indicating the determined height co-ordinate position of the temperature contrast region at the intersection.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a block schematic diagram of an arrangement having the band or feature <b>33</b> sensing apparatus described previously, and apparatus for noting the intersection of the vertical cut face with the roof <b>17</b> or the floor <b>19</b>. In this example one IR video camera <b>41</b> is used for region of interest <b>35</b> and a further IR video camera <b>69</b> is used for the second region of interest <b>67</b>. In the preceding discussion a single IR camera <b>41</b> was utilised to encompass both regions of interest <b>35</b>, <b>67</b>. In this example the second IR video camera <b>69</b> has been utilised to show that the concepts need not be limited to a single IR camera implementation. The left hand side components of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> repeat the components shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> herein and will not be described further. On the right hand side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> there is shown a second thermal IR video camera <b>69</b> having a field of view <b>67</b>. Digital output signals <b>71</b> are fed to an image acquisition component <b>73</b>. Signals <b>75</b> are output from an image acquisition component <b>73</b> and provided to the signal processing component <b>49</b>. Here the signals are fed to a height position component <b>53</b> where the height co-ordinate positions of the temperature contrast regions that define the intersection of the vertical cut face <b>25</b> of the seam with the roof <b>17</b> and/or floor <b>19</b> are calculated. Here, the signals are output to the signal output component to define co-ordinate position signals which are supplied to the mining machine control circuit <b>61</b> for controlling the mining machine.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a processing algorithm for detecting the fresh cut product face <b>25</b> intersection with the roof <b>17</b> or floor <b>19</b>. This algorithm requires two parameters to be established during initial calibration. The first parameter corresponds to a threshold above which the coal seam interface with the roof <b>17</b> or floor <b>19</b> is assumed to have been reached. A detection threshold is set at 70% of the maximum intensity value and represents an appropriate initial choice. The second parameter is the seam extraction height which can be readily determined from the mining machine <b>9</b> itself using known processes.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At step <b>1</b> the machine position is ascertained according to the same processes described in relation to step <b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. At step <b>2</b> image acquisition is performed and this again is identical to step <b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> but from a different camera or region of interest within the image from a single camera. At step <b>3</b> a mean intensity value of all pixels in the image of the field of view is determined. If the mean intensity value changes, as noted by an averaging process of all the intensity value levels of the pixels in the image from the second camera <b>69</b>, then it can be determined that there has been an intersection of the cutter drum <b>11</b> with the roof <b>17</b> or the floor <b>19</b>. At step <b>4</b>, a maximum mean pixel intensity value is stored. Such value may change significantly as the cutting drum <b>11</b> moves through segments of harder material (eg. rock) and provides a robust measure of any thermal intensity values. The maximum mean value is stored for the current machine <b>9</b> position.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">At step <b>5</b> a process is invoked to determine if the machine horizontal position has changed. This is identical to step <b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. At step <b>6</b>, the magnitude of the mean intensity value computed at step <b>6</b> is compared to a pre-determined interface detection threshold. If the mean value is above the coal interface detecting threshold, then the coal seam interface is considered to be breached. Conversely if the mean value is below the coal interface then the mining machine is assumed to be cutting within the seam <b>1</b>. At step <b>8</b> an output is provided of the seam interface positions of the interface with the roof <b>17</b> or the floor <b>19</b>. This provides a maximum height for mining of the machine or a lower height for mining of the seam. In step <b>9</b>, a mid point output signal is provided if no coal interface intersection is determined. This provides a suitable sentinel signal (eg. half the extracted seam height) to provide an output suitable for use in a horizon control system. Alternatively, a suitable sentinel signal can be established to run the mining machine control system in an open-loop mode.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The band or feature <b>33</b> tracking system described herein, and the coal interface detector for detecting the interface of the vertical fresh cut product face <b>25</b> with the roof <b>17</b> or the floor <b>19</b> provides two complimentary in-situ measures of the seam <b>1</b> behaviour. Whilst the outputs of the systems can be applied independently, they can also be usefully combined to provide a robust predictive-reactive sensing capability for use in real time horizon control of a mining machine <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows how the outputs of the band or feature <b>33</b> tracking and the interface detection systems can be combined to provide a robust datum for horizon control. Thus, if it should occur that a primary and preferred mode of operation using the band or feature <b>33</b> is not available, then an output selector can be operated to use the reactive (and coarser) coal seam boundary interface signals for horizon control. If the band or feature <b>33</b> tracking signals are provided and no interface intersection signals are provided, the system can output, depending on mine site's specific horizon control policy, the last band or feature <b>33</b> output signals, half seam extraction height signals or zero signals. Here, at step <b>1</b>, a marker band assessment is made to determine if a band or feature <b>33</b> is present. If present, an output height signal is provided at step <b>2</b>. If no band or feature <b>33</b> is determined, then at step <b>3</b> an assessment is made as to whether a floor coal interface is detected. If it is detected then an output signal is determined to indicate the height of the floor. If no floor interface is detected then an assessment is made at step <b>5</b> as to whether a roof intersection is detected. If it is detected then an output signal is provided to indicate the height of the roof <b>17</b>. If no interface is detected then step <b>7</b> provides the last known band height output signals.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In order to achieve horizon control of a mining machine such as a longwall mining shearer, the output of the band or feature <b>33</b> tracking system is fed into an existing mining machine shearer arm <b>13</b> control system. The arms <b>13</b> are the principal method for adjusting the horizon (horizontal) position of the longwall shearer machine <b>9</b> as it extracts product <b>3</b> such as coal. Corrections to the mining horizon are usually applied on each backwards and forwards traverse cycle of the mining machine <b>9</b> along the rail means <b>15</b>. The band or feature <b>33</b> height signals may be acted upon by the control system in an instantaneous manner using the observed heights. This is because any variation in the height is expected to be quite minimal. If required, the height locations at various positions along the face of the mine may be stored in memory and subsequently retrieved on a next backwards or forward traverse cycle of the mining machine <b>9</b> where they can be retrieved and compared with any newly measured height positions of the bands or features <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Account may be taken of the dynamics of the mining machine <b>9</b> control system noting the specific mechanical limitations of the cutter drum <b>11</b> and any desired horizon profile rate of change to provide a safe and practical control.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a block schematic diagram showing a general arrangement for the automation of the horizon control in a mining machine <b>9</b>. A desired vertical location within the seam <b>1</b> is typically a fixed offset from the band or feature <b>33</b> height location. Here at step <b>1</b> a desired horizon set point is established. At step <b>2</b> a command (position error) signal is provided to the arm position control system at step <b>3</b>. At step <b>4</b> an actual vertical location of the mining machine <b>9</b> is determined within the seam. At step <b>5</b>, the combined band and feature <b>33</b> system and the interface detection system provide a vertical position sensing capability to provide for a control loop.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A system of the above type is useful in automated control systems for mining coal in a longwall mining and minimises equipment damage whilst increasing productivity and improving personnel safety. Using the methods herein no external reference infrastructure such as beacons, markers, stripes are required for operation. Thus, there is increased practicality and robustness of mining machines utilising the concepts herein. The principles herein can operate in either real-time or offline. The techniques disclosed herein represent automatic, online, self-regulating methods for roof or floor detection and band or feature <b>33</b> detection for horizontal control. Further, the co-ordinate position output signals of the band or feature <b>33</b> positions or the interface positions of the roof <b>17</b> or floor <b>19</b> can be used in mining survey processes to greatly enhance mining operations.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">It should also be appreciated that the band or feature <b>33</b> system described herein can be utilised for identifying thermally identifiable structure in a mined product when mining that product from a mine. Thus, by noting the IR image signals of an observed position of a freshly exposed cut product face immediately adjacent the mining machine cutter, one can obtain signals which can be useable to identify thermally identifiable structure in the mined product. The thermally identifiable structure can be identified by either noting the size magnitude (i.e. the number of high intensity pixel) of the at least one temperature contrast region, or noting the magnitude of the at least one temperature contrast region above a temperature threshold. An output signal can be provided from an output component to indicate thermally identifiable structure in the mined product. In this example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the necessary signal processing components where the output signal <b>59</b> provides an indication of the thermally identifiable product. A specific circuit diagram is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Here, the digital video camera <b>41</b> will provide output signals <b>43</b> to the image acquisition component <b>45</b>. The image acquisition component <b>45</b> will process the signals <b>43</b> in the same way as explained in relation to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Output signals <b>47</b> will be provided to the signal processing component <b>49</b> which can sense if the IR temperature pixel intensity values exceed a particular threshold, and provide an output signal <b>51</b> to the signal output component <b>57</b> which will, in turn, provide an output signal <b>59</b> indicating the presence or absence of thermally identifiable structure in the mined product. Thus, in this embodiment, the signal processing component <b>49</b> can note either the size magnitude of the at least one temperature contrast region, or if the temperature contrast region has a magnitude above a temperature threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Modifications may be made to the invention as would be apparent to persons skilled in the mining machine control arts. These and other modifications may be made without departing from the ambit of the invention the nature of which is to be determined from the foregoing description.</p>
