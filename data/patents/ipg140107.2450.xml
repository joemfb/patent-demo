<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Over the past 25 years, the amount of DNA sequence information that has been generated and deposited into Genbank has grown exponentially. Many of the next-generation sequencing technologies use a form of sequencing by synthesis (SBS), wherein specially designed nucleotides and DNA polymerases are used to read the sequence of chip-bound, single-stranded DNA templates in a controlled manner. To attain high throughput, many millions of such template spots are arrayed across a sequencing chip and their sequence is independently read out and recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Devices, equations, and computer systems for forming and using arrays of material on a substrate for DNA sequencing are known (e.g., Ju et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,664,079; Pirrung et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,143,854; Hubbell et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,71,639; Lipshutz et al., U.S. Pat.

(2008) 36(4):e25). However, there is a continued need for methods and compositions for increasing the fidelity of sequencing nucleic acid sequences.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention provides methods, compositions, devices, systems and kits are described including, without limitation, reagents, mixtures, data processing steps, algorithms, computer readable media, and computer programs, for determining the identity of nucleic acids in nucleotide sequences using, for example, data obtained from sequencing by synthesis methods. The methods of the invention include reducing and/or correcting one or more phenomena that are encountered during nucleotide sequencing, such as using sequencing by synthesis methods. These phenomena include, without limitation, sequence lead, sequence lag, spectral crosstalk, light from neighboring spots, and noise resulting from variations in illumination and/or filter responses.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a set of data processing steps that may be used to analyze images of a hexagonal array of spots or beads on a surface. In one embodiment, the steps comprise a) field flattening and background subtraction, b) spot location in the array, c) image sharpening, d) spot brightness determination, e) neighbor influence elimination, and f) color crosstalk elimination. Each of these steps is described in more detail below. Of course, in one embodiment, the present invention contemplates using a subset of these steps (in the same order or in a different order) as well as additional processing steps. The result of the analysis may be used to make measurements of the output of four different fluorescent dyes for each spot in the array. The methods described may also be generalized for a rectangular or other shaped arrays rather than a hexagonal array.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for determining an identity of a nucleic acid at an interrogation position in a nucleotide sequence from data acquired from one or more channels, comprising a) obtaining a data set for one or more probe intensities at one or more nucleic acid positions in the sequence, wherein each probe corresponds to a nucleic acid, b) determining the ratio contribution to probe intensity at the interrogation position from probe intensities at the interrogation position and at one or both of i) at least one subsequent nucleic acid positions in the sequence, and ii) at least one preceding nucleic acid positions in the sequence, and c) applying the ratio contribution to probe intensity to the data set to arrive at an identity for a nucleic acid at the interrogation position in the nucleotide sequence. In a particular embodiment, the step of determining the ratio contribution to probe intensity comprises measuring the rate (that is, the fraction of template molecules in an ensemble of identical template molecules) at which a lag, such as Gi, occurs at one or more nucleotide position in the nucleotide sequence, such as at each nucleotide position in the nucleotide sequence. In another embodiment, the step of determining the ratio contribution to probe intensity comprises measuring the rate (fraction) at which a lead, such as Di, occurs at one or more nucleotide positions in the nucleotide sequence. In yet another embodiment, the method further comprises calling a nucleic acid at the interrogation position in the nucleotide sequence. In a further embodiment, the method comprises repeating steps b) and c) to arrive at an identity for a nucleic acid at more than one interrogation position in the nucleotide sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">While not intending to limit the invention's method to particular steps, in one embodiment, the method further comprises a) applying a sequence lead-lag compensation equation to determine the ratio contribution to probe intensity from probe at i) the interrogation position, ii) each position preceding the interrogation position, and iii) each position subsequent to the interrogation position, and b) summing up the ratio contribution to probe intensity. In an alternative embodiment, the step of applying of the ratio contribution to probe intensity comprises a) comparing probe intensities from the one or more channels at the interrogation position, b) selecting the highest probe intensity of the compared probe intensities, and c) calling a nucleic acid, which corresponds to the selected probe, at the interrogation position.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is not intended to limit the invention to a particular mathematical formula. Nonetheless, in one embodiment, the method comprises applying a sequence lead-lag compensation equation to the ratio contribution to probe intensity at a plurality of positions in the sequence. In one particular embodiment, the sequence lead-lag compensation equation is determined by applying equation</p>

In a particular embodiment, the nucleic acid comprises a base selected from the group of adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U), and the probe is detectable using any means such as color in the visible spectrum (e.g., fluorescence), radioactivity, and the like.
</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0043">While not intending to limit the invention's methods to particular steps, in one embodiment, the methods further comprise field flattening of background data for the data set. This may be accomplished by, for example, a) obtaining a first data set for a plurality of pixel intensities of a first raw image of a probe at a first concentration on a solid support, wherein the first raw image is produced using a first spectral filter for detecting a first probe, b) obtaining a second data set for a plurality of pixel intensities of a second smoothed image of the probe uniformly spread on the solid support or other uniformly radiating substrate, wherein the second smoothed image is produced using a low pass filter, c) determining a field flattening intensity value for a plurality of pixels of the first raw image, and d) generating a third field flattened image of the probe on the solid support using the field flattening intensity of the plurality of pixels, wherein the correlation of intensity of a plurality of pixels to their spatial location on the third field flattened image is reduced compared to the intensity of a plurality of pixels at a corresponding location on the first raw image. In a particular embodiment, the background intensities are removed from both the first and second data sets so that the lowest intensity data point is at 0.</p>

<br/>
In one embodiment, the scale factor M<sub>x0,y0 </sub>may also include a factor accounting for different exposure times or lighting intensities. In another embodiment, such as where a camera system has a proportional response to changes in exposure times or lighting conditions, the following equation may be used

In a further embodiment, the method further comprises repeating steps a) to d), using a second spectral filter for detecting a second probe. In an alternative embodiment, the method further comprises repeating steps a) to d), using the probe at a second concentration on the solid support. The solid support is exemplified, but not limited to, a microscope slide and silicon chip.

<p id="p-0025" num="0067">The invention further provides an algorithm for processing data for nucleic acids in a nucleotide sequence, wherein the data is acquired from one or more channels, the algorithm comprising a) determining the ratio contribution to probe intensity in the one or more channels for one or more interrogation positions, from probe intensities at the interrogation position and at one or both of i) at least one subsequent nucleic acid positions in the sequence, and ii) at least one preceding nucleic acid positions in the sequence, b) processing data from the one or more channels to correct for sequence lead and sequence lag, and c) reconstructing the data in the one or more channels. In one embodiment, the step of processing data comprises applying the ratio contribution to probe intensity to determine, for the probe at the one or more interrogation positions, a sequence lead-lag compensation equation. Without limiting the invention to any particular equation, in one embodiment, the sequence lead-lag compensation equation is determined by applying equation</p>

While not necessary, it may be desirable to also include field flattening of background data in the algorithm and/or reducing spectral crosstalk between the data comprised in a plurality of channels. Dephasing correction (i.e., correction for lead-lag effects), field flattening and spectral crosstalk correction may be carried out in any order. Thus, in one embodiment, the field flattening is carried out before spectral crosstalk correction. In an alternative embodiment, spectral crosstalk correction is carried out before dephasing correction.

In a particular embodiment, the order of the data correction methods described herein is 1) field flattening, 2) color crosstalk correction and 3) dephasing correction. When field flattening precedes color crosstalk correction, then the same crosstalk parameters may be used for the entire image. When color crosstalk correction precedes dephasing correction, the dephasing correction will be more accurate as the intensity data from the different channels will more precisely represent actual probe intensities.

<p id="p-0044" num="0129">As noted above, the present invention contemplates reducing some of these phenomenon that make accurate base calling difficult. One problem addressed in one embodiment of the present invention is the problem created by using a cleaving agent. In one embodiment, a cleaving agent scavenger is employed to address leftover cleaving agent which might prematurely cleave in the next cycle. Thus, the present invention contemplates in one embodiment a method of incorporating labeled nucleotides into nucleic acid, comprising: a) providing a plurality of nucleic acid template molecules, a polymerase, a cleaving agent, a cleaving agent scavenger, and a plurality of nucleotide analogues wherein each nucleotide analogue is labeled with a unique label and contains a removable chemical moiety capping the 3&#x2032;-OH group; b) incorporating a first nucleotide analogue with said polymerase; c) detecting the label of the incorporated nucleotide analogue; d) removing the chemical moiety of the incorporated nucleotide analogue capping the 3&#x2032;-OH group with said cleaving agent; and f) incorporating a second nucleotide analogue in the presence of said cleaving agent scavenger. With regard to step f), the scavenger can, by way of example, be put into the solution used to incorporate nucleotides in the next round (indeed, in one embodiment, the present invention contemplates compositions comprising 1) the scavenger(s) and one or more labeled or unlabeled nucleotides, 2) the scavenger(s) and polymerase, 3) the scavenger(s) and one or more nucleotides with or without 3-OH capping groups). Alternatively, the scavenger can be in a separate solution that is used prior to the incorporation solution (with residual scavenger present at the time of incorporation). In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates wash steps after step b) and after step d).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0130">It is not intended that the present invention be limited by the nature of the chemistry of the removable chemical moiety. A variety of chemistries are contemplated (and described below in more detail). In one embodiment, said removable chemical moiety comprises a disulfide bond. In another embodiment, said removable chemical moiety comprises an azido group (e.g. an azidomethyl ether). It is preferred that said moiety capping the 3&#x2032;-OH is not a fluorescent moiety.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0131">It is also not intended that the present invention be limited by the nature of the cleaving agent. In the case of azido-group-containing nucleotides (e.g. 3&#x2032;-O-azidomethyl ether nucleotides), several types of cleaving agents can be used. In principle, any reducing agent capable of converting the azido group into an amine is suitable for this purpose. The amine undergoes spontaneous conversion to hydroxyl group to enable next nucleotide incorporation. Examples of cleaving agents include: a) Catalytic hydrogenation over PtO2 or Pd/C; b) Reduction with LiAlH4, HCO<sub>2</sub>NH<sub>4</sub>-10% Pd/C, NaBH<sub>4</sub>/CoCl<sub>2</sub>.6 H<sub>2</sub>O, Zn/NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, Fe/NH<sub>4</sub>Cl; and c) Reduction with phosphines; e.g. tri-n-butyl-phosphine, triphenyl phosphine and its sulfonated versions (i.e., tris(3-sulfophenyl)-phosphine, TPPTS), and tri(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and its salts. Most preferred cleaving reagents are soluble in water and are highly selective reducing agents. Water soluble phosphines are particularly preferred. In one embodiment, said cleaving agent is a phosphine Tris(2-carboxy-ethyl)phosphine.</p>

In one embodiment, said cleaving agent scavenger comprises a disulfide bond (e.g. cystamine or one of the other disulfide-containing compounds shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>). Cystamine is also known as 2,2&#x2032;-Dithiobisethanamine, 2-Aminoethyl disulfide, or Decarboxycystine, and is available commercially from Sigma-Aldrich. Alternatively, the present invention contemplates in one embodiment that said cleaving agent scavenger comprises an azido group (e.g. an azidomethyl group, an azidoethyl ether group, etc.). In a preferred embodiment, said scavenger is 11-Azido-3,6,9-trioxaundecan-1-amine (which is also known as: 1-Amino-11-azido-3,6,9-trioxaundecane, 2-{2-[2-(2-Azidoethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy}ethylamine, or O-(2-Aminoethyl)-O&#x2032;-(2-azidoethyl)-diethylene glycol, and which is available commercially from Sigma-Aldrich).</p>

In one embodiment, said cleavable linker comprises a disulfide bond. As noted above, the present invention contemplates embodiments wherein the chemistries for the cleavage at the two cites is the same, as well as embodiments where it is different. For example, in one embodiment, said removable chemical moiety comprises an azido group (e.g. an azidomethyl ether) and said cleavable linker (which attaches the label) comprises a disulfide bond. In another embodiment, this is reversed (the cleavable linker comprises an azido group and the removable chemical moiety comprises a disulfide bond.</p>

However, in one embodiment, each of said four different nucleotide analogues comprises a unique (preferably cleavable) label, said label selected from the group consisting of BODIPY, Rhodamine, Carboxyrhodamine, and Cyanine (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, which shows these labels in the context of a cleavable disulfide bond).</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0165">It is also not intended that the composition be limited by the chemistry of the removable chemical moiety, which may, by way of example, comprise a disulfide bond or an azido group (e.g. an azidomethyl ether). The chemistry may be the same or different vis-&#xe0;-vis the cleavable linker. For example, said removable chemical moiety comprises an azido group and said cleavable linker comprises a disulfide bond.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0166">In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a composition comprising i) a first plurality of nucleotide analogues comprising four different (for example, in one embodiment, the four nucletodes are either (i) aA, aC, aG, and aT, or (ii) aA, aC, aG, and aU) nucleotide analogues, wherein each different nucleotide analogue is labeled with a unique (preferably cleavable) label and contains a removable chemical moiety capping the 3&#x2032;-OH group; and ii) a second plurality of nucleotide analogues comprising four different (for example, in one embodiment, the four nucletodes are either (i) aA, aC, aG, and aT, or (ii) aA, aC, aG, and aU) nucleotide analogues, wherein each nucleotide analogue is unlabeled and contains a removable chemical moiety capping the 3&#x2032;-OH group. Again, this composition may further comprise a polymerase and it is preferred that the reagents (e.g. said nucleotide analogues and optionally said polymerase) are in solution.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0167">It is not intended that the composition be limited by the particular linkages. However, in a preferred embodiment, the nucleotide analogues selected from the group consisting of cytosine, thymine, deaza-adenine and deaza-quanine and each comprising a unique (preferably) label attached through a cleavable linker to a 5-position of cytosine or thymine or to a 7-position of deaza-adenine or deaza-guanine.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0168">In one embodiment, the second plurality of nucleotide analogues is present in said solution at a high concentration than said first plurality of nucleotide analogues. In one embodiment, said second plurality of nucleotide analogues is present at a concentration between 1 uM and 100 uM. In one embodiment, said first plurality of nucleotide analogues is present at a concentration between 1 nM and 1 uM.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0169">In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates kits, said kits comprising a mixture of labeled and unlabeled nucleotide analogues (preferably both containing groups capping the 3&#x2032;-OH&#x2014;such as an azido group) and (optionally) polymerase. In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a mixture of 4 labeled and 4 unlabeled nucleotide analogues as herein described) and (optionally) polymerase. The mixture can be provided dry or in solution in the kit (along with appropriate instructions for extension reactions). Preferably, the unlabeled nucleotide analogues are present in the mixture in a greater amount than the labeled nucleotide analogues.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0170">The above-indicated solutions provide advantages in incorporation reactions. Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a method of incorporating labeled nucleotides into nucleic acid, comprising: a) providing i) a reaction chamber comprising plurality of nucleic acid template molecules bound to a solid support, ii) a solution comprising a first plurality of nucleotide analogues wherein each nucleotide analogue is labeled with a unique (preferably cleavable) label and contains a removable chemical moiety capping the 3&#x2032;-OH group, and a second plurality of nucleotide analogues wherein each nucleotide analogue is unlabeled and contains a removable chemical moiety capping the 3&#x2032;-OH group; and iii) polymerase; b) introducing said solution into said reaction chamber under conditions wherein a nucleotide analogue of said first plurality of nucleotide analogues is incorporated by said polymerase (e.g. the polymerase can be added separately or together with other reagents; regardless, it is preferred that said polymerase is in said solution prior to step b); and c) detecting the label of the incorporated nucleotide analogue. The method may comprise additional steps (cleavage of the capping group, washing, etc.) and may repeat steps (e.g. in order to incorporate subsequent, e.g. a second, third, fourth, etc., nucleotide analogues).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0171">It is not intended that the present invention be limited by where the first (or subsequent) nucleotides are incorporated. In one embodiment, they are incorporated into a primer [e.g. prior to step b), the present invention contemplates in one embodiment hybridizing a primer to said plurality of nucleic acid template molecules, such that said first nucleotide analogue is incorporated into said primer at step b)]. In another embodiment, they are incorporated into the template molecules [e.g. said nucleic acid template molecules comprise a self-priming hairpin, such that said first nucleotide analogue is incorporated into said template molecules at step b)].</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0172">In one embodiment, the second plurality of nucleotide analogues is present in said solution at a high concentration than said first plurality of nucleotide analogues. In one embodiment, said second plurality of nucleotide analogues is present at a concentration between 1 uM and 100 uM. In one embodiment, said first plurality of nucleotide analogues is present at a concentration between 1 nM and 1 uM.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0173">In a preferred embodiment, said first plurality of nucleotide analogues comprises four different nucleotide analogues and said second plurality of nucleotide analogues comprises four different nucleotide analogues. In one embodiment, each of said four different nucleotide analogues of said first plurality of labeled analogues comprises a unique label, said label selected from the group consisting of BODIPY, Rhodamine, Carboxyrhodamine, and Cyanine.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0174">Again, it is not intended that the present invention be limited by the nature of the chemical moiety capping the 3&#x2032;-OH on the nucleotide analogue or the (preferably cleavable) linker attaching the label. In one embodiment, said removable chemical moiety comprises a disulfide bond. In one embodiment, said removable chemical moiety comprises an azido group (e.g. an azidomethyl ether). In one embodiment, said removable chemical moiety comprises an azido group and said cleavable linker comprises a disulfide bond. In another embodiment, these chemistries are reversed. Again, it is preferred that said moiety capping the 3&#x2032;-OH is not a fluorescent moiety.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0175">Increasing the number of bases that can be sequenced, i.e. increasing read lengths is desirable. However, as one proceeds to larger and larger read lengths, one often encounters a reduction in signal. In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates reducing extension times (e.g. extension times of 5-15 minutes are reduced to 1-2 minutes) in order to maintain signal strength at longer read lengths (greater than 20 bases, more preferably greater than 30 bases, etc.). This reduction in extension times can be combined with other methods herein described (e.g. the use of mixtures of labeled and unlabeled nucleotides) to improve performance and increase the retention in signal. Signal retention is defined as the ratio of signals at the end of the run to the signals at the beginning of the run.</p>

<p id="p-0157" num="0242">A. Sequencing by Synthesis</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0243">The invention relates to methods and compositions for determining the identity of nucleic acids in nucleotide sequences using, for example, data obtained from sequencing by synthesis methods. Methods of DNA sequencing are generally described in Metzker, Genome Res. (2005) 15(12): 1767-1776 and Shendure et al. (2004) Nature Reviews Genetics 5: 335-344. The Sanger sequencing method or chain termination or dideoxy method is a technique that uses an enzymatic procedure to synthesize DNA chains of varying length in different reactions that contain diluted concentrations of individual dideoxy nucleotides mixed in with normal nucleotides. DNA replication is stopped at positions that are occupied by one of the dideoxy nucleotide bases resulting in a distribution of nucleotide fragments since the normal nucleotides will properly incorporate. Unnatural ddNTP terminators replace the OH with an H at the 3&#x2032;-position of the deoxyribose molecule and irreversibly terminate DNA polymerase activity. The resulting fragment lengths are determined to decipher the ultimate sequence. Electrophoretic separation of the deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) fragments may be accomplished with single-base resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0244">In sequencing by synthesis, nucleotides conjugated with fluorescent markers that incorporate into a growing double-stranded nucleic acid from the single strand are detected. For example, one may immobilize template DNA on a solid surface by its 5&#x2032; end. One may accomplish this by annealing a sequencing primer to a consensus sequence and introducing DNA polymerase and fluorescent nucleotide conjugates (alternatively, a self-priming hairpin can be introduced by PCR or ligation to the template). One detects nucleotide incorporation using a laser microarray scanner or fluorescent microscope by correlating a particular fluorescent marker to a specific nucleotide. After each nucleotide is incorporated and the fluorescent signal is detected, one bleaches or removes the fluorescent moiety from the nucleotide conjugate so as to prevent the accumulation of a background signal.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0245">In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates DNA sequencing by synthesis using an automated instrument, as well as methods and compositions useful for sequencing using such an instrument. In one embodiment, the instrument comprises a flow cell (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>) with at least two fluidics ports, a substrate with sequenceable nucleic acid molecules attached to the substrate, reagent and waste reservoirs and fluidic system connecting the reservoirs to the flowcell (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The flowcell is interfaced with a detection system to monitor the incorporation of the nucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0246">In one embodiment, the sequencing by synthesis is carried out using reversibly terminating nucleotides and polymerase. The nucleotides comprise a protective group at their 3&#x2032;-OH which prevents multiple incorporations and allows for accurate decoding of the sequence. Once incorporated the protective groups can be cleaved with high efficiency and specificity to allow subsequent nucleotide incorporations. The nucleotides may also comprise a detectable label which can be cleaved after the detection.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0247">In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a series of method steps, which an instrument for automated sequencing by synthesis may carry out. In one embodiment, the process is comprised of the following reagent reservoirs: 1) Extend A (reversibly terminated labeled nucleotides and polymerase); 2) Extend B (reversibly terminated unlabeled nucleotides and polymerase, but lacking labeled nucleotide analogues); 3) Wash solution 1 (e.g. in one embodiment comprising a detergent, such as polysorbate 20, in a citrate solution, such as saline sodium citrate); 4) Cleave solution; 5) Wash solution 2 (e.g. in one embodiment, comprising a detergent, such as polysorbate 20 in a buffer comprising tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane or &#x201c;Tris&#x201d;). Of course, the present invention is not limited to particular concentrations of reagents in these solutions (and other buffers and detergents can be employed). Nonetheless, in order to achieve high throughput rates, the incorporation reactions and the cleavage reactions are desired to be fast. In one embodiment, high reaction rates are achieved by increasing the concentration of reagents, agitation, pH or temperature (or the combination of all these factors). The incorporation rate in addition is dependent on the specific activity and processivity of the polymerase used. In one particular embodiment (which is provided by way of a non-limiting example), the reagents solutions have the following compositions and concentration ranges:</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0248">1) Extend A&#x2014;reversibly terminated (3&#x2032;-O-Azidomethyl) labeled (1 nM to 1 uM) and non-labeled nucleotides (1 uM to 100 uM) and a first polymerase (1-500 ug/ml)); 2) Extend B&#x2014;reversibly terminated non-labeled nucleotides (1 uM to 100 uM) and a second polymerase (1-500 ug/ml)); 3) Wash solution 1 (3&#xd7;SSC, 0.02% Tween 20); 4) Cleave solution (50-100 mM TCEP); 5) Wash solution 2 (100 mM Tris-HCl, 0.02% Tween 20, 10 mM KCl, 20 mM (NH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. In one embodiment, the first polymerase incorporates labeled nucleotides better than the second polymerase, which incorporates unlabeled nucleotides more efficiently. Examples of commercially available polymerases that can be used include Therminator I-III. These polymerases are derived from <i>Thermococcus </i>sp. and carry mutations allowing for incorporation of modified nucleotides. Examples of these polymerases are listed in Table below:</p>

Other polymerases derived from 9 deg N parent polymerase or <i>Thermococcus </i>sp. could also be used. Other suitable polymerase families could conceivably be used after introducing mutation controlling the steric gate and enabling reversible terminators incorporation.

<p id="p-0165" num="0250">In one embodiment, the sequenceable DNA (preferably loaded on the chip or slide) is subjected to these solutions and compositions in the instrument, and the sequencing is performed using automated protocol. Again, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to a precise protocol or series of method steps. The order and number of steps can vary, as well as the time taken for each step. By way of a non-limiting example, in one embodiment, the instrument protocol comprises (and is configured) as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0251">1. Extend A&#x2014;0.5-5 minutes (delivery+agitation)</p>

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">The cycle may be repeated as desired and images may be taken and subsequently analyzed to decode the DNA sequence present at each location.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0259">In one embodiment of the above indicated cycle, eight nucleotide analogues are employed: four (A, T, C, G) cleavably labeled and reversibly terminated; four (A, T, G, C) unlabeled but reversibly terminated. In one embodiment, the concentration of the labeled analogues is at a relatively low concentration [e.g. just enough to be incorporated into a substantial portion (e.g. so the label is visible and detected) of the plurality of primers, whether they be detached primers or self-priming hairpins on the template]. By contrast, the unlabeled analogues, in one embodiment, are employed in a relatively high concentration (e.g. in order to drive the extensions to completion, and avoid primers, whether they be detached primers or self-priming hairpins, that lack incorporation of a first nucleotide analogue). It has been found empirically that the use of unlabeled nucleotides improves read lengths, and reduces lead and lag (discussed below).</p>

in the Table (above), wherein un-labeled nucleotides are employed in ratios between 8.33 to 1 and 12.5 to 1 (relative to labeled nucleotides). In one embodiment, the labeling (i.e. incorporation) step uses Kapa RevTerm polymerase (from Kapa Biosystems, Woburn, Mass.) at 2 &#x3bc;g/ml and is performed at 55 deg C. for 1-2 minutes. This is followed by synchronization step where only non-labeled nucleotides are used at 25 &#x3bc;M concentration and a polymerase derived from 9 deg N (<i>Thermococcus </i>sp). at 25 &#x3bc;g/ml is used. This step is also carried out at 55 deg C. Thus, unlabeled nucleotide analogues can be employed together with labeled nucleotides, as well as in steps where no labeled nucleotides are employed.

B. Device
</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0262">In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates using an optical system, for exciting and measuring fluorescence on or in samples comprising fluorescent materials (e.g., fluorescent labels, dyes or pigments). In a further embodiment, a device is used to detect fluorescent labels on nucleic acid. In another embodiment, the device comprises a fluorescent detection system and a flow cell for processing biomolecules (e.g., nucleic acid samples) arrayed on a &#x201c;chip&#x201d; or other surface (e.g., microscope slide, etc.). The flow cell permits the user to perform biological reactions, including but not limited to, hybridization and sequencing of nucleic acids.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0263">It is not intended that the present invention be limited to particular light sources. By way of example only, the system can employ ultra-bright LEDs (such as those available from Philips Lumileds Lighting Co., San Jose, Calif.) of different colors to excite dyes attached to the arrayed nucleic acids. These LEDs are more cost effective and have a longer life than conventionally used gas or solid state lasers. Other non-lasing sources of lights such as incandescent or fluorescent lamps may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0264"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a useful configuration of the LEDs, whereby the emitted light converges on a region or platform (e.g., suitable for positioning the flow cell or sample). However, linear arrays of LEDs can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0265">It is not intended that the present invention be limited to particular light collection devices. By way of example only, the system may employ a high sensitivity CCD camera (such as those available from Roper Scientific, Inc., Photometric division, Tucson Ariz. or those available from Apogee Instruments, Roseville, Calif.) to image the fluorescent dyes and make measurements of their intensity. The CCD cameras may also be cooled to increase their sensitivity to low noise level signals. These may also be CMOS, vidicon or other types of electronic camera systems.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0266">Since LED illumination light is not a collimated beam as from lasers, it is therefore an appropriate choice for imaging a larger area of many nucleic acid spots. To get sufficient light and therefore fluorescent signals over the larger area, the area seen by each pixel of the camera must be of sufficient size to allow enough fluorescent dye molecules to create a sufficient signal (for example, an Apogee U13 CCD available has 1.3 megapixels of 16 microns in size, while the Apogee U32 has 3.2 megapixels of 6.8 microns in size).</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0267">To increase capacity and efficiency, the present invention contemplates in one embodiment, a two flow cell system (e.g. while one chip in a first flow cell is undergoing one or more reaction steps, a second chip in a second flow cell is being scanned and imaged) with a single camera. In yet another embodiment of an imaging system, two flow cells and two cameras are employed.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0268">In one embodiment, the chip containing the array of nucleic acid spots is processed in a transparent flow cell incorporated within the instrument, which flows reagent past the spots and produces the signals required for sequencing (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>). In a particular embodiment, the chip remains in the flow cell while it is imaged by the LED detector. The flow cell and associated reagents adds the nucleic acids, enzymes, buffers, etc. that are required to produce the fluorescent signals for each sequencing step, then the flow cell delivers the required reagents to remove the fluorescent signals in preparation for the next cycle. Measurement by the detector occurs between these two steps. In order for reactions to take place, the flow channels are configured to be of sufficient dimensions. For example, the flow-cell fluid channel formed by the array and the flat surface of the flow cell are at least 0.1 mm in depth (more particularly 0.5 mm in depth) and the volume formed by the chip, the block and the seal is at least 100 microliters in volume (more particularly, between 100 and 700 microliters, and still more particularly, between 150 and 300 microliters, e.g. 200 microliters, in volume).</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0269">In one embodiment, the flow cell is motionless (i.e., not moved during reactions or imaging). On the other hand, the flow cell can readily be mounted on a rotary or one or more linear stages, permitting movement. For example, in a two flow cell embodiment, the two flow cells may move up and down (or side to side) across the imaging system. Movement may be desired where additional processes are desired (e.g., where exposure to UV light is desired for photochemical reactions within the flow cell, such as removal of photocleavable fluorescent labels), when multiple flow cells share a single camera, or when the field of view of the detection system is smaller than the desired area to be measured on the flow cell. The detector system may also be moved instead of or in addition to the flow cell.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0270">In a further embodiment, the flow cell is in fluid communication with a fluidics system (see illustrative system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In one embodiment, each bottle is pressurized with a small positive gas pressure. Opening the appropriate valve allows reagent to flow from the source bottle through the flow cell to the appropriate collection vessel(s). In one embodiment, the nucleotides and polymerase solutions are recovered in a separate collection bottle for re-use in a subsequent cycle. In one embodiment, hazardous waste is recovered in a separate collection bottle. The bottle and valve configuration allow the wash fluid to flush the entire valve train for the system as well as the flow cell. In one embodiment, the process steps comprise: 1) flushing the system with wash reagent, 2) introducing nucleotides (e.g. flowing a nucleotide cocktail) and polymerase, 3) flushing the system with wash reagent, 4) introducing de-blocking reagent (enzyme or compounds capable of removing protective groups in order to permit nucleic acid extension by a polymerase), 5) imaging, 6) introducing label removing reagent (enzyme or compounds capable of removing fluorescent labels), and 7) flushing the system with wash reagent.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0271">The system can be made to include a user interface system. The Labview (National Instruments, Austin, Tex.) system is available and provides software for computer controlled systems. Galil Motion Control (Rocklin, Calif.) provides motion control systems that can be interfaced to control the instrument.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">C. Nucleotides</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0272">The invention's compositions and methods contemplate using nucleotide sequences that contain nucleotides. The terms &#x201c;nucleotide&#x201d; and &#x201c;nucleic acid&#x201d; refer to constituents of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) that contain a purine or pyrimide base, such as adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), uracil (U), or thymine (T)), covalently linked to a sugar, such as D-ribose (in RNA) or D-2-deoxyribose (in DNA), with the addition of from one to three phosphate groups that are linked in series to each other and linked to the sugar. The term &#x201c;nucleotide&#x201d; includes native nucleotides and modified nucleotides.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0273">&#x201c;Native nucleotide&#x201d; refers to a nucleotide occurring in nature, such as in the DNA and RNA of cells. In contrast, &#x201c;modified nucleotide&#x201d; refers to a nucleotide that has been modified by man, such as using chemical and/or molecular biological techniques compared to the native nucleotide. The terms also include nucleotide analogs attached to one or more probes to facilitate the determination of the incorporation of the corresponding nucleotide into the nucleotide sequence. In one embodiment, nucleotide analogues are synthesized by linking a unique label through a cleavable linker to the nucleotide base or an analogue of the nucleotide base, such as to the 5-position of the pyrimidines (T, C and U) and to the 7-position of the purines (G and A), to use a small cleavable chemical moiety to cap the 3&#x2032;-OH group of the deoxyribose or ribose to make it nonreactive, and to incorporate the nucleotide analogues into the growing nucleotide sequence strand as terminators, such as reversible terminators and irreversible terminators. Detection of the unique label will yield the sequence identity of the nucleotide. Upon removing the label and the 3&#x2032;-OH capping group, the polymerase reaction will proceed to incorporate the next nucleotide analogue and detect the next base. Exemplary fluorescent moieties and fluorescent semiconductor crystals are described in Ju et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,664,079, hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0274">Other nucleotide analogs that contain markers, particularly cleavable markers, are also contemplated, such as those configured using allyl groups, azido groups, and the like, and which are further described below. The nucleotide compositions of the invention are particularly useful in massively parallel DNA Sequencing By Synthesis (SBS) approaches utilizing fluorophores as markers.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0275">a. Allyl Analogs</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0276">Cleavable fluorescent nucleotides with photo-cleavable linkers having reversible terminator allyl groups have been described in Ruparel et al. (2005) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 102(17) 5932-7. Similar, fluorescent nucleotide conjugates have been described in Bi et al. (2006) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128(8) 2542-3. In one embodiment, the invention contemplates using nucleotide analogs with cleavable markers conveniently configured with allyl groups. In a particular embodiment, the exposed amine groups of incorporated nucleotides are capped during sequencing. In other embodiments, the nucleotide derivatives comprise two or more allyl ethers and synthetic intermediates thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0277">Sample preparation and parallel sequencing steps are exemplified, but not limited, to those illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> Panel A shows how one isolates and prepares the DNA prior to sequencing and Panel B shows the sequencing cycle. One isolates DNA from a biological source and shears it by a mechanical device to the desired average size. One end-repairs, A-tails, and circularizes the fragments using a dT-tailed linker about 100 nucleotides in length. The linker consists of two outward directed primer recognition sequences and an arbitrary sequence of about 100 bases between the priming sites. After ligation, one decomposes noncircular sequences by treatment with an endonuclease. One dilutes the circular DNA fragments to prepare them for bead-based emulsion PCR using a biotinylated forward primer and a bead-attached reverse primer carrying an azido group on its 5&#x2032;-end. One performs emulsion PCR. An aqueous mix containing all the necessary components for PCR plus primer-bound beads and template DNA are stirred together with an oil/detergent mix to create microemulsions. The aqueous compartments contain an average of less than one template molecule and less than one bead. The microemulsions are temperature-cycled as in a conventional PCR. If a DNA template and bead are present together in a single aqueous compartment, the bead-bound oligonucleotides act as primers for amplification. One breaks the emulsion and subjects the mixture to an enrichment step by using streptavidin coated magnetic beads. One denatures the nucleic acid immobilized on the beads generating single stranded amplicons to which a self-priming hairpin moiety is then ligated.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0278">The beads are then arrayed on a chip surface and the sequencing by synthesis reactions are performed. Each cycle comprises steps that are used to read out the DNA sequence (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, Panel B). One subjects the array segment to the fluorescent nucleotide conjugate with a hydroxyl-protecting group on the 3&#x2032; end. One scans the array and the fluorescent output of each of the fluorescent markers and measures the output for each position. One exposes the array to conditions for cleavage of the fluorescent marker and the hydroxyl-protecting group. The entire process is repeated with another set of nucleotide bases unit the sequence of each position is determined. As the sequence data is generated, one collects the sequence information and aligns the reference sequences for diagnosis. One may use computer software and a database of previously known mutations and corresponding sequences to correlate them to the sequence with known mutations.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0279">The PCR approach described above ensures that instead of sequencing of the entire pool of templates, one performs clonal or digital sequencing, resulting in much higher sensitivity for detection of mutations. For example, if a spontaneous mutation is present at only 5% of the population and the remaining 95% of the gene copies are wild types it is difficult to detect the mutated DNA using a conventional pool sequencing approach because of insufficient sensitivity. In the applicants' approach, one dilutes the input sample so that each PCR emulsion bubble contains at most a single template, which is then subjected to sequencing. If one performs this process on 1,000 unique clones, then one on average detects mutant sequences (present in 5% of amplicons) in 50 reactions and wild type sequence in 95% of the reactions.</p>

<p id="p-0229" num="0314">PG1 stands for protective group that is selectively removable and, and CL stands for cleavable linker, which is also selectively cleavable. In one embodiment these nucleotide compositions can be incorporated into the nucleic acid by nucleic acids modifying enzymes in a controlled fashion for example to decode the identity of the bases encoded by the marker moiety M. Once the identity of the base has been decoded, then the marker moiety can be cleaved off and removed. In one embodiment, the invention contemplates the use of cleavable protection for 3&#x2032;-OH in nucleotides for reversible terminators for SBS.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0315">Examples of PG1 protective groups are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>. As an illustration, the synthesis of one of the embodiments in such classes of nucleotide-3&#x2032;-O&#x2014;(CH<sub>2</sub>ONH<sub>2</sub>)-dNTPs is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. Briefly, the protected 3&#x2032;-methylthiomethyl nucleoside (1) upon treatment with SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>produce activated product (2) which after reaction with hydroxylamine or its N-Fmoc protected compound install aminoxy group. The later compounds can be triphosphorylated to result in nucleotides. Other compounds and exemplary synthesis pathways within the scope of the invention are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-31</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0316">D. Reducing Lead and Lag</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0317">The cleaving agent is designed to cleave the 3&#x2032;-OH or the dye attached to the nucleotide or both the 3&#x2032;-OH and the dye. A variety of chemistries may be used for these attachments. FIG. <b>35</b> shows various possible chemistries for the 3&#x2032;-OH group. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref> shows disulfide linkers for attaching the dye. Importantly, for any particular nucleotide, the chemistries may be same or may be different. For example, in one embodiment, the 3&#x2032;-OH group can carry an azidomethyl ether and yet the dye can be attached via an azido linker. In another embodiment, however, the 3&#x2032;-OH group can carry an azidomethyl ether and yet the dye can be attached via a disulfide linker. Both the azidomethyl ether and the disulfide linker are cleavable by TCEP (Tris-carboxyethyl)phosphine, although the disulfide linker cleaves much faster than the 3&#x2032;-O-azidomethyl ether.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0318">The cleaving agent is used at relatively high concentration (50-100 mM) to achieve fast cleavage. It is important for the sequencing process to remove any traces of cleaving agent in the wash steps, as these traces could interact with the Extend A and B solution (see the discussion of these solutions above) in the next cycle and create native nucleotides. This is highly undesirable as this leads to sequence dephasing (lead and lag) and limits useful read lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0319">One approach might be to increase the number of washes. However, it has been found empirically that increased washing cycles after cleavage step have only minimal effect on the sequencing performance unless very high numbers of washes are used (see Example 14). Such an approach would slow down the process considerably.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0320">The present invention, in one embodiment, contemplates a different approach to solving the problem. In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates novel compositions to be used in one or more of the solutions employed in the sequencing by synthesis method (or in a new, additional separate solution) that reduce, minimize and/or inhibit the cleaving agent and the &#x201c;pre-cleaving&#x201d; effect. In one embodiment, a cleavage agent &#x201c;scavenger&#x201d; is contemplated. The cleavage agent scavenger is designed to react with any leftover cleaving reagent remaining in the flow cell or the fluidics (e.g. tubing) by inefficient or incomplete washing. In one preferred embodiment, the scavenger agent is added to the wash solution directly after the cleave step. In another embodiment the scavenger is added to the Extend A solution. In yet another embodiment the scavenger agent is added to Extend B solution. The scavenger requirements are as follows: 1) solubility; 2) fast and specific reaction with the cleaving agent. In the embodiments where the scavenger is added to Extend A or B solution, there is the additional requirement of lack of inhibition of polymerase reaction and lack of reactivity with functional groups on the nucleotides, dyes or polymerase.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0321">In one particular embodiment, the scavenger agent mimics the structure of the protective group present on the 3&#x2032;-OH location of the nucleotide. In another embodiment, the scavenger mimics only the reactivity of the protective group. For example, in case of 3&#x2032;-O-azidomethyl nucleotides scavenger compounds could comprise azidomethyl, azidoethyl ethers or disulfide compounds. In case of 3&#x2032;-O&#x2014;NH2 nucleotides the scavengers could be any aminoxy compounds, such as hydroxylamine. In case of 3&#x2032;-O-allyl nucleotides the scavengers could be any allyl ether or disulfide compounds. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref> provides examples of cleaving agent &#x201c;scavengers.&#x201d; It has been found empirically (see Example 15), that the use of such compounds improves base calling accuracy, without the need for additional wash steps (and in particular, without the need for high numbers of wash cycles).</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0322">E. Dephasing</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0323">Many next-generation DNA sequencing systems read the sequence of millions of different single-stranded DNA fragments in parallel by using a polymerase enzyme to incorporate fluorescently labeled DNA nucleotides into the complementary strand one cycle at a time. However, incorporation errors can shift the phase of some of the templates, so base read outs may lead ahead or lag behind the cycle number. The invention provides a model and methods to account for incorporation errors and show how the model may be inverted to correct this dephasing and extend read lengths.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0324">Although fluorescence-based, single-molecule sequencing on a chip has been demonstrated, it is very sensitive to polymerase incorporation errors. This may be reduced and therefore reliability of sequence read out may be increased if each spot on a chip is an ensemble of identical template molecules. Polymerase errors (such as the incorporation of the wrong complementary nucleotide or no incorporation at all) are inevitable, but infrequent. Therefore, the superposition of all of the fluorescent signals from template molecules within an ensemble will primarily be from the correct nucleotide. As the number of cycles gets large, however, certain errors can accumulate within an ensemble and contribute to possible miscalling of the correct nucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0325">For our analysis, we assume that a set of reversibly terminated and cleavably labeled nucleotides with four different dye colors (one for each nucleotide type: A, C, G and T) are used for sequence read out. The methods described herein may also be applied to other types of SBS processes such as pyrosequencing. If the SBS process works without mis-incorporations, then for each cycle only a single nucleotide type is incorporated into every strand in an ensemble. During a read out phase, the color of each ensemble is measured, then during a cleavage phase, the terminator and dyes are cleaved off and the chip is ready for the next cycle. Thus, the position of the base being read out on every template on the chip is synchronized with the cycle number.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0326">Because of impurities, limited polymerase efficiencies and other errors, some of the templates within an ensemble may get out of phase with the cycle number. For example, the base that is incorporated in the i<sup>th </sup>cycle may be complementary to the i&#x2212;1<sup>st </sup>position or the i+1<sup>st </sup>position in the template rather than the expected i<sup>th </sup>position. The invention's methods provide computational re-phasing of the dephased data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic flow chart for re-phasing. Additional data demonstrating the efficacy of the invention's methods is discussed below, including <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9-19</figref> and Example 11 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-34</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0327">d. Sequence Lead</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0328">Polymerases that have an increased capacity for incorporating 3&#x2032; reversibly terminated nucleotide analogs continue to have a preference for incorporating native nucleotides. This means that even though nucleotide analogs may be extremely pure, any residual nucleotides with 3&#x2032;-OH (non-terminated) will be incorporated at a much higher rate and therefore appear to be more prevalent. The incorporation of non-terminated nucleotides has the effect of skipping a base, as a second incorporation (the next base) will occur in the same cycle. Thus, the fluorescent measurement for that template will exhibit the dye from the following base rather than the expected base at that cycle number. Since that template now exhibits a &#x201c;lead,&#x201d; it will continue to do so, even if all future nucleotides are reversibly terminated. This effect is cumulative and shown in simulated data in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> for a non-terminated nucleotide incorporation rate of 2% as compared to the terminated nucleotide analog rate and a repeated 35 base sequence of ACTGACTGACTG . . . . (SEQ ID NO: 5). Here we make the assumption that each of the nucleotides has the same nonterminated incorporation rate thereby allowing us to use a linear model. Again, the actual nucleotide purity may well be better than say 99.5%, but the apparent non-terminated incorporation rate may be 2% depending on the polymerase. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the model tells us the amount of signal due to the sequence lead effect. In cycle 20, the model calculates that we have 60% of the signal from the primary base at the 20th position (red), 32.4% of the signal from the base at the 21st position (blue), 6.7% of the signal from the base at the 22nd position (green), 0.8% of the signal from the base at the 23rd position (yellow), and 0.07% of the signal from the base at the 24th position (red). An interesting observation is that with the lead effect, the primary base signal (actual base at that cycle) does not have a 100% signal as some templates are already &#x201c;reading out&#x201d; subsequent bases on that strand. Thus at the end of a run, we can &#x201c;look forward&#x201d; and shift back the lead signals and correct the primary signals. We denote the contributions at the cycle as R<sub>0Lead,i</sub>, R<sub>+1Lead,1</sub>, R<sub>+2Lead,i</sub>, R<sub>+3Lead,i</sub>, etc. for the ratio between the reduced signal for the i<sup>th </sup>base to the actual i<sup>th </sup>base population, the ratio contribution to the i<sup>th </sup>base signal from the i+1<sup>th </sup>base, the ratio contribution to the i<sup>th </sup>base signal from the i+2<sup>nd </sup>base, etc. Because the amount of lead changes with each cycle, there will be a different set of ratios for each cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0329">e. Sequence Lag</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0330">We developed a model for de-phasing due to sequence lag. This is caused by limited incorporation efficiency where some small percentage of the templates do not get a base incorporated in the cycle. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows simulated data for a 98% incorporation efficiency for the same template sequence as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. We denote the contributions at the i<sup>th </sup>cycle as R<sub>0Lag,i</sub>, R<sub>&#x2212;1Lag,i</sub>, R<sub>&#x2212;2Lag,i</sub>, R<sub>&#x2212;3Lag,i</sub>, etc., for the ratio between the reduced signal for the i<sup>th </sup>base to the actual i<sup>th </sup>base population, the ratio contribution to the i<sup>th </sup>base signal from the i&#x2212;1<sup>st </sup>base, the ratio contribution to the i<sup>th </sup>base signal from the i&#x2212;2<sup>nd </sup>base, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0331">f. Nucleotide Incorporation Events</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0332">As discussed above, every time there is an available site for the polymerase to incorporate a nucleotide on a template, there are three possible outcomes: First, no nucleotide is incorporated&#x2014;Event No-I. If no nucleotide is incorporated due for example to polymerase inefficiency, then the site remains available for the next cycle. We term this a &#x201c;lag&#x201d; event as it has the effect of causing a readout in the next cycle that will from the position behind or lagging the cycle number. Second, a reversibly terminated nucleotide is incorporated&#x2014;Event T-I. If as expected, a reversibly terminated nucleotide is incorporated, then the nucleotide readout is in sync with the cycle number. In the next cycle, the next consecutive template nucleotide position will be available for incorporation. Third, a non-terminated (native) nucleotide is incorporated&#x2014;Event N-I. If a non-terminated nucleotide is incorporated, then during that same cycle, there is a second opportunity for another nucleotide to be incorporated at the subsequent position in the template strand. We term this a &#x201c;lead&#x201d; event as it has the effect of causing a readout of a nucleotide that is at a position that is ahead of or leading the cycle number. This second incorporation event is subject to the same three possible outcomes (No-I, T-I or N-I); thus, N-I events are recursive.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0333">We will use the variable G<sub>i </sub>to represent the rate at which a lag occurs at template position i and similarly D<sub>i </sub>for the lead rate at position i. The analysis assumes that these rates may vary from position to position depending on the identity of the nucleotide that is to be incorporated, but we have assumed that all incorporation events for a particular nucleotide have the same lag and lead rates, even if the incorporation is not the first one in a cycle (it follows an N-I event). The fluorescent signal that will be generated from an incorporation event at a template location i is proportional to (1&#x2212;G<sub>i</sub>&#x2212;D<sub>i</sub>), so at every i<sup>th </sup>incorporation event, the three types of events (No-I, T-I and N-I) will occur at the following rates: Event No-I at rate G<sub>i</sub>, Event T-I at rate (1&#x2212;G<sub>i</sub>&#x2212;D<sub>i</sub>), and Event N-I at rate D<sub>i</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0334">g. Signals Produced In Each Cycle</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0335">Although there are only three potential outcomes from an incorporation event, all of the combined events from multiple cycles in a template can be fairly complex. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may be used to better visualize the sequence of extension events. For simplicity, only 4 templates positions and only 3 cycles are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The numbered regions in the vertical direction along the left edge indicate the nucleotide position along the strand. The horizontal direction symbolizes the relative number of strands in an ensemble that undergo events No-I, T-I or N-I (lag, readout or lead).</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0336">For clarity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, we have designated each of the three possible events (No-l, T-I and N-I) to occur at the same rate for every cycle. In an actual system, the lead and lag rate are both likely to be much smaller values. The chart is easier to understand if it is viewed one color at a time. The blue regions represent events that occur during the first cycle. At position 1 of the template, the entire ensemble of templates are available for extensions. The portion of templates that experienced a lag during the first cycle, remain available during the second cycle for incorporations. The portion of the templates that experienced a readout comprises the signal that is read during cycle 1 at position 1. This portion will progress in synchrony and allow incorporations to occur at position 2 during the second cycle. The portion of the templates that experienced a lead at position 1 will have a second incorporation event during cycle 1 at the second position of the template. This incorporation again will be split equally into the three possible events. A portion of the templates will remain unextended (lag), a portion will generate a signal (readout) and a portion will undergo a lead and produce a third set of incorporation events at position 3. This process will continue during cycle 1. Although lead events may continue down the entire length of the template during cycle 1, in practical terms, the effects 30 after about 4 lead events are negligible.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0337">In cycle 2, the only strands that are available to be extended at position 2 are those for which one of three events occurred (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>): (1) strands that were read out at position 1 during cycle 1, (2) strands that experienced both a lead at position <b>1</b> and a lag at position during cycle 1, and (3) strands that experienced a lag at position 1 during cycle 1 along with a subsequent lead at position 1 during cycle 2. A portion of these strands will also experience a cycle lead to the third position, however, since they have &#x201c;caught up&#x201d; to the other strands with available sites at the second position, they are lumped together with them and further leads are considered as portions of the combined population.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0338">Similar events occur at each template position during cycle 2. The events of cycle 3 follow very similar patterns to those described for cycle 2.</p>

<p id="p-0255" num="0340">We may derive general equations that describe all the incorporation events at each position and for each cycle.

<p id="p-0260" num="0345">In one embodiment, the model is used to apply the lead-lag compensation based on calibration of parameters, before or during the test, and to provide an initial estimate of the base identity at each location as determined during the sequencing run. In a particular embodiment, G<sub>i </sub>and D<sub>i </sub>for each nucleotide may be pre-calibrated or measured during the sequencing procedure. In general, the model is constructed with lag parameters that are applied to each cycle and lead parameters that are recursively applied to each cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0346">In a particular embodiment, the lead-lag matrix is formulated after an initial draft sequence is measured. This allows application of the proper set of G<sub>i </sub>and D, parameters to each cycle based on the nucleotides identified at each position in the draft sequence. In a further embodiment, the re-phasing of data is iterated using the result of one re-phasing calculation to select an updated set of G<sub>i </sub>and D<sub>i </sub>parameters for the next iteration.</p>

<p id="p-0265" num="0350"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows that with the presence of a lead and lag component, there is a cumulative effect that reduces the signal from the expected nucleotide at a particular cycle and &#x201c;spreads&#x201d; some of the signal forwards and backwards. As the number of cycles increases, it becomes more and more difficult to directly read the correct base from the graph, thereby limiting the effective read length of the template.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0351">ii. Re-Phasing Sequencing Data</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0352">Data herein (Example 11, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-34</figref>) demonstrate that applying the methods and the below described equations of the invention, exemplary 16-base and 25-base nucleotide sequences were sequenced with high fidelity. The high quality of the data, particularly in the last several bases in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, demonstrates that the read length will not be limited by signal decline. Thus, it is contemplated that the invention's methods are applicable to sequences containing at least 16 nucleotides, at least 25 nucleotides, at least 35 nucleotides, at least 50 nucleotides, at least 100 nucleotides, at least 1,000 nucleotides, and at least 10,000 nucleotides. Further description of the equations used to re-phase sequencing data is described as follows.</p>

The diagonal terms, R<sub>Lag/Lead,i</sub>, in the K<sub>Lead/Lag </sub>matrix above is the fractional remaining signal in the i<sup>th </sup>cycle from the i<sup>th </sup>position of the templates after all of the leads and lags to that point. Each of the terms in the upper triangular portion of the matrix, R<sub>+kLead,i</sub>, is the fractional contribution to the signal in the i<sup>th </sup>cycle from k positions forward of the i<sup>th </sup>position. Each of the terms in the lower triangular portion of the matrix, R<sub>&#x2212;kLag,i</sub>, is the fractional contribution to the signal in the i<sup>th </sup>cycle from k positions before the i<sup>th </sup>position. In most systems, the terms with k greater than about 4 (5 positions or more away from the position corresponding to the cycle number) are negligible. The diagonal terms are close to 1 for the earlier cycles and do not drop below about 0.25 for the later cycles. Thus, this matrix is invertable.

<p id="p-0271" num="0356">In order to compensate for both sequence leads and lags, we solved for [I<sub>Ai</sub>] in Equation 4 by taking the inverse, K<sub>Lead/Lag</sub><sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, of K<sub>Lead/Lag </sub>(Equation 5) to get an estimate of the actual template population [I<sub>Ai</sub>]:</p>

<p id="p-0273" num="0358">When the lead rates for all the nucleotides are identical and the lag rates for all of the nucleotides are identical, then the lead/lag matrix, K<sub>Lead/Lag</sub>, does not depend on the sequence. This makes Equation 6 linear and the inverse of the matrix is deterministic. In this case the inverse of the lead/lag model gives the correction matrix, K<sub>Lead/Lag</sub><sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, which is applied just once at the end of a run and takes into account all of the signals from the first to the last base.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0359">If on the other hand the lead and lag factors vary from one nucleotide to the next, then the lead/lag matrix, K<sub>Lead/Lag</sub>, depends on the actual sequence (solution of [I<sub>Ai</sub>] in Equation 6) and the problem is non linear. In other words, we need to determine an estimate for the true value of the intensities of each base in the sequence when the governing equations depend on this solution.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0360">To solve the non-linear problem, one can estimate a solution and iterate until the solutions converge. We may use the raw out-of-phase sequence data to make an initial estimate of the sequence by taking the maximum value at each cycle, using this information to determine the lead and lag rates for each position, construct a lead/lag matrix (K<sub>Lead/Lag</sub>), take the inverse of that matrix and solve for the corrected, re-phased sequence. We can then use the new sequence to make a new estimate of the lead/lag matrix, etc. As long as the various lead and lag factors are fairly close to one another, this method should converge in about two or three iterations.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0361">iii. Additional Factors</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0362">The above method is a very powerful way of &#x201c;cleaning up&#x201d; sequence data that has been dephased due to the lead and lag phenomena. The matrix condition number determines when matrix manipulations will be sensitive to small numerical variations. A matrix condition near 1 means the matrix is well behaved, while a large condition number means the matrix is ill-conditioned or sensitive to small numerical inaccuracies.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0363"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> shows a simulated 35 base read data with 10% noise added and lead and lag factors of 1% each. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> shows an accurate lead/lag compensation reconstruction using the inverse lead/lag matrix, K<sub>Lead/Lag</sub><sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. The condition number for this lead/lag matrix is 5. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> shows the same exemplary 35 base sequence with 10% noise and a lead and lag factor of 1.75% each and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> shows the reconstruction. Here, the condition number is 550 and reconstruction is poor. In order to have a fairly precise reconstruction of the data, lead/lag matrices desirably have a condition below about 20. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> plots the matrix condition numbers below 20 for 35 base lead/lag matrices with various values of lead and lag. Because the lead/lag matrix is calculated independent of the DNA sequence in a template for the case where nucleotides all have equal lead ratios and equal lag ratios, we are able to determine our ability to accurately call bases without consideration of the A, C, T, and G content of the templates. Even if a 35 base lead/lag matrix is ill-conditioned and produces poor reconstruction, smaller matrices from a portion of the same data may still be well behaved. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17C</figref> shows the reconstruction of the first 18 bases for a lead and lag of 1.75% each (same conditions that produced the poor reconstruction for the 35 base read). Here the 18&#xd7;18 lead/lag matrix has a condition number of 3.7. The matrix becomes ill-conditioning when cumulative contributions from the lead or lag or both generate signals that are on the order of the signal from the true base (where the position equals the cycle number).</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0364">The above shows that changing the read length can provide an accurate reconstruction of earlier portions of the data. Thus, we can plot the lead and lag factors that will cause matrices of different sizes (read lengths) to have a condition number of 20 (the point where matrices become too ill-conditioned for precise reconstruction). For example, if a 23&#xd7;23 matrix produces a condition number of 20, then we would restrict the read length to a maximum of 23 as reconstruction using the 24th base (as well as any additional bases) would likely create a matrix that is too ill-conditioned to accurately reconstruct the data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> shows the read lengths for various lead and lag factors. This plot provides a method for predicting the read length obtainable from a sequencing system based on two factors: the purity of the nucleotides (major contributor to the lead) and the polymerase incorporation efficiency (major contributor to the lag). This result also shows that if both the lead and lag factors are below about 0.5%, this results in reconstruction of a 100-base read.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0365">F. Field Flattening</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0366">In one embodiment, when a chip of uniform dye concentration is imaged, it may be desirable that all of the pixels in the resultant image have nearly the same intensity, with variations reflecting only the relatively small distribution inherent in the camera's optical system. In practice, however, the inventors have found that variations in illumination and filter response produce a significant spatially correlated pattern in an image. The inventors have also found that the pattern is highly reproducible and has a linear response to changes in dye concentration and camera exposure. These conditions lead to the following algorithm for removing this spatial correlation between pixel intensity and location of the pixel on the solid substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0367">First, for each machine and each filter, we image the pattern of a spatially uniform fluorescence on a dyed microscope slide. Second, the image is smoothed using a low-pass filter. In the resultant smoothed image, M, we choose an origin point, M<sub>x0,y0</sub>. The choice of the point is fairly arbitrary but it is selected from a region in which the smoothed images of all of the filters have low intensity gradients to minimize the impact of changes in the system. Third, the intensity of each pixel at a point in a raw image (R<sub>x,y</sub>) is replaced by its field-flattening value, F<sub>x,y</sub>, where F<sub>x,y</sub>=R<sub>x,y </sub>M<sub>x0,y0</sub>/M<sub>x,y </sub>and M<sub>x,y </sub>is the value of the model image at the same spatial location as the raw image pixel. The resultant &#x201c;Field Flattened&#x201d; image, F, has intensities that are now solely dependent on the camera exposure and dye concentration, and do not have any correlation with the spatial location of the pixel in the image.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0368">The invention's algorithms and equations for field flattening are distinguished from those described by, for example Eltoukhy et al. (2006), since the algorithms of Eltoukhy et al. relate to signal noise that is uncorrelated to system parameters (e.g., uneven light source). In contrast, the signal noise that is corrected by the invention's methods is correlated to the signal's position across the solid substrate. In one embodiment, each pixel is corrected (i.e., field flattened) based on a previously calibrated baseline intensity at that pixel position and a scaling factor based on for example a longer exposure time.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0369">G. Spot Location in the Array</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0370">In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a processing step (preferably in a series of processing steps as discussed above) for locating the spots in the array. In one embodiment, the spot locating image processing algorithm uses the fact that the spots on the chip are in a regular hexagonal pattern along vertical columns and diagonal rows. To find the columns of spots, image pixel values are summed along the vertical direction. This results in a one-dimensional set of data that resembles a sinusoidal pattern. The peaks of the pattern are measured and used to determine the period and phase of the pattern. There are then used to guide a search to determine a set of equations for vertical lines that approximately bisect each of the spots in a column. The result is a set of equations for parallel lines (slope, intercept and spacing) at regular spacing. A number of these lines are then probed to establish a second sinusoidal-like pattern of intensities along the lines. These are then used to determine the period, angle and phase of the diagonal lines that bisect each of the spots. These second set of lines are at a 60 degree angle from the vertical lines. The intersection of the diagonal set of lines and the vertical set of lines give an estimate for the subpixel locations of each of the spot centers.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0371">H. Image Sharpening</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0372">In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a processing step (preferably in a series of processing steps as discussed above) to sharpen the image of the spots on the array. This is particularly useful if chips are constructed with tightly packed spots. In such a case, it might be beneficial to run the images through a sharpening filter in order to reduce the amount of blur or spread for each of the spots. This will reduce the amount of light energy blooming into adjacent spots. Similarly, if the optics for the system cannot sufficiently resolve spots on the chip, then the application of a sharpening filter may also help to precisely analyze the images. A number of sharpening algorithms may be used to narrow the spread of the spots. One embodiment uses a Wiener filter (as described, for example, in The Image Processing Handbook, by John C. Russ, Published by CRC Press, 2006, ISBN 0849372542, 9780849372544, 817 pages) to make the diameter of the spots smaller and remove light energy from adjacent spots.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0373">I. Spot Brightness Determination</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0374">In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates a processing step (preferably in a series of processing steps as discussed above) to determine spot brightness. In one embodiment, the pixels that surround each of the subpixel locations of the spots are summed to determine an estimate for the spot brightness. The local set of pixels that is selected depends on both the diameter of the spots and the location within the pixel of the subpixel center location. For example, if the subpixel location is close to the top of the pixel that contains the center, then more pixels above the pixel that contains the center are counted than pixels below the pixel containing the center.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0375">In one embodiment, the above method for making spot brightness measurements is repeated independently for each of the four different color channels (four separate images) and the sharpening and neighbor influence (see below) correction calculations are applied, then the color crosstalk correction is applied (see below). In one embodiment, the result of the color crosstalk calculation produces a list of four values (one for each dye color) for each spot in the images that may be used to call the base for that sequencing cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0376">J. Neighbor Influence Elimination</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0377">In addition to each of the spots expanding beyond its physical bounds, the light from one spot (bead) may illuminate an adjacent spot and make it appear to have more of the color of its neighbors. This might happen because light being emitted from one bead make impinge on an adjacent bead, be reflected within the bead and then reemitted from that bead. This neighbor influence may be eliminated by, in one embodiment, constructing an influence or &#x201c;spreading&#x201d; matrix, then applying the inverse of this matrix to the data. To formulate the solution to the neighbor influence problem from spot data that is in hexagonal form, it is convenient to first put the data into a rectilinear array. This is done by shifting the even vertical columns up by &#xbd; of a pixel as shown below. Thus, a two-dimensional rectilinear matrix, whose elements represent the magnitude of each spot in the original image of the hexagonal array of spots, may be used. To further facilitate matrix manipulations, the rectilinear spot matrix may be made into a spot vector by stacking the columns from the two-dimensional matrix under one another to form a one dimensional array or vector. In other words, the second column is appended to the bottom of the first, the third to the bottom of the second, etc., thereby generating a 1&#xd7;N<sup>2 </sup>vector formed from an N&#xd7;N spot matrix.</p>

<br/>
In one embodiment, a &#x201c;spreading matrix&#x201d; is next formed that represents the magnitude of the influence from a spot to neighboring spots. In a general formulation, a central spot may be thought of as influencing the nearest six neighbors surrounding the central spot by a fraction, A, of the central spot brightness, the next nearest neighbors by a smaller fraction, B, etc. If the central spot is very bright, then its neighbors may appear to be emitting their own light of the same color as the central spot, even if they actually generate none of their own light in that color. The spreading matrix is formulated such that if it is applied to an ideal image of single element spots (each spot is an idealized point and does not extend beyond one element of the matrix), then the resultant matrix will have spots that have been spread across several elements due to the neighbor influence phenomenon. Thus, the spreading matrix is a model for the influence of any spot in the image to any other spot in the image.

<p id="p-0294" num="0379">For hexagonal arrayed spots that have been make into a one-dimensional vector with dimensions N<sup>2</sup>&#xd7;1 (in other words, a concatenation of all the columns of the matrix), the spreading matrix, S, may be formulated as a N<sup>2</sup>&#xd7;N<sup>2 </sup>matrix. An example 25&#xd7;25 spreading matrix corresponding to a 5&#xd7;5 spot image that has the three levels of neighbor influence (A for the closest 6 neighbors, B for the next closest 6 and C for the third closest 6) is shown below.</p>

If the spreading matrix, S, is inverted, S<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, it may be used to eliminate the neighbor influence modeled by the spreading matrix. If we multiply the measured spot matrix (in the form of a vector), v<sub>spot</sub>, by the inverse of the spreading matrix, S<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>, we can generate an estimate for the spot matrix with the neighbor influence removed, V<sub>uninfluenced </sub>

<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>v<sub>uninfluenced</sub>=S<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>v<sub>spot</sub>.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
The method described above for removing the neighbor influence can generate sizable spreading matrices on the order of N<sup>4 </sup>and therefore may be computationally intensive for typical images. Since the influence of spots that are relatively far from the spot of interest have relatively negligible influence, it is possible to reduce the size of the spreading matrices used for the calculation and perform the calculation on smaller subsections of the image at a time. This can significantly reduce the computational complexity and computer memory requirements for the calculation. It should be understood that the methods set forth above may be generalized in algorithms that are more efficient or operate on smaller portions of the image.

<p id="p-0296" num="0381">K. Spectral Crosstalk Calibration</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0382">In one embodiment, it may be desirable to correct the data to account for color crosstalk. This may be done using methods known in the art (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,209,836 incorporated by reference) as well as methods disclosed herein (see Example 10, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>). For example, a four-color fluorescent detection system (for detection of the exemplary colors blue, green, yellow and red) has one detector channel for each of the four different color dyes. However, because the dyes have fairly broad spectra, there is some detection of dyes in adjacent color channels. For example, when exciting only a green dye, a signal is visible in the yellow channel as well as the green channel. If this spectral crosstalk is calibrated, it may be removed from subsequent measurements even if the dyes are mixed in unknown quantities. To determine actual fluorescent intensities for the four colors, A, B, C and D from measured detector outputs, M<sub>A</sub>, M<sub>B</sub>, M<sub>C</sub>, M<sub>D </sub>in corresponding channels, one needs to know all of the spectral crosstalk factors: R<sub>AB</sub>, R<sub>BA</sub>, R<sub>BC</sub>, R<sub>CB</sub>, R<sub>CD</sub>, and R<sub>DC</sub>. For example, R<sub>AB </sub>is the ratio between the portion of the signal in the A channel coming from the B dye and the actual intensity of the B dye. If for instance R<sub>AB </sub>is 20%, then the A channel will have an additional signal equal to 0.2 times the actual B dye intensity in the B channel. Thus for channel B, the observed measurement, M<sub>B</sub>, is the direct measurement of B and the two contributions from the adjacent channels (if any): M<sub>B</sub>=B+R<sub>BA</sub>A+R<sub>BC</sub>C (6). For the four channels, this may be written in matrix form:</p>

where K<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>is the inverse of matrix K. Although the inverse of matrix K may be written out in terms of the six spectral crosstalk factors, it is somewhat complex and is best performed by plugging in the numbers and letting the computer take the inverse. The results are discussed in Example 10 which demonstrate that a base in the sequence would have been miscalled were the spectral crosstalk calibration not performed.
</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0386">Any multicolor sequencing by synthesis device may be calibrated using the above equations and the resultant spectral crosstalk matrix may be used in all four color measurements from the device. In one embodiment, if we also include information on the relative magnitude of each of the four colors, then we can also correct for differences in perceived dye brightness from one channel to the next. Multiplying the matrix K by a diagonal matrix, whose diagonal terms are the relative brightness for each dye, produces a new matrix K whose inverse will automatically scale the dyes to be consistent with one another.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0387">K. Base Calls</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0388">As discussed above, at each sequencing by synthesis cycle, the signals that are observed in the four color channels are used to both determine the most likely base at that cycle (base call) and to determine a quality score for the base call. Because of a number of factors, it may not always be the case that the brightest color in the raw data indicates the most likely base. Thus, it may be desirable to correct for at least one, and more particularly all, of the following phenomena that were discussed supra: field flattening, spectral crosstalk, sequence lead and sequence lag. After the correction factors (field flattening, spectral crosstalk and/or lead-lag compensation) have been applied, a base is called based on the maximum signal between the four channels. The output of the base calls may be a file similar to a FASTA format. In one embodiment, this file is also accompanied by a quality score file.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0389">To optimize the alignment and assembly of the data into contigs, it is desirable to have a precise quality score associated with each base call. A quality file may be generated that encodes quality scores for each cycle. Preserving the information for all four bases is also desirable to allow the sequence alignment software to examine several likely calls instead of only the one with the highest signal.</p>

<p id="p-0307" num="0392">The synthesis of 3&#x2032;-O-azidomethyl-dNPTs is described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Briefly, reaction of 5&#x2032;-O-TBDMS-2&#x2032;-deoxynucleosides (5) with a mixture of DMSO, acetic acid, and acetic anhydride installed the 3&#x2032;-O-methylthiomethyl group (3&#x2032;-O-MTM, 6), which upon treatment with SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2 </sub>converted to activated 3&#x2032;-O&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>Cl (7). The latter can be monitored in TLC as 3&#x2032;-OH (5) after dissolving in wet organic solvent due to fast hydrolysis of the &#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>Cl group. The 3&#x2032;-O&#x2014;CH<sub>2</sub>Cl-2&#x2032;-deoxynucleoside (7) is then treated with NaN<sub>3 </sub>in dry DMF without purification to convert to 3&#x2032;-O -CH<sub>2</sub>N<sub>3 </sub>(8). 3&#x2032;-O-azidomethyl-2&#x2032;-deoxynucleosides of A, T, and C (9a-9c) were obtained in good yield after deprotection of the 5&#x2032;-O-TBDMS group as described in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Similar synthesis route for guanosine (G, 9d), lead only very low yield (&#x3e;10%) due to formation of a number of side reaction products. To circumvent this, a new method was introduced for the synthesis of guanosine analog (14) which is described in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, which involved protection of the O<sup>6</sup>-group by diphenycarbamoyl group. After protection of this particular group, the intermediate (12-14) became less polar, making easier to purify, and lead good overall yield in the azidomethyl group installation step.</p>

The surface constitutes any surface that is bio-compatible, has low fluorescent background and has functional groups on the surface which can be used to covalently attach the DNA. In the described case, pre-activated Codelink (from GE Healthcare) slides were used for this purpose. The solution of the oligonucleotides (50 uM) for spotting was prepared in 150 mM phosphate/bicarbonate spotting buffer (pH=7.5). The arrays were then spotted and incubated in the humid chamber at 25 deg C. overnight. After the incubation, the arrays were blocked by washing in the 1&#xd7;TBST/2% BSA buffer, rinsed with nuclease free water and dried. The sequencing was performed in a chambered slide (Grace Biolabs). In the experiment, each well was subjected to different number of cycles using the mixture of 3&#x2032;-O-azidomethyl nucleotides with each extension cycle followed by a cleavage cycle.

The relatively high lead parameter was probably due to native nucleotide contamination in the polymerase preparation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> illustrates how the compensation helps to correct miscalls. For example, bases at locations 11, 13 and 15 would be a miscall in the original dephased data, but are correctly called (as are all the other bases) in the rephased data. For the 25-base read in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, the lead and lag parameters were 1.2% and 1.5% respectively. Although the lead and lag for this sample were not large enough to create miscalls in the original data (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34A</figref>), the lead/lag correction does make the correct base a stronger signal compared to the other colors (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34B</figref>).

It is clear from the data in the table that the use of a scavenger can improve the accuracy of base calling and reduce lead and lag. Importantly, extension reactions performed in the absence and in the presence of this disulfide based scavenger, cystamine, showed the additive does not significantly interfere with the extension reaction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>).

<p id="p-0335" num="0420">B. ATA Scavenger</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0421">A second scavenger was also tested, i.e. the azido based scavenger, ATA: (11-Azido-3,6,9-trioxaundecan-1-amine). Extension reactions performed in the absence and in the presence of this azido based scavenger. Nucleotides with 3&#x2032;-O-azidomethyl groups and with azido based cleavable linkers were used. The results (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>) show that the additive does not significantly interfere with the extension reaction.</p>

<heading id="h-0055" level="1">Hot Embossing: Millions to Billions of Beads on Slides or Chips</heading>
<p id="p-0339" num="0424">In one embodiment, the present invention contemplates such microspheres or beads disposed at high density into microwells or indentations on a surface. It is not intended that the present invention be limited by the nature of the surface or the method of fabrication. Nonetheless, in one embodiment, the present invention contemplates methods of fabrication to generate beads on slides at high density.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0425">In one preferred embodiment, the method relies on the use of a hot embossing technique as schematically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>. Briefly, the process employs a stamp (<b>80</b>) having projections (<b>81</b>) that will create desired features (<b>83</b>) of desired dimensions when pressed into the polymer (<b>82</b>). The pressing step (B) is typically done with heat and pressure. Thereafter, the stamp is removed and the polymer is cooled (step C). Finally (step D), microspheres (<b>84</b>) containing biomolecules (<b>85</b>) are loaded into the microwells (<b>86</b>). In another embodiment, the method relies on the use of injection molding technique.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0426">It is not intended that the present invention be limited by the nature of the polymer used in performing the hot embossing or molding process. A variety of polymers can be used including but not limited to: PMMA (polymethyl methacrylate), COP (cycloolefine polymer), and COC (cycloolefine copolymer). In the case of polymers that lack natural functional groups on the surface these groups can be grafted on the surface by performing ozonation, oxidation, corona discharge treatment, surface plasma or UV treatment or combination thereof. These fabrication methods allow one to generate substrates with varying features/wells density. Using standard size microscope slides casted out of PMMA or COP polymers one can create wells with 20 um, 5 um, and 1 um diameters. The slides with approximately 5 um features (e.g. between 4.8 um and 5.3 um) contain about 40 million microwells per slide, while the 1 um feature slide contains about 1 billion features per slide. With the biomolecule-containing microspheres deposited within the microwells, a single slide with such features permits a variety of high throughput, robust assays (e.g. sequencing by synthesis, hybridization, etc.). Nucleic acid fragments representing a large portion of a genome (e.g. human genome) or even an entire genome can be placed on a single slide or handful of slides, and then assayed sequentially or simultaneously.</p>

<heading id="h-0057" level="1">Sequencing: Changing the Spacer Arm Groups or Charge</heading>
<p id="p-0342" num="0427">When performing sequencing by synthesis process one needs to use labeled nucleotides to be able to read the signal. In most cases these labeled nucleotides after cleavage result in structures that is not of the native nucleotide. For example, if one uses only labeled nucleotides the DNA structure after cleavage of the dye looks like one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> (right side). As can be seen, the spacer arm used to attach the dye to the base still remains attached.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0428">In some cases the spacer also carries a charge, such as for example when propargylamino nucleotides are used. In the case of disulfide bonds what remains after cleavage is the spacer arm with thiol (SH) group attached. The presence of these spacers and groups may affect the ability of the sequencing polymerases to incorporate the subsequent nucleotide. One approach to minimize or eliminate this undesirable effect is to change the reactivity of the spacer arm groups or their charge by performing a chemical &#x201c;capping&#x201d; step, where specific reagent is added to react only with groups on the spacer arm. This is shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref>.</p>
<heading id="h-0058" level="1">Example 19</heading>
<heading id="h-0059" level="1">Sequencing by Synthesis Data: Using Labeled and Unlabeled Nucleotides</heading>
<p id="p-0344" num="0429">As noted previously, the presence of the linkers, spacers and groups on nucleotides may affect the ability of the sequencing polymerases to incorporate the subsequent nucleotide. One approach to minimize or eliminate this undesirable effect is to reduce the amount of labeled nucleotides incorporated in the template. Reducing the amount of labeled nucleotides that are incorporated can be accomplished by reducing the concentration of labeled nucleotides in the extension solution, and/or mixing labeled nucleotides (reversible terminators) with non-labeled reversibly terminating nucleotides. In contrast to labeled nucleotides, non-labeled reversible terminator nucleotides after cleavage convert to native nucleotide.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0430">The effect of reducing the concentration of labeled nucleotides can be best observed by measuring the ability of polymerase to incorporate the subsequent nucleotides efficiently and with high fidelity. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 44</figref>, <b>45</b> and <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0431">When the amount of labeled nucleotides is reduced, this results in reduction of fluorescent signal as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 47</figref> (where only labeled nucleotides are used in successive extention reactions). In principle only the amount of signal necessary to decode the nucleotide is required. In addition to changing the ratio of labeled and unlabeled nucleotides and optimizing it for particular polymerase, one can also adjust the time of extension (e.g. reduce extension times down to 1-2 minutes) to gain even better control on the signal/incorporation ratio of labeled nucleotides. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 48 and 49</figref> where additional performance improvement is achieved upon reducing extension time (to 2 minutes and 1 minute, respectively).</p>
