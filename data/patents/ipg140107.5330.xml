<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a travel supporting control system <b>10</b> including an LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> which performs traveling-lane keeping assist control so that a vehicle V travels without deviating from the lane along which it travels, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> calculates a virtual lane width W, which is the width of the lane narrowed by an obstacle O detected by an obstacle detecting sensor <b>11,</b> and stops the traveling-lane keeping assist control when the calculated virtual lane width W is so narrow as to be equal to or smaller than a threshold value and an avoidance operation of the driver is required. Accordingly, since the operation of LDW or LKA can be stopped at a proper timing, it becomes possible to prevent interference between the operation of the driver and the operation of the system for keeping the lane.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a National Stage of International Application No. PCT/JP2009/062520 filed on Jul. 9, 2009, which claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-181869, filed on Jul. 11, 2008, the contents of all of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a travel supporting control system and in particular, to a travel supporting control system which supports driving of a driver of a vehicle or controls traveling of the vehicle so that the vehicle travels without deviating from the lane along which it travels.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A system has been proposed which performs support of driving of a driver or control of traveling of a vehicle, such as lane departure warning (LDW) or lane keeping assist (LKA), so that the vehicle travels without deviating from the lane along which it travels. For example, Patent Literature 1 discloses a lane departure control device which detects a parked vehicle in front of its own vehicle, sets a virtual line by changing an actual lane which is a threshold value for control of departure prevention on the basis of the detected parked vehicle, and performs control for lane departure prevention on the basis of the virtual line when the vehicle tends to deviate from the lane, so that the control for lane departure prevention can be optimally performed in consideration of a front obstacle, such as a parked vehicle.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the above technique, however, if a driver performs a driving operation of avoiding the obstacle in front of the vehicle without stopping the operation of LDW or LKA, the operation of LDW or LKA for keeping the lane and the driving operation of the driver may interfere with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">That is, if an obstacle exists in front of the vehicle during the operation of LDW or LKA, an avoidance operation by course changing is required. Usually, the driver performs an avoidance operation after performing a blinker operation for course changing. Accordingly, the driver performs the avoidance operation (course changing) after the operation of LDW or LKA is stopped by the blinker operation. However, when the detection of an obstacle is late, the operation of LDW or LKA is not stopped by the blinker operation or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, since steering power is generated in a direction against the avoidance operation by LDW or LKA, the steering power may interfere with the operation of the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Currently, as a method of stopping the operation of LDW or LKA in order to avoid an obstacle, a driver should perform a blinker operation or set an operation switch of LDW or LKA to OFF. Interference by the operation of LDW or LKA cannot be completely prevented even if the operation of LDW or LKA is stopped when the driver steers with steering power equal to or more than a threshold value. For this reason, unless a driver performs a switch operation, interference between the operation of the driver and the operation of LDW or LKA occurs. Therefore, there is a demand for stopping the operation of LDW or LKA at a proper timing even if the driver does not perform a switch operation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention has been made in view of the situation, and it is an object of the present invention to provide a travel supporting control system capable of preventing interference between the operation of a driver and the operation of a system for keeping the lane.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is a travel supporting control system including: a traveling-lane keeping assist control unit that performs traveling-lane keeping assist control, which is either assistance of driving of a driver of a vehicle or control of traveling of the vehicle, so that the vehicle travels without deviating from a lane along which the vehicle travels; an obstacle detecting unit that detects an obstacle in front of the vehicle; a virtual lane width calculating unit that calculates a virtual lane width which is a width of the lane narrowed by the obstacle detected by the obstacle detecting unit; and a traveling-lane keeping control stopping unit that stops the traveling-lane keeping assist control performed by the traveling-lane keeping control unit when the virtual lane width calculated by the virtual lane width calculating unit is equal to or smaller than a threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to this configuration, in the travel supporting control system including the traveling-lane keeping assist control unit that performs traveling-lane keeping assist control so that the vehicle travels without deviating from the lane along which it travels, the virtual lane width calculating unit calculates the virtual lane width, which is the width of the lane narrowed by the obstacle detected by the obstacle detecting unit, and the traveling-lane keeping control stopping unit stops the traveling-lane keeping assist control performed by the traveling-lane keeping control unit when the virtual lane width calculated by the virtual lane width calculating unit is so narrow as to be equal to or smaller than the threshold value and the avoidance operation of the driver is required. Accordingly, since the operation of LDW or LKA can be stopped at a proper timing, it becomes possible to prevent interference between the operation of the driver and the operation of the system for keeping the lane.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In this case, it is preferable to further include a virtual lane setting unit that sets a virtual lane which is a region where the vehicle travels in the lane narrowed by the obstacle detected by the obstacle detecting unit, and it is preferable that the virtual lane width calculating unit calculates a width of the virtual lane set by the virtual lane setting unit as the virtual lane width.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to this configuration, the virtual lane setting unit sets a virtual lane, which is a region where the vehicle travels in the lane narrowed by the obstacle detected by the obstacle detecting unit, and the virtual lane width calculating unit calculates the width of the virtual lane set by the virtual lane setting unit as the virtual lane width. Accordingly, it is possible to stop the operation of LDW or LKA at an ideal timing according to the width of the region where the vehicle travels.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In this case, it is preferable to further include: a driver intention detecting unit capable of detecting a direction, in which the driver is going to make the vehicle travel, on the basis of an operation of the driver of the vehicle; and a virtual lane selecting unit that, when the virtual lane setting unit sets a plurality of virtual lanes divided in the width direction of the virtual lane by the obstacle detected by the obstacle detecting unit, selects the virtual lane in the direction in which the driver is going to make the vehicle travel, which is detected by the driver intention detecting unit, from the plurality of divided virtual lanes. Moreover, it is preferable that the traveling-lane keeping control stopping unit stops the traveling-lane keeping assist control performed by the traveling-lane keeping control unit when the virtual lane width of the virtual lane selected by the virtual lane selecting unit is equal to or smaller than the threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to this configuration, the traveling-lane keeping control stopping unit stops the traveling-lane keeping assist control when the virtual lane width of the virtual lane in the direction in which the driver is going to make the vehicle travel, which is detected by the driver intention detecting unit, among the plurality of divided virtual lanes is equal to or smaller than the threshold value. Accordingly, even when a lane which stops the operation of LDW or LKA and a lane which does not stop the operation of LDW or LKA are mixed on the road, it becomes possible to prevent interference between the operation of the driver and the operation of the system for keeping the lane.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In addition, preferably, the traveling-lane keeping assist control unit performs the traveling-lane keeping assist control so that the vehicle travels without deviating from the virtual lane until the vehicle arrives at the location where the virtual lane width becomes equal to or smaller than the threshold value in the virtual lane, and the traveling-lane keeping control stopping unit stops the traveling-lane keeping assist control performed by the traveling-lane keeping control unit when the vehicle arrives at the location where the virtual lane width becomes equal to or smaller than the threshold value in the virtual lane.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to this configuration, the traveling-lane keeping assist control is performed so that the vehicle travels without deviating from the virtual lane until the vehicle arrives at the location where the virtual lane width becomes equal to or smaller than the threshold value in the virtual lane, and the traveling-lane keeping assist control is stopped when the vehicle arrives at the location where the virtual lane width becomes equal to or smaller than the threshold value in the virtual lane. Accordingly, even in a virtual lane narrowed by the obstacle, it is possible to operate LDW or LKA until the vehicle arrives at the location where the virtual lane width becomes equal to or smaller than the threshold value and stop the operation of LDW or LKA at a proper timing.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Alternatively, it is preferable that when the driver intention detecting unit does not detect a direction in which the driver is going to make the vehicle travel, the traveling-lane keeping control stopping unit stops the traveling-lane keeping assist control performed by the traveling-lane keeping control unit when one of the plurality of divided virtual lanes is equal to or smaller than the threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to this configuration, if a driver does not determine the direction in which the driver is going to make the vehicle travel, the traveling-lane keeping assist control is stopped when one of the plurality of divided virtual lanes becomes equal to or smaller than a threshold value. Accordingly, when a driver's intention is not determined, the traveling-lane keeping assist control is stopped early. As a result, it becomes possible to prevent interference between the operation of the driver and the operation of the system for keeping the lane when the driver's intention is determined.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the travel supporting control system of the present invention, it becomes possible to prevent interference between the operation of a driver and the operation of a system for keeping the lane.</p>

The distance L<b>2</b> is set to L<b>2</b>=L<b>1</b> or is set to a value smaller than the distance L<b>1</b>, for example, L<b>2</b>=L<b>1</b>/<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Ideally, T which is a normal avoidance timing of a driver is set for every driver by learning the driving operation characteristic of each driver by the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b>. However, when the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> cannot learn the driving operation characteristic of each driver or when the driving operation characteristics have not been learned yet sufficiently, it may be set on the basis of the value calculated from the statistical data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a graph showing the distribution of timing of a normal avoidance operation of a driver against an obstacle. 3.8 seconds, which is the average value of a normal avoidance timing of a driver, or 1.8 seconds, which is a lower limit of the avoidance timing, may be used as an initial value of T which is the normal avoidance timing of the driver.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">It is still better that the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> changes the initial value of T, which is the normal avoidance timing of the driver, on the basis of the speed of an obstacle detected by the obstacle detecting sensor <b>11</b> and the vehicle speed sensor <b>12</b>, the relative speed with respect to the obstacle, and the overlapping rate with the obstacle (rate at which the obstacle O overlaps the vehicle V in the lane width direction).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a graph showing the relationship between the relative speed with respect to the obstacle O and T, which is a normal avoidance timing, when the overlapping rate is 50% in a state where the obstacle is stopped, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the case when the overlapping rate is 100% in a state where the obstacle O is stopped, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows the case when the overlapping rate is 50% in a state where the speed of the obstacle O is 30 km/h, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows the case when the overlapping rate is 100% in a state where the speed of the obstacle O is 30 km/h.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 11</figref>, the initial value of T which is the normal avoidance timing decreases as the relative speed with respect to the obstacle increases in all of the cases. The initial value of T in the case where the speed is 30 km/h is larger than the case where the obstacle O is in the stopped state. It is thought that the initial value of T tends to be larger when the overlapping rate is closer to 100%.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In addition, the virtual white line L<sub>V </sub>may be set as a line other than the straight line described above. For example, it may be set as a clothoid curve. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> may calculate the virtual lane width W by setting the safety margin M with a width of about 0.1 to 1.0 m at the side of the obstacle O and pulling the virtual white line L<sub>V </sub>on the basis of the safety margin M and the distances L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> determines whether or not the virtual lane width W shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is equal to or smaller than a predetermined threshold value, for example, 3.5 m (S<b>104</b>). When the virtual lane width W is equal to or smaller than 3.5 m or less, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> stops the operation of LDW or LKA (S<b>105</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5D</figref> are plan views showing an example when course changing is required for obstacle avoidance. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> controls the operation of LDW or LKA on the basis of the virtual white line L<sub>V </sub>until the vehicle V arrives at the location where the virtual lane width W becomes equal to or smaller than 3.5 m in the virtual lane. The LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> guides the vehicle V to the right side while the control of LKA is being performed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, when the vehicle V arrives at the location where the virtual lane width W becomes equal to or smaller than 3.5 m in the virtual lane, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> stops the operation of LDW and LKA. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, the vehicle V avoids the obstacle O by going over the white line L<sub>R</sub>, which is a boundary of the lane, and deviating from the lane to perform course changing. However, since the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> stopped the operation of LDW and LKA, a warning by the buzzer <b>18</b> or the steering torque for returning to the lane by the steering torque output device <b>20</b> is not generated even if the vehicle V deviates from the lane.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the virtual lane width W is not equal to or smaller than 3.5 m which is a predetermined threshold value (S<b>104</b>), the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> controls the operation of LDW or LKA on the basis of the virtual white line L<sub>V </sub>regarding the white line L<sub>R </sub>at the opposite side of the avoidance direction (at a side where the obstacle O is located in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) (S<b>106</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6D</figref> are plan views showing an example when course changing is not necessary for obstacle avoidance. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> controls the operation of LDW or LKA on the basis of the virtual white line L<sub>V</sub>. The LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> guides the vehicle V to the right side while the control of LKA is being performed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C and 5D</figref>, even if the vehicle V approaches the obstacle O, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> continues the operation of LDW or LKA on the basis of the virtual white line L<sub>V </sub>because the virtual lane width W in the virtual lane is larger than 3.5 m, which is a threshold value, so that the vehicle V can avoid the obstacle O without deviating from the lane.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">(Operation in the Situation Where There is an Obstacle in a Front Lane and Avoidance to Either the Left Side or the Right Side is Possible)</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a plan view showing the situation of a road to which the travel supporting control system according to the embodiment is applied. In the following description, the case is assumed in which the vehicle V is traveling on the lane divided by the white line L<sub>R </sub>and the obstacle O, such as a parked vehicle, is located in the middle of the lane. Also in this case, the overall operation is performed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a flow chart showing the details of the operation of the travel supporting control system <b>10</b> according to the embodiment, which shows the operation in the situation where the obstacle O exists in the front lane and avoidance to either the left side or the right side is possible. When the obstacle detecting sensor <b>11</b> does not detect that the obstacle O exists in the front lane (S<b>201</b>), the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> performs lane keeping control by LDW or LKA on the basis of the actual white line L<sub>R </sub>(S<b>202</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the obstacle detecting sensor <b>11</b> detects that the obstacle O exists in the front lane (S<b>101</b>), the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> sets the distances L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b> similarly to the operation in the situation where there is no choice but to avoid the obstacle in one direction and pulls virtual white lines L<sub>V1 </sub>and L<sub>V2</sub>, which divide the region where the vehicle V travels, to the left and right sides of the obstacle O. Also in this case, the virtual white line L<sub>V </sub>may be set as a line other than the straight line. For example, it may be set as a clothoid curve. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> may calculate the virtual lane widths W<sub>1 </sub>and W<sub>2 </sub>by setting the safety margin M with a width of about 0.1 to 1.0 m at the left and right sides of the obstacle O and pulling the virtual white lines L<sub>V1 </sub>and L<sub>V2 </sub>on the basis of the safety margin M and the distances L<b>1</b> and L<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> determines that the driver has an intention to avoid the obstacle O to the right side by the steering torque detecting sensor <b>14</b> (S<b>204</b>), the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> determines whether or not the virtual lane width W<sub>1 </sub>on the right side of the obstacle O shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is equal to or smaller than a predetermined threshold value, for example, 3.5 m (S<b>205</b>). When the vehicle V arrives at the location where the virtual lane width W<sub>1 </sub>becomes equal to or smaller than 3.5 m, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> stops the operation of LDW or LKA (S<b>206</b>). A determination regarding in which direction of the left and right directions the driver is going to avoid the obstacle O can be made on the basis of the steering in the early stage of avoidance of the driver, for example. On the other hand, when the virtual lane width W<sub>1 </sub>is not equal to or smaller than 3.5 m which is a predetermined threshold value (S<b>205</b>), the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> controls the operation of LDW or LKA on the basis of the white line L<sub>R </sub>on the right side and the virtual white line LV<sub>1 </sub>on the right side of the obstacle O (S<b>207</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> does not determine that the driver has an intention to avoid the obstacle O to the right side by the steering torque detecting sensor <b>14</b> (S<b>204</b>) but determines that the driver has an intention to avoid the obstacle O to the left side (S<b>208</b>), the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> determines whether or not the virtual lane width W<sub>2 </sub>on the left side of the obstacle O shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is equal to or smaller than a predetermined threshold value, for example, 3.5 m (S<b>209</b>). When the vehicle V arrives at the location where the virtual lane width W<sub>2 </sub>becomes equal to or smaller than 3.5 m, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> stops the operation of LDW or LKA (S<b>210</b>). On the other hand, when the virtual lane width W<sub>2 </sub>is not equal to or smaller than 3.5 m which is a predetermined threshold value (S<b>209</b>), the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> controls the operation of LDW or LKA on the basis of the white line L<sub>R </sub>on the left side and the virtual white line LV<sub>2 </sub>on the left side of the obstacle O (S<b>211</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> does not determine that the driver has an intention to avoid the obstacle O to the right side by the steering torque detecting sensor <b>14</b> (S<b>204</b>) and does not determine that the driver has an intention to avoid the obstacle O to the left side (S<b>208</b>), the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> stops the operation of LDW or LKA (S<b>213</b>) if the virtual lane width W<sub>1 </sub>is equal to or smaller than 3.5 m which is a predetermined threshold value or if the virtual lane width W<sub>2 </sub>is equal to or smaller than 3.5 m which is a predetermined threshold value (S<b>212</b>). In addition, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> determines whether to stop the operation of LDW or LKA on the basis of the virtual lane width W<sub>1 </sub>of the region, which is divided by the virtual white line L<sub>V1 </sub>and the white line L<sub>R </sub>on the right side, and the virtual lane width W<sub>2 </sub>of the region, which is divided by the virtual white line L<sub>V2 </sub>and the white line L<sub>R </sub>on the left side. However, before stopping the operation of LDW or LKA, the lane divided by the actual white line L<sub>R </sub>is set, for both the left and right sides, as a lane from which departure is to be prevented by LDW or LKA.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In this case, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> may set, as conditions of stopping the operation of LDW or LKA, the case where the virtual lane width W<sub>1 </sub>is equal to or smaller than 3.5 m which is a predetermined threshold value or the virtual lane width W<sub>2 </sub>is equal to or smaller than 3.5 m which is a predetermined threshold value in S<b>212</b>. Moreover, in this case, a point of time when the vehicle V arrives at the location where the distance from the obstacle O is a distance set as a predetermined threshold value, for example, the distance L<b>1</b> may be set as a point of time when the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> does not determine that the driver has an intention to avoid the obstacle O to the right side by the steering torque detecting sensor <b>14</b> (S<b>204</b>) and does not determine that the driver has an intention to avoid the obstacle O to the left side.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">On the other hand, when the virtual lane width W<sub>1 </sub>is not equal to or smaller than 3.5 m which is a predetermined threshold value or the virtual lane width W<sub>2 </sub>is not equal to or smaller than 3.5 m which is a predetermined threshold value (S<b>212</b>), the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> performs lane keeping control on the basis of the actual white line L<sub>R </sub>by LDW or LKA (S<b>202</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the present embodiment, in the travel supporting control system <b>10</b> including the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> which performs traveling-lane keeping assist control so that the vehicle V travels without deviating from the lane along which it travels, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> calculates the virtual lane width W, which is the width of the lane narrowed by the obstacle O detected by the obstacle detecting sensor <b>11</b>, and stops the traveling-lane keeping assist control when the calculated virtual lane width W is so narrow as to be equal to or smaller than a threshold value and the avoidance operation of the driver is required. Accordingly, since the operation of LDW or LKA can be stopped at a proper timing, it becomes possible to prevent interference between the operation of the driver and the operation of the system for keeping the lane.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Moreover, in the present embodiment, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> sets a virtual lane, which is a region where the vehicle V travels in the lane narrowed by the obstacle O detected by the obstacle detecting sensor <b>11</b>, and calculates the width of the set virtual lane as the virtual lane width W. Accordingly, it is possible to stop the operation of LDW or LKA at an ideal timing according to the width of the region where the vehicle V travels.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Moreover, in the present embodiment, the LDW/LKA system <b>17</b> stops the operation of LDW or LKA when the virtual lane width W<sub>1 </sub>or the virtual lane width W<sub>2 </sub>of the virtual lane in a direction in which the driver is going to make the vehicle travel, which is assumed on the basis of the steering torque detected by the steering torque detecting sensor <b>14</b>, among the plurality of divided virtual lanes is equal to or smaller than the threshold value. Accordingly, even when a lane which stops the operation of LDW or LKA and a lane which does not stop the operation of LDW or LKA are mixed on the road, it becomes possible to prevent interference between the operation of the driver and the operation of the system for keeping the lane.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Moreover, in the present embodiment, traveling-lane keeping assist control is performed so that the vehicle V travels without deviating from the virtual lane until the vehicle V arrives at the location where the virtual lane width W becomes equal to or smaller than the threshold value in the virtual lane, and the traveling-lane keeping assist control is stopped when the vehicle V arrives at the location where the virtual lane width W becomes equal to or smaller than the threshold value in the virtual lane. Accordingly, even in a virtual lane narrowed by the obstacle O, it is possible to operate LDW or LKA until the midway and stop the operation of LDW or LKA at a proper timing.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, according to the present embodiment, if a driver does not determine the direction in which the driver is going to make the vehicle travel, the traveling-lane keeping assist control is stopped when one of the plurality of divided virtual lanes becomes equal to or smaller than a threshold value. Accordingly, when a driver's intention is not determined, the traveling-lane keeping assist control is stopped early. As a result, it becomes possible to prevent interference between the operation of the driver and the operation of the system for keeping the lane when the driver's intention is determined.</p>
