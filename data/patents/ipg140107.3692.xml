<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) advisories may be graphically displayed on a display located in the flight deck and may provide pilots and flight crews with information on the location of other aircraft in the vicinity. TCAS equipment transmits signals to transponder equipped aircrafts within its immediate vicinity and receives reply signals from the aircraft. By measuring the time intervals between the transmissions and the replies the TCAS can determine the relative range, bearing and altitude of the other aircraft(s). With this information the TCAS can determine a potential threat and will, if necessary, generate advisories on the TCAS display, with the advisories varying depending on the severity of the threat. The advisories may be graphically displayed as a generally trapezoidal shape that moves upwards and downwards on the TCAS display, with the location being indicative of the threat of the aircraft and where the threat of the aircraft is based upon the proximity, speed, climb rate, etc. of each aircraft. The generally trapezoidal shape may be designed to match the shape of the aircraft reference symbol and thus may not be entirely trapezoidal.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a portion of a prior art aircraft <b>2</b> having a cockpit <b>4</b> with a flight deck <b>6</b> having multiple flight displays <b>10</b>. The multiple flight displays <b>10</b> may include primary and secondary flight displays any of which may be used to display to the pilot and flight crew a wide range of aircraft, flight, navigation, and other information used in the operation and control of the aircraft. TCAS information and advisories may be graphically displayed on any of the flight displays <b>10</b> located in the flight deck <b>6</b> to provide pilots and flight crews with information on the location of other aircraft in the vicinity.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a prior art flight display <b>10</b>, which may be used to visually indicate an advisory from the TCAS. The display <b>10</b> shows an air speed indicator <b>12</b>, an altitude indicator <b>14</b>, a vertical speed indicator <b>16</b>, which are all illustrated as scales, and an aircraft reference symbol including a boresight <b>18</b> representing the aircrafts longitudinal axis at the center of the boresight <b>18</b> and conventional aircraft symbols <b>20</b> and <b>22</b> on either side thereof. A ladder <b>24</b> may represent the pitch scale and an artificial horizon may include a line <b>26</b> between an upper pitch scale area <b>28</b> and a lower pitch scale area <b>30</b>. Both pitch scale areas <b>28</b>, <b>30</b> may be differently colored to better assess the areas above and below the horizon line <b>26</b>. A roll scale <b>32</b> may also be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A descent avoidance region <b>34</b> indicating a TCAS do not descend advisory includes a trapezoid symbol. An ascent avoidance region <b>36</b> indicating a TCAS do not climb advisory includes a similar trapezoid symbol. Both avoidance regions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> together define two pitch value ranges which should be avoided by the crew of the aircraft. Accordingly, the avoidance regions <b>34</b>, <b>36</b> define in between them a region of values, which are allowed. Simultaneous with the presentation of the avoidance regions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> additional information such as air speeds, altitudes, and vertical speed values which should be avoided or maintained may be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an additional prior art display where the descent avoidance region <b>34</b> is closer, in time, range, or altitude, to the aircraft than the ascent avoidance region <b>36</b>. As such, the descent avoidance region <b>34</b> has moved up on the ladder <b>24</b> closer to the aircraft reference symbol. It may be seen that the avoidance regions <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> are static shapes that translate up and down according to the threat severity of other air traffic. It will be understood that the pilot will have to read the pitch scale to determine that the descent avoidance region <b>34</b> has moved and that the area to be avoided has changed. This may require additional scrutiny for the pilot to determine the relative proximity of each avoidance region <b>34</b> and <b>36</b> and the area that the aircraft should stay within.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The inventive method makes such a severity of an avoidance region or a difference between the avoidance regions easier to identify and react to. According to the first embodiment a method of visually indicating an advisory from the TCAS on a flight display includes receiving a TCAS advisory, determining the severity of the received TCAS advisory, displaying a geometric body on the flight display in response to a TCAS advisory, and altering at least one of an angle and an arc in the displayed geometric body in response to the determined severity. This may be easily seen in the flight display <b>100</b>, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, wherein it is more clearly illustrated that a descent avoidance region <b>134</b> is closer to the aircraft than the ascent avoidance region <b>136</b> and that the angles of the geometric bodies forming the avoidance regions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> are altered.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The flight display <b>100</b> illustrates a geometric body forming the descent avoidance region <b>134</b> indicating a do not descend advisory and a different and geometric body forming the ascent avoidance region <b>136</b> indicating a do not climb advisory. It is contemplated that the geometric bodies may include various shapes including polygons and that in the case of an increased severity of the advisory that such geometric bodies may be reshaped so that the pilot may more readily determine the threat of the avoidance regions. In the case of the polygon it is contemplated that such reshaping may include altering at least one angle of the polygon forming the avoidance region. It is contemplated that the geometric bodies representing the avoidance regions may be displayed on a flight display <b>100</b> that is a primary flight display. Thus, the geometric bodies may lay between the air speed indicator <b>112</b> and the altitude indicator <b>114</b> displayed on the primary flight display. It will be understood that any geometric shapes may be used for the descent avoidance region <b>134</b> and ascent avoidance region <b>136</b> including circular shapes or shapes having smooth curves or rounded corners in such cases it is contemplated that at least one arc of the geometric body may be altered in response to the determined severity.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">More specifically, the geometric body forming the descent avoidance region <b>134</b> has been illustrated as a trapezoid having a cap <b>140</b>, a shorter side, and base <b>142</b>, a longer side, connected by opposing sides. The cap <b>140</b> may be parallel to the horizontal axis of the aircraft reference symbol and may be a straight line segment or shape that matches the aircraft reference symbol. The base <b>142</b> correlates to a horizontal line segment correlating to the bottom edge of the display. The opposing sides are formed by two auxiliary line segments <b>144</b> and <b>146</b>. All of which are positioned such that together the cap <b>140</b>, base <b>142</b>, and line segments <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> define a base-down trapezoid.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The trapezoid forming the ascent avoidance region <b>136</b> is similarly shaped however it is considered a base-up trapezoid as its largest side, corresponding to a base <b>148</b> of the trapezoid, is at the upper edge of the display <b>100</b>. Correspondingly, the lower portion of the trapezoid on the display may be considered the cap <b>150</b> of the trapezoid, which is parallel to the horizontal axis of the aircraft reference symbol. It also has two auxiliary line segments <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> which along with the base <b>148</b> and cap <b>150</b> define the base-up trapezoid. Thus, as described, the trapezoid is base-down when the TCAS advisory is for an aircraft at a lower altitude and base-up when the TCAS advisory is for an aircraft at a higher altitude.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As the aircraft at the lower altitude provides a greater severity advisory a shape of the geometric body is altered. More specifically, the interior angles connecting the cap <b>140</b> to the sides <b>144</b> and <b>146</b> are increased corresponding to the increased severity. When the severity is high at least a portion of the geometric body forming the avoidance region may overlap with at least a portion of the air speed indicator <b>112</b> and/or the altitude indicator <b>114</b>, as may be seen in the illustrative descent avoidance region <b>134</b>. As the aircraft at the higher altitude provides a less severe advisory the interior angles connecting its cap <b>150</b> to its sides <b>152</b>, <b>154</b> are decreased correspondingly. It is contemplated that when the severity is low no portion of the geometric body forming the avoidance region overlaps with either the air speed indicator <b>112</b> or altitude indicator <b>114</b>, as may be seen in the illustrative ascent avoidance region <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Both the descent avoidance region <b>134</b> and ascent avoidance region <b>136</b> may be displayed in a contrasting color, for instance a red color, indicating symbolically the &#x201c;red area&#x201d; which is not advisable. Alternatively, the avoidance regions <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> may be, by way of non-limiting examples, shaded, crosshatched, outlined in a contrasting color, or filled with a semi-transparent color to contrast them from the remainder of the display <b>100</b>. Both avoidance regions <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> may underlie a portion of the pitch ladder <b>124</b>. The values of the pitch scale surrounded by the avoidance regions <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> are in the &#x201c;red area&#x201d; which should be avoided by the aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The above described inventive embodiment allows dynamic TCAS avoidance regions to be shaped in proportion to the aircraft's proximity to the avoidance regions indicating other aircrafts, creating a visual &#x201c;floor&#x201d; and &#x201c;ceiling&#x201d; effect to help guide the pilot during the TCAS resolution maneuver. It is contemplated that the avoidance regions <b>134</b>, <b>136</b> may dynamically re-shape themselves in proportion to the aircraft's proximity to the region's limit to better inform the pilot of the severity of the advisories. In the illustrated example, the descent avoidance region <b>134</b> is shaped with a wider aspect to appear as if a &#x201c;floor&#x201d; is closer than the &#x201c;ceiling&#x201d; and this is further aided in the fact that the ascent avoidance region <b>136</b> appears more distant due to its narrower aspect.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Further, it has been contemplated that altering the avoidance region in response to the determined severity may occur when only a single advisory is being displayed on the flight display <b>100</b>. Thus, it will be understood that the avoidance regions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> may be shown independently of each of other if only one advisory is warranted and that such shapes may be re-shaped in the above described manner so that the severity of the advisories may be more readily determined. In such an instance and by way of non-limiting example, the angles connecting the cap with the sides of the trapezoid may be increased to show the increased severity of the advisory, which acts to increase the area of the trapezoid. Even with a single advisory such a re-shaping may aid in creating the &#x201c;floor&#x201d; or &#x201c;ceiling&#x201d; effect from which the pilot may more easily assess the values that are allowed.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a descent avoidance region <b>234</b> and ascent avoidance region <b>236</b> according to a second embodiment, which may be displayed on the flight display <b>100</b>. The descent avoidance region <b>234</b> and ascent avoidance region <b>236</b> have been displayed such that they rotate to remain aligned with the horizon, for example when the aircraft is in a left roll. Further, the fill styles of the avoidance regions <b>234</b> and <b>236</b> have been set according to the determined severities. More specifically, the fill styles may be set to have non-uniform fill styles, which may further be used to simulate the &#x201c;floor&#x201d; and &#x201c;ceiling&#x201d; effect and enhance the displayed avoidance regions <b>234</b> and <b>236</b>. The ascent avoidance region <b>236</b> has been illustrated as being non-uniformly filled with a first symbol <b>260</b> while the descent region <b>234</b> has been illustrated as being non-uniformly filled with a second symbol <b>262</b>. The non-uniform fill of the first and second symbols <b>260</b> and <b>262</b>, in both cases, is due to the line thickness used to form the symbols <b>260</b> and <b>262</b>; however, it is also contemplated that the non-uniformity may also occur because of spacing of the symbols <b>260</b> and <b>262</b> within the avoidance regions. It is contemplated that the non-uniform fill styles may alternatively include gradient shading, gradient transparencies, or non-uniform lines. The setting of the fill styles in response to the determined severity may be in addition to the changed shape of the advisories as shown or may be used in the alternative.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a descent avoidance region <b>334</b> and ascent avoidance region <b>336</b> according to a third embodiment, which may be displayed on the flight display <b>100</b>. It will be understood that the geometric shapes forming the avoidance regions <b>334</b> and <b>336</b> may also be used to provide lateral guidance in addition to pitch guidance and that in such situations the avoidance regions <b>334</b> and <b>336</b> may be further reshaped to indicate an overall region to avoid that may include both vertical and lateral aspects. The avoidance regions <b>334</b> and <b>336</b> have been proportionally reshaped to illustrate the lateral threat severity and to indicate to the flight crew that a lateral maneuver should be made. It may be seen that the caps <b>340</b> and <b>350</b> of the avoidance regions <b>334</b> and <b>336</b>, respectively, are no longer horizontal with the horizon. More specifically, the aircraft is illustrated as being in level flight and the avoidance regions <b>334</b> and <b>336</b> indicate that a climb and/or a left turn is required to escape the threat region.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, the avoidance regions <b>334</b> and <b>336</b> may include setting the graphical fill styles, which may alternatively be used to better simulate the &#x201c;floor&#x201d; and &#x201c;ceiling&#x201d; effect and enhance the displayed avoidance regions <b>334</b> and <b>336</b>. The ascent avoidance region <b>336</b> has been illustrated as having a fill style that includes lines <b>364</b> having a variable spacing, which gives the user a similar effect of the perceived spacing of railroad ties when looking down a train track. The descent fill style of the avoidance region <b>334</b> includes contour lines <b>366</b>, which may also be used to enhance the displayed avoidance region.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It will be understood that the above described embodiments aid in aerial navigation as the pilot's ability to perform a safe avoidance maneuver is improved. Advantages that may be realized include that a pilot may more readily determine the severity of the advisory and that the pilot may more readily determine the areas that are allowed and the areas which should be avoided. These advantages result in an improved safety margin.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">This written description uses examples to disclose the invention, including the best mode, and also to enable any person skilled in the art to practice the invention, including making and using any devices or systems and performing any incorporated methods.
