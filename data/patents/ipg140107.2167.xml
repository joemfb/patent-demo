<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Disclosed is an interferon-&#x3b1; (IFN-&#x3b1;) fused protein having IFN-&#x3b1; fused to a cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP). The disclosure relates to a fused protein wherein a CTP, which binds well to cell-membrane barriers and enables translocation into the liver, is genetically fused to a human IFN-&#x3b1;, thereby enhancing the conjugation capacity of cell membranes and antiviral activity, inhibiting CTP transport into the cell nucleus, and enhancing the translocation and settlement of the fused protein into the liver and of transduction to the liver tissue. Accordingly, it is possible to develop protein-based medicines effective for preventing or treating various liver diseases associated with viral infection at low doses.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. national stage filing under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7; 371 of international application PCT/KR2009/001575, filed Mar. 27, 2009.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to an interferon-&#x3b1; (IFN-&#x3b1;) fused protein having IFN-&#x3b1; fused to a cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP). More particularly, the disclosure relates to a fused protein wherein a CTP, which binds well to cell-membrane barriers and enables translocation into the liver, is fused to a human IFN-&#x3b1; at the N-terminal or C-terminal thereof, thereby enhancing the conjugation capacity of cell membranes, inhibiting CTP transport into the cell nucleus after being introduced into the cell, and enhancing the translocation and settlement of the fused protein into the liver and of transduction to the liver tissue.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Interferons (IFNs) are used to treat hepatitis and marketed as interferon-&#x3b1; (Intron A: Schering, Roferon A: Roche) or PEGylated IFN (PegIntron: Schering, Pegasys: Roche) wherein PEG is added to make the interferon last longer in the body.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The early side effect of interferon-&#x3b1; therapy includes fever, chills, lethargy, lack of appetite, nausea and myalgia, which occur in most patients in a dose-dependent manner. They are the most severe in the early stage of treatment and usually disappear when the treatment is stopped. Also, it is known that the occurrence and severity of side effects during treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients with PEG-interferon-&#x3b1; are comparable to those in treatment with interferon-&#x3b1; (1).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to the dose-dependent side effects associated with the interferon therapy, there is a need of reducing its administration dose.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Throughout the specification, a number of publications and patent documents are referred to and cited. The disclosure of the cited publications and patent documents is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety to more clearly describe the state of the related art and the present disclosure.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The inventors of the present disclosure have made efforts to develop an interferon with improved translocation and settlement into the liver tissue as well as better effect. As a result, they have prepared a fused protein wherein a cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP) is fused to a human interferon (IFN) and confirmed that it has improved translocation, penetration and settlement ability into the liver and thus can solve the side effect and cost problems of the existing therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure is directed to providing an IFN-&#x3b1; fused protein.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present disclosure is also directed to providing a nucleotide molecule coding for the IFN-&#x3b1; fused protein.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure is also directed to providing a vector including the nucleotide molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present disclosure is also directed to providing a transformant including the vector.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present disclosure is also directed to providing method for preparing an IFN-&#x3b1; fused protein.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present disclosure is also directed to providing a method for purifying an IFN-&#x3b1; fused protein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present disclosure is also directed to providing a pharmaceutical composition for preventing or treating a liver disease.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present disclosure is also directed to providing a method for preventing or treating a liver disease.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Other features and aspects will be apparent from the following detailed description, drawings, and claims.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In an aspect, the present disclosure provides an IFN-&#x3b1; fused protein comprising IFN-&#x3b1; fused to a CTP.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The inventors of the present disclosure have made efforts to develop an interferon with improved translocation and settlement into the liver tissue as well as better effect. As a result, they have prepared a fused protein wherein a CTP is fused to a human IFN and confirmed that it has improved translocation, penetration and settlement ability into the liver and thus can solve the side effect and cost problems of the existing therapy.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As used herein, the term &#x201c;IFN-&#x3b1; fused protein&#x201d; refers to a protein comprising IFN-&#x3b1; fused to a CTP.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The CTP included in the IFN-&#x3b1; fused protein of the present disclosure is a delivery peptide developed for the first time by the inventors of the present disclosure to solve the problems of PTD and was patented in several countries (Korean Patent No. 0608558, U.S. Pat. No. 7,101,844 and Japanese Patent No. 4188909). The disclosure of the patents about the CTP is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The term &#x201c;cytoplasmic transduction peptide (CTP)&#x201d; was first coined by the inventors of the present disclosure and refers to a peptide capable of penetrating the cell membranes and settling in the cytoplasm with limited transport into the nucleus.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The CTP included in the IFN-&#x3b1; fused protein of the present disclosure may have a peptide length generally employed in the related art. It may comprise specifically 9-20 amino acids, more specifically 9-15 amino acids, most specifically 11 amino acids.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In a specific embodiment of the present disclosure, the CTP included in the IFN-&#x3b1; fused protein of the present disclosure comprises an amino acid sequence selected from a group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 13-26. More specifically, it comprises an amino acid sequence selected from a group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 13-18, 20-22, 25 and 26. Most specifically, it comprises an amino acid sequence selected from a group consisting of SEQ ID NOS: 13 and 25.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The CTP binds well to cell membranes and its transport into the nucleus is inhibited after it is introduced into the cell. Further, since it has less cytotoxicity than other transporters (especially, PTD or polyarginine) and is capable of translocating the fused protein into the liver, it makes a very effective drug delivery peptide for treating liver diseases.</p>

Details can be found in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press (2001), which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Typically, the vector of the present disclosure may be established as a cloning vector or an expression vector. And, the vector of the present disclosure may be established using a prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell as host. Specifically, a prokaryotic cell may be used as the host considering that the nucleotide sequence of the present disclosure is derived from a prokaryotic cell and culturing is more convenient.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When the vector of the present disclosure is an expression vector and a prokaryotic cell is a host, a powerful promoter for transcription (e.g., tac promoter, lac promoter, lacUV5 promoter, lpp promoter, p<sub>L</sub><sup>&#x3bb;</sup> promoter, p<sub>R</sub><sup>&#x3bb;</sup> promoter, rac5 promoter, amp promoter, recA promoter, SP6 promoter, trp promoter, T7 promoter, etc.), a ribosome binding site for initiation of translation, and a transcription/translation termination sequence are included in general. When <i>E. coli </i>is used as the host cell, the promoter and operator regions involved in tryptophan biosynthesis in <i>E. coli </i>(Yanofsky, C., <i>J. Bacteria, </i>158: 1018-1024 (1984)) and the left side promoter of phage &#x3bb; (p<sub>L</sub><sup>&#x3bb;</sup> promoter, Herskowitz, I. and Hagen, D., <i>Ann. Rev. Genet., </i>14: 399-445 (1980)) can be used as a regulatory site.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Meanwhile, the vector that can be used in the present disclosure can be constructed by using a plasmid (e.g., pSC101, ColE1, pBR322, pUC8/9, pHC79, pUC19, pET, etc.), a phage (e.g., &#x3bb;gt4.&#x3bb;B, &#x3bb;-Charon, &#x3bb;&#x394;z1, M13, etc.) or a virus (e.g., SV40, etc.) that are typically used in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the vector of the present disclosure is an expression vector and has an eukaryotic cell as a host, a promoter originating from mammalian genome (e.g., metallothionein promoter) or promoter originating from mammalian virus (e.g., adenovirus late promoter, vaccinia virus 7.5K promoter, SV40 promoter, cytomegalovirus promoter and tk promoter of HSV) can be used. As a transcription termination sequence, polyadenylation sequence is generally used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The vector of the present disclosure may be fused with other sequence, if necessary, for easier purification of the IFN-&#x3b1; fused protein of the present disclosure expressed thereby. The fused sequence may be, for example, glutathione S-transferase (Pharmacia, USA), maltose-binding protein (NEB, USA), FLAG (IBI, USA), hexahistidine (6&#xd7;His; Qiagen, USA), or the like, but is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a specific embodiment of the present disclosure, the IFN-&#x3b1; fused protein expressed by the vector of the present disclosure is purified by cation exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With respect to a host cell, any one known in the art to be capable of stably and continuously cloning and expressing the vector of the present disclosure can be used. Examples thereof include <i>Bacillus </i>sp. strains including <i>E. coli </i>JM109, <i>E. coli </i>BL21(DE3), <i>E. coli </i>RR1, <i>E. coli </i>LE392, <i>E. coli </i>B, <i>E. coli </i>X 1776, <i>E. coli </i>W3110, <i>Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis</i>, etc., and intestinal bacteria and strains including <i>Salmonella typhimurium, Serratia marcescens </i>and various <i>Pseudomonas </i>sp.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In addition, when a eukaryotic cell is transformed with the vector of the present disclosure, yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>), an insect cell or a human cell (e.g., CHO (Chinese hamster ovary) cell line, W138, BHK, COS-7, 293, HepG2, 3T3, RIN and MDCK cell line) can be used as a host cell.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">When the host cell is a prokaryotic cell, delivery of the vector of the present disclosure into the host cell can be carried out by the CaCl<sub>2 </sub>method (Cohen, S. N. et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acac. Sci. USA, </i>9: 2110-2114 (1973)), the Hannahan's method (Cohen, S. N. et al., <i>Proc. Natl. Acac. Sci. USA, </i>9: 2110-2114 (1973); Hanahan, D., <i>J. Mol. Biol., </i>166: 557-580 (1983)), the electroporation method (Dower, W. J. et al., <i>Nucleic. Acids Res., </i>16: 6127-6145 (1988)), and the like. And, when the host cell is an eukaryotic cell, the vector can be introduced to the host cell via the microinjection method (Capecchi, M. R., <i>Cell, </i>22: 479 (1980)), the calcium phosphate precipitation method (Graham, F. L. et al., <i>Virology, </i>52: 456 (1973)), the electroporation method (Neumann, E. et al., <i>EMBO J., </i>1: 841 (1982)), the liposome-mediated transfection method (Wong, T.

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The examples and experiments will now be described. The following examples and experiments are for illustrative purposes only and it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the scope of the present disclosure is not limited by the following examples.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Synthesis of Template of Human Interferon-&#x3b1; (IFN-&#x3b1;) Gene for High-Level Expression in <i>E. coli </i></heading>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Since the Interferon-&#x3b1; (IFN-&#x3b1;) gene originating from human contains a considerable amount of codons that are not expressed well in <i>E. coli</i>, it is known that the degree of expression of IFN protein is very low in the absence of modification. In particular, such codon clusters as AGG/AGA, CUA, AUA, CCA or CCC are reported to degrade both quantity and quality of the proteins expressed in <i>E. coli </i>(2-3).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Among them, the AGG codon cluster has the worst effect, presumably because the available tRNA pool is limited and the cluster binds competitively with ribosomes due to similarity to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence (4-5).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Thus, in order to improve the degree of expression, the inventors chemically synthesized the full sequence of the human IFN-&#x3b1; gene excluding the rare codon, in consideration of the codon usage frequency of <i>E. coli</i>. First, in order to obtain the human IFN-&#x3b1;2b gene optimized for the codon usage of <i>E. coli</i>, they synthesized the 6 oligomers shown in Table 1 such that the 18 nucleotides overlap with each other:</p>

<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The gene originating from human has the problem in that the level of expression is very low in <i>E. coli </i>in the absence of modification. To solve this problem, the inventors carried out two-step reactions to obtain synthetic gene in consideration of the codon usage of <i>E. coli</i>. First, they mixed the 6 oligomers shown in Table 1, with the same quantity, and allowed them to react at 60&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes after adding pfu DNA polymerase and dNTP mixture. As a result, a template of human IFN-&#x3b1; gene was synthesized according to the codon usage. Then, PCR was carried out using the template and using the CFN-4 and CFN-3 primers. As a result, the human IFN-&#x3b1; gene was obtained as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> (SEQ ID NO: 27).

First, after adding ampicillin to 60 mL of 2&#xd7;YT medium (16 g of tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract and 5 g/L NaCl) to 50 &#x3bc;g/mL, and then adding each bacteria, culturing was carried out at 37&#xb0; C. for 16 hours. The culture was transferred to a 3 L of TB fermentation medium (24 g of yeast extract, 12 g of tryptone, 0.4% glycerol, and 2.31 g of KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>or 12.54 g/L K<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>) to which 50 &#x3bc;g/mL ampicillin had been added, and cultured at 37&#xb0; C. When the absorbance at 600 nm reached about 3, IPTG with a final concentration of 0.4 mM was added to induce expression of protein. Then, after further culturing for 6 hours, the cells were recovered and the expression was confirmed by SDS-PAGE (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>

By washing 2 times with 1% Triton X-100 and then once with distilled water, the inclusion bodies with the bacteria lysates removed were isolated. In order to obtain IFN and CTP-fused IFN having activity, the isolated inclusion body was dissolved in different optimized solubilization buffers and then refolded by stirring in a refolding buffer. The solubilization and refolding buffers used for each IFN inclusion body and the refolding condition are summarized in Table 3:</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">After the refolding, cation exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography were carried out to purify the normally refolded IFN or CTP-fused IFN with high purity. Since the isoelectric point of the protein to be isolated is expected at about 6.0 for IFN and at about 9.2 for CTP-fused IFN, the proteins were bound to the CM-Sepharose cation exchanger (Amersham Biosciences) at a lower pH, and fractions were obtained by eluting with the pH and NaCl concentration gradient described in Table 4. The obtained protein fractions were identified by SDS-PAGE. After removing protein multimers from the acquired fractions and concentrating on Centricon with a molecular weight cut-off of 5,000 Da, gel filtration chromatography was carried out to obtain the proteins with high purity.</p>

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The IFN and CTP-fused IFN purified in Example 5 were subjected to biological activity test as follows:</p>
<heading id="h-0031" level="1">EXAMPLE 6-1</heading>
<heading id="h-0032" level="1">Cell Membrane Binding and Residence in Cytoplasm</heading>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The purified IFN and CTP-fused IFN were fluorescence-labeled with FITC or rhodamine and then treated to HeLa cells (Korean Cell Line Bank) or HepG2 cells (Korean Cell Line Bank), which had been cultured for 2 days, to a final concentration of 5-10 nM. Then, their distribution was observed using a confocal scanning microscope (LSM 5 Exciter, Carl-Zeiss).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, CTP-fused IFN showed much stronger binding to the cell membrane than IFN. And, as seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the CTP-fused IFN which was translocated into the cell through the cell membrane remained in the cytoplasm without penetrating the nuclear membrane. Thus, it was confirmed that CTP-fused IFN is free from the risk of chromosomal damage in the nucleus by the protein attached thereto.</p>
<heading id="h-0033" level="1">EXAMPLE 6-2</heading>
<heading id="h-0034" level="1">Translocation into Liver Tissue</heading>
<p id="h-0035" num="0000">{circle around (1)} PEGylation of IFN and CTP-Fused IFN</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In mice, a protein with a molecular weight smaller than 30 kDa may be quickly excreted by renal clearance, resulting in short residence in the blood making observation of translocation property difficult. To overcome this problem and thus extend residence in blood and make observation of translocation into the liver easier, IFN and CTP-fused IFN, whose molecular weight is about 20 kDa, was PEGylated to increase the molecular weight to at least 40 kDa.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">For this, polyethylene glycol (PEG) NHS ester (Jenkem Biotechnology) with a molecular weight of 20 kDa was used to randomly PEGylate IFN and CTP-fused IFN (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Then, mono-PEGylation IFN and CTP-fused IFN were finally isolated by cation exchange chromatography and gel filtration chromatography.</p>
<p id="h-0036" num="0000">{circle around (2)} Observation of Translocation into Liver Tissue by In Vivo Imaging</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The IFN and CTP-fused IFN whose molecular weight was increased to above 40 kDa by PEGylation were fluorescence-labeled with Cy5.5 and administered intravenously to mice at 2 nmol. About 45 minutes later, the distribution of the proteins in the body was observed using IVIS-200 (Xenogen).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, PEG-IFN was excreted to the bladder whereas most of PEG-CTP fused IFN remained in the liver. And, as seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, when the relative concentration of the proteins in the liver tissue were compared by measuring the fluorescence intensity, the concentration of PEG-N-terminal CTP-fused IFN was about 3.2 fold and that of PEG-C-terminal CTP-fused interferon was about 2.6 fold as compared to PEG-IFN.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the distribution of the Cy5.5-labeled PEG-IFN and PEG-CTP fused IFN in the mouse liver tissue cryosections observed using a fluorescence microscope. It can be seen that, differently from PEG-IFN, PEG-CTP fused IFN penetrated deep into the liver tissue without remaining on the surface region of the liver.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">This suggests that, when a hepatitis treatment is developed using PEG-CTP fused IFN instead of the currently used PEG-IFN, a longer-lasting therapeutic effect can be achieved with less amount of interferon.</p>
<p id="h-0037" num="0000">{circle around (3)} Measurement of concentration change in liver with time</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">After fluorescence-labeling and intravenously administering the PEGylation IFN and CTP-fused interferon, the relative concentration of the administered proteins in the liver was determined by measuring the fluorescence intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">As seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the concentration of CTP-fused IFN was highest between 30 and 60 minutes after the administration and decreased slowly thereafter as compared to IFN. Whereas IFN was completely excreted within about 2 hours, the concentration of CTP-fused interferon in the liver was maintained for at least 6 to 24 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">This suggests that, when a hepatitis treatment is developed using CTP fused IFN, a longer-lasting therapeutic effect can be achieved with less amount of interferon as compared to the existing interferon drugs.</p>
<heading id="h-0038" level="1">EXAMPLE 6-3</heading>
<heading id="h-0039" level="1">Measurement of Antiviral Activity</heading>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The antiviral activity of purified IFN and CTP-fused IFN was measured by the degree of the cytopathic effect reduced by the proteins in Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells (Korean Cell Line Bank) infected with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV; Korean Cell Line Bank).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">First, MDBK cells were diluted in DMEM medium to 7.5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>cells/mL and transferred to a 96-well plate, with 200 &#x3bc;L per each well. After culturing the cells at 37&#xb0; C. in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator for about 18 hours, IFN and CTP-fused IFN sequentially diluted by 2-fold were treated to induce reaction with interferon. After 4-20 hours, the cells in all the wells were infected with 5&#xd7;10<sup>4 </sup>PFU of VSV and further cultured for about 24 hours to induce cytopathic effect. The cultured cells were fixed with formaldehyde, stained with crystal violet, and dried. After dissolving the stain by adding 80% methanol, absorbance was measured at 570 nm.</p>
<p id="h-0040" num="0000">{circle around (1)} Antiviral Activity of Purified Interferon</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The antiviral activity of the purified interferon was determined by comparison with known standard interferon. As seen from Table 15, when the antiviral activity was measured after treating with interferon for 20 hours, the purified interferon showed activity comparable (97.7%) to that of the standard. The specific activity was about 2.54&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>IU/mg, satisfying the international standard (&#x2267;1.4&#xd7;10<sup>8 </sup>IU/mg). In the following activity measurement, the purified interferon, which showed an activity comparable to that of standard, was used as a new standard.</p>
