<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a rotational heating member which is suitable as a fixing member of an image fixing apparatus (fixing device) mountable in image forming apparatuses such as an electrophotographic copy machines, electrophotographic printers, and the like. It also relates image heating apparatuses which use a rotational image heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There have been increasing activities to reduce in energy consumption, image heating apparatuses (fixing devices) which are mounted in electrophotographic copy machines, electrophotographic printers, and the like. More specifically, various efforts have been made to reduce image heating apparatuses in the so-called &#x201c;startup&#x201d; time, that is, the length of time it takes for an image heating apparatus to become ready for image formation after it is turned on. As one of such efforts, a fixing apparatus of the belt type has been proposed, which uses a belt as a part of the fixing means. It is structured so that an unfixed toner image on recording medium is heated through a belt (fixation belt). For example, Japanese Laid-open Patent Application 2006-293225 and Japanese Laid-open Patent Application H04-204980 propose fixing apparatuses of the belt type. These fixing apparatuses have a ceramic heater (which hereafter will be referred to simply as heater), a belt (fixation belt), and a pressure roller. The fixation belt is made of thin film. It is pressed against the heater by the pressure roller, forming a nip between itself and pressure roller. In operation, the fixation belt is moved in contact with the heater. Fixing apparatuses of this type have various advantages over fixing apparatuses of the other types. For example, their heater and fixation belt are relatively small in thermal capacity, and therefore, relatively short (quick start) in the length of time it takes for them to become ready for image formation after they are turned on. Further, they are substantially smaller in electric power consumption (reduction in electric power consumption) while they are kept on standby. Japanese Laid-open Patent Applications H01-177576, H04-328594, H04-326386, and H09-114295 disclose another example of the image heating apparatus of the aforementioned type. This image heating apparatus heats the toner image on recording medium with the use of a rotational heating member made up of a rotational core, and a heat generating cylindrical heating member which rotates with the core. The heat generating cylindrical member is made of a substance which generates heat as electric current is flowed through it.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Fixing apparatuses which employ a fixation belt suffer from the following weaknesses. That is, if they become unstable in the transmission of electric power to their heater, they become unreliable in the length of startup time. Further, if the transmission of electric power to the heater becomes unstable while recording medium is conveyed through their fixation nip, they fail to supply the fixation belt with heat by the amount necessary to properly fix the toner image, and therefore, cannot properly fix the toner image on the recording medium; the so-called cold offset occur. Thus, the primary object of the present invention is to provide a rotational heating member which is significantly shorter than any of conventional rotational heating members, in the startup time, that is, the length of time it takes for the rotational heating member to become ready for properly heating recording medium, on which an image is present, and also, does not cause the cold offset. It is also to provide an image heating apparatus which employs the rotational heating member in accordance with the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The primary object of the present invention is to provide a rotational heating member which is significantly shorter in startup time than any of conventional heating members, and an image heating apparatus which employs such a rotational heating member.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image heating rotatable member for heating an image on a recording material, comprising: a base layer; a heat generation layer, provided on said base layer, for generating heat by being supplied with electric power; an electrode layer, provided outside of said heat generation layer with respect to a widthwise direction and having an electric resistance which is smaller than that of said heat generation layer, for supplying the electric power to heat generation layer; an elastic layer provided on said electrode layer and having a length longer than that of said electrode layer measured in the widthwise direction; and a parting layer provided on said elastic layer and having a length which is substantially equal to the length of said electrode layer measured in the widthwise direction.

<p id="h-0005" num="0000">[Embodiment 1]</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">(Image Forming Apparatus)</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic sectional view of a typical image forming apparatus in which an image heating apparatus in accordance with the present invention can be mounted as its image heating apparatus. It depicts the structure the apparatus. This image forming apparatus is an electrophotographic color printer. The image forming apparatus in this embodiment has four image forming portions, that is, first to fourth image forming portions Py, Pm, Pc, and Pb, which are disposed in parallel in the image forming apparatus. The four image forming portions form four monochromatic toner images, different in color, one for one, through the charging, exposing, developing, and transfer processes. The image forming apparatus forms images by performing a preset image formation sequence in response to print signals outputted from external apparatus (unshown) such as a host computer. More specifically, the image forming portions Py, Pm, Pc, and Pb are sequentially driven, whereby the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> (image bearing member) of each image forming portion P is rotated at a preset peripheral velocity (process speed) in the direction indicated by an arrow mark. The image forming apparatus is provided also with an intermediary transfer belt <b>7</b>, which is supported, and kept stretched, by a driver roller <b>6</b><i>a</i>, a follower roller <b>6</b><i>b</i>, and a tension roller <b>6</b><i>c </i>so that it is kept in contact with the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> of each of the image forming portions Py, Pm, Pc, and Pb. The intermediary transfer belt <b>7</b> is circularly driven by the driver roller <b>6</b><i>a </i>at a peripheral velocity which corresponds to the peripheral velocity of each photosensitive drum <b>1</b>, in the direction indicated by another arrow mark. In the yellow (first color) image forming portion Py, the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> is uniformly charged to preset polarity and potential level by a charging device <b>2</b>. Then, an exposing apparatus <b>3</b> scans (exposes) the charged portion of the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>, with a beam of laser light it projects while modulating the beam of laser light with image formation signals (information) sent from an external apparatus. As a result, an electrostatic latent image which reflects the image formation signals is formed on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>. This latent image is developed by a developing apparatus <b>4</b>, which uses yellow toner (developer), into a visible image; a visible image of yellow color (which hereafter will be referred to as yellow toner image) is formed of the yellow toner, on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>. Processes similar to the above described processes for forming a yellow toner image are carried out in the magenta (second color) image forming portion Pm, cyan (third color) image forming portion Pc, and black (fourth color) image forming portion Pb, one for one. The four toner images which were formed in the image forming portions Py, Pm, Pc, and Pb, one for one, and are different in color, are sequentially transferred in layers onto the outward (surface) of the intermediary transfer belt <b>7</b> by four primary transfer rollers <b>8</b> which oppose the four photosensitive drums <b>1</b> with the presence of the intermediary transfer belt <b>7</b> between the transfer rollers <b>8</b> and photosensitive drums <b>1</b>, one for one. As a result, a full-color toner image is borne on the outward surface of the intermediary transfer belt <b>7</b>. Meanwhile, one of the sheets of recording mediums P which are stored in layers in a recording medium feeding-and-conveying cassette <b>10</b> is moved out of the cassette <b>10</b>, while being separated from the rest, and into the main assembly of the image forming apparatus, by a feed roller <b>11</b>. Then, the sheet of recording medium P (which hereafter will be referred to simply as recording medium P) is sent by the feed roller <b>11</b> to a pair of registration rollers <b>13</b> through a recording medium guidance path <b>12</b>. Then, the recording medium P is conveyed by the pair of registration rollers <b>13</b> to a second transfer nip Tn, which is the interface between the intermediary transfer belt <b>7</b> and a second transfer roller <b>14</b>. Then, the recording medium P is conveyed through the second transfer nip Tn while remaining pinched by the intermediary transfer belt <b>7</b> and second transfer roller <b>14</b>. While the recording medium P is conveyed through the second transfer nip Tn, the full color toner image on the outward surface of the intermediary transfer belt <b>7</b> is transferred by the second transfer roller <b>14</b> onto the recording medium P. Then, the recording medium P, on which the unfixed full-color toner image is present, is introduced into a fixing apparatus <b>15</b>, and conveyed through the nip (which will be described later in detail) of the fixing apparatus <b>15</b>, while remaining pinched by the nip. As the recording medium P is conveyed through the nip, the unfixed toner image on the recording medium P is thermally fixed to the recording medium P. After coming out of the fixing apparatus <b>15</b>, the recording medium P is discharged into a delivery tray <b>16</b>. After the transfer of a toner image from each photosensitive drum <b>1</b>, the transfer residual toner, that is, the toner remaining on the peripheral surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>, is removed by a drum cleaner <b>5</b>. Then, the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> is used for the next round of image formation. After the transfer of the full-color toner image from the intermediary transfer belt <b>7</b>, the transfer residual toner, that is, the toner remaining of the outward surface of the intermediary transfer belt <b>7</b>, is removed by a belt cleaner <b>9</b>. Then the intermediary transfer belt <b>7</b> is used for the next round of image formation.</p>

The fixing apparatus <b>15</b> in this embodiment has: a fixation belt <b>20</b>, a pressure roller <b>22</b>, and a belt holder <b>16</b>. The fixation belt <b>20</b> is a rotational heating member, and the pressure roller <b>22</b> is a member for backing up the fixation belt <b>20</b>. The belt holder <b>16</b> is a member for holding the fixation belt <b>20</b>. The fixing apparatus <b>15</b> has also a pressure application stay <b>17</b>, an adiabatic sheet <b>30</b>, and a pair of the fixation flanges <b>40</b> and <b>40</b>. The pressure application stay <b>17</b> is a pressure applying member. The adiabatic sheet <b>30</b> is a heat shield. The fixation flanges <b>40</b> and <b>40</b> are members for keeping the fixation belt <b>20</b> proper in shape at the edges of the fixation belt <b>20</b>. The lengthwise direction of the fixation belt <b>20</b>, pressure roller <b>22</b>, belt holder <b>16</b>, pressure application stay <b>17</b>, and adiabatic sheet <b>30</b> is the same as that of the fixing apparatus <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The fixing apparatus <b>15</b> in this embodiment has the fixation belt <b>20</b>, belt holder <b>16</b>, and pressure application stay <b>17</b>, as described above. The fixation belt <b>20</b> is cylindrical (endless). The belt holder <b>16</b> is roughly semicircular in cross section, heat resistant, and rigid, and is on the inward side of the cylindrical fixation belt <b>20</b>. The pressure application stay <b>17</b> is roughly U-shaped in cross section, and is also on inward side of the fixation belt <b>20</b>. Further, the pressure application stay <b>17</b> is placed on inward side of the belt holder <b>16</b>, being positioned in contact with the inward side of the belt holder <b>16</b> in such a manner that its open side faces the belt holder <b>16</b>. From the standpoint of reducing the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> in energy consumption, the belt holder <b>16</b> is desired to be formed of a substance which is low in thermal conductivity. In this embodiment, therefore, a heat resist substance, for example, heat resistant glass, or heat resistant resin such as polycarbonate, is used as the material for the belt holder <b>16</b>. The pressure application stay <b>17</b> is desired to be unlikely to flex even if it comes under a large amount of pressure. In the first embodiment, therefore, SUS 304 is used as the material for the pressure application stay <b>17</b>. The pressure roller <b>22</b> is below the fixation belt <b>20</b>, and is parallel to the fixation belt <b>20</b>. The pressure roller <b>22</b> is made up of a metallic core <b>22</b><i>a </i>and an elastic layer <b>2</b><i>b</i>. The metallic core <b>22</b><i>a </i>is made of stainless steel. The elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>is made of silicone rubber, and is roughly 3 mm in thickness. It covers the entirety of the peripheral surface of the metallic core <b>22</b><i>a</i>. The pressure roller <b>22</b> has also a parting layer <b>22</b><i>c </i>which covers the entirety of the peripheral surface of the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b</i>. It is a piece of PFA resin tube, and is roughly 40 pm in thickness. The pressure roller <b>22</b> is rotatably supported by the frame <b>24</b> of the fixing apparatus <b>15</b>. More specifically, the lengthwise end portions of the metallic core <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the pressure roller <b>22</b> are rotatably supported by a pair of bearings <b>25</b><i>a </i>and <b>25</b><i>b </i>attached to the front and rear plates of the frame <b>24</b>, respectively. The adiabatic sheet <b>30</b> is for preventing the heat from the fixing belt <b>20</b> conducting to the belt holder <b>16</b> and pressure application stay <b>17</b>. It is between the inward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b> and the outward surface of the belt holder <b>16</b>, and is held to the outward surface of the belt holder by adhesive. The adiabatic sheet <b>30</b> is a piece of silicone sponge, and is 500 &#x3bc;m in thickness. The fixation flanges <b>40</b> and <b>40</b> are at the lengthwise ends of the pressure application stay <b>17</b>, one for one. Each pressure application stay <b>40</b> has a substrate <b>40</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>)) which faces the corresponding edge of the fixation belt <b>20</b>. The fixation flange <b>40</b> has also a belt supporting portion <b>40</b><i>b</i>, which projects inward of the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> from the inward surface <b>40</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> of the substrate <b>40</b>. The substrate <b>40</b><i>a </i>has also a spring seat <b>40</b><i>c </i>which projects from the outward surface <b>40</b><i>a</i><b>2</b>, that is, the opposite surface from the fixation belt <b>20</b>, outward of the fixing apparatus <b>15</b>. The fixation flanges <b>40</b> are solidly attached to the side plates <b>24</b><i>a </i>and <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the apparatus frame <b>24</b> by the spring seats <b>40</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>c</i>, one for one. Further, the fixation flanges <b>40</b> and <b>40</b> are held to a pair of outwardly extending arms <b>17</b><i>a </i>and <b>17</b><i>a </i>which are lengthwise end portions of the pressure application stay <b>17</b>, by the bottom portion of the substrates <b>40</b><i>a </i>and <b>40</b><i>a</i>. The belt holding portions <b>40</b><i>b </i>and <b>40</b><i>b </i>are fitted inward of the loop which the fixation belt <b>20</b> forms, in such a manner that each edge of the fixation belt <b>20</b> is in contact with the inward surface <b>40</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> of the corresponding fixation flange <b>40</b>. There are also a pair of compression springs <b>42</b> and <b>42</b>, which are between the corresponding spring seats <b>40</b><i>c </i>and <b>40</b><i>c</i>, and pressure application arms <b>41</b> and <b>41</b>, one for one. The force from the compression springs <b>42</b> is applied to the belt holder <b>16</b> through the pressure application stay <b>17</b>, whereby the outward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b> is kept pressed upon the peripheral surface of the pressure roller <b>22</b>. The pressure applied to the peripheral surface of the pressure roller <b>22</b> causes the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the pressure roller <b>22</b> to resiliently deform, forming a nip N (fixation nip) with a preset width, between the outward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b> and peripheral surface of the pressure roller <b>22</b>. In this embodiment, the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> is structured so that the amount of pressure applied to each of the lengthwise ends of the pressure application stay <b>17</b> becomes 156.8 N, that is, the amount of the combination of the pressure applied to the lengthwise ends of the pressure application stay <b>17</b> becomes 313.6 N (32 kgf). Designated by a referential code <b>18</b> is a thermistor as a temperature detecting means. The thermistor <b>18</b> is positioned above the belt holder <b>16</b> in such a manner that it remains in contact with the inward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b> regardless of the movement of the fixation belt <b>20</b>. The thermistor <b>18</b> detects the temperature of the inward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b>. More specifically, the thermistor <b>18</b> is attached to a stainless steel arm <b>19</b> solidly attached to the belt holder <b>16</b>. The arm <b>19</b> is made flexible so that even if the fixation belt <b>20</b> becomes unstable in the movement of its inward surface because of its circular movement, the arm <b>19</b> absorbs the unstable movement of the inward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b> by flexing. Thus, the thermistor <b>18</b> remains always in contact with the inward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b>.</p>

The fixation belt <b>20</b> is a laminar belt, and has four sublayers, that is, substrate layer <b>20</b><i>a</i>, a heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>, an electric power supplying electrode layer <b>20</b><i>e </i>(which hereafter will be referred to simply as electrode layer), an elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c</i>, and a parting layer <b>20</b><i>d</i>, listing from the inward side of the fixation belt <b>20</b>. As the material for the substrate layer <b>20</b><i>a</i>, a heat resistant substance is used. For the minimization of the fixation belt <b>20</b> in thermal capacity, that is, for quick start, the thickness of the substrate layer <b>20</b><i>a </i>is made to be no more than 100 &#x3bc;m, preferably, in a range of 20-50 &#x3bc;m. That is, a belt formed of dielectric resin, for example, polyimide, polyimide-amide, PEEK, PTFE, PFA, FEP, etc., or a belt formed of metallic substance, for example, SUS, nickel, etc., can be used as the substrate layer <b>20</b><i>a</i>. In this embodiment, a cylindrical polyimide belt, which is 30 &#x3bc;m in thickness, and 25 mm in diameter, was used as the substrate layer <b>20</b><i>a</i>. Incidentally, in a case where an electrically conductive substance is used as the material for the substrate layer <b>20</b><i>a</i>, it is necessary for a dielectric layer made of polyimide or the like to be provided between the substrate layer <b>20</b><i>a </i>and heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>. As the material for the elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>placed on the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>and electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e</i>, silicon rubber, which was 10 degrees in hardness (JIS-A), and 1.3 w/m.K in thermal conductivity, was used. The thickness of the elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>was 300 &#x3bc;m. As the material for the parting layer <b>20</b><i>d</i>, which is placed on the elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c</i>, a piece of PFA tube, which is formed of fluorinated resin, was used. The thickness of the parting layer <b>20</b><i>d </i>was 20 &#x3bc;m. The parting layer <b>20</b><i>d </i>is placed in such a manner that it opposes both the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>and electrode layer <b>20</b><i>e </i>through the elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c</i>. The parting layer <b>20</b><i>d </i>may be formed by coating the elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>with PFA. That is, whether the parting layer <b>20</b><i>d </i>is to be formed of a pieces of PFA tube, or the elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>is to be coated with PFA to form the parting layer <b>20</b><i>d </i>may be decided according to the amount of mechanical and electrical strength of which the parting layer <b>20</b><i>d </i>is required. The parting layer <b>20</b><i>d </i>is held to the elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>with adhesive formed of silicone resin. The heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>is a layer of a substance which generates heat as electric current is flowed through it. It is formed on the substrate layer <b>20</b><i>a </i>by uniformly coating the substance, which contains silver-palladium alloy, on the substrate layer <b>20</b><i>a</i>. It is 10.0&#x3a9; in total amount of electric resistance. Thus, the amount of electric power which is generated as electric current is flowed through the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>with the use of an AC electric power source which is 100 V in voltage, is 1,000 W. The total amount of electric resistance for the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>should be set according to the amount of the heat required of the fixing apparatus <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Next, the various sublayers of fixation belt <b>20</b>, and the elastic layer of the pressure roller <b>22</b>, will be described regarding their length. The width of the largest recording medium P, in terms of the lengthwise direction, usable with the image forming apparatus in this embodiment is 297 mm. The image forming apparatus in this embodiment is designed so that when the recording medium P is conveyed through the apparatus, the center of the recording medium passage in the apparatus in the &#x201c;lengthwise direction&#x201d; coincides with the center of the recording medium P in the &#x201c;widthwise direction&#x201d; of the recording medium P. That is, a broken line A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which is the center line of the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> in terms of the &#x201c;lengthwise direction&#x201d;, is the referential line for recording medium conveyance. In other words, the recording medium P is conveyed so that the center line A of the recording medium P in terms of its &#x201c;widthwise direction&#x201d;, coincides with the recording medium conveyance reference line A. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the substrate layer <b>20</b><i>a </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b> is 326 mm in length, and the elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>and parting layer <b>20</b><i>d </i>are 316 mm in length. The actual roller portion, that is, elastic layer portion, of the pressure roller <b>22</b> is 312 mm in length. In terms of the &#x201c;lengthwise direction&#x201d;, the centers of the substrate layer <b>20</b><i>a</i>, elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c</i>, and parting layer <b>20</b><i>d </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b> coincide with the recording medium conveyance reference line A. Further, the center of the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the pressure roller <b>22</b> also coincides with the recording medium conveyance reference line A. That is, the front halves of the sublayers <b>20</b><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>c</i>, and <b>22</b><i>b </i>are symmetrical with their rear halves with reference to the recording medium conveyance reference line A. The heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>is 307 mm in length. Therefore, when the recording medium P of the maximum size (297 mm) in terms of its &#x201c;widthlengthwise direction&#x201d; is conveyed through the fixing apparatus <b>15</b>, the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>extends 5 mm beyond the edge of the recording medium P at both lengthwise ends (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>a</i>)). Generally speaking, the heat generated in the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>transmits (radiates) outward. Therefore, the lengthwise end portions of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b> of conventional fixing apparatuses (<b>15</b>) are lower in temperature than the center portion of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>, being therefore unable to supply the corresponding portion of the fixation belt <b>20</b> with heat by an amount necessary for proper fixation, being therefore likely to cause the so-called cold offset. This is why the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>in this embodiment was made long enough for its lengthwise ends to extend beyond the corresponding edges of the recording medium P by 5 mm, in order to keep uniform in temperature, the portion of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>, which corresponds in position to the recording medium path. The electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e</i>, which are for allowing electric current to flow through the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>, extend outward from the corresponding lengthwise ends of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>(electrode layers are outside heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>in terms of lengthwise direction). More specifically, the electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e </i>are on the outward surface of the substrate layer <b>20</b><i>a</i>, and are formed by uniformly coating the outward surface of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>with electrically conductive substance, in contact with the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>, to a thickness of roughly 30 &#x3bc;m. The combined electrical resistance of the two electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e </i>is roughly 0.1&#x3a9;, which amounts to roughly 1% of the total electrical resistance of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>. That is, the amount of heat which the electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e </i>generate is roughly 1% of that of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>; the electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e </i>are negligibly small in electrical resistance compared to the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Thus, it does not occur that the end portions of the fixation belt <b>20</b> in terms of the lengthwise direction excessively is excessively increased in temperature by the electrode layer <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e</i>, and therefore, it does not occur that the fixation belt <b>20</b> breaks because of the excessive increase in temperature of its lengthwise ends (edges) caused by the electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e</i>. Further, the inwardly facing surface of electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e </i>are exposed by 5 mm across the outward end portions, in terms of the lengthwise direction. It is with these exposed portions <b>20</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>20</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> that a pair of members <b>45</b> and <b>45</b> for supplying the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>with electric power are in connection. More specifically, the power supplying members <b>45</b> and <b>45</b> are in contact with the electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e</i>, in the area of contact between the lengthwise end portions (edges) of the fixation belt <b>20</b>, and the outward surface of the belt holding portions <b>40</b>. In this embodiment, a pair of electrically conductive leaf springs are used as the power supplying members <b>45</b> and <b>45</b>. Each of the pair of leaf springs (power supplying members) is provided with an electrically conductive contact point formed of carbon. The pair of electrically conductive leaf springs <b>45</b> and <b>45</b> are kept in contact with the exposed portions <b>20</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> and <b>20</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> of the electrode layer <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e</i>, one for one, by the application of pressure, whereby the pair of leaf springs <b>45</b> and <b>45</b> remain in contact with the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>through the electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e</i>. Further, the pair of leaf springs <b>45</b> and <b>45</b> are in connection with an electrical power source <b>51</b> through a heater driving circuit <b>50</b> as a controlling means.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">(Operation of Fixing Apparatus for Thermally Fixing Toner Image)</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The operation of the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> in this embodiment is as follows: the fixation motor (unshown) of the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> is rotationally driven in response to a print signal, whereby the pressure roller driving gear G (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>b</i>)) attached to one of the lengthwise ends of the metallic core <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the pressure roller <b>22</b> is rotated. Thus, the pressure roller <b>22</b> rotates in the direction indicated by an arrow mark at a preset peripheral velocity (process speed). The rotation of the pressure roller <b>22</b> is transmitted to the outward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b> by the friction which occurs between the peripheral surface of the pressure roller <b>22</b> and the outward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b>, in the nip N. Therefore, the fixation belt <b>20</b> is circularly moved by the rotation of the pressure roller <b>22</b> in the direction indicated by an arrow mark at roughly the same speed as the peripheral velocity of the pressure roller <b>22</b>, while the inward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b> remains in contact with the outward surface of the belt holding portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the fixation flange <b>40</b>. While the fixation belt <b>20</b> rotates, its inward surface remains in contact with the outward surface of the belt holding portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the fixation flange <b>40</b>. Therefore, the fixation belt <b>20</b> remains stable in its track. In particular, in this embodiment, the value for the circumference of the peripheral surface of the belt holding portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>is set so that the sum of the length of the surface of the belt holding portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>which is in contact with the inward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b>, and the length of the surface of the belt holder <b>16</b>, becomes roughly 2% smaller than the internal diameter of the fixation belt <b>20</b>. This setup can prevent the problem that the fixation belt <b>20</b> slackens and/or becomes wavy across its &#x201c;lengthwise&#x201d; end portions (edges) while the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> is driven. Therefore, it is ensured that while the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> is driven, the &#x201c;lengthwise&#x201d; end portions of the fixation belt <b>20</b> remains in contact with the peripheral surface of the belt holding portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the fixation flange <b>40</b>. That is, the fixation belt <b>20</b> remains stable in its track across the areas which correspond to the lengthwise end portion of the fixation flange <b>40</b>. Further, each of the leaf springs <b>45</b> and <b>45</b> is electrically in contact with the exposed portion <b>20</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> of the corresponding electrode layer <b>20</b><i>e</i>, in the area in which the lengthwise end of the fixation belt <b>20</b> and the peripheral surface of the belt holding portion <b>40</b><i>b </i>of the fixation flange <b>40</b> are in contact with each other. Therefore, it is ensured that the contact points <b>45</b><i>a </i>and <b>45</b><i>a </i>of the leaf springs <b>45</b> and <b>45</b> remain in contact with the electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e</i>, which are at the lengthwise ends of the fixation belt <b>20</b> which is stable in its track. In other words, it is ensured that the leaf springs <b>45</b> and <b>45</b> remain in contact with the electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e</i>, one for one. The inward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b> is coated with grease. The presence of the grease reduces the amount of friction between the belt holder <b>16</b> and the inward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b>, preventing therefore the inward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b> from being frictionally worn. As a print start signal is inputted, the electric power source <b>51</b> of the heater driving circuit <b>50</b> is turned on. As a result, electric current is flowed through the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>by way of the leaf springs <b>45</b> and <b>45</b> and the electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e</i>. The current causes the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>to generate heat, causing thereby the fixation belt <b>20</b> to increase in temperature. More specifically, the heater driving circuit <b>50</b> takes in the output signals S (which reflect detected temperature of fixation belt <b>20</b>) of the thermistor <b>18</b>, and turns on or off the electric power source <b>51</b> in response to the output signals S so that the temperature of the fixation belt <b>20</b> remains at a preset level (target temperature for fixation). In this embodiment, the heater driving circuit <b>50</b> controls the electric power source <b>51</b> so that the temperature of the fixation belt <b>20</b> remains at 160&#xb0; C. While the pressure roller <b>22</b> and fixation belt <b>20</b> are stable in rotation, and also, the fixation belt <b>20</b> is stable in temperature at the preset level (fixation level), the recording medium P, on which an unfixed toner image t (image to be fixed) is present, is introduced into the nip N by an entrance guide <b>46</b>. Then, the recording medium P is conveyed through the nip N while remaining pinched by the outward surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b> and the peripheral surface of the pressure roller <b>22</b>. While the recording medium P is conveyed through the nip N, it is subjected to the heat applied by the fixation belt <b>20</b> and the pressure applied by the pressure roller <b>22</b>, whereby the toner image t is thermally fixed to the surface of the recording medium P. As the recording medium P comes out of the nip N, it is separated from the surface of the fixation belt <b>20</b>, and then, is discharged from the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> by a pair of discharge rollers <b>47</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">(Relationship between Dimension of Substrate Layer, Heat Generation Layer, Elastic Layer, Parting Layer, and Elastic layer of Pressure Roller, and Maximum Width for Recording Medium)</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The length of the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the pressure roller <b>22</b> is such that when a sheet of recording medium (P), which is maximum in &#x201c;width&#x201d;, is conveyed through the fixing apparatus <b>15</b>, the elastic layer <b>2</b><i>b </i>extends beyond the edge of the recording medium P by 7.5 mm at both of its lengthwise ends. Further, the substrate layer <b>20</b><i>a</i>, heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>, elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c</i>, and parting layer of the fixation belt <b>20</b> are longer than the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the pressure roller <b>22</b>. If the dimension of the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>is less than the dimension of the recording medium P in terms of the lengthwise direction (&#x201c;widthwise direction of recording medium P), the &#x201c;widthwise&#x201d; end portions of the recording medium P fail to be pressed by the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>(pressure roller <b>22</b>). Consequently, the recording medium P is bent along the border lines between the pressed portion of the recording medium P and the unpressed portions of the recording medium P. In the case of the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> in this embodiment, the length of its elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>is greater than the maximum &#x201c;width&#x201d; for the recording medium P. Therefore, the recording medium P is always pressed across its entirety when it is conveyed through the fixing apparatus <b>15</b>. Therefore, it does not occur that the recording medium P is bent along the border line between the portion pressed by the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>(pressure roller <b>22</b>) and the portions which were not pressed by the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>(pressure roller <b>22</b>). Also in the case of the fixing apparatus in this embodiment, the parting layer <b>20</b><i>d </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b> is made longer than the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the pressure roller <b>22</b>, by such a length that it extends by 2 mm beyond the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>at both lengthwise ends. Further, the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>does not come into contact with the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the pressure roller <b>22</b>. Therefore, it does not occur that the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>is frictionally worn by the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, it is ensured that even when the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> is used for a long time, electric current is reliably flowed through the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The following is the description of the relationship between the length of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>and the temperature increase which occurred to the lengthwise end portions of the fixation belt <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) is a graph which shows the relationship between the length of the heat generating layer and the temperature of the fixation belt. The solid line (a) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) represents the changes, in temperature, of the portions of the fixation belt <b>20</b>, which correspond in position to the lengthwise ends (edges) of the recording medium P. The broken line (b) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4(</figref><i>b</i>) represents the changes, in maximum temperature, of the lengthwise end portions of the fixation belt <b>20</b>. Table 1 shows the conditions under which an experiment was carried out, and the results of the experiment. The fixing apparatus used in this experiment is the same in structure as the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> in this embodiment, except that it is different in the length of the heat generation layer from the fixing apparatus in this embodiment. As described above, because of the outward heat transmission (radiation) from the lengthwise ends of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b> in terms of the lengthwise direction, the lengthwise end portions of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b> become lower in temperature than the center portion of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b> in terms of the lengthwise direction (which hereafter will be referred to as lengthwise center portion of heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>). Therefore, in order to keep equal in temperature, the lengthwise center portion of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>and the portions of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>, which correspond in position to the &#x201c;widthwise&#x201d; ends of the recording medium P, it is necessary for the length of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>to be no less than 304 mm. On the other hand, making the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>long enough to deal with even the widest recording medium P causes the portions of the fixation belt <b>20</b>, which are outside the recording medium path in nip N to excessively increase in temperature. For example, if the length of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>is no less than 314 mm, it is greater than the length of the elastic layer <b>22</b><i>b </i>of the pressure roller <b>22</b>, creating thereby the portions from which no heat is given to the pressure roller <b>22</b> and recording medium P. Thus, the portions of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>, from which no heat is given to the pressure roller <b>22</b> nor recording medium P excessively increases in temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the case of the fixation belt <b>20</b> in this embodiment, a silicone resin is used as the adhesive to keep the parting layer <b>20</b><i>d </i>adhered to the elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c</i>. This silicone resin softens at 210&#xb0; C., and therefore, becomes ineffective as adhesive. Thus, in the case of a fixation belt (<b>20</b>), the heat generation layer (<b>20</b><i>b</i>) of which is no less the 310 mm in length, its parting layer (<b>20</b><i>d</i>) is likely to separate from the elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c</i>; the fixation belt (<b>20</b>) is likely to break.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The length of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b> in this embodiment is 307 mm. Therefore, it is possible to prevent the so-called cold offset from occurring across the &#x201c;widthwise&#x201d; end portion of the recording medium P, and also, to prevent the parting layer <b>20</b><i>d </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b> from separating from the elastic layer <b>20</b><i>c </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In terms of the widthwise direction of the recording medium P, the electrode layer <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b> in this embodiment is on the outward side of the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b>. Therefore, the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> is stable in the flow of the electric current to the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, it is faster in startup time, that is, the length of time it takes for the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> to become ready to properly heat the recording medium P on which the toner image t is present. Also in this embodiment, the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b> is longer than the &#x201c;width&#x201d; of the recording medium P, and the parting layer <b>20</b><i>d </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b> is longer than the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the so-called cold offset does not occur. Further, the electrode layers <b>20</b><i>e </i>and <b>20</b><i>e </i>are smaller in electrical resistance than the heat generation layer <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, the fixation belt <b>20</b> is unlikely to break across its lengthwise end portions.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The electric power supplying member <b>45</b> of the fixing apparatus <b>15</b> in this embodiment is the electrically conductive leaf spring <b>45</b><i>b</i>.

For example, it may be an electrically conductive member which is in the form of a brush (unshown). In a case where the electric power supplying member <b>45</b> is an electrically conductive member in the form of a brush, it is connected to the exposed portion <b>20</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> of the electrode layer <b>20</b><i>e </i>of the fixation belt <b>20</b>. The employment of the above described fixation belt <b>20</b> in this embodiment can reduce a fixing apparatus <b>15</b> in startup time, that is, the length of time it takes for the fixing apparatus to become ready for properly heating (fixing) the recording medium P, on which the toner image t is present, after electric power begins to be flowed through the fixation belt <b>20</b>.
