<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to revolvers which have multiple chambers in a revolving cylinder. More particularly this invention relates to an apparatus to seal the gap between the chamber aligned with the barrel, and the barrel to enhance safety, as well as to contain energy loss and enhance bullet velocity.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A revolver is the least expensive, shortest, lightest and most reliable multi-shot action gun available. Revolvers however do have their disadvantages. Most all of these disadvantages relate to the revolver gap, or the gap between the barrel and the revolving cylinder, or more particularly the gap between the barrel and the front of the chamber in the revolving cylinder which is aligned with the barrel. Unlike other firearms where the cartridges&#x2014;each comprising a shell, filled with gun powder, and topped with a bullet, are individually and successively positioned within a firing chamber attached to the barrel; it is generally been accepted that the revolver gap is an inherent weakness in a revolver, necessitated by the need to provide clearance between the revolving cylinder and the barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Probably the biggest disadvantage associated with the revolver gap is safety. People have been injured by lead pieces and burnt by flame gases escaping through the gap. What is needed is a practical way to close the revolver gap. Not only would this increase gun safety, but additionally energy loss would be eliminated thereby increasing bullet velocity and energy; combustion would be more complete in the chamber, resulting in less deviation and more shot accuracy; higher pressure cartridges could be used more effectively; benefits of longer gun barrels would be maximized; revolvers would be quieter for the shooter; moving sound away from the shooter's face; generally revolvers would be more cost effective; generally revolvers would be cheaper to manufacture, less precise tolerances being needed between the revolving cylinder and the barrel; and, revolver carbine rifles would be come more safe, effective, and practical.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is an object of this invention to disclose an effective and practical way of closing the revolver gap. It is an object of this invention to improve the safety and comfort of a revolver. It is an object of this invention to eliminate burns from high velocity lead pieces and powder flames. It is an object of this invention to make the operation of a revolver quieter by effectively moving sound away from the user's face. It is yet a further object of this invention to disclose a method to better completion of combustion, and increase efficiency, velocity and energy in a discharged bullet with a same sized bullet and shell. It is yet a further object of this invention to disclose a method better utilizing a longer barrel on a revolver. It is yet a further object of this invention to disclose a method making revolver carbines more safe, effective and practical. It is a final object of this invention to reduce manufacturing costs of revolvers by reducing the need for higher tolerances between the cylinder and the barrel, which are compensated for with the gap seal.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One aspect of this invention provides for the improvement in a revolver having a frame, carrying a barrel and a revolving cylinder having multiple cartridge chambers therearound, each configured to hold and sequentially and longitudinally align a cartridge therein carrying a bullet with a rear portion of the barrel, the improvement comprising: a sliding sleeve positioned over an inner end portion of the barrel, said end portion of the barrel and inner diameter of the sliding sleeve closely mated; said sliding sleeve having a front face having a central opening therethrough having an inner diameter nominally equivalent to marginally larger than, a bore through the barrel. Whereafter firing, the sliding sleeve is instantaneously driven back contacting its front face with the revolving cylinder, thereby eliminating any gap between the revolving cylinder and the barrel, preventing exploding gas from escaping therethrough, and substantially increasing bullet discharge velocity and energy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a preferred aspect of this invention a sliding sleeve as in claim <b>1</b> further comprising an enlargement in a back end portion of the bore of the barrel so that the central opening through the front face of the sliding sleeve, sized marginally larger than the bore, will thereby catch a periphery of a compressed airstream ahead of a fired bullet, as well as the hot combustion gases after the bullet passes therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet another preferred aspect of this invention the sliding sleeve further comprises a ring seal positioned between the sliding sleeve and one of the inner end portion of the barrel and the gun frame.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following is a discussion and description of the preferred specific embodiments of this invention, such being made with reference to the drawings, wherein the same reference numerals are used to indicate the same or similar parts and/or structure. It should be noted that such discussion and description is not meant to unduly limit the scope of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Turning now to the drawings and more particularly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> we have a perspective view of a revolver <b>18</b> having a gap seal positioned over a diametrically reduced rear portion of the barrel <b>24</b> in front of the revolving cylinder <b>22</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective exploded a rear portion of the barrel and the gap seal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In a revolver having a frame <b>16</b>, carrying a barrel <b>24</b> and a revolving cylinder <b>22</b> having multiple cartridge chambers <b>14</b> therearound, each configured to hold and sequentially and longitudinally align a cartridge <b>12</b> therein carrying a bullet <b>10</b>, and shell <b>8</b>, with a rear portion of the barrel <b>24</b>, the improvement most broadly comprises: a) a sliding sleeve <b>20</b> positioned over an inner end portion of the barrel <b>24</b>, said end portion of the barrel <b>24</b> and inner diameter of the sliding sleeve <b>20</b> closely mated; and, b) said sliding sleeve <b>20</b> having a front face <b>21</b> having a central opening <b>23</b> therethrough having an inner diameter nominally equivalent to marginally larger than, a bore B through the barrel <b>24</b>. Whereafter firing, the sliding sleeve <b>20</b> is instantaneously driven back contacting its front face <b>21</b> with the revolving cylinder <b>22</b>, thereby eliminating any gap G between the revolving cylinder <b>20</b> and the barrel <b>24</b>, preventing exploding gas from escaping through the gap G, and substantially increasing bullet <b>10</b> discharge velocity and energy.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a partial cross sectional view of the gun frame, the revolver cylinder the gap seal and a rear portion of the barrel as taken along line <b>3</b>-<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged cross sectional exploded view of a rear portion of the barrel and the gap seal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. If the sliding sleeve <b>20</b> is used in conjunction with an enlarged diameter E in a back end portion of the bore B of the barrel <b>24</b> then the central opening <b>23</b> through the front face <b>21</b> of the sliding sleeve <b>20</b>, sized marginally larger than the bore B, will thereby catch a periphery of a compressed airstream ahead of a fired bullet <b>10</b>, as well as the hot combustion gases after the bullet <b>10</b> passes therethrough. Most preferably, the sliding sleeve <b>20</b> further comprises a ring seal <b>28</b> positioned between the sliding sleeve <b>20</b> and one of the inner end portion of the barrel <b>24</b> and the gun frame <b>16</b>. In the most preferred embodiment of the invention the ring seal <b>28</b> comprises a split ring <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Again referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an enlarged cross sectional exploded view of a rear portion of the barrel and the gap seal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, we have an embodiment of the invention, preferred for revolvers <b>18</b> of the bore B most commonly used. Herein the ring seal <b>28</b> is positioned within an interior peripheral groove <b>32</b> within the sliding sleeve <b>20</b>, and slides over and along the inner end portion of the barrel <b>24</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an enlarged cross sectional exploded view of a rear portion of the barrel and a gap seal, this variation preferred for large bore revolvers <b>18</b> including shot gun revolvers <b>18</b> which generally are not presently practical due to problems with the revolver gap G. It is noted that with the sliding sleeve <b>20</b> sealing the revolver gap G it is possible to use the revolver <b>18</b> format for a shot gun. Mostly for safety reasons, it was not previously practical to have a revolver <b>18</b> shot gun. This embodiment of the invention is generally preferred for revolvers <b>18</b> of larger bore B. Herein, the ring seal <b>28</b> is positioned within an exterior peripheral groove <b>34</b> around the sliding sleeve <b>20</b>, and the periphery of the ring seal <b>20</b> slides within and along a recessed circular groove <b>36</b> around the inner end portion of the barrel <b>24</b>. It is noted that the recessed circular groove <b>36</b> may be either within an end portion of the barrel <b>24</b>, or within the frame <b>16</b> therearound, or partially within the frame <b>16</b> and the end portion of the barrel <b>24</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an enlarged cross sectional exploded view of yet another variation preferred for smaller bore revolvers <b>18</b>. Herein, the ring seal <b>28</b> is positioned within an exterior peripheral groove <b>38</b> around the inner end portion of the barrel <b>24</b>, and the periphery of the ring seal <b>28</b> slides along and within the inner diameter of the sliding sleeve <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In yet another preferred embodiment of the invention a bias means <b>40</b> is positioned over and around the back end portion of the barrel <b>24</b> to urge the front face of the sliding sleeve <b>20</b> against the revolving cylinder <b>22</b> prior to firing. In the most preferred embodiment of the invention the bias means comprises a spring washer <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is noted that use of a sliding sleeve <b>20</b> has broader application. In a projectile launching device <b>19</b>&#x2014;such as a paint ball marker, air gun, or a riot control gun launching projectiles (including tear gas balls, pepper gas balls, bean bags, and rubber bullets)&#x2014;having a frame <b>16</b>, carrying a barrel <b>24</b> and a projectile feed mechanism <b>22</b>B, configured to hold and sequentially align a projectile <b>11</b> therein with a rear portion of the barrel <b>24</b>, the improvement comprising: a) a sliding sleeve <b>20</b> positioned over an inner end portion of the barrel <b>24</b>, said end portion of the barrel <b>24</b> and inner diameter of the sliding sleeve <b>20</b> closely mated; and, b) said sliding sleeve <b>20</b> having a front face <b>21</b> having a central opening <b>23</b> therethrough having an inner diameter nominally equivalent to marginally larger than, a bore B through the barrel <b>24</b>. Whereafter firing, the sliding sleeve <b>20</b> is instantaneously driven back contacting its front face <b>21</b> with the feed mechanism <b>22</b>B, thereby eliminating any gap G between the feed mechanism <b>22</b>B and the barrel <b>24</b>, preventing exploding gas from escaping therethrough, and substantially increasing projectile <b>11</b> discharge velocity and energy.</p>

<claim-text>10. In a projectile launching device having a frame, carrying a barrel and a projectile feed mechanism, configured to hold and sequentially align a projectile therein with a rear portion of the barrel, the improvement comprising:
<claim-text>a) a sliding sleeve positioned over an inner end portion of the barrel, said end portion of the barrel and inner diameter of the sliding sleeve closely mated; and,</claim-text>
<claim-text>b) said sliding sleeve having a front face having a central opening therethrough having an inner diameter nominally equivalent to marginally larger than, a bore through the barrel;</claim-text>
<claim-text>whereafter firing, the sliding sleeve is instantaneously, and directly driven back, substantially by gas pressure, until the front face of the sliding sleeve makes contact with the revolving cylinder, thereby eliminating any gap between the revolving cylinder and the barrel, preventing exploding gas from escaping therethrough, and substantially increasing bullet discharge velocity and energy, and subsequently, after the bullet is fully discharged, and gas pressure drops, said sleeve is no longer forcibly maintained in a gap eliminating position. </claim-text>
