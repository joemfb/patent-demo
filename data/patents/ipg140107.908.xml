<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Control valves are widely applied in many fields such as hydraulic equipment, to control the flow of a liquid or gas. A commonly used control valve often includes two controls, which are switched during use, for controlling the supply to the hydraulic equipment. However, the commonly used control valve has a poor structure and is prone to switching between the two controls accidently, thereby generating a potential safety hazard to the hydraulic equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Therefore, there is room for improvement in the art.</p>
