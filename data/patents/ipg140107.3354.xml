<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to a system and method for harnessing hydro-kinetic energy from vertical, horizontal or oscillatory movement of water through unique devices and through reconstructing height differences in flowing bodies of water without the necessity for building a dam.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The importance of utilizing natural clean renewable energy has emerged as critical in order to combat global warming. The major sources of natural clean energy are the sun, the ground, wind and water.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The use of natural energy to harness power from different sources is limited for different reasons. The use of the sun and wind energy is mostly limited by the inconsistent availability of the energy source, depending upon weather, seasonal changes, and day and night cycles. The use of ground energy is limited by geographical location and by difficulties in drilling a few miles below the surface of the ground. Water is the most abundant source of clean energy, but the use of energy derived from water is limited by conventional technology that requires dam construction, high water flow, usually exceeding a few meters per second, and the complexity of corresponding energy harnessing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Kinetic energy sources of water movement can be divided largely into three categories, (1) horizontal movement resulting from height differences between two locations in a river, or by tidal flow in the ocean, (2) vertical movement of water in a human built dam or fall, and (3) oscillatory wave movement originated from a combination of the horizontal and vertical movement of water, found mostly in the ocean.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Currently, the use of horizontal hydro-kinetic energy in a traditional water mill or propeller-type generator requires a minimum water flow of a few meters per second and is greatly restricted by geographical location. The method also lacks the ability to harness massive power. Several methods have been devised to harness massive energy, in mid-scale to large-scale power generation, based upon horizontal hydro-kinetic energy, including placing a turbine above a river, under a bridge. The method blocks natural water flow, similar to a dam, with the possibility of an occasional increased risk of flooding. The ability to harness horizontal hydro-kinetic energy with no or minimal water flow hindrance is a highly desirable goal. The present invention enables the harnessing of such energy with no or minimal water flow hindrance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Currently, use of the vertical movement of water to harness hydro-kinetic energy is largely limited by the use of an existing natural fall, like Niagara, or by building a dam to hold water above a dam area to create height for harnessing hydro-kinetic energy. Building a dam has mixed advantages and disadvantages. Disadvantages include (1) changes, or even destruction, of an ecosystem, and (2) a requirement for a large scale relocation of people in the affected region. Harnessing vertical hydro-kinetic energy is highly desirable, and the present invention enables harnessing vertical hydro-kinetic energy by recreating height differences without the necessity for building a dam.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Current uses of oscillatory hydro-kinetic energy in several applications are summarized in http://www1.eere.energy.gov/windandhydro/hydrokinetic/default.aspx. These applications still require improvements in efficiency and ease of installation. The present invention provides a simple, highly effective and efficient way of harnessing oscillatory hydro-kinetic energy.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention utilizes three different modalities to achieve the harnessing of hydro-kinetic energy, namely, (1) oscillatory, (2) horizontal, and (3) vertical, with a reconstruction of height.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The surface of sea water always oscillates, moving upward and downward in waves, in a &#x201c;seesaw-like&#x201d; movement. Direct harnessing of this mode of hydro-kinetic energy is not easy. The present invention makes use of &#x201c;seesaw&#x201d; power chambers filled with water. Wavel movements oscillate the seesaw power chambers up and down. Water inside the seesaw power chambers moves, based on changes in the relative slope between the seesaw power chambers. This moving water spins a power conversion unit to convert the hydro-kinetic energy inside the seesaw power chambers to usable electric power. Unidirectional flow devices can be located near the power conversion unit to effect unidirectional spinning of the power conversion unit. The rotation of the power conversion unit is used to generate hydro-electric power, using a generator. The power chambers are constructed to facilitate the movement of water from one power chamber to the other, in response to the seesaw motion, and to drive the power conversion unit for the effective and efficient generation of electric power and to enable seamless energy production.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Power generation along the surface of flowing water using a propeller-type small water turbine system has been in use for a very long time. However, the installation and scale of such a system is limited, based on the flow rate of the water at the site of the application. The present invention uses a different system and method to harness the horizontal flow of water, based on simple flow dynamics. As an analogy, if someone places a ball on the top of flowing water, the ball will flow in the direction of the water flow. The present invention utilizes a method and system for harnessing such water flow by extending into the flow of water, a plurality of wide vanes spaced apart at predetermined distances, so as to be moved by the water in the direction of flow of the water. The wide vanes are linked together by a continuous belt or chain system so that each vane travels back to an origin. When the wide vanes are returned against the direction of the flow of the water, the vanes are retracted to minimize backward water flow resistance. The total available hydro-kinetic power follows the basic energy equation, energy equals one-half times mass times velocity<sup>2 </sup>where mass is calculated by the unit area of the wide vane multiplied by the length of the belt or chain and velocity is the flow rate of the water at the system site. The present invention enables capturing hydro-kinetic energy with minimal flow rate by concentration and accumulation, using wide vane movements.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One of the well known methods and systems currently in use to harness gravitational hydro-kinetic energy includes the use of a dam. A dam utilizes the hydro-kinetic energy produced by gravitational forces generated by differences in height between the origin and the destination of water. Building a dam requires the relocation of local populations and can cause harmful ecological changes due to the huge area above the dam which will be submerged under water, and the creation of barriers to the natural movements of fish. The present invention provides a method and system which recreates height differences similar to those established by a dam, without requiring the building of a dam and the creation of a huge reservoir. In accordance with the present invention, water is moved downward inside of closed pipes to a given destination by means of gravitational hydro-kinetic forces. At the destination, the water exiting the closed pipes moves upward inside a closed tower, which is separated by a baffle into two parts, namely, a rising part that receives water from the origin and a power harnessing part. As the water reaches the top of the closed tower, the water will fall toward the lowest part of the tower to harness gravitational hydro-kinetic power, expressed as m times g times h, where m represent the mass of the water flow over a unit time, g represents gravitational force and h represents the height of the closed tower. This gravitational force creates a lower pressure area at the closed pipes to accelerate water flow rate. Since the pipes can be located outside of the water-way and can accelerate water flow rates by the gravitational hydro-forces, the present invention can be used to minimize potential flooding adjacent the bottle neck created in the vicinity of the water flow.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the following description, for purposes of explanation, specific numbers, materials and configurations are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the invention. It will be apparent, however, to one having ordinary skill in the art, that the invention may be practiced without these specific details. In some instances, well-known features may be omitted or simplified so as not to obscure the present invention. Furthermore, reference in the specification to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; means that a particular feature, structure or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. The appearances of the phrase &#x201c;in an embodiment&#x201d; in various places in the specification are not necessarily all referring to the same embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present invention advantageously provides an electricity generation system and method utilizing hydro-kinetic energy that provides increased efficiency, weather durability and easier installation and manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention also provides an electricity generation system and method that takes advantage of oscillatory hydro-kinetic energy.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The present invention also provides an electricity generation system and method that takes advantage of horizontal hydro-kinetic energy.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present invention also provides an electricity generation system and method that can be used at lower levels of horizontal hydro-kinetic energy in a river or in the sea.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">There is always wave movement in the ocean due to heat from the sun, wind, and forces resulting from relative movement between the earth and the moon. The waves have heights up to a few meters, depending on location. The amount of energy available is proportional to the volume of water in the wave and the frequency of movement.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The height of the wave varies by time and conditions. Therefore, it is difficult to harness power by simple piston movements, as found in many existing and proposed systems. In addition, efficiency can be doubled if a system could use both rising and falling wave movements.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">There is always water flow in the sea for the reasons mentioned above, and in rivers as a result of altitude differences. Electric generation has been achieved using a propeller-type generator. Use of the propeller-type generator can injure fish or water animals when operating at high speed. Moreover, propeller-type systems require a medium to high water flow rate. Developing methods to harness energy over wider surroundings, or through or increased energy harness efficiency in a limited area can enable use of a low flow rate in electricity generation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As set forth in the following detailed description, the present invention enables use of horizontal hydro-kinetic energy for electricity generation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The present invention utilizes belt or chain type rotors to harness energy and enable capturing energy in a much wider area with high efficiency. This invention enables electric generation at lower flow rates and reduces fish or sea animal injury during the generation of electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The present invention also provides method and systems for recreating gravitational hydro-kinetic energy.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to the drawing, and especially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> thereof, a wave kinetic energy harnessing apparatus constructed in accordance with the present invention is shown in the form of a &#x201c;seesaw&#x201d; power system <b>20</b> for harnessing oscillatory wave hydro-kinetic energy manifested in the form of waves <b>22</b> at the surface <b>24</b> of a body of water <b>26</b>. Power system <b>20</b> includes power chambers in the form of tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, each having an interior <b>33</b>, and being interconnected by a conduit <b>34</b> providing passages <b>36</b> communicating with corresponding interiors <b>33</b> of tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> to connect the interiors <b>33</b>. Passages <b>36</b> are tapered down from each tank <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> toward a throat <b>38</b> located intermediate the tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>. A volume of a kinetic energy material, shown in the form of water <b>40</b>, is contained within power system <b>20</b> and fills approximately less than one-half the total volume available within the system <b>20</b>. An energy conversion device is shown in the form of a water-flow responsive drive wheel <b>42</b> journaled for rotation within throat <b>38</b> and coupled to an electrical power generator <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, power system <b>20</b> is buoyant, is floated on the surface <b>24</b> of the body of water <b>26</b>, and has a length between tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> derived from the characteristics of the tidal waves <b>22</b> located at a particular installation site <b>50</b>. That is, the spacing between tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> preferably is set to somewhat less than the spacing between adjacent waves <b>22</b> experienced at site <b>50</b> so that as power system <b>20</b> floats on surface <b>24</b>, power system <b>20</b> will be driven through a &#x201c;seesaw&#x201d; motion in which the relative elevation of tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> will alternate between a first orientation, shown at <b>52</b>, wherein tank <b>30</b> is up, elevated above tank <b>32</b>, which is down, and water <b>40</b> flows from tank <b>30</b> to tank <b>32</b>, and a second orientation, shown at <b>54</b>, wherein tank <b>32</b> is up, elevated above tank <b>30</b>, which is down, and water <b>40</b> flows from tank <b>32</b> to tank <b>30</b>. As the water <b>40</b> passes between tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, through conduit <b>34</b>, drive wheel <b>42</b> is actuated by water <b>40</b> passing through throat <b>38</b>, and the oscillatory tidal hydro-kinetic energy available at surface <b>24</b> of the body of water <b>26</b> is converted into usable electrical power by power generator <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one-way flow controllers are added to power system <b>20</b> and are shown in the form of flow directors <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> located within conduit <b>34</b>, adjacent throat <b>38</b>. Flow directors <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> serve to control the flow of water <b>40</b> so that the flow of water <b>40</b> always is directed to the appropriate side of drive wheel <b>42</b>, thereby increasing effectiveness and efficiency in the actuating of water wheel <b>42</b> by water <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, a power system <b>120</b> is constructed similar to power system <b>20</b> described above, and the same reference characters are used to identify similar component parts. Thus, tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> of power system <b>120</b> are similar to those of power system <b>20</b>, with the exception of the addition of ports <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> which open corresponding tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> for the passage of water from the body of water <b>26</b> into and out of the interior <b>33</b> of each tank <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>. The ports <b>170</b> and <b>172</b> are located on tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, respectively, such that upon riding the waves <b>22</b> at the surface <b>24</b> of the body of water <b>26</b>, the tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> will move through a &#x201c;seesaw&#x201d; motion as before; however, rather than rely upon a kinetic energy material carried inside the tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, water from the body of water <b>26</b> is passed through the tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> to harness oscillatory hydro-kinetic energy, as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, power system <b>120</b> is driven through a &#x201c;seesaw&#x201d; motion in which the relative elevation of tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b> alternates from a first orientation, shown at <b>152</b>, wherein tank <b>30</b> is up, elevated above tank <b>32</b>, which is down, and water <b>140</b> flows from the body of water <b>26</b>, through ports <b>170</b> into tank <b>30</b>, and thence from tank <b>30</b> to tank <b>32</b> to exit through ports <b>172</b>, and a second orientation, shown at <b>154</b>, wherein tank <b>32</b> is up, elevated above tank <b>30</b>, which is down, and water <b>140</b> flows from the body of water <b>26</b>, through ports <b>172</b> into tank <b>32</b>, and thence from tank <b>32</b> to tank <b>30</b> to exit through ports <b>170</b>. As the water <b>140</b> passes between tanks <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>, through conduit <b>34</b>, drive wheel <b>42</b> is actuated by water <b>140</b> passing through throat <b>38</b>, and the oscillatory tidal hydro-kinetic energy available at surface <b>24</b> of the body of water <b>26</b> is converted into usable electrical power by power generator <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, one-way flow controllers added and are shown in the form of flow directors <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> located within conduit <b>34</b>, adjacent throat <b>38</b>. Flow directors <b>60</b> and <b>62</b> serve to control the flow of water <b>140</b> so that the flow of water <b>140</b> always is directed to the appropriate side of drive wheel <b>42</b>, thereby increasing effectiveness and efficiency in the actuation of drive wheel <b>42</b> by water <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, a horizontal kinetic energy harnessing apparatus constructed in accordance with the present invention is shown in the form of a power system <b>220</b> for harnessing horizontal hydro-kinetic energy manifested in the form of water <b>226</b> flowing substantially horizontally, in the direction of arrows <b>228</b>. Power system <b>220</b> includes a continuous, endless conveyor having a demand-based length and shown in the form of a pair of belts <b>230</b> mounted upon rollers <b>232</b> for movement along a closed loop path of travel as rollers <b>232</b> rotate about fixed axes of rotation <b>234</b>. A multiplicity of vanes <b>240</b> are carried by belts <b>230</b>, mounted upon supports <b>242</b> carried by the belts <b>230</b>, for pivotal movement relative to the belts <b>230</b>, as will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Belts <b>230</b>, rollers <b>232</b> and vanes <b>240</b> are immersed in flowing water <b>226</b> and secured in place by stationary posts <b>243</b>. As water <b>226</b> flows in the direction of arrows <b>228</b>, vanes <b>240</b>L along the lower legs <b>230</b>L of belts <b>230</b> are pivoted by the water flow, as well as by gravity, to the orientation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, wherein the vanes <b>240</b>L project substantially perpendicular to legs <b>230</b>L to intercept the water flow for being driven by the flow of water <b>226</b> to advance the legs <b>230</b>L of belts <b>230</b> in a direction of advancement indicated by arrows <b>244</b>. At the same time, vanes <b>240</b>U along the upper legs <b>230</b>U of belts <b>230</b> are retracted by the water flow, as well as by gravity, into an orientation wherein the vanes <b>240</b>U lie substantially parallel to belts <b>230</b>, adjacent upper legs <b>230</b>U, so as to minimize any resistance to the movement of legs <b>230</b>U in the return direction depicted by arrow <b>246</b>, as legs <b>230</b>L are advanced. Belts <b>230</b> are coupled with a drive wheel <b>250</b> which, in turn, is coupled to a driven wheel <b>252</b> through a drive belt <b>254</b>, and a generator <b>260</b> is coupled to driven wheel <b>252</b> for actuation to generate electrical power derived from the hydro-kinetic energy of flowing water <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Power system <b>220</b> is quite versatile and can be immersed to almost any depth in flowing water to harness kinetic energy available in the water, and can be used in any one of many positions in order to maximize the capture of horizontal hydro-kinetic energy present in flowing water.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, two power systems <b>270</b>, constructed similar to the construction of power system <b>220</b>, are immersed in a body of water, the two power systems <b>270</b> being spaced apart horizontally in a field of water <b>272</b> flowing in the direction of arrows <b>274</b>. As in the embodiment described above, each power system <b>270</b> is provided with vanes <b>280</b> on supports <b>282</b> carried by belts <b>284</b> coupled to rollers <b>286</b>. As water <b>272</b> flows in the direction of arrows <b>274</b>, the vanes <b>280</b> along one side <b>290</b> of each power system <b>220</b> are raised from a corresponding belt <b>284</b> to be driven by the flowing water <b>272</b>, while the vanes <b>280</b> along the other side <b>292</b> of each power system <b>220</b> are retracted so as not to impede the movement of belts <b>284</b>. The belts <b>284</b> are coupled to generators (not shown) to convert the kinetic energy present in the flowing water <b>272</b> to electrical power.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Power systems <b>270</b> are provided with a wedge-like configuration in which forward ends <b>294</b> are narrower than rearward ends <b>296</b>. In this manner, the flow of water <b>272</b> is accelerated along each power system <b>270</b> for greater effectiveness in harnessing the kinetic energy available in the flowing water <b>272</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, a wave kinetic energy harnessing apparatus constructed in accordance with the present invention is shown in the form of a power system <b>320</b> for harnessing vertical hydro-kinetic energy. Power system <b>320</b> is shown installed in a body of wave water <b>322</b> where the level of the surface <b>324</b> of the water <b>322</b> rises and falls in accordance with an oscillatory movement in a wave cycle. Power system <b>320</b> includes a belt <b>330</b> that extends around upper and lower rollers <b>332</b> mounted for rotation about substantially horizontal, vertically spaced apart axes of rotation <b>334</b> which are fixed in place relative to the rising and falling surface <b>324</b> of water <b>322</b>. A plurality of impellers <b>340</b> are carried by belt <b>330</b> and project from the belt <b>330</b>, generally perpendicular to the belt <b>330</b>. Each impeller <b>340</b> includes a frame <b>342</b> within which vanes <b>344</b> are mounted for pivotal movement between an open frame orientation, as seen at <b>350</b>, and a closed frame orientation, as seen at <b>352</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">During a rising wave, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> by arrows <b>356</b>, the force of the rising water <b>322</b> against the vanes <b>344</b> of submerged left impellers <b>340</b>L moves the vanes <b>344</b> into a closed frame orientation <b>352</b> and drives the belt <b>330</b> in an advancing direction, depicted by arrows <b>358</b>. As each impeller <b>340</b>L rises above the surface <b>324</b> of water <b>322</b>, the corresponding vanes <b>344</b> will become free to move back to the open frame orientation <b>350</b>, in response to the biasing force of gravity, in which orientation any water or other matter within an impeller <b>340</b>L is released, and any air or water resistance is minimized, so that impellers <b>340</b>L offer little resistance to continued movement of belt <b>330</b>, along a closed looped path of travel, in the direction of arrows <b>358</b>. Upon rounding the upper one of rollers <b>332</b>, each frame <b>342</b> will be inverted as the corresponding impeller <b>340</b> becomes a right impeller <b>340</b>R, and the vanes <b>344</b> of those impellers <b>340</b>R located above surface <b>324</b> of water <b>322</b> will move to a closed frame orientation <b>352</b> in response to the biasing force of gravity. In the closed frame orientation of vanes <b>344</b>, water in the vicinity can accumulate within those impellers <b>340</b>R which are above surface <b>324</b>, and the weight of such water will assist in moving the belt <b>330</b> in the direction of arrows <b>358</b>. Upon movement of impellers <b>340</b>R into water <b>322</b>, the vanes <b>344</b> of submerged impellers <b>340</b>R will be biased, by the force of water <b>322</b> against the vanes <b>344</b>, into the open frame orientation <b>350</b>, offering little resistance to downward movement of submerged impellers <b>340</b>R and continued advancement of belt <b>330</b> in the direction of arrows <b>358</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">During a falling wave, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> by arrows <b>370</b>, the force of the falling level of water <b>322</b> against the vanes <b>344</b> of submerged right impellers <b>340</b>R will maintain the vanes <b>344</b> in the closed frame orientation <b>352</b> and, along with enlistment of the force of gravity acting upon any water-filled right impellers <b>340</b>R located above surface <b>324</b> of water <b>322</b>, will drive the belt <b>330</b> in the direction of arrows <b>358</b>. As each impeller <b>340</b>R rounds the lower one of the rollers <b>332</b>, each frame <b>342</b> will be inverted as the corresponding impeller becomes a left impeller <b>340</b>L, and the corresponding vanes <b>344</b> will move back to the open frame orientation <b>350</b>, in response to the biasing force of the relatively downward movement of water <b>322</b> against the vanes <b>344</b> of submerged impellers <b>340</b>L, and will continue to remain in the open frame orientation upon emerging from water <b>322</b>, by the biasing force of gravity, in which orientation of vanes <b>344</b> impellers <b>340</b>L offer little resistance to continued advance movement of belt <b>330</b> in the direction of arrows <b>358</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Belt <b>330</b> is coupled with a drive wheel <b>380</b> which, in turn, is coupled to a generator (not shown) so that upon advance movement of belt <b>330</b> in the direction of arrows <b>358</b>, the vertical hydro-kinetic energy available in the body of wave water <b>322</b> is harnessed and converted to electrical power.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a multiplicity of power systems <b>320</b> are arranged in a matrix <b>390</b> spread over a relatively large area at an installation site <b>392</b>. A framework <b>394</b> constructed of columns <b>396</b> and beams <b>398</b> support the multiple power systems <b>320</b>, each fixed in place within matrix <b>390</b>, for harnessing the tidal vertical hydro-kinetic energy available over the area of the installation site <b>392</b>. Framework <b>394</b> may be buoyant for ease of movement to installation site <b>392</b>, and then tethered or anchored in place once located at the installation site <b>392</b>. Alternately, framework <b>394</b> can be constructed as a fixed structure at the installation site <b>392</b>. Thus, even where the rise and fall of waves may not be great, or the time between rise and fall may be spread out, the field of multiple power systems <b>320</b> will derive suitable amounts of electrical power from the available vertical hydro-kinetic energy.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, there is illustrated, diagrammatically, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a potential site <b>400</b> for the installation of a system for harnessing gravitational hydro-kinetic energy available in water <b>410</b> flowing naturally from a higher elevation at <b>412</b> to a lower elevation at <b>414</b>. Conventional installations generally call for the construction of a dam, as shown at <b>420</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Dam <b>420</b> creates a very large water reservoir <b>422</b> behind the dam <b>420</b>, establishing a source of energy which is tapped by releasing the water <b>410</b> through a water-powered generator (not shown). However, the presence of a dam can have a very great adverse affect on the character of the area in which the dam is located, not the least of which is flooding to create the reservoir <b>422</b>, often requiring the relocation of local populations, and causing irreversible disruptions to local ecological systems.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The embodiment of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> harnesses the gravitational hydro-kinetic energy available at the natural site <b>400</b>, without the necessity for building a dam, and without significant disruption of the character of the area. To that end, a power system <b>500</b> includes a water duct in the form of a pipe <b>510</b> extending between the higher elevation <b>412</b> and the lower elevation <b>414</b>. At the lower elevation <b>414</b>, a tower <b>520</b> communicates with pipe <b>510</b> and water <b>522</b> is passed from the higher elevation <b>412</b>, confined by pipe <b>510</b>, to the lower elevation <b>414</b> and into tower <b>520</b> through an inlet <b>524</b>. A baffle <b>530</b> is placed within the interior <b>531</b> of tower <b>520</b> and extends upwardly to a predetermined elevation adjacent the higher elevation <b>412</b> and divides the interior <b>531</b> of the tower <b>520</b> into a first chamber <b>532</b> and a second chamber <b>534</b>. Water <b>522</b> enters the tower <b>520</b> through inlet <b>524</b> at the bottom of the first chamber <b>532</b>, rises in the first chamber <b>532</b>, and then spills over baffle <b>530</b> to flow downwardly through second chamber <b>534</b> to an outlet <b>536</b> to be passed to a water-driven generator (not shown). The height of baffle <b>530</b> extends from a basal end <b>540</b> to a top end <b>542</b> and establishes a reconstructed altitude from which water <b>522</b> flows downwardly at an accelerated rate of flow, thereby maximizing the energy derived from the flow of water <b>522</b> for optimum power generation. In the preferred construction, top end <b>542</b> of baffle <b>530</b> is placed adjacent the level of higher elevation <b>412</b>, at an elevation <b>548</b> located just below the level of higher elevation <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At the same time, the impact on the site <b>400</b> is minimized. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 through 17</figref>, as well as to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, pipe <b>510</b> is a generally tubular construction in which the pipe <b>510</b> essentially is closed to the surroundings along the length of the pipe <b>510</b>. Moreover, the pipe <b>510</b> has a relatively narrow width, as viewed in plan, and can be located along a run <b>550</b> which is significantly wider than the pipe <b>510</b>, enabling naturally flowing water <b>410</b> to bypass the pipe <b>510</b> so as to cause very little disruption to the character of the area. To that end, pipe <b>510</b>, and tower <b>520</b>, can be located at one edge <b>552</b> of run <b>550</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, between edges <b>552</b> of run <b>550</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, or even spaced somewhat beyond an edge <b>552</b> of run <b>550</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. In each of these arrangements, water <b>522</b> flows through pipe <b>510</b> at a lowered pressure inside the closed pipe <b>510</b>, the pressure being determined by the selection of the level of elevation <b>548</b>, enabling water <b>522</b> to be delivered from higher elevation <b>412</b> to lower elevation <b>414</b> as needed and with minimal risk of damage due to flooding.</p>
