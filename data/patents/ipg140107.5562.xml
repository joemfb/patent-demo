<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation in part of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/768,876, filed Apr. 28, 2010, and entitled System And Method For Securing Payment Instruments.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure is directed generally to methods for protecting sensitive financial information from theft and fraud. In particular, the present disclosure relates to methods for authenticating the initiation of a financial transaction.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Safeguarding customer financial information against criminal fraudsters, forgers and cybercriminals represents an ongoing battle for consumers, businesses and financial institutions. Financial fraud can assume many forms including swindling, payment instrument fraud, debit or credit card fraud, real estate fraud, identity theft, deceptive telemarketing, or even money laundering. Personal computers continue to be a favorite target for fraudsters as they are typically poorly protected. Common attacks against consumers include the use of mirror or phishing sites, pharming sites, carding or skimming techniques, and crimeware such as Trojans. Although advancements in computer technology have offered more robust security features to consumers, businesses and financial institutions, they have also offered an easier operating environment for fraudsters to manipulate financial instruments, such as payment instruments, in such a way as to deceive innocent victims expecting value in exchange for their money.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In particular, payment instrument fraud is one of the largest challenges facing businesses, consumers and financial institutions today. Annual losses due to payment instrument fraud are estimated to be in the billions of dollars. This problem affects consumers who face financial losses and anxiety from the instant theft and also from possible future repercussions with credit bureaus. The Uniform Commercial Code has placed increasing emphasis on the role of businesses and financial institutions in ensuring that their issued payment instruments are secure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Victims of payment instrument fraud include financial institutions, businesses who accept and issue payment instruments, and the consumer. These crimes may begin with the theft of a financial document, for example, the theft of a blank check from a consumer's home or vehicle during a burglary, searching for a canceled or old check in the garbage, or removing a consumer's check from a mailbox. As financial institutions also continue to expand &#x201c;automated clearing house&#x201d; (or ACH) activities, the foregoing fraud risks only increase. ACH refers to an electronic clearing and settlement system for exchanging electronic credit and debit transactions among participating depository institutions. These electronic transactions are substitutes for paper checks and are typically used to make recurring payments such as payroll or loan payments. ACH transactions are often available as a way to reload prepaid debit cards issued by many companies.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Common types of payment instrument fraud include forgery where an individual, such as a disgruntled employee of a financial institution or business, issues a check without proper authorization, counterfeiting where a payment instrument may be fabricated as a whole or duplicated, alteration where chemicals are used to remove or modify information on the payment instrument, paperhanging where consumers purposefully write checks on closed accounts, or kiting where a fraudster opens accounts at two or more financial institutions and uses &#x201c;the float time&#x201d; of available funds to create fraudulent balances. In particular, payment instrument compilations, such as paper checkbooks, are particularly prone to fraud due to check number guessing and limited controls placed on the physical paper checks within the checkbook.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventional systems and methods have utilized transaction specific information, such as a transaction amount or a particular type of transaction, to permit independent verification of a transaction and a payment instrument. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,630,201 to White discloses a paper check security feature in which the checks include unique transaction numbers. When a check is cleared, the bank compares the unique transaction number to a stored number to determine if the check number is being duplicated. White further discloses that a password protected portable device generates the transaction numbers. Additionally, U.S. Patent Publication Ser. No. 2005/0149439 to Suisa discloses a paper check security feature in which the checks include unique transaction numbers generated for a particular type of transaction. When a check is cleared, the bank compares the unique transaction number to a stored number to determine if the check number is being duplicated. Further by way of example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,754,653 to Canfield discloses a paper check security feature that uses a security code that is unique for each check and for each transaction involving a check. The security code is generated from the check sequence number preprinted on the check or the total transaction amount and a customer selected base code. Still further, U.S. Pat. No. 4,958,066 to Hedgcoth discloses a checkbook in which each check has a randomly assigned number. The number is used to verify the authenticity of the check by comparing it to digits on the payor's ATM card or separate dedicated, disposable card, but is not compared to a stored bank number during check clearing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In U.S. Pat. No. 6,754,640, to Bozeman, a system is disclosed for a customer to enter current check register information via an interface such as a PC or PDA, and that a financial institution, intermediary, clearing house can match and compare the information from a check to the information in the check register. If the check has been altered in any way, then the transaction is stopped. The system notifies each of the parties when a check has been rejected or when a deposit has occurred. Electronic check processing and electronic check registering is disclosed that allows checks to be deposited and cleared in a wide variety of ways, including ACH.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In U.S. Patent Pub. No. 20100078471 to Lin et al., discloses peer-to-peer financial transactions using one or more electronic devices such as a mobile device. The device includes one or more input interfaces, including a camera, image processing software, and communication interfaces to retrieve transaction information from a payment instrument, such as a check, transmit payment information to a financial server and/or another electronic device or conduct a transaction. Lin et al., also disclose using a partial image of the check. A notification message is provided on the screen of the mobile device including information regarding the transaction, such as the depositing of a requested payment amount.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">U.S. Pat. No. 7,774,283, issued to Das et al., discloses a system for a mobile device, including a camera, to capture an image of a bar code on a &#x201c;printed medium&#x201d;, decodes the transaction information and identification information for a business entity contained in the bar code and communicates the transaction information to the business entity that is identified in the bar code to conduct the transaction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">U.S. Pat. No. 7,389,913, issued to Starrs, discloses a system for a customer to provide online and/or electronically, such as via a graphical user interface, check information for a transaction.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The present disclosure may be utilized to secure financial information in payment instruments provided to customers of financial institutions. A financial institution may be, but is not limited to, a bank or other similar entity. The present disclosure may utilize a computer-based system and method that provides financial institution customers access to numerous online banking services offered by online banking service providers based on customer information profiles that may be developed over time. &#x201c;Online&#x201d; may mean connecting to or accessing account information from a location remote from the financial institution or a branch of the financial institution. Alternatively, &#x201c;online&#x201d; may refer to connecting or accessing an electronic network (wired or wireless) via a computer as described below. In exemplary embodiments, the methods are often web-based.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The Internet is a worldwide system of computer networks&#x2014;a network of networks in which a user at one computer or other device connected to the network can obtain information from any other computer and communicate with users of other computers or devices. The most widely used part of the Internet is the World Wide Web (often-abbreviated &#x201c;WWW&#x201d; or called &#x201c;the Web&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">One of the most outstanding features of the Web is its use of hypertext, which is a method for cross-referencing. In most Web sites, certain words or phrases appear in text of a different color than the surrounding text. This text is often also underlined. Sometimes, there are hot spots, such as buttons, images, or portions of images that are &#x201c;clickable.&#x201d; Clicking on hypertext or a hot spot causes the downloading of another web page via a protocol such as hypertext transport protocol (HTTP). Using the Web provides access to millions of pages of information. Web &#x201c;surfing&#x201d; is done with a Web browser, the most popular of which presently are Apple Safari and Microsoft Internet Explorer. The appearance of a particular website may vary slightly depending on the particular browser used. Versions of browsers have &#x201c;plug-ins,&#x201d; which provide animation, virtual reality, sound, and music. Interpreted programs (e.g., applets) may be run within the browser.</p>

The functionality of the method may be programmed and executed by at least one computer processor unit <b>152</b>, with necessary data and graphical interface pages as described below stored in and retrieved from a data storage unit <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. A user can access this functionality using a user device <b>108</b>, <b>110</b>. Online banking access system <b>150</b> may provide separate features and functionality for front-end users, including customers and online banking service provider users, as well as back-end users that manage the online banking access system <b>150</b>. As used herein, a &#x201c;customer&#x201d; is an individual or organization that signs up for or otherwise takes advantage of an online banking service, and an &#x201c;online banking service provider&#x201d; is an individual or organization, such as a financial institution, that provides one or more online banking services to customers. Accordingly, the customers are actual customers of the online banking service providers.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and flow diagram <b>200</b>, at block <b>201</b> a customer may contact a financial institution to request or order a compilation of payment instruments, such as a checkbook, from the financial institution. For example, the checkbook may be a paper checkbook or an electronic checkbook. As can readily be appreciated, the present disclosure is applicable to a number of payment instruments and compilations of payment instruments, and that a check and compilation of a plurality of checks commonly referred to as a checkbook are only an exemplary form of a payment instrument or a compilation of payment instruments that are contemplated by the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The customer may order a checkbook by contacting the financial institution through a wide variety of methods including, but not limited to, telephone, mobile telephone, SMS, electronic mail, physical mail or by entering the financial institution's electronic system for online check ordering. The financial institution's electronic system for online check ordering may be a website provided by the financial institution's online banking access system <b>150</b> that the customer may access via a public or private network. The customer may enter the website a number of ways (i.e., the customer's entrance into the financial institution's website may be &#x201c;path sensitive&#x201d;) such as via a public network, via a link from another account the customer may have with the financial institution, via a notice or alert sent to the customer by the financial institution, via an e-mail advertisement sent to the customer by the financial institution, in response to a receipt of a promotional advertisement, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At block <b>203</b>, a determination may be made as to whether the customer is an existing client of the financial institution. In one embodiment, a determination may be made as to whether the customer is an existing online client of the financial institution. This determination may be based on information from block <b>201</b> or other information provided by the customer or from another source, including records or files possessed by, or stored at, the financial institution, including, but not limited to, at data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. The determination at block <b>203</b> may be made as to whether the customer is an existing offline client of the financial institution or both an online and offline client of the financial institution. An offline client may include the situation where the customer currently does business with the financial institution but not through the financial institution's online system.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">If the customer is an existing online client of the financial institution, then at block <b>205</b>, the customer enters information (which may sometimes be referred to herein as information for identifying a party or information for identifying a customer) such as, for example, a username and password. This information may typically be entered and transmitted to the financial institution using a computer such as, for example, through customer's terminal <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> or local computer <b>164</b>. Alternatively, other information may be entered or used in place of a username and password. For example, the information for identifying a customer may include the customer's name, the customer's mailing address, the customer's electronic mailing address, the customer's account number, the customer's social security number, the customer's bank's name, the customer's bank's identification number, the customer's bank's routing transit number, the website login information assigned to the customer by the financial institution or selected by the customer when creating an online account with the financial institution, a digital signature, information stored in a security token such as a soft token, hard token, key fob, or the like, a personal identification number (PIN), source IP address, a session identification, a session start time, a knowledge based authentication (KBA) status or any combination thereof. In one embodiment, since the customer is an existing online client of the financial institution only a limited amount or portion of information need be entered by the customer. In an exemplary embodiment, the information sent between the customer and the financial institution is encrypted using a network security protocol known in the art such as, for example, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS). If the customer is an existing offline client of the institution, the customer provides identifying information, at block <b>205</b>, such as, for example, the customer's name, customer's mailing address, the customer's electronic mailing address, the customer's account number, the customer's social security number, the customer's bank's name, the customer's bank identification number, the customer's bank's routing transit number, telephone call-in information assigned to the customer by the financial institution or selected by the customer during account set-up, a call-in password, a call-in PIN, or any combination thereof. In another embodiment, when the customer is an existing offline client of the financial institution, only a limited amount or portion of information need be entered by the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">At block <b>207</b>, the information provided by the customer at block <b>205</b> may be authenticated by any appropriate method known in the art. For example, the information provided by the customer at block <b>205</b> may be compared to information stored for the customer in records or files possessed by, or stored at, the financial institution, including, but not limited to, at data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. If the information provided by the customer at block <b>205</b> is not authenticated, the financial institution may inform the customer that the information provided at block <b>205</b> is incorrect by any appropriate method known in the art including, for example, by displaying an error message on the customer's computer screen at block <b>209</b> and looping the process back to block <b>205</b>. If the information provided by the customer at block <b>205</b> is authenticated, then the financial institution may, at block <b>211</b>, present to the customer (e.g. by displaying information on a webpage presented to the customer) at, for example, the customer's terminal <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> or local computer <b>164</b>, information for ordering a compilation of payment instruments. In one embodiment, the financial institution may provide to the customer, at block <b>211</b>, information for ordering a checkbook by telephone, electronic mail, mobile telephone, SMS, physical mail, or any other correspondence mechanism.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The information for ordering a checkbook presented to the customer at block <b>211</b> may be dynamically presented based at least partially on the information provided by the customer at block <b>201</b> or <b>205</b> or from another source, including records or files possessed by, or stored at, the financial institution, including, but not limited to, at data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. For example, the information for ordering the checkbook may include a type of account held by the customer at the financial institution including, but not limited to, a savings account, checking account, money market account, etc. In one embodiment, the information for ordering the checkbook may include the name of the primary account holder, the name of a joint account holder, an account number of a checking, savings, money market or other account, a physical or electronic mailing address of the customer, terms and conditions for ordering the checkbook, etc. The terms and conditions, as is known in the art, typically includes information appropriate for a product to be selected or ordered by a customer, in this case at block <b>211</b>, and may include information, such as, but not limited to, minimum balance requirements, payment rules, interest rates charged, overdraft charges, late fee applicability, etc. In an embodiment, the information for ordering the checks may include an option for renewal of a previous order or request made by the customer. In another embodiment, the customer may be asked to verify the accuracy of the information presented at block <b>211</b> and/or accept terms and conditions presented at block <b>211</b> prior to ordering or requesting the checkbook. In a further embodiment, the customer may perform edits to the information presented at block <b>211</b> to ensure accuracy. In another embodiment, the information for ordering the checkbook may include a link to a third party provider site, including but not limited to, a check provider or check printing service provider. At block <b>213</b>, the customer makes a selection from the information for ordering the checkbook provided or presented at block <b>211</b> and orders or requests the checkbook.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Upon receipt of the request or order from the customer, at block <b>215</b>, an activation code is generated by the financial institution. As used herein, an activation code is a random or pseudorandom code generated by any appropriate method known in the art, including at least one or more of a number, letter or symbol, or combination thereof, and that is unique to the checkbook ordered or requested by the customer at block <b>213</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, computer processing unit <b>152</b> may be programmed to execute an activation code generating algorithm that returns a sequence of apparently non-related numbers, letters, symbols or combinations thereof each time the program is called. For example, an activation code for a requested checkbook may be generated as &#x201c;e429ab.&#x201d; In an alternate embodiment, the activation code may be generated by a third party check provider or check printing service provider.</p>

Computer programs (also referred to as computer control logic) are stored in main memory <b>304</b>, secondary memory <b>308</b> and/or data storage devices <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. Computer programs may also be received via communications interface <b>320</b>. Such computer programs, when executed by a processor, enable the computer processing unit <b>152</b> to perform features of the methods discussed herein. For example, main memory <b>304</b>, secondary memory <b>308</b>, data storage devices <b>154</b>, <b>156</b> or removable storage units <b>316</b> or <b>318</b> may be encoded with computer program code for performing the activation code algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an embodiment implemented using software, the software may be stored in a computer program product and loaded into computer processing unit <b>152</b> using removable storage drive <b>312</b>, hard drive <b>310</b>, or communications interface <b>320</b>. The software, when executed by a processor <b>302</b>, causes the processor <b>302</b> to perform the functions of the activation code algorithm described herein. In another embodiment, the activation code algorithm may be implemented primarily in hardware using, for example, hardware components such as a digital signal processor comprising application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). In yet another embodiment, the activation code algorithm is implemented using a combination of both hardware and software.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As discussed above, at block <b>215</b>, the financial institution may generate an activation code by any appropriate method known or used in the art. For example, it is well-known in the art to program and execute a standard C RAND or RAND_S function, or the PHP hypertext preprocessor functions microtime or mt_rand, or the Unix function /dev/random, or the Java function SecureRandom, to return a pseudorandom number or alphanumeric sequence within a specified range. It is understood that a pseudorandom number or alphanumeric sequence generator should produce a pseudorandom sequence with a period that is long enough so that a finite sequence of reasonable length is not periodic. It is also well known that all pseudorandom number or alphanumeric sequence generators have an internal memory or state and that the size of the state is the value that determines the strength of the pseudorandom number or alphanumeric sequence generator, where an n-bit state can produce at most 2<sup>n </sup>different values. The strength, or ability of the pseudorandom sequence generator to resist a brute force attack by a cryptanalyst, of the output of the pseudorandom number or alphanumeric sequence generator is also commonly associated with the information entropy of the process that produced the pseudorandom sequence. This information entropy (H) is conventionally measured in bits and is commonly calculated as: H=L log<sub>2 </sub>N where L is the number of letters, numbers or symbols in the sequence and N is the number of possible letters, numbers or symbols. See, e.g. National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-63, Electronic Authentication Guideline, Appendix A; Bruce Schneier, Applied Cryptography, John Wiley &#x26; Sons, 1996, Chapter 11, Mathematical Background, p. 233-237. For example, in a pseudorandom alphanumeric sequence, where each alphanumeric character in the sequence is produced independently, and where the number of possible letters, numbers or symbols includes all letters in the Latin alphabet from a-z (26), A-Z (26) and all Arabic numerals from 0-9 (10), the entropy per symbol would be calculated as H=log<sub>2 </sub>N or log<sub>2 </sub>(52) or 5.70 bits per symbol. It is well known in the art to select L and N based on a desired information entropy, thus, one skilled in the art would understand to select those values for the activation code based on a desired information entropy.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It is also understood that to be cryptographically secure, a pseudorandom sequence must be unpredictable where a secret key, or seed, is used to set the initial state of the pseudorandom sequence generator. Key management of the secret key or seed may be implemented by the financial institution in any method known in the art and should be at least in compliance with the financial industry standards set forth by the Accredited Standards Committee X9. In addition to employing a secret key, there are a wide variety of known methods to generate the seed for pseudorandom sequence generation. For example, the standard C function RAND may be seeded using the time function, although time of day is often not used as a seed due to its susceptibility to cryptographic attacks. Additionally, by way of example, Open SSL may use the function RAND_screen( ) to hash the contents of the screen to generate a seed. Further by way of example, the Linux random number generator may collect data from a variety of sources, including mouse, keyboard and other interrupts to seed a random number generator. Furthermore, it is well known in the art to combine the seed and a counter output and hash the output with a one-way hashing functions such as MD5 or SHA-1 to generate a cryptographically secure pseudorandom sequence.</p>

At block <b>825</b>, the financial institution may update the authenticated customer's records or files possessed by, or stored at, the financial institution, including, but not limited to, at data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>, to indicate that the checkbook associated with the stored activation code has been activated. At block <b>827</b>, the customer may be able to obtain information and details of each check of the plurality of checks in the activated checkbook by contacting the financial institution through a wide variety of methods including, but not limited to, telephone, mobile telephone, SMS, electronic mail, physical mail or by entering and accessing the financial institution's electronic system for online banking. Thus, for example, a customer may be able to reconcile each of the plurality of checks in the activated checkbook online on the financial institution's website. In an embodiment, a customer may be able to contact the financial institution to obtain, retrieve and/or view information or details on each of the plurality of checks in the activated checkbook at a variety of stages during the life of a check, for example, cashed checks, outstanding checks or voided checks, online on the financial institution's website. A customer may also be provided with the capability to actively reconcile each of the plurality of checks in the activated checkbook through a financial institution or check service provider. For example, a customer may be provided with the capability to stop payment of a check, void a check, cancel one or more of the plurality of outstanding checks in the activated checkbook online using, for example, the financial institution's website. In an embodiment, a customer may be provided with the capability to register information and/or details on a check of the plurality of checks, online on the financial institution or check service provider's website or at a separate portal maintained by the financial institution or check service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">For example, and with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the financial institution or check service provider may establish and dynamically present an online check register, such as an online check and/or transaction register, where a customer may register and/or record information and/or details on a check or financial transaction. For example, a customer may be dynamically presented with an online check register including check information including, but not limited to, a check number, unique pseudorandom check code, activation status, date and/or time of activation, MICR data of a check, account number of the customer, customer name, joint account holder name, and/or account balance, of a plurality of checks, such as in a checkbook, of the customer. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a customer may dynamically enter or update information from the check and/or a financial transaction associated with the check including, but not limited to, a check or transaction amount, a payee name, a payee address, a transaction date, a transaction time, and/or a transaction description into an online check register. The online check register may be an intelligent check register. An intelligent check register may provide for automatic reconcilement of a check and/or transaction, such as at a time when a check is presented for deposit or a transaction authorization request is received. An online check register may be maintained in records or files possessed by, or stored at, the financial institution, including, but not limited to, at data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, at block <b>1001</b>, a financial institution may automatically authenticate a request for financial transaction when, for example, it receives a customer's check which may include a customer name <b>1102</b>, a customer address <b>1104</b>, a customer account number <b>1106</b>, a check sequence number <b>1108</b>, a unique pseudorandom check code <b>1110</b>, and transaction-related information such as a payee name <b>1112</b>, a date <b>1114</b>, and an amount <b>1116</b>. The check may be a paper check or an electronic check. In an embodiment, a customer may have previously provided the check to a third party. The third party may be a company or person to whom the customer owes a debt or desires to make a payment. For example, the customer may provide a paper check to a utility company to cover a monthly bill or to a friend or relative as a gift. In an embodiment, the customer may provide an electronic check to one or more payees to satisfy a debt or make a payment. One skilled in the art will recognize that the customer may provide a check through a wide variety of methods including, but not limited to, telephone, mobile telephone, electronic mail, physical mail, by submitting a bill payment request through a financial institution's electronic system for online bill payment, or by providing a check directly to a third party. In an embodiment using electronic systems for online bill payment, a financial institution or check service provider may provide a paper check or electronic check based on the customer's online bill payment request to a third party on behalf of the customer. In another embodiment, the customer may submit a request to create a paper check from an electronic check through a financial institution's website displayed on, for example, a customer's terminal <b>108</b>, <b>110</b> or to local computer <b>164</b> at the customer's home, office or other location. In one embodiment, the third party may deposit the check in a financial institution of the third party, such as for example, a bank of first deposit. One skilled in the art would understand that a bank of first deposit may include any financial institution where a customer's check is initially deposited to an account. For example, if the check is drawn on another financial institution or bank, the collecting bank may present the check directly to a paying financial institution or the collecting bank may present the check to a correspondent bank or clearinghouse corporation, or to the Federal Reserve Bank for settlement against a paying financial institution's reserve account. One skilled in the art would also understand that a Federal Reserve Bank may be any of the regional banks in the Federal Reserve System. In an embodiment, the bank of first deposit may scan the deposited check and send an electronic image of the deposited check, or a substitute check, to a paying financial institution or Federal Reserve Bank as appropriate. In an embodiment including a Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Reserve Bank may process the check and send an electronic image, or substitute check, to the paying bank through, for example, the Federal Reserve's check clearing system. In an embodiment, a correspondent bank or clearinghouse corporation may process the check through an electronic check processing system such as, for example, FedWire or Clearing House Interbank Payment System (CHIPS).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, at block <b>1401</b>, in an embodiment, a customer may write a check to a second party from the customer's account. The second party may be, for example, a company or person to whom the customer owes a debt or desires to make a payment. The check may be a paper check or an electronic check. The check may be from the customer's checking account. At block <b>1403</b>, the customer provides or issues the check to the second party. The customer may provide the check to the second party using a wide variety of methods. In the illustrated embodiment, at block <b>1405</b>, the second party may present the check for depositing to the customer's financial institution. At block <b>1407</b>, the customer's financial institution will authenticate information on the presented check. For example, the customer's financial institution may identify its customer's identifying information on the check and may compare the customer identifying information to identifying information for the customer in records or files possessed by, or stored at, the financial institution, including, but not limited to, at data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. If the customer identifying information on the presented check is authenticated, the financial institution may further authenticate the presented check by determining the status of activating a checkbook, i.e., a plurality of checks, for the authenticated customer. For example, the financial institution may determine the status of activating a checkbook for the authenticated customer by determining if the activation code stored in records or files possessed by the financial institution has been updated to indicate that it was activated by the authenticated customer. If the authenticated customer is determined to have an activated checkbook, the financial institution may authenticate the unique pseudorandom check code on the presented check by, for example, comparing it with the stored unique pseudorandom check codes of the pseudorandom sequence associated with the authenticated customer to determine if the presented check pseudorandom check code matches one of the stored unique pseudorandom check codes for the activated checkbook. In another embodiment, the financial institution may actively reconcile other check information with information stored in an online check register. For example, a financial institution may compare an amount identified on the presented check against an amount registered by the customer in an online check register. If the customer identifying information, or the unique pseudorandom check code, on the presented check is not authenticated, or if the checkbook of the presented check has not been activated, or if the information on the presented check does not match the information stored in the online check register, the financial institution may reject the check at block <b>1409</b> by any appropriate method. If the financial institution rejects the check, it may notify the customer of the rejected check at block <b>1411</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">If the presented check has been authenticated, the second party, may at block <b>1413</b>, provide the customer's financial institution with information to transfer the funds from the customer's account to an account of the second party. In an embodiment, the second party may provide the customer's financial institution with information for identifying an account of the second party with the second party's financial institution and also information for identifying the second party's financial institution. For example, the second party may provide the customer's financial institution with his checking account number at his financial institution and the routing transit number (RTN) of his financial institution. In another embodiment, the second party may provide the customer's financial institution with the name or bank identification number of his financial institution. At block <b>1415</b>, the customer's financial institution will transfer the appropriate funds associated with the check amount of the presented check from the customer's account to the second party's account at the second party's financial institution. For example, the customer's financial institution may send the funds as an automated clearing house (ACH) transaction to the second party's financial institution. The second party's financial institution may receive the funds and post the amount to the second party's account specified in the ACH transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, at blocks <b>1501</b> and <b>1601</b> respectively, a customer may write a paper check to a second party from the customer's account at his financial institution. At block <b>1503</b> (<b>1603</b>), the customer provides or issues the check to the second party. In an embodiment, at block <b>1605</b>, the customer may access, for example, his financial institution's website to update information from the check issued to the second party in an online check register. For example, a customer may dynamically enter or update the check amount from the check issued to the second party. At block <b>1505</b> (<b>1607</b>), the second party electronically presents paper check information to the customer's financial institution. For example, the second party may access a customer's financial institution's website or a portal maintained by the customer's financial institution for check clearing.

At block <b>1509</b> (<b>1611</b>), the customer's financial information may receive the check information entered by the second party for authentication. At block <b>1511</b> (<b>1619</b>), the customer's financial institution authenticates the check information received from the second party from the paper check issued by the customer. In an embodiment, the customer's financial institution may compare the customer identifying information from the check entered by the second party to identifying information for the customer in records or files possessed by, or stored at, the financial institution, including, but not limited to, at data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. If the customer identifying information entered by the second party is authenticated, at block <b>1617</b>, the financial institution may further authenticate the received check information by determining the status of activating a checkbook for the authenticated customer. If the authenticated customer is determined to have an activated checkbook, at block <b>1511</b> (<b>1619</b>), the customer's financial institution may authenticate the unique pseudorandom check code entered by the second party by, for example, comparing it with the stored unique pseudorandom check codes of the pseudorandom sequence associated with the authenticated customer to determine if the received pseudorandom check code matches one of the stored unique pseudorandom check codes for the activated checkbook. In an embodiment, at block <b>1619</b>, The financial institution may actively reconcile other received check information with information stored in an online check register. For example, a financial institution may compare a check amount entered by the second party for the customer's check against an amount registered by the customer in an online check register. If the received customer identifying information, or the received unique pseudorandom check code, is not authenticated, or if the checkbook of the customer's check has not been activated, or if the received check information does not match the information stored in the online check register, the financial institution may reject the check at block <b>1513</b> (<b>1613</b>) by any appropriate method. If the financial institution rejects the check, it may notify the customer of the rejected check at block <b>1515</b> (<b>1615</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">If the received check information has been authenticated, the customer's financial institution may notify the second party by any appropriate method. For example, the customer's financial institution may notify the second party via their website or web portal and may request that the second party provide additional information for clearing the customer's check.

To facilitate an electronic check depositing transaction, a check may include instructions for contacting the customer's online banking service provider to electronically deposit the check including, but not limited to, a website address, portal information, a secure electronic mailing address, a telephone number, and/or instructions for electronically depositing the check once contact has been established with the financial institution. The customer's online banking service provider may process the electronic check depositing request through a wide variety of methods. In an embodiment, the customer's online banking service provider may process the electronic check depositing request as an ACH transfer using the received deposit information.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, at block <b>1003</b>, the financial institution may authenticate the customer identifying information on the received check <b>1100</b>. For example, the customer identifying information on the received check <b>1100</b> may be compared to identifying information for the customer in records or files possessed by, or stored at, the financial institution, including, but not limited to, at data storage units <b>154</b>, <b>156</b>. In an embodiment, the financial institution may authenticate customer identifying information from a check <b>1100</b> entered by a third party at, for example, a website or portal maintained by the online banking service provider. If the customer identifying information on the received check <b>1100</b> is not authenticated, the financial institution may reject the check at block <b>1005</b> by any appropriate method known in the art. In an embodiment, the financial institution may inform the third party that the customer identifying information entered into the portal or website is incorrect by any appropriate method including, for example, by displaying an error message on the customer's computer screen. In an embodiment, the financial institution may send a received substitute check, or received scanned image of the electronic check, back to its originator such as, for example, the bank of first deposit, Federal Reserve Bank, correspondent bank or clearinghouse corporation that processed the check. If the financial institution rejects the check or electronic check depositing request, the financial institution may, at block <b>1007</b>, notify the customer of the rejected check or the rejected electronic check depositing request by any appropriate method. In an embodiment, the financial institution may take additional measures to enhance the security of the customer's account. For example, the financial institution may review a risk assessment stored for the customer or force the customer to modify customer identifying information to include, for example, a username, a password, website login information assigned to the customer by the financial institution or selected by the customer when creating an online account with the financial institution, a personal identification number (PIN), telephone call-in information assigned to the customer by the financial institution or selected by the customer during account set-up, a call-in password, or a call-in PIN.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">If the customer identifying information on the received check <b>1100</b>, or the customer identifying information from a check <b>1100</b> entered by a third party at a website or portal maintained by a financial institution, is authenticated, the financial institution may, at block <b>1009</b>, determine the status of activating a checkbook, i.e., a plurality of checks, for the authenticated customer. In an embodiment, the financial institution may determine the status of activating a checkbook for the authenticated customer by comparing at least a portion of the customer identifying information for the authenticated customer stored in records or files possessed by the financial institution with at least a portion of the customer identifying information on the received check and by reviewing the status of the stored activation code. In an exemplary embodiment, the financial institution may determine the status of activating a checkbook for the authenticated customer by determining if the activation code stored in records or files possessed by the financial institution has been updated to indicate that it was activated by the authenticated customer. For example, the financial institution may determine the status of activating a checkbook for the customer by comparing the customer's name and account number on the received check, or as received electronically from a third party, to the stored customer name and customer account number to determine that the customer is authentic and by determining if the stored activation code has been updated to indicate that it was activated by the associated customer that was previously authenticated. In an alternate embodiment, the financial institution may simply determine the status of activating a checkbook for the authenticated customer using the stored activation code associated with the authenticated customer. If the authenticated customer is determined to not have an activated checkbook, the financial institution may reject the check or electronic check deposit transaction request by looping back to block <b>1005</b>. In an embodiment, the financial institution may inform the third party that the customer does not have an activated checkbook by any appropriate method including, for example, by displaying an error message on the customer's computer screen.</p>

In an embodiment, the financial institution may authenticate deposit information entered by a third party at, for example, a website or portal maintained by the online banking service provider, including a unique pseudorandom check code, using the stored information for identifying the customer, at least a portion of the received information for indentifying the customer and by comparing the received unique pseudorandom check code with the stored unique pseudorandom check codes of the pseudorandom number sequence associated with the authenticated customer. If the received check pseudorandom check code does not match one of the stored unique pseudorandom check codes for the activated checkbook associated with the authenticated customer, the financial institution may reject the check or electronic check deposit transaction request by looping back to block <b>1005</b>. However, if the customer identifying information and the unique pseudorandom check code included on the received check, or entered by a third party, are authenticated, and the checkbook for the authenticated customer is determined to be activated, then the received check or electronic check deposit transaction request is determined to be authentic and may be cleared automatically for payment. In an embodiment, a financial institution and/or check service provider may actively reconcile other check and/or transaction information with information in an online check register. For example, a financial institution may compare an amount of the received check <b>1100</b> or electronic check deposit transaction request against an amount registered by the customer in an online check register. In another embodiment, a financial institution may attempt to reconcile other information including, but not limited to, a payee name, a payee address, a transaction date, a transaction time, and/or a transaction description. If the received check or electronic check deposit transaction request information does not match information in an online check register, the financial institution may reject the check or electronic check deposit transaction request by looping back to block <b>1005</b>. However, if the received check or electronic check deposit transaction request information are authenticated with the information in the online check register, the customer identifying information and the unique pseudorandom check code included on the received check, or entered by a third party, are authenticated, and the checkbook for the authenticated customer is determined to be activated, then the received check or electronic check deposit transaction request is determined to be authentic and may be cleared automatically for payment.
