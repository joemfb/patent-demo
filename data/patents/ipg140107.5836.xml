<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates in general to file distribution, and more specifically to systems and methods for efficiently distributing a file that is encoded with multiple description coding.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Today, much information is stored as digital data. Such information is often available to processor-based devices via client-server networks. Client-server networks are delivering a large array of information (including content and services) such as news, entertainment, personal shopping, airline reservations, rental car reservations, hotel reservations, on-line auctions, on-line banking, stock market trading, as well as many other services and types of content. Such information providers (sometimes referred to as &#x201c;content providers&#x201d;) are making an ever-increasing amount of information available to users via client-server networks.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It is often desirable to communicate information to a plurality of different recipients. More particularly, it is often desirable to replicate a large file among a number of distributed computers. For instance, in some situations it is desirable for a plurality of distributed clients to receive a replicated file. For example, suppose a number of client computers comprise a software application program, and the application program's provider makes a modification or update to the program. The application provider may desire to distribute the software update to each of the client computers. As another example, a company may receive a new software program and desire to distribute the software program to all of its computers that are communicatively coupled to the company's Local Area Network (LAN) or Intranet.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As still another example, it may be desirable for a large file to be replicated among a plurality of distributed servers. For instance, as described further below, a plurality of distributed servers may be established for efficiently serving content to clients (e.g., each server may be responsible for a particular geographical region of clients), and it may be desirable to replicate a file from an originating server to the other distributed servers such that all of the servers provide the same content to their respective clients. For example, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are based on a large-scale distributed network of servers located closer to the edges of the Internet for efficient delivery of digital content, including various forms of multimedia content. The main goal of the CDN's architecture is to minimize the network impact in the critical path of content delivery as well as to overcome a server overload problem, which is a serious threat for busy sites serving popular content. CDNs implementing distributed content servers are becoming increasingly popular on the Internet, and particularly within the World Wide Web (the &#x201c;web&#x201d;) portion of the Internet, for example, for serving content (web documents) to clients. Many edge servers may be implemented within the Internet (e.g., hundreds, thousands, or even hundreds of thousands of edge servers may be implemented) that are each to serve the same, replicated content to their respective clients.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">CDNs were developed to overcome performance problems, such as network congestion and server overload, that arise when many users access popular content. As mentioned above, CDNs improve end-user performance by storing popular content on edge servers located closer to users. This provides a number of advantages. First, it helps prevent server overload because the replicated content can be delivered to users from edge servers. Furthermore, because content is delivered from the closest edge server and not from the origin server, the content is sent over a shorter network path, thus reducing the request response time, the probability of packet loss, and the total network resource usage.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For many web documents (e.g., html pages and images having a relatively small file size) served via CDN, active replication of the original content at the edge servers may not be needed. The CDN's edge servers act as caching servers, and if the requested content is not yet in the cache at the time it is requested by a client, the content is retrieved from the original server using the so-called pull model. The performance penalty associated with the initial document retrieval from the original server to the edge server serving the requesting client, such as higher latency observed by the client and the additional load experienced by the original server, is generally not significant for small to medium size web documents.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For large files (e.g., large documents, software download packages, and media files), a different operational mode is typically preferred. In this case, it is typically desirable to replicate these files at edge servers in advance of a client requesting them, using the so-called push model. For large files, actively replicating the files to a plurality of distributed edge servers is a challenging, resource-intensive problem, e.g., media files can require significant bandwidth and download time due to their large sizes: a 20 minute media file encoded at 1 Mbit/s results in a file of 150 Mbytes. Thus, if such a large file was not actively replicated to the edge servers in advance of a client requesting the file, a significant performance penalty may be incurred for retrieving the file from the original server, such as higher latency observed by the client and the additional load experienced by the original server in providing the large file to the edge server serving the requesting client. Sites supported for efficiency reasons by multiple mirror servers face a similar problem: the original content needs to be replicated across the multiple, geographically distributed, mirror servers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">While CDNs were originally intended for static web content, recently, they have been applied to the delivery of streaming media as well. Streaming media is generally characterized by data that has a strict delay constraint. This delay constraint makes streaming media very sensitive to packet loss and network outages. For example, when receiving a streaming media session, data that arrives late is useless. Not only does streaming media suffer from the same problems associated with static content delivery, it also presents additional challenges due to the real-time nature of the content. Conventional approaches for dealing with packet loss for static data, such as retransmissions, may not be possible in a streaming context. Thus, additional mechanisms have been developed to provide streaming media delivery over packet networks.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Of the various techniques to improve streaming media quality, a method of multiple description coding (MDC) has been proposed. MDC is well-known in the art and is becoming increasingly popular for use with delivery of streaming media. See e.g., S. Wenger, &#x201c;Video Redundancy Coding in H.263<i>+&#x201d;, Workshop on Audio</i>-<i>Visual Services for Packet Networks, </i>1997; V. Goyal and J. Kovacevic, &#x201c;Multiple description transform coding of images&#x201d;, Bell Labs, 1998; Justin Ridge, Fred W. Ware, and Jerry D. Gibson, &#x201c;Multiple Descriptions, Error Concealment, and Refined Descriptions for Image Coding&#x201d;, <i>Proc. Second Annual UCSD Conference on Wireless Communications, </i>1999; John G. Apostolopoulos and Susie J. Wee, &#x201c;Unbalanced Multiple Description Video Communication Using Path Diversity&#x201d;, <i>IEEE International Conference on Image Processing </i>(<i>ICIP</i>), Thessaloniki, Greece, October 2001; and John Apostolopoulos, Tina Wong, Wai-tian Tan, and Susie Wee, &#x201c;On Multiple Description Streaming with Content Delivery Networks&#x201d;, <i>IEEE INFOCOM</i>, June 2002.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In general, MDC codes a media stream into two (or more) complementary descriptions (or &#x201c;descriptors&#x201d;). These descriptions have the property that if either description is received it can be used to decode baseline quality of the media stream (e.g., video, audio, etc.), and both descriptions can be used to decode improved quality of the media stream. More particularly, MDC is source coding for multiple channels such that a decoder which receives an arbitrary subset of the channels may produce a useful reconstruction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, MDC codes a media file into a plurality of complementary descriptions. If any one of the descriptions are received a baseline quality of the media file can be decoded, and if additional ones of the descriptions are received, improved quality of the media file can be decoded. This is in contrast to conventional video coders (e.g., MPEG-1/2/4, H.261/3, Microsoft's and Real Network's proprietary coders), which produce a single stream that does not have these MD properties (and may be referred to herein as single description coding (SDC)).</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Various embodiments of the present invention are now described with reference to the above figures, wherein like reference numerals represent like parts throughout the several views. As described further below, embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for distributing a file from a first node (which may be referred to herein as the &#x201c;origin&#x201d; node) to a plurality of recipient nodes. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for distributing an MDC file from a first node (or &#x201c;origin&#x201d; node) to a plurality of recipient nodes. In certain embodiments, the plurality of recipient nodes comprise servers, such as edge servers in a CDN or mirror servers as examples. Of course, embodiments of the present invention may also be utilized for distributing a file to client nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to an embodiment of the present invention, an MDC file to be distributed comprises a plurality of complementary descriptors, and the plurality of descriptors are distributed from the origin node to the recipient nodes. More particularly, all of the plurality of descriptors of the MDC file are desired to be communicated from an origin node to the recipient nodes, but the origin node does not send all of the descriptors to each recipient node. That is, the origin node sends only a portion of the descriptors to at least a portion of the recipient nodes. For instance, in one embodiment, each recipient node receives a different one of the descriptors of the MDC file to be distributed. Thereafter, the recipients exchange their respective descriptors with each other, thus resulting in each recipient obtaining all of the descriptors. Accordingly, the origin node is not required to communicate all of the descriptors to each recipient node, but rather may communicate only a portion thereof to each recipient node, and the recipient nodes then exchange their respective portions to result in each recipient node obtaining all descriptors of the MDC file.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In certain embodiments described below, the origin node may distribute descriptors to a sub-group of a group of recipient nodes, and the sub-group of nodes may then distribute the descriptors to the other nodes of the group. For instance, suppose an MDC file comprises m number of descriptors and is to be distributed to a group of n number of recipient nodes, wherein n&#x3e;m. In certain embodiments, the origin node may establish concurrent connections with a sub-group of the n number of recipient nodes, wherein the sub-group comprises m number of recipient nodes. That is, nodes corresponding in number to the m number of descriptors of an MDC file to be distributed may be logically grouped into a sub-group. The origin node may transmit a different one of the m descriptors of the MDC file to each of the m nodes of the sub-group. Thereafter, each of the m nodes of the sub-group may establish concurrent communication connections with the remaining n&#x2212;1 nodes of the group and distribute the descriptor that it received from the origin node to those remaining nodes. Accordingly, each of the n nodes of the group receives all of the descriptors of the MDC file, but the origin node is not required to communicate all of the descriptors to each recipient node.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Furthermore, the very nature of MDC encoding enhances the reliability of the distribution technique. For instance, if the communication of a descriptor from a first node to a second node is unsuccessful such that the second node fails to receive this descriptor, the second node may nevertheless receive a usable version of the MDC file (e.g., of lesser quality) if it receives at least one descriptor. Thus, while the distribution technique may attempt to distribute all of the descriptors of an MDC file to the recipient nodes (to provide the highest possible quality of the MDC file), if all of the descriptors are not received by particular ones of the recipient nodes, the distribution of the MDC file (having at least a baseline quality) to those particular recipient nodes may still be successful if at least one descriptor is received thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a file distribution technique is provided that is scalable for application in distributing an MDC file to a very large number of recipient nodes. For instance, embodiments of the present invention enable the recipient nodes to be logically organized into a plurality of different groups, with each group having a plurality of recipient nodes, and an MDC file is efficiently distributed to the plurality of groups of recipient nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">According to one embodiment, the MDC file to be distributed comprises a plurality of complementary descriptors as described above, and the plurality of descriptors are distributed from the origin node to a first group of recipient nodes. More particularly, all of the descriptors of the MDC file to be distributed are communicated from the origin node to at least a portion of the recipient nodes of the first group (e.g., at least to a sub-group thereof), but the origin node does not send all of the descriptors to each recipient node of the first group. That is, the origin node sends only a portion of its descriptors to at least a portion of the first group of recipient nodes. For instance, in one embodiment, each recipient node of a sub-group of the first group receives a different one of the descriptors of the MDC file. Thereafter, the recipient nodes of the sub-group each distribute their respective descriptors to the remaining recipient nodes of the first group, thus resulting in each recipient node of the first group obtaining all of the descriptors of the MDC file. Accordingly, the origin node is not required to communicate all of the descriptors to each recipient node of the first group, but rather may communicate only a portion thereof to a sub-group of the first group, and those recipient nodes of the sub-group then distribute their respective descriptors to the remaining nodes of the first group.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Various techniques may be implemented for distributing a file, such as an MDC file, from an origin node to a first group of recipient nodes in the manner described above. One embodiment of the present invention implements a technique referred to herein as the FastReplica distribution technique. With FastReplica, an MDC file F comprising m descriptors may be replicated among a group of n recipient nodes by transferring each descriptor from the origin node to a different node in the recipient group. That is, the MDC descriptors are communicated to recipient nodes from the origin node concurrently. Such transfer of the MDC descriptors from the origin node to the recipient nodes is referred to herein as a &#x201c;distribution&#x201d; step. Thereafter, each recipient node that received an MDC descriptor from the origin node propagates its respective MDC descriptor (i.e., the descriptor that it received from the origin node) to the remaining recipient nodes in the group. That is, each recipient node that received a descriptor concurrently communicates its descriptor to the other nodes of the group. This exchange of descriptors by recipient nodes is referred to herein as a &#x201c;collection&#x201d; step, as the recipient nodes each collect the descriptors of MDC file F from the other recipient nodes. Thus, instead of typical replication of all of the m descriptors to n nodes by using n communication paths (e.g., Internet paths) connecting the origin node to the replication group, this FastReplica technique exploits m&#xd7;n communication paths within the replication group where each path is used for transferring one of the m MDC descriptors. Co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/345,716, titled &#x201c;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR EFFICIENTLY REPLICATING A FILE AMONG A PLURALITY OF RECIPIENTS&#x201d;, the disclosure of which has been incorporated herein by reference, further describes an example file distribution technique that may be used for distribution of MDC descriptors in embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As mentioned above, embodiments of the present invention are scalable and enable distribution of an MDC file to a plurality of groups of recipient nodes. Various distribution techniques may be utilized to enable the distribution of an MDC file to a plurality of different groups of recipient nodes. In one implementation, an origin node distributes the descriptors of MDC file F to a first group of recipient nodes, such as in the above-described distribution step of the FastReplica distribution technique. Thereafter, the recipient nodes of the first group exchange their respective descriptors of MDC file F, such as in the above-described collection step of the FastReplica distribution technique. While the first group performs this collection step, the origin node may perform a distribution of the descriptors of MDC file F to a second group of recipient nodes. Thereafter, the recipient nodes of the second group exchange their respective descriptors of MDC file F, such as in the above-described collection step of the FastReplica distribution technique. While the second group performs this collection step, the origin node may perform a further distribution of the descriptors of MDC file F to a third group of recipient nodes. Further, once the first group has performed the collection step, each of those nodes may establish a communication connection to each of the nodes of a fourth group of recipient nodes, and each node of the first group may communicate the descriptor that it received from the origin node to each node of the fourth group. Thus, at the end of this distribution from the first group to the fourth group, each node of the fourth group has all of the descriptors of MDC file F, and therefore do not need to perform a collection step within such fourth group. Such a distribution from the first group to the fourth group is referred to herein as a &#x201c;group-to-group&#x201d; distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another scaled distribution implementation, an origin node distributes the descriptors of MDC file F to a first group of recipient nodes, such as in the above-described distribution step of the FastReplica distribution technique. Thereafter, the recipient nodes of the first group exchange their respective descriptors of MDC file F, such as in the above-described collection step of the FastReplica distribution technique. Thereafter, the recipient nodes of the first group may each act as an origin node to distribute MDC file F to further groups of recipient nodes in a manner such as that used to distribute the MDC file F to this first group, e.g., each node of the first group may use the FastReplica distribution technique to distribute MDC file F to further groups of recipient nodes. In this manner, the FastReplica distribution technique may be performed iteratively wherein after a group of nodes receives MDC file F through the FastReplica distribution technique, each of such nodes may act as an origin node to distribute file F to further groups of nodes using the FastReplica distribution technique. Thus, in this example implementation, each node that is used for distribution of MDC file F to further recipient nodes distributes the file F to a plurality of recipient nodes (e.g., to another group having a plurality of recipient nodes), and therefore such distribution technique may be referred to herein as a &#x201c;one-to-many&#x201d; distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As described further below, in certain distribution environments the second scaled distribution technique identified above results in a wider, shorter distribution tree than the first scaled distribution technique identified above. Accordingly, in those environments, the second scaled distribution technique provides improved efficiency in distributing MDC file F. In certain implementations described herein, a hybrid of the above-identified scaled distribution techniques may be used. For instance, &#x201c;one-to-many&#x201d; distributions may be performed for certain group(s) of recipient nodes, and &#x201c;group-to-group&#x201d; distribution may be performed for other group(s) of recipient nodes. Co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/345,718, titled &#x201c;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR EFFICIENTLY REPLICATING A FILE AMONG A PLURALITY OF RECIPIENTS HAVING IMPROVED SCALABILITY&#x201d;, the disclosure of which has been incorporated herein by reference, further describes scalable file distribution techniques that may be used for distribution of MDC descriptors in embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">To better appreciate aspects of embodiments of the present invention, it is appropriate to briefly review the existing techniques in the art for file distribution. Currently, the three most popular methods used for content distribution (or file &#x201c;replication&#x201d;) in the Internet environment are: (1) satellite distribution, (2) multicast distribution, and (3) application-level multicast distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With satellite distribution, the content distribution server (or the &#x201c;origin node&#x201d;) has a transmitting antenna. The servers (or &#x201c;recipient nodes&#x201d;) to which the content should be replicated (or the corresponding Internet Data centers, where the servers are located) have a satellite receiving dish. The original content distribution server broadcasts a file via a satellite channel. Among the shortcomings of the satellite distribution method are that it requires special hardware deployment and the supporting infrastructure (or service) is quite expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">With multicast distribution, an application can send one copy of each packet of a file and address it to the group of recipient nodes (IP addresses) that want to receive it. This technique reduces network traffic by simultaneously delivering a single stream of information to hundreds/thousands of interested recipients. Multicast can be implemented at both the data-link layer and the network layer. Applications that take advantage of multicast technologies include video conferencing, corporate communications, distance learning, and distribution of software, stock quotes, and news. Among the shortcomings of the multicast distribution method is that it requires a multicast support in routers, which still is not consistently available across the Internet infrastructure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Since the native IP multicast has not received widespread deployment, many industrial and research efforts have shifted to investigating and deploying the application level multicast, where nodes across the Internet act as intermediate routers to efficiently distribute content along a predefined mesh or tree. A growing number of researchers have advocated this alternative approach, where all multicast related functionality, including group management and packet replication, is implemented at end systems. In this architecture, nodes participating in the multicast group self-organize themselves into a scalable overlay structure using a distributed protocol. Further, the nodes attempt to optimize the efficiency of the overlay by adapting to changing network conditions and considering the application-level requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An extension for the end-system multicast is introduced by J. Byers, J. Considine, and M. Mitzenmacher in &#x201c;Informed Content Delivery Across Adaptive Overlay Networks&#x201d;, <i>Proc. Of ACM SIGCOMM, </i>2002, in which instead of using the end systems as routers forwarding the packets, the authors propose that the end-systems actively collaborate in an informed manner to improve the performance of large file distribution. The main idea is to overcome the limitation of the traditional service models based on tree topologies where the transfer rate to the client is defined by the bandwidth of the bottleneck link of the communication path from the origin server. The authors propose to use additional cross-connections between the end-systems to exchange the complementary content these nodes have already received. Assuming that any given pair of end-systems has not received exactly the same content, these cross-connections between the end-systems can be used to &#x201c;reconcile&#x201d; the differences in received content in order to reduce the total transfer time.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As mentioned above, embodiments of the present invention may implement a distribution technique referred to herein as the FastReplica distribution technique. Example embodiments implementing such FastReplica technique are described further below. Consider the following notations:

    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">The problem becomes replicating file F across nodes N<sub>1</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n</sub>, while minimizing the overall replication time. In one embodiment, the group of recipient nodes N<sub>1</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n </sub>is equal to the number m of descriptors of MDC file F (i.e., n=m), and n is a sufficiently small number of recipient nodes such that each node N<sub>0</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n </sub>can support concurrent communication connections to all of the other n&#x2212;1 nodes, which is typically 30 or less recipient nodes.

<p id="p-0052" num="0055">In another embodiment, a relatively small group of recipient nodes N<sub>1</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n </sub>exist (e.g., a sufficiently small number of recipient nodes such that each node N<sub>0</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n </sub>can support concurrent communication connections to all of the other n&#x2212;1 nodes, which is typically 30 or less recipient nodes), but the number of recipient nodes is greater than the number of descriptors of MDC file F (i.e., n&#x3e;m). In this embodiment, FastReplica in the Small may be implemented to perform a distribution step in which origin node N<sub>0 </sub>opens m concurrent network connections to nodes N<sub>1</sub>, . . . , N<sub>m </sub>(i.e., a &#x201c;sub-group&#x201d; of the group of n recipient nodes), and sends to each recipient node N<sub>i</sub>(1&#x2266;i&#x2266;m) the following items:

<p id="p-0053" num="0058">For example, suppose 20 recipient nodes exist (i.e., n=20) to which an MDC file having 4 descriptors (i.e., m=4) is to be distributed from origin node No. The m recipient nodes with which origin node No directly communicates may be referred to herein as a &#x201c;sub-group&#x201d; of the group of recipient nodes (i.e., a &#x201c;sub-group&#x201d; of the group of 20 recipient nodes in this example).

<p id="p-0055" num="0062">An example of one application of the distribution step of the FastReplica algorithm is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an example environment <b>100</b> in which embodiments of the present invention may be utilized. Environment <b>100</b> comprises origin node N<sub>0 </sub>and recipient nodes N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>3</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n-1</sub>, N<sub>n </sub>that are communicatively coupled via communication network <b>101</b>. Communication network <b>101</b> is preferably a packet-switched network, and in various implementations may comprise, as examples, the Internet or other Wide Area Network (WAN), an Intranet, Local Area Network (LAN), wireless network, Public (or private) Switched Telephony Network (PSTN), a combination of the above, or any other communications network now known or later developed within the networking arts that permits two or more computing devices to communicate with each other. In certain embodiments, nodes N<sub>0</sub>-N<sub>n </sub>comprise server computers. For instance, nodes N<sub>1</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n </sub>may comprise edge servers in a CDN or mirror servers within a mirrored network. In other embodiments, nodes N<sub>0</sub>-N<sub>n </sub>may comprise server and/or client computers. For example, node N<sub>0 </sub>may comprise a server computer, and nodes N<sub>1</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n </sub>may comprise client computers to receive an MDC file from node N<sub>0</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0063">Origin node N<sub>0 </sub>comprises MDC file F stored thereto, and such MDC file F is coded to comprise n complementary descriptors D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, . . . , D<sub>n-1</sub>, D<sub>n </sub>in this example. Thus, in this example, the number of descriptors of MDC file F is equal to the number of recipient nodes to which file F is to be distributed. As shown, the plurality of descriptors of MDC file F are distributed from origin node N<sub>0 </sub>to the recipient nodes N<sub>1</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n</sub>. More particularly, all of the n descriptors are communicated from origin node N<sub>0 </sub>to the recipient nodes N<sub>1</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n</sub>, but origin node N<sub>0 </sub>does not send all of the n descriptors to each recipient node. That is, origin node N<sub>0 </sub>sends only a portion of the n descriptors to each recipient node. For instance, in this example, each recipient node receives a different one of the n descriptors from origin node N<sub>0</sub>. More particularly, origin node N<sub>0 </sub>communicates descriptor D<sub>1 </sub>to node N<sub>1</sub>, descriptor D<sub>2 </sub>to node N<sub>2</sub>, descriptor D<sub>3 </sub>to node N<sub>3</sub>, . . . , descriptor D<sub>n-1 </sub>to node N<sub>n-1</sub>, and descriptor D<sub>n </sub>to node N<sub>n </sub>via communication network <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0064">Each of recipient nodes N<sub>1</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n </sub>may comprise a decoder <b>102</b> that is operable to decode the received descriptor(s) of MDC file F.

If any one of the descriptors of file F are received by a recipient node, baseline quality of file F can be decoded by the node's decoder <b>102</b>, and if additional ones of the descriptors are received, improved quality of file F can be decoded by the node's decoder <b>102</b>. MDC is a popular encoding technique for encoding images and streaming media, as examples, and thus in certain applications file F may comprise an image file or a streaming media file. Of course, in other applications file F may comprise any type of file that is encoded with MDC.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0065">The next step of the FastReplica algorithm is referred to herein as the &#x201c;collection&#x201d; step. An example of one implementation of the collection step is described herein in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. After receiving descriptor D<sub>i </sub>of MDC file F, node N<sub>i </sub>opens (n&#x2212;1) concurrent network connections to remaining nodes in the recipient group and sends descriptor D<sub>i </sub>to them, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> for node N<sub>1</sub>. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows that node N<sub>1 </sub>opens n&#x2212;1 concurrent network connections, i.e., one network connection with each of recipient nodes N<sub>2</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n</sub>. Node N<sub>1 </sub>communicates descriptor D<sub>1</sub>, which it received from origin node N<sub>0 </sub>in the above-described distribution step, to each of the recipient nodes N<sub>2</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0066">Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the set of incoming, concurrent connections to node N<sub>1 </sub>from the remaining recipient nodes N<sub>2</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n</sub>, transferring the complementary descriptors D<sub>2</sub>, . . . , D<sub>n </sub>of MDC file F to node N<sub>1 </sub>during the collection step of the FastReplica algorithm. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows that node N<sub>1 </sub>has n&#x2212;1 concurrent network connections, i.e., one network connection with each of recipient nodes N<sub>2</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n </sub>through which node N<sub>1 </sub>receives the other descriptors of MDC file F from the recipient nodes N<sub>2</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n</sub>. That is, each of recipient nodes N<sub>2</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n </sub>communicates to node N<sub>1 </sub>its respective descriptor of MDC file F that it received from origin node N<sub>0 </sub>in the above-described distribution step (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0067">Thus at the end of this collection step, each node N<sub>i </sub>has the following set of network connections:

    </ul>
    </li>

</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0070">Thus, at the end of this collection step, each recipient node receives all descriptors D<sub>1</sub>, . . . , D<sub>n </sub>of the MDC file F. Accordingly, each of the nodes in the replication set R obtain the full set of descriptors of MDC file F.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0071">In view of the above, it should be recognized that instead of the typical replication of an entire file to n nodes by using n communication paths connecting the origin node N<sub>0 </sub>to the replication group, the example FastReplica algorithm described above exploits n&#xd7;n different communication paths within the replication group wherein each path is used for transferring one of the n descriptors of MDC file F. Thus, the impact of congestion on any particular communication path participating in the schema is limited for a transfer of one of the n descriptors of MDC file F. Additionally, the example FastReplica algorithm described above takes advantage of both the upload and download bandwidth of the recipient nodes. Typical servers in CDN environments have symmetrical upload and download bandwidth to be able to utilize this feature. Such FastReplica algorithm and its efficiency for various types of bandwidths that may be available between the nodes is discussed further in co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser.

<p id="p-0063" num="0072">Another example application of the FastReplica algorithm is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0073">Origin node No comprises MDC file F stored thereto, and such MDC file F of the illustrated embodiment is coded to comprise <b>4</b> complementary descriptors D<sub>1</sub>, D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, D<sub>4 </sub>in this example. Thus, in this example, the number of descriptors of MDC file F is less than the number of recipient nodes to which file F is to be distributed. While 20 recipient nodes are shown in this example and 4 descriptors, the distribution technique described below for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4C</figref> may be utilized with other implementations that comprise any number n of recipient nodes and any number m of descriptors of MDC file F in which n is greater than m. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the plurality of descriptors of MDC file F are distributed from origin node N<sub>0 </sub>to a sub-group of the recipient nodes N<sub>1</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n</sub>, wherein such sub-group comprises nodes N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>4</sub>. In this example, each recipient node of the sub-group receives a different one of the 4 descriptors from origin node N<sub>0</sub>. More particularly, origin node N<sub>0 </sub>communicates descriptor D<sub>1 </sub>to node N<sub>1</sub>, descriptor D<sub>2 </sub>to node N<sub>2</sub>, descriptor D<sub>3 </sub>to node N<sub>3</sub>, and descriptor D<sub>4 </sub>to node N<sub>4 </sub>via communication network <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0074">The collection step of the FastReplica algorithm may then be performed in the manner described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 4C</figref>. In this example, k number of concurrent communication connections can be supported by each of the recipient nodes, wherein n&#x3c;k (i.e., the total number of recipient nodes, 20 in this example, is less than the number k of concurrent communication connections that can be supported by each of the recipient nodes). After receiving descriptor D<sub>i </sub>of MDC file F, node N<sub>i </sub>of the sub-group of recipient nodes opens n&#x2212;1 concurrent network connections (i.e., wherein n=20 in this example) to remaining nodes in the recipient group and sends descriptor D<sub>i </sub>to them, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> for node N<sub>1</sub>. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows that node N<sub>1 </sub>opens n&#x2212;1 concurrent network connections (or 19 concurrent network connections in this example), i.e., one network connection with each of recipient nodes N<sub>2</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n </sub>(where n=20 in this example). Node N<sub>1 </sub>communicates descriptor D<sub>1</sub>, which it received from origin node N<sub>0 </sub>in the above-described distribution step, to each of the recipient nodes N<sub>2</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n</sub>.

<p id="p-0066" num="0075">Similarly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> shows the set of incoming, concurrent connections to node N<sub>1 </sub>from the remaining recipient nodes N<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>4 </sub>of the sub-group of recipient nodes via which those nodes transfer their respective complementary descriptors D<sub>2</sub>, D<sub>3</sub>, D<sub>4 </sub>of MDC file F to node N<sub>1 </sub>during the collection step of the FastReplica algorithm. More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> shows that node N<sub>1 </sub>has m&#x2212;1 concurrent network connections (wherein m is the number of descriptors of MDC file F, which is 4 in this example), i.e., one network connection with each of recipient nodes N<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>3</sub>, N<sub>4 </sub>of the sub-group through which node N<sub>1 </sub>receives the other descriptors of MDC file F from those recipient nodes of the sub-group.

<p id="p-0070" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an example operational flow diagram for distributing an MDC file from an origin node to a plurality of recipient nodes in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In operational block <b>501</b>, a number m of descriptors of an MDC file F to be distributed is determined. More specifically, an origin node may determine the number m of descriptors of MDC file F that it is to distribute to recipient nodes. Typically, an MDC file comprises <b>10</b> or less descriptors, but any number m descriptors may be implemented for an MDC file within the scope of embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0080">In operational block <b>502</b>, the distribution step of the FastReplica technique is performed. More particularly, the descriptors of MDC file F are distributed from the origin node to at least a portion of the recipient nodes, wherein the origin node does not attempt to communicate all descriptors of the MDC file F to all of the recipient nodes. As shown, in certain embodiments block <b>502</b> may comprise operational block <b>502</b>A, wherein a different descriptor is distributed from the origin node to each recipient node. Of course, in certain embodiments, as described with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> above, the origin node may distribute the descriptors to a portion (e.g., sub-group) of the recipient nodes. For instance, if the total number n of recipient nodes is greater than the number m of descriptors, the origin node may determine a sub-group of the recipient nodes comprising m members to which the origin node distributes the descriptors of file F.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0081">In operational block <b>503</b>, the collection step of FastReplica is performed. More particularly, each recipient node that received a descriptor from the origin node communicates its descriptor to all other recipient nodes. Thus, as a result of such collection step, each recipient node obtains all of the determined number of descriptors of the MDC file F. In operational block <b>504</b>, scaling operations may be performed, if needed. That is, if the number of recipient nodes is sufficiently large, the distribution process may be scaled to enable distribution to such a large number of recipient nodes. For instance, the distribution technique may be scaled to allow for a file distribution to hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands, of recipient nodes, for example. More particularly, if it is determined that the number k of concurrent communication connections that can be supported by each of the nodes N<sub>0</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n </sub>is less than the total number of recipient nodes n, then the distribution technique may be scaled for distribution to a plurality of groups of recipient nodes as described further below. Various suitable scaling techniques may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0082">One scaling technique that may be implemented is described in co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/345,716, titled &#x201c;SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR EFFICIENTLY REPLICATING A FILE AMONG A PLURALITY OF RECIPIENTS&#x201d;, the disclosure of which has been incorporated herein by reference. This first scaling technique that may be implemented is described herein below in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>. According to this first scaling technique, the above-described FastReplica in the Small distribution strategy is generalized to a case in which a set of nodes to which MDC file F is to be distributed is very large (e.g., hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, or more of such recipient nodes). According to one example implementation of this scaling technique, let k be a number of network connections chosen for concurrent transfers between a single node and multiple recipient nodes (k limits the number of nodes in each distribution group for the above-described FastReplica strategy). An appropriate value of k can be experimentally determined for a given environment via probing, for example. Heterogeneous nodes might be capable of supporting a different number of connections, in which case the value of k may be a number of connections suitable for most of the nodes in the overall replication set.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0084">First, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, origin node N<sub>0 </sub>opens m concurrent network connections to nodes N<sub>l</sub><sup>1</sup>, . . . , N<sub>m</sub><sup>1 </sup>of group G<sup>1</sup>, wherein m corresponds to the number of descriptors of MDC file F and wherein m is less than or equal to k. Generally, m is less than k because MDC files are typically encoded with no more than 10 descriptors and each node of a network (e.g., CDN) is often capable of supporting more than 10 concurrent connections. As with the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> above, the origin node communicates descriptor D<sub>i </sub>to the corresponding recipient node N<sub>i</sub><sup>1</sup>(1&#x2266;i&#x2266;m), such that the origin node distributes descriptors to a sub-group of m recipient nodes.

Thus, in the first iteration, origin node N<sub>0 </sub>distributes a plurality of descriptors of MDC file F to at least a portion of nodes N<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>, N<sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup>, . . . , N<sub>k</sub><sup>1 </sup>of first group G<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>, and then the recipient nodes that received a descriptor from origin node N<sub>0 </sub>further communicate their respective descriptors to the others of nodes N<sub>1</sub><sup>1</sup>, N<sub>2</sub><sup>1</sup>, . . . , N<sub>k</sub><sup>1 </sup>(i.e., perform a collection step) such that all of the recipient nodes of the first group G<sub>1</sub><sup>1 </sup>obtain all descriptors of MDC file F. Such first group G<sub>1</sub><sup>1 </sup>may be referred to herein as a first-level group of nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0113">At the second iteration, each node N<sub>i</sub><sup>1</sup>(1&#x2266;i&#x2266;k) of group G<sub>1</sub><sup>1 </sup>can serve as an origin node propagating MDC file F to the nodes of other groups G<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>, G<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, . . . , G<sub>k</sub><sup>2</sup>. Such groups G<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>, G<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, . . . , G<sub>k</sub><sup>2 </sup>may be referred to herein as second-level groups of nodes. For instance, node N<sub>1</sub><sup>1 </sup>of first-level group G<sub>1</sub><sup>1 </sup>distributes the descriptors of MDC file F to the recipient nodes of second-level group G<sub>1</sub><sup>2 </sup>in a manner similar to that described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> for origin node N<sub>0 </sub>communicating descriptors to recipient nodes. In other words, node N<sub>1</sub><sup>1 </sup>of first-level group G<sub>1</sub><sup>1 </sup>performs a distribution step to distribute a plurality of descriptors of MDC file F to at least a portion of the recipient nodes of second-level group G<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>. Thereafter, the recipient nodes that received a descriptor from acting origin node N<sub>1</sub><sup>1 </sup>further communicate their respective descriptors to the other nodes of group G<sub>1</sub><sup>2 </sup>(i.e., perform a collection step) such that all of the recipient nodes of group G<sub>1</sub><sup>2 </sup>obtain all descriptors of MDC file F.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0114">Similarly, each other node N<sub>1</sub><sup>2</sup>, . . . , N<sub>k</sub><sup>1 </sup>of first-level group G<sub>1</sub><sup>1 </sup>may concurrently (in itcration 2) distribute MDC file F to second level groups G<sub>2</sub><sup>2</sup>, . . . , G<sub>k</sub><sup>2</sup>, respectively, in a similar manner to that described above for distribution from node N<sub>1</sub><sup>1 </sup>to group G<sub>1</sub><sup>2 </sup>(e.g., using the above-described FastReplica distribution technique). This distribution technique may be referred to herein as an iterative &#x201c;one-to-many&#x201d; distribution technique, as each node of each group at each level may act as an origin node to distribute MDC file F to many nodes comprising a group at a next level.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0115">In view of the above, in two iterations, MDC file F can be replicated to k&#xd7;k nodes using this iterative one-to-many distribution technique.

where r&#x3c;k, then there is one &#x201c;incomplete&#x201d; group &#x11c; with r nodes in it. A preferred way to deal with this group when using this second scaling algorithm is to arrange it to be a leaf-group in the shortest subtree. So, assuming for instance that such an incomplete group exists in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it would be arranged in the third level of the distribution tree such that group G<sub>2</sub><sup>2 </sup>of the second level would act as complete group G&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> for communicating the subfiles to the nodes of the incomplete group &#x11c;.
</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0120">For example, let G&#x2032;={N<sub>1</sub>&#x2032;, . . . , N&#x2032;<sub>k</sub>} be a complete replication group in the shortest subtree. Further, let incomplete group &#x11c;={{circumflex over (N)}<sub>1, </sub>. . . {circumflex over (N)}<sub>r</sub>} where r&#x3c;k. The communications between groups G&#x2032; and &#x11c; may follow a slightly different file exchange protocol than that described above in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> for communicating MDC file F from a node of one group to the nodes of another group. Suppose that all of the nodes in G&#x2032; have already received all descriptors D<sub>1</sub>, . . . , D<sub>m </sub>of MDC file F (e.g., when performing iteration 2 in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, all of the nodes of group G<sub>1</sub><sup>1 </sup>have received all of descriptors D<sub>1</sub>, . . . , D<sub>m </sub>of MDC file F, as such descriptors were received in the first iteration). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, each node N<sub>i</sub>&#x2032; of a sub-group of m nodes of complete group G&#x2032; opens r concurrent network connections to all r nodes of group G&#x2032; for transferring its respective descriptor D<sub>i</sub>. In this way, at the end of this step, each node of group &#x11c; has all descriptors D<sub>1</sub>, . . . , D<sub>m </sub>of MDC file F. This step may be referred to herein as a special step. It should be recognized that this special step corresponds to the &#x201c;group-to-group&#x201d; type of distribution utilized in the first scaling technique described above. Thus, in certain implementations, if a group of recipient nodes is not complete (i.e., does not have k nodes), then the group-to-group distribution technique of the first example scaled distribution may be utilized for communicating the MDC file F to such incomplete group. Accordingly, in certain embodiments, a hybrid of the first example scaling technique described above and the second example scaling technique described above may be utilized. More particularly, both the above-described group-to-group distribution technique and the above-described one-to-many distribution technique may be employed in certain implementations of the scaled distribution algorithm. For instance, the one-to-many distribution technique may be used for all complete groups having k nodes, and the group-to-group distribution technique may be used for any incomplete group that has less than k nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0121">As an example, let k=10 (i.e., 10 concurrent communication connections are determined to be suitable for use between the nodes) and let the number of descriptors m of MDC file F be no more than 10 (i.e., m&#x2266;k). How many algorithm iterations are required to replicate the MDC file F to 1000 nodes using the second scaled distribution technique described above? Using Equation 2 above, the following representation for 1000 nodes can be derived: 1000=10&#xd7;10<sup>2</sup>. Thus, in three algorithm iterations (10&#xd7;10&#xd7;10), the original file F can be replicated among all 1000 nodes. At each iteration, the replication process follows the above-described FastReplica in the Small distribution technique, i.e., each iteration has 2 steps (a distribution step and a collection step).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0122">Taking into account the nature of MDC (i.e., that any description received by the recipient node can be used to decode the baseline quality video), the reliability of the scaled FastReplica algorithm may be enhanced when distributing MDC files. For instance, when using the first scaling technique described above for distributing a media file encoded with MDC, even if failed nodes exist in the distribution tree, this first scaled FastReplica technique may provide a suitable distribution technique because receipt by nodes below the failed node(s) in the distribution tree of a portion of the descriptions (from the working nodes of the higher level) will be enough to decode a baseline quality file. That is, when using a group-to-group distribution technique, if one of the nodes in a first group responsible for distributing a particular descriptor to the nodes of a second group fails, then the nodes of the second group will not receive this particular descriptor. However, the nodes of the second group will still receive the descriptors from the working nodes of the first group, and with MDC encoding, such portion of the total number of descriptors is sufficient to enable the nodes of the second group to decode the MDC file. Thus, service providers also may determine which of the above-described scaling techniques of FastReplica to utilize based on the content reliability requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0123">Furthermore, in certain embodiments, techniques may be implemented for improving the reliability of the distribution technique in the event that one or more recipient nodes fail. That is, techniques may be implemented for improving the distribution technique in a manner that ensures non-failed nodes receive as many descriptors as possible (to ensure that a high-quality version of the MDC file is received by the non-failed nodes). Example techniques for improving the reliability of the first scalable distribution algorithm described above (with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-9</figref>) to account for failed nodes that may be implemented with embodiments of the present invention are disclosed in co-pending and commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser.

<p id="p-0104" num="0124">As mentioned briefly above, in certain implementations the first and second scaling techniques of FastReplica may be combined in a hybrid strategy to result in using an optimal size distribution tree. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12B</figref>, an example operational flow diagram for distributing an MDC file to a plurality of recipient nodes in a scalable fashion in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>, operation of this example embodiment starts with operational block <b>1201</b>, whereat a suitable number k of communication connections that can be concurrently established from any one of a plurality of nodes N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n </sub>to which an MDC file F is to be distributed to any other of the plurality of nodes is determined. In operational block <b>1202</b> it is determined whether k is less than the total number n of recipient nodes to which file F is to be distributed. If k is not less than the total number n of recipient nodes, then operation advances to block <b>1203</b> whereat all n of the recipient nodes are grouped into a first group of nodes. Then, in operational block <b>1204</b>, k is set equal to n. That is, the number of concurrent communication connections that is established from any one of the nodes during distribution is set to n. Operation then advances from block <b>1204</b> to operational block <b>1210</b>, which is described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0125">If, at operational block <b>1202</b>, it is determined that k is less than the total number n of recipient nodes, then operation advances to block <b>1205</b> whereat the first k number of recipient nodes N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, . . . , N<sub>n </sub>(i.e., nodes N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, . . . , N<sub>k</sub>) are grouped into a first group of nodes. Then, in operational block <b>1206</b> it is determined whether at least k recipient nodes remain ungrouped. If there are fewer than k recipient nodes remaining to be grouped, then operation advances to block <b>1207</b> whereat the remaining r recipient nodes (r&#x3c;k) are grouped to an incomplete group &#x11c;. Operation then advances from block <b>1207</b> to operational block <b>1210</b>, which is described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0126">If, at operational block <b>1206</b>, it is determined that at least k recipient nodes remain ungrouped, operation advances to block <b>1208</b> whereat the next k number of recipient nodes are grouped into a next group. Then, in operational block <b>1209</b>, it is determined whether any recipient nodes remain ungrouped. If more recipient nodes do remain ungrouped, then operation returns to block <b>1206</b> to continue the logical grouping of the recipient nodes. If it is determined at operational block <b>1209</b> that no further recipient nodes remain ungrouped, then operation advances to block <b>1210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0127">At operational block <b>1210</b>, m concurrent communication connections are established from origin node N<sub>0 </sub>to a sub-group of m recipient nodes of the first group of nodes, wherein m is the number of descriptors of MDC file F and is no greater than k (i.e., m&#x2266;k). That is, origin node No may determine the number m of descriptors of MDC file F and may logically group m recipient nodes of the first group into a sub-group, and origin node No may establish concurrent communication connections with the m recipient nodes of such sub-group. In operational block <b>1211</b>, the distribution step is performed in which origin node N<sub>0 </sub>communicates all of the m descriptors of MDC file F to the sub-group of recipient nodes of the first group, wherein each recipient node of the sub-group receives a different descriptor (as in the distribution step of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> described above). Then, in operational block <b>1212</b>, the collection step is performed in which the sub-group of recipient nodes of the first group each communicate its respective descriptor to the other nodes of the first group such that each recipient node of the first group obtains all m descriptors of file F (as in the collection step of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B-4C</figref> described above). Preferably, each node of the sub-group establishes k&#x2212;1 concurrent communication connections with the other of nodes N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, . . . , N<sub>k </sub>to communicate the descriptor that it received from origin node N<sub>0 </sub>in block <b>1211</b> to those other nodes concurrently.</p>

In block <b>1217</b>, for each complete group remaining, a different node of the first group is assigned as an origin node to such complete group, wherein the assigned nodes of the first group each performs a one-to-many distribution to the recipient nodes of its assigned distribution group (and the nodes within each recipient group perform a collection step to obtain all of the descriptors of MDC file F), as discussed above with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. In operational block <b>1218</b>, it is determined whether an incomplete group &#x11c; remains to have MDC file F distributed thereto. If not, then operation ends in block <b>1220</b>.

<p id="p-0112" num="0132">In view of the above, the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A-12B</figref> provide an implementation of a scalable distribution technique that may use both group-to-group distribution (e.g., for incomplete groups) and one-to-many distribution.

<p id="p-0113" num="0133">It should be recognized that while recipient nodes are referred to above as being logically grouped into groups or sub-groups, such logical groupings may exist only for distribution of an MDC file F in certain embodiments.

For instance, different distributions (of other MDC files at other times) may comprise different logical groupings of the recipient nodes.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0134">Various elements for performing the above-described file distribution functions of embodiments of the present invention may be implemented in software, hardware, firmware, or a combination thereof.

As another example, network interfaces may be used to concurrently communicate descriptors of an MDC file from an origin node to recipient nodes of a distribution group (e.g., in the distribution step of FastReplica), as well as for communication of such descriptors between recipient nodes of the distribution group (e.g., in the collection step of FastReplica).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0135">When implemented via computer-executable instructions, various elements of embodiments of the present invention for distributing MDC file F from an origin node to recipient nodes are in essence the software code defining the operations of such various elements.
