<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) from the following Korean Patent Applications filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office: (1) Serial No. 2007-0004166 filed on Jan. 15, 2007; (2) Serial no. 2007-0046076 filed on May 11, 2007; and (3) Serial no. 2007-0056394 filed on Jun. 9, 2007, the entire contents of each aforementioned disclosure are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a digital right management (DRM) system. More particularly, the present invention relates to a rights objects acquisition method of a mobile terminal in a digital right management system that is capable of delivering multiple rights objects to a mobile terminal simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the recent tendency toward digital convergence, mobile terminals are evolving into multifunctional devices. For example, the functionality of mobile terminals now may include capabilities such as MP3 players and digital broadcast players by incorporating MP3 and digital broadcast tuner modules. Such multimedia-enabled mobile terminals may also support various multimedia services, such as wireless Internet access, online games, Music On Demand (MOD), and Video On Demand (VOD). The ongoing diversification of the mobile services and the terminal capabilities continue to expand the utilizations of mobile terminals. The mobile content business has also expanded to include enabling the provision of various types of mobile contents including ringtones, motion pictures, music files, and games, many of which are valuable copyrighted materials. Since these mobile contents are typically delivered to end users as pay contents, there is a need to protect the contents from theft and prying eyes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Digital Rights Management (DRM) now plays an ever-increasing role to protect the pay contents from mobile terminal service providers and used in mobile terminals from piracy and illegal copying. DRM is specifically provides a controlled consumption of digital contents, such as documents, audio files including voice and music files and ring tones, video files, and games to protect the intellectual property right of the authors and the content providers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Although DRM content object can be freely downloaded, it is useless to a user without a usage right, because without the corresponding Rights Object (RO), the material cannot be accessed since the DRM content objects are encrypted with a specific license key.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The RO is a container used in the Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) DRM system, which is an open DRM standard invented by the Open Mobile Alliance, for carrying the license key to decrypt the corresponding DRM object. The RO is issued by a Right Issuer (RI) and purchased by the end user. Since the digital content and corresponding RO are delivered in a detached manner (typically separately), the usage of the downloaded content is restricted to the user acquiring the corresponding RO. The RO is a collection of Permission, Constraints, and other attributes that define under what circumstances access is granted to a particular user, and what usages are defined for, DRM content object. Typically, the usage constraints include Count, DateTime, Interval, Timed-Count, Accumulated, and Individual. The constraints are stored in a specific field of the RO.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, the RO may specify the usage for an MP3 file with the count constraint value set to &#x201c;10&#x201d;. In this case, the MP3 file can be played 10 times and the count is decremented by 1 each time the MP3 file is played. If the count reaches &#x201c;0&#x201d;, the usage right on the MP3 file is exhausted. In order to maintain the usage right on the MP3 file, the corresponding RO should be updated.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b</i>, a mobile terminal <b>101</b> transmits a content request message (<b>105</b>) to content server <b>102</b>, and the content server <b>102</b> transmits a corresponding content in response to the content request message <b>106</b>. In a case where the requested content is a DRM protected content, the content is encrypted with an encryption key and with a scheme specified by the DRM, and transmitted in a DRM format having the constraints (e.g., usage rule, the number of times to be played, and duration). If a user request for acquiring the license for the downloaded content is detected, the mobile terminal <b>101</b> transmits a license request message <b>107</b> to a Right Issuer (RI) <b>103</b>, and the RI <b>103</b> transmits the corresponding license <b>108</b> to the mobile terminal <b>101</b> in response to the license request message. Here, the license is a usage right on the content which includes a decryption key and usage constraint information. In the case of a DRM content object, the mobile terminal <b>101</b> should acquire the usage right for consuming the content. Accordingly, the RI <b>103</b> checks whether the identity of the user of the mobile terminal <b>101</b> is valid. If it is determined that the user is valid, the RI <b>103</b> transmits the license to the mobile terminal <b>101</b>. If the license is received from the RI <b>103</b>, the mobile terminal <b>101</b> is capable of playing/accessing the content by using the license. Typically, the decryption key and usage constraint information are extracted from the license by a DRM client application installed in the mobile terminal <b>101</b>. The content is decrypted by using the decryption key and played under the usage constraints specified in the license.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows an OMA DRM version 1.0 system in which the DRM RO containing a non-encrypted content encryption key (CEK) is delivered from the RI server <b>103</b> to the mobile terminal <b>101</b>. In the OMA DRM version 1.0 system, there are serious shortcomings in that the content can be acquired and distributed by an unauthorized user who obtained the DRM Content Format (DCF) and RO (i.e., the license of the corresponding DRM content), simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>shows an OMA DRM version 2.0 system in which an authentication authority <b>104</b> (for example, Content Management Licensing Administrator: CMLA) is introduced. The CMLA <b>104</b> transfers the content encryption keys CEK <b>109</b> and <b>110</b>, which are encrypted with a public key, to the mobile terminal <b>101</b> and the RI <b>103</b>, respectively, and the RI <b>103</b> transfers the RO contained the encrypted CEK to the mobile terminal <b>101</b>. Accordingly, in the OMA DRM version 2.0 system, the content can be decrypted only in the mobile terminal <b>101</b> having the CEK, resulting in reinforcement of usage right protection.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the conventional OMA DRM version 2.0 system, however, each content is individually protected by one RO, whereby the RO acquisition process, especially when acquiring multiple ROs, is laborious and time-consuming. For example, extending the validity of a number of ROs for expired MP3, video, and game files requires multiple RO purchasing processes, resulting a great degree of user inconvenience. Thus, there is a need in the art for a more user convenient method that provides effective protection of content.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a configuration of a mobile terminal according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> includes a control unit <b>201</b>, an audio processing unit <b>204</b>, an input unit <b>205</b>, a radio frequency (RF) unit <b>206</b>, a data processing unit <b>207</b>, a memory unit <b>208</b>, a camera unit <b>209</b>, a video processing unit <b>210</b>, and a display unit <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The control unit <b>201</b> controls general operations of the mobile terminal <b>200</b> and cooperative signaling between the internal elements of the mobile terminal <b>200</b>. In other words, the control unit <b>201</b> controls the cooperative signaling among the audio processing unit <b>204</b>, input unit <b>205</b>, data processing unit <b>207</b>, memory unit <b>208</b>, camera unit <b>209</b>, video processing unit <b>210</b>, and display unit <b>211</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">If a play command is detected, the control unit <b>201</b> checks information on the target DRM content file (e.g., DCF file) and performs a series of processes for decoding and playing the DRM content file.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For example, the control unit <b>201</b> checks ROs stored in the memory unit <b>208</b> when an access to the content is detected or a value of a specific constraint contained in the RO becomes unavailable. In a case of an available RO is retrieved, the DRM content can be played.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the audio processing unit <b>204</b> converts audio data into an analog signal and outputs the analog signal through a speaker (SPK) in the form of an audible sound wave and converts the analog signal input through a microphone (MIC) into audio data.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The input unit <b>205</b> can be implemented, for example, with at least one of a keypad and a touch panel including a plurality of alphanumeric keys for inputting text and numeric data and a plurality of function keys for executing various functions of the mobile terminal <b>200</b>. The input unit <b>205</b> receives a key input and outputs an input signal corresponding to the key input to the control unit <b>201</b>. The control unit <b>201</b> executes a task indicated by the input signal.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The RF unit <b>206</b> is responsible for radio communication with a cellular network or any other type of wireless communication network. The RF unit <b>206</b> includes an RF transmitter for up-converting and amplifying the signal to be transmitted and an RF receiver for low-noise amplifying and down-converting the received signal.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The data processing unit <b>207</b> includes a transmission portion for encoding and modulating a signal to be transmitted through the RF unit <b>205</b> and a reception portion for demodulating and decoding the signal received through the RF unit <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The memory unit <b>208</b> includes a program memory region and a data memory region. The program memory region stores the operating system for booting up the mobile terminal <b>200</b> and application programs. The data memory region stores user data with the execution of the applications. The user data can be copied from an external storage such as portable memory and hard disc or downloaded from a remote server or other mobile terminal through a wired or wireless communication channel. Particularly, the user data include DRM contents.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The camera unit <b>209</b> converts an image projected on a lens into an optical signal and converts the optical signal into a digital signal. The video processing unit <b>210</b> converts the digital signal output by the camera unit <b>209</b> into a video signal for generating screen data.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The display unit <b>211</b> displays the screen data output by the video processing unit <b>210</b>. The display unit <b>211</b> is implemented with a flat panel display, such as a liquid crystal display (LCD) having a touchscreen function. In this case, the display unit <b>211</b> can be a part of the input unit <b>206</b>. When a content is used to the usage limit of a constraint contained in the corresponding RO, the display unit <b>211</b> may display a RO package acquisition solicitation message under the control of the control unit <b>201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Although the mobile terminal is described above with the structure depicted in the exemplary drawings, it will be understood that at least one of the internal units of the mobile terminal may be omitted, or replaced by another functional unit. In addition at least another functional unit not shown in the drawings, may be added to the mobile terminal. In other words the functional units could be fewer or greater than those shown in the examples, and may have different functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">For example, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> may provided with a memory slot for receiving external storage media such as memory card, a short range communication module such as Infrared Data Association (IrDA) and Bluetooth, multimedia module such as MP3 module, electronic transaction module such as mobile banking chip and traffic card chip, broadcast receiver module, data communication port for exchanging data with other devices, battery module, and power charging module.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>is a flowchart illustrating an example of a rights object acquisition method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, a mobile terminal, such as, for example, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, operates in an idle mode (S<b>301</b>). While operating in the idle mode, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> determines whether a DRM content execution mode has been activated (S<b>303</b>). The DRM content execution mode is activated when an access event (consumption, update, or purchase) to a specific DRM content object is detected.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">If a DRM content execution mode is activated at step (S<b>303</b>), the mobile terminal generates a DRM content object list in response to a DRM RO acquisition command input by the terminal user <b>150</b> (S<b>305</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The DRM content objects are encrypted multimedia files to which corresponding ROs are not acquired or nearly expired in association with their constraints.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In order to generate the DRM content object list (S<b>305</b>), the terminal generates a RO Acquisition Protocol (ROAP) trigger request (common rights object acquisition request) message for requesting information on the DRM content objects selected or approved by the terminal user <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The ROAP trigger request message includes a content identifier (CID, contentID) of at least one DRM content object. The ROAP trigger request message may further include at least one of a device identifier (DeID) of the mobile terminal <b>200</b>, permissions of individual ROs, and constraints for restricting the permissions.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Permissions are actual usages or activities allowed over protected content. For example, in the case of content granted only, the &#x201c;display&#x201d; permission can be only displayed, and the content granted the &#x201c;display&#x201d; and &#x201c;print&#x201d; permissions can be displayed and printed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The mobile terminal <b>200</b> generates an ROAP trigger request message containing the DRM content list and sends the ROAP trigger request message to the RI. In this exemplary embodiment, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> is connected through at least one wired or wireless communication networks.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The RI generates a ROAP trigger (a common rights object acquisition response) message with reference to the CIDs of the contents listed in the ROAP trigger request message and transmits the ROAP trigger message to the mobile terminal <b>200</b>. At this time, costs for purchasing the contents are contained in the ROAP trigger message. The ROAP trigger message contains at least one of the RO identifier (roID) assigned to the content. The ROAP trigger message may contain at least one rights object acquisition address of the content (roapURL) element, RI identifier (RIID), RI Alias, Domain ID, Domain Alias, and Nonce. The Nonce element is a random value of 32 or 64 bits assigned by the RI.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The control unit <b>201</b> receives the ROAP trigger message and generates the DRM content list composed of contents. At this time, the control unit <b>201</b> displays purchasing cost information on the screen of the display unit <b>211</b> for obtaining user consent.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this exemplary embodiment, the RI generates and sends a ROAP trigger message referencing RO identifiers assigned to ROs corresponding individual contents. The mobile terminal <b>200</b> requests to RI an ROAP trigger message for multiple contents through the ROAP trigger request message.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>, after generating the DRM contents list at step S<b>305</b>, the control unit <b>201</b> generates an RO Request message for acquiring ROs corresponding to the contents listed in the DRM contents list (S<b>307</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The RO Request message contains roIDs assigned to the ROs corresponding to the contents. The roIDs can be extracted from the ROAP trigger message received from the RI in response to the ROAP trigger request message. The RO Request message also contains parameters such as DeID, RIID, Nonce, request time, RO Information (RO Info), certificate chain, signature, and extensions.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Table 2 shows an exemplary RO Request message format according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. In Table 2, the RO Request message contains roIDs (ro11, ro53, and ro97) of three contents selected by the user and a nonce identical with that contained in the ROAP trigger message. The roIDs also are contained the ROAP trigger message received from the RI.</p>

The ROAP Trigger Request message is sent to the RI URL.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">In order to send the ROAP Trigger Request message, a DCF structure has an additional field indicating the address of the RI <b>250</b> for acquiring multiple ROs in a composite manner.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a diagram illustrating a structure of DCF proposed for the rights object acquisition method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a BatchRIURL <b>1310</b> is an address of RI which is issuing a multiple RO, and a BatchRIURLLength <b>1320</b> indicates a length of the BatchRIURL <b>1310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">The BatchRIURLLength <b>1320</b> is optional information, so as not to be included in the DCF structure.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">At least one BatchRIURL is included in a DCF structure. The greater a number of BatchRIURL is, the more the ROs content objects can be sent.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">For example, if a content A includes a BatchRIURL A and a content B includes a BatchRIURL B, it can be difficult to acquire the ROs of the contents A and B in a composite manner. However, if the BatchRIURLs A and B are included in the content A, the ROs of the contents A and B can be acquired in a composite manner since the common RI address B from which the ROs of the two contents A and B can be acquired exist.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In a case that at least two BatchRIURLs exist from which ROs of the content objects can be acquired, a BatchRIURL having a best quality and reliability (for example, an address of the RI servicing at higher data rate or a superior capability) can be selected. For this purpose, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> manages the BatchRIURLs or equivalent information of the content objects in the form of a list or a database.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The BatchRIURL field can be added within the common header of the DCF structure as a mandatory field or included in an extended header field, which is mandatory field, located in the common header.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Also, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> may select an RI for acquiring ROs of the DRM content objects in a composite manner with reference to the RI URLs stored in the memory unit <b>208</b> and send an ROAP Trigger Request message including the selected RI URL. Also, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> may request an RI URL for receiving ROs of the DRM content objects to the RI <b>250</b> and send an ROAP Trigger Request message to the RI URL received from the RI <b>250</b>. The RI URL received from the RI <b>250</b> is typically stored within the memory unit <b>208</b> and uses for acquiring the ROs in a composite manner later.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">In response to the ROAP Trigger Request message, the RI <b>250</b> generates a ROAP Trigger message and sends the ROAP Trigger message to the mobile terminal <b>200</b> (S<b>920</b>). The ROAP Trigger message may include price information on the ROs of the content objects indicated by the ROAP Trigger Request message. Also, the ROAP Trigger message may include one or more roIDs to identify the ROs corresponding to the content objects. The ROAP trigger message may include at least one of roapURL, RI ID, RI Alias, Domain ID, Domain Alias, and Nonce.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The ROAP Trigger request message and ROAP Trigger message can be sent in the form a HTTP GET or a HTTP POST (see RO acquisition mechanism of OMA DRM v2.0). In a multiple RO acquisition method for acquiring multiple ROs simultaneously, the message length may increase, whereby HTTP POST prefers to send the ROAP messages.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In addition, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> may display the price information on the screen for user reference.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">If the RO Trigger message is received, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> generates an RO Request message for requesting one or more ROs corresponding to the DRM content objects and sends the RO Request message to the RI <b>250</b> (S<b>930</b>). The ROs may be identical with those indicated in the RO Trigger Request message or may not be identical with those indicated in the RO trigger Request message. That is, the DRM content objects for which ROs are to be acquired may be changed by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">If the RO Request message is received, the RI <b>250</b> generates an RO Response message containing the ROs indicated in the RO Request message and sends the RO Response to the mobile terminal (S<b>940</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Consequently, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> can acquire the ROs by extracting the ROs contained in the RO Response message in a batch processing manner.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The procedure (S<b>910</b> to S<b>940</b>) can be applied in an abnormal situation. For example, if the DCF of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> includes an abnormal header such as a Silent header, or a Preview header for carrying free contents without user interaction for payment and purchase approval, the RO acquisition procedure S<b>910</b> to S<b>940</b> may be progressed as a background operation under the negotiation between the mobile terminal <b>200</b> and RI <b>250</b>. In this case, address information for acquiring a multiple of ROs such as a silent group URL (silent-group-url) may included in the abnormal header such that the mobile terminal <b>200</b> can access to the RI with reference to the silent group URL to acquire the DCF files, i.e. the ROs of the DRM content objects.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">For the background execution of the RO acquisition procedure, permissions, constraints, and purchase information are selectively included in the DCF structure in addition to the silent header.

The constraints are dependent on the individual permissions. The purchase information may include prices of the content objects and contract policies such as a fixed charge system and a metering-based charge system.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">The silent group URL, permissions, constraints, and purchase information can be included in additional parts for allowing the user to the parameters therein, or in mandatory parts for protecting the parameters from being tampered. The RO Response message may further include a Session ID for establishing a session between the mobile terminal <b>200</b> and the RI <b>250</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, if an RO acquisition command is input for acquiring ROs corresponding to one or more DRM content object, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> generates an ROAP Trigger Request message and sends the ROAP Trigger Request message to the RI <b>250</b> (S<b>1010</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">The ROAP Trigger Request message includes one or more DRM content identifiers (CIDs). Also, the ROAP Trigger Request message also includes at least one of the device identifier (DeID) of the mobile terminal <b>200</b> and constraints for restricting the usage rights of the selected content objects. The DRM content objects are either the content objects received from another mobile terminal or downloaded from a server or the content objects of which right objects has expired or are close to expires.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Here, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> selects an RI for purchasing the ROs corresponding to the DRM content objects with reference to the RI URL information and sends the ROAP Trigger Request message to the selected RI.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">If the ROAP Trigger Request message is received, the RI <b>250</b> generates an ROAP Trigger message and sends the ROAP Trigger message to the mobile terminal <b>200</b>. The ROAP Trigger message includes the price information on the ROs corresponding to the content objects indicated by the ROAP Trigger Request message. The ROAP Trigger message further includes roIDs assigned to the individual ROs. The ROAP Trigger message further includes at least one of RI ID, RI Alias, Domain ID, Domain Alias, and Nonce.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">If the RO Trigger message is received, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> generates an RO Request message for requesting one or more ROs corresponding to the DRM content objects and sends the RO Request message to the RI <b>250</b> (S<b>1030</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In response to the RO Request message, the RI <b>250</b> generates an RO Response message containing the ROs indicated in the RO Request message and sends the RO Response to the mobile terminal (S<b>1040</b>). The RO Response message may include a session ID.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">If the RO Response message is received, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> extracts the ROs from the RO Response message. In a case that a session ID is included in the RO response message, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> establishes a session with the RI <b>250</b> on the basis of the session ID and sends a RO Confirm Request message to the RI <b>250</b> through the session (S<b>5050</b>). Since the RO Confirm Request message includes a parameter such as &#x201c;RO Confirm Info&#x201d;, the RI <b>250</b> is acknowledged the successful RO acquisition.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Upon receiving the RO Confirm Request message, the RI <b>250</b> checks that the requested ROs are successfully issued and determines whether to end the session or resend the RO Response message. If the parameter &#x201c;RO Confirm Info&#x201d; is included in the RO Confirm Request message, the RI <b>250</b> determines that the ROs are successfully issued and thus send an RO Confirm Response message to the mobile terminal <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The RO acquisition method of the present invention can be implemented without BatchRIURL in the DCF structure.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a message flow diagram illustrating a rights object acquisition method according to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention.

<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, if a multiple RO acquisition command is input by the terminal user, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> generates a ROAP Trigger Request message containing CIDs of individual DRM content objects and sends the ROAP Trigger Request message to the RI <b>250</b>. Here, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> sends the ROAP Trigger Request message to the RI <b>205</b> with reference to an RI URL of one of multiple DRM content objects.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">If the RI <b>250</b> received the ROAP Trigger Request message has no multiple RO transmission capability, the RI <b>250</b> sends a Redirection message notifying a new URL of another RI, which has the multiple RO transmission capability, to the mobile terminal <b>200</b> (S<b>1220</b>). The redirection message can be one, for example, of HTTP <b>302</b>, HTTP <b>303</b>, and HTTP <b>307</b> messages proposed in OMA DRM.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">If the Redirection message is received, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> sends the ROAP Trigger Request message to the RI <b>300</b> indicated by the RI URL contained in the Redirection message (S<b>1230</b>). Accordingly, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> acquires the ROs from the RI <b>300</b> through the procedure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">As described above, the ROAP Trigger Request message and ROAP Trigger message can be exchanged in the form of HTTP GET or HTTP POST message.

<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the if a multiple RO acquisition command is input by the user, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> generates a ROAP Trigger Request message containing a CIDs of individual DRM content objects and sends the ROAP Trigger Request message to the RI <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">After transmitting the ROAP Trigger Request message, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> and RI <b>250</b> initiate a web transaction. At this time, the user can configure the permissions of ROs corresponding to the content objects together with constraints. For example, if the RI <b>250</b> publishes prices of the ROs associated with the content objects, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> generates acquisition request information on the ROs approved by the user and sends the acquisition request information to the RI <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">After the web transaction has completed by user's approval, the RI <b>250</b> generates an ROAP Trigger message associated with the ROs to be acquired and sends the ROAP Trigger message to the mobile terminal <b>200</b> (S<b>1430</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">If the ROAP Trigger message is received, the mobile terminal <b>200</b> generates an RO Request message for acquiring the ROs and sends the RO Request message to the RI <b>250</b> (S<b>1440</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Although the web transaction is performed after the ROAP Trigger Request message is transmitted to the RI <b>250</b>, it is obvious to those of ordinary skill in the art that the web transaction can be performed at any timing and multiple times. For example, the web transaction can be performed prior to the transmission of the ROAP Trigger Request message. In this case, the user may complete all the manipulations required for payment during the web transaction. Also, the web transaction can be initiated one or more times before and after the transmission of the ROAP Trigger Request message for changing the payment conditions.</p>
