<p id="p-0001" num="0000">This invention relates generally to an illumination system that is configured for attachment to a hard hat or the temple arm portion of a pair of eyeglasses. The illumination system includes a light source and a multi-axis pivot assembly to permit directional adjustment and focus of a beam of light. An adapter clip is provided to facilitate attachment to the temple arm portion of the eyeglasses. The adapter clip includes a plurality of grooves positioned between two flexible side portions to allow the clip to be slid along the temple arm to a desired position and snapped into a locked position. The illumination system is fully adjustable in terms of light intensity and direction of the light beams.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an illumination system, and more particularly to an illumination system adapted for attachment to various thin or small diameter structures. The illumination system includes a light source, a power source, a power switch configured to connect the light source to the power source, and a multi-axis pivot assembly which permits the directional adjustment and focus of a beam of light.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The need for proper illumination of an item for viewing in a poorly lit area is known, as is the use of lights and other illuminating devices attached to eyewear to create an illuminated surface. In general, assumptions are made regarding focal distances and light intensities when designing these devices. With reading glasses for example, these assumptions are often based on accepted norms such as average distance between the reading material and the eye glasses, and commonly used print or font sizes. The result is a single light source, or multiple light sources that are either formed integral to or otherwise permanently mounted to existing reading glasses that uni-directionally focus the light to a predetermined focal range at a given intensity. Therefore, the current devices are not readily adjustable to either user preferences or reading conditions. In addition, the integral and/or fixed nature of the prior art devices make repairs, such as battery replacement of the lighting device, difficult or impossible.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are many variables that non-adjustable reading lights do not account for, yet are necessary for creating a comfortable reading environment for the eyes. For example, a person's age or optical health determines how well one's optic nerve receives light, and thus one's comfortable focal distance under variable lighting conditions. The type, color, and quality of the paper the reading material is printed on also affects the amount of light required. Newspapers and most books use a soft, off-white paper that absorbs light and minimizes glare. Magazines, on the other hand, are often printed on high gloss white paper that requires a lower intensity, diffused light source for maximum eye comfort. The amount and directional location of any ambient light also needs to be considered and adjusted for. The inability to adjust to these and other variables may result in increasing the potential for eye strain or eye fatigue rather than minimizing it.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This application uses LED's as the light source. LED's are low power light sources that offer a high lumen light emission. Prior art LED lighting devices are typically built into eyeglass frames. One disadvantage to this type of construction is that the power source(s), wiring, switches, etc., must also be built into the frames. This construction requires the glasses to be significantly redesigned to incorporate the light assemblies. Many of the changes required to incorporate the hardware make the designs unpopular for fashion and add significant weight to the assembly. The changes in style and weight are required whether or not the owner of the glasses utilizes the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Additionally, these same constraints and variables may be applied in areas other than recreational reading as well. For example, many jobs require workers to perform their duties in poorly lit work environments in an area where it is impractical to bring in an external light source. Various examples of this would be an electrician that may be working during an electrical outage, a coal miner, a construction worker, an auto mechanic, etc. Many of these workers are required to wear hard hats for safety reasons. Therefore, many hard hats are provided with a rectangular opening into which a mount is rigidly attached for a portable light. The mount includes a circular aperture having a thumb screw through which a flashlight is slid through the aperture and the thumb screw tightened against its side. This device includes several drawbacks. For example, the light extends away from the helmet making it susceptible to being caught in wiring, tree limbs, structures and the like. Because the light bracket is rigidly attached to the hard hat, this may create a dangerous situation. In addition, the rigid attachment and thumbscrews prevent quick removal of the light for hand held usage. Still yet, the rigidly fixed mount does not provide the angular adjustment necessary for some lighting requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Light systems are used in areas where low light can inhibit human activities including such things as repairs, observations, reading and the like. When properly directed, little light is actually needed for such activities. Large lights, such as ceiling lights, often result in shadows being cast on areas of interest since the person is often positioned between the area of interest and the light source. Also, some such lights are designed to light large areas and cannot be directed without affecting illumination in some areas meant to be illuminated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Some solutions to directed lighting include such things as so-called work lights on articulated arms that may be positioned adjacent an area of interest. These lights tend to be large and require adjustment if the user moves and needs to redirect the light; requiring use of one or more hands to effect the light redirection, hands that may be busy doing other jobs. Such lights may also be found in combination with magnifiers and are referred to as magnifier lights. Headlamps are also provided, and through the use of straps and/or a helmet, can be mounted on a user's head and can be redirected by moving the head although with limits. Such lights can be provided with a pivot to assist in the redirection.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Such lights, while being somewhat effective, have limits, particularly in the ability to redirect over a large range of adjustment, and sometimes being fixed in place or requiring hands to redirect.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, there is a need for an attachable illumination system that is constructed and arranged for attachment to eyewear, hard hats and the like to provide illumination in poorly lit areas. More particularly, there is a need for an attachable illumination system where the light source is fully adjustable in terms of light intensity and direction of the light beams produced by the illumination system. Furthermore, it would be desirable if the attachable illumination system incorporated a light source and power source for efficiency packaged in a non-intrusive, comfortable and aesthetically pleasing manner. The light source should be removable and replaceable with respect to the mount, and should be adapted to be secured to various structures with a single adapter clip without modification.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention relates generally to an illumination system and, more particularly, to an attachable illumination system that is configured for attachment to relatively thin structures such as the frame portion of a pair of eyeglasses/eyewear or the edge of a hard hat. The attachable illumination system includes a light source, a power source, a power switch configured to connect the light source to the power source, and a multi-axis pivot assembly to permit directional adjustment and focus of a beam of light. An adapter clip is provided to facilitate attachment to the thin structure. One such adapter clip includes a tapered lead-in and at least one barb positioned between two flexible side portions to allow the clip to be slid over a surface to a desired position so that the barb engages opposite side portion of the clip or the material within the clip to maintain a locked position. Another adapter clip includes a plurality of grooves positioned between two flexible side portions to allow the clip to be slid along the temple arm of a pair of glasses to a desired position and snapped into a locked position. The illumination system is fully adjustable in terms of light intensity and direction of the light beams. Furthermore, the invention may provide a means to fully adjust the focus of the light beams from a narrow point of light to a relatively broad beam of light. This addresses the problem of eye strain caused by poor lighting by allowing the user to adjust the light beams to cover the precise area desired of the item being viewed. Additionally, the invention may provide a means to adjust the intensity of the light projected onto the item being viewed. This addresses the problem of eye fatigue caused by improper lighting by allowing the user to adjust how brightly an item is illuminated, thus preventing the need to stare at an item that is too dark, or the glare off an item that is too brightly illuminated. Furthermore, the invention may provide a means to adjust the directional focus of the light to the item being viewed. This addresses the problems of using an assumed focus distance which is fixed by allowing the user to adjust the direction of the light output so as to focus on an item at a distance that provides maximum eye comfort to the user. The attachable illumination system can be scaled to a variety of sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention preferably utilizes LED's as the light source that emit white light, such as the LUXEON&#x2122; series LED's manufactured by LUMILEDS&#x2122;. These LED's have a high flux output, 100,000 hour lifespan, operate on a low direct current (DC) voltage input signal, are fully dimmable, and operate at cool temperatures, making them ideal for attachment onto surfaces that are maintained in close proximity to the user's face. Of course, those skilled in the art will understand that various types of high intensity LED's are available in the industry, and that the invention is not limited to any particular configuration or design of a particular LED. The light source is preferably a self-contained removable and replaceable light assembly, such as a portable flashlight, that is constructed and arranged to snap into a mounting assembly. The light assembly includes a power switch, preferably incorporated into the bezel and configured to connect the light source to a battery power source. The light output from the light source may be adjustable in various intensity levels and focus upon rotation of the bezel. Rotation of the bezel preferably moves a parabolic reflector with respect to the LED light source to change the focus of the emitted light. A lens may be positioned at or about the distal end of the light assembly which may include curvatures and/or coloration to provide additional light characteristics and modifications as is known in the art. The light source preferably includes a battery, capacitor, bat-cap or other electrical storage means for storing a supply of electrical power for consumption by the LED(s). The electrical storage device is generally positioned within a cylindrical or other shaped tubular portion that is sized to cooperate in a removable and replaceable manner with the mounting assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The mounting assembly includes an adapter clip and an offset arm. The adapter clip is constructed and arranged for securing the mounting assembly to a relatively thin structure or small diameter structure and includes the first portion of the first rotation assembly. The offset arm is generally L-shaped and includes the second portion of the first rotation assembly at a first end and the first portion of a second rotation assembly at a second end thereof. The first and second portions of the first rotation assembly snap together and preferably allow up to 360 degrees of rotational freedom about a first axis of rotation. The first portion of the second rotation assembly is formed onto the friction tube, and like the first rotation assembly, snaps together with the second portion of the second rotation assembly to allow up to 360 degrees of rotational freedom about a second axis of rotation. Each first portion of a rotation assembly includes a snap ring portion and a bearing race portion, while each second portion of a rotation assembly preferably includes a plurality of spring clips and a bearing portion. This combination allows the snap together assembly yet provides thrust and rotational bearings to accept loads and provide controlled rotation, while the spring clips maintain the assembly and provide a predetermined resistance to rotation. This allows the light to be positioned by the user so that the desired position is maintained during movement of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide an illumination system that can be secured to a relatively small or thin structure.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It is a further objective of the present invention to provide an illumination system for eyewear having multiple axes of movement for the light assembly permitting a wide range of adjustment and directing of the light source with respect to the eyewear.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">It is yet another objective of the present invention to provide a clip adapter for securing an illumination system to the temple arm portion of eyewear that can be secured to the temple arms of eyeglasses which have various sizes and shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">It is a still further objective of the present invention to provide a mounting assembly having two axes of rotation that each provide 360 degrees of rotational freedom.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Still yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an illumination system adapter clip having an open edge for attachment to the edge portion of a thin structure.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A further objective of the present invention is to provide an illumination system mounting assembly that is constructed and arranged for attachment to the edge of a hat.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An even further objective of the present invention is to provide an illumination system mounting assembly that is constructed and arranged to break away upon receiving a predetermined force.</p>
