<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to an image processing apparatus that combines an object with a circular image, a printing apparatus, and an image processing method.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, household printing apparatuses are mainly used in printing images, documents, and the like, on paper. However, with the increasing use of circular storage medium such as a digital versatile disc (DVD) and a compact disc (CD) in homes, printing apparatuses now exist that are provided with a function for mounting such storage medium, and printing a circular image on a surface thereof. Furthermore, a technique exists for combining an object such as text data and a stamp with an image. Using this technique, an object can be combined with an image to be printed on the above-described circular storage medium. When an object is combined with a background image and printed in such a manner, it maybe necessary to adjust a position of the object with respect to the background image.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Nowadays, operations relating to printing which were previously performed by a personal computer (PC) can be performed using only a printing apparatus main body itself, without the PC. Therefore, it may be desirable that the printing apparatus can easily perform operations such as the above positioning. When the positioning is performed, a common method is to move the object to be combined on a display screen using a key. US Patent Application Publication No. 2005168566 discusses a method which determines a combination position of an object with an image by changing and rotating the position of the image with up/down/right/left keys. However, there is a need for a method which can be operated more directly than the method using the keys.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of this, one way would be to provide a touch panel in the printing apparatus. Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2004-282439 discusses a method for moving an object by touching a touch panel which displays a print preview. However, in most printing apparatuses the display screen is small, and thus it may be difficult to finely perform a movement and rotation operation.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, considering that the image to be printed is circular, a wheel device such as a jog wheel may be provided to rotate the image. A user could thus more easily and directly position the object on the background image.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, if the circular image or object is rotated, an orientation of the object on the display screen will change, and thus the object may not be aligned with a direction of the circular image. For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the directions of the circular image and the object may be out of alignment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A basic orientation of the object may usually be determined according to the user's preference when the user combines the object with the background image. Therefore, when the object is moved, the determined object orientation changes. In addition, when the user adjusts the object orientation and then moves the object, although the user has adjusted the orientation, the object orientation may move out of alignment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the present invention, an image processing apparatus that combines a background image and an object includes a display screen configured to display an image, a wheel device configured to be operated by a user, and a display control unit configured to display on the display screen an image in which a circular background image and at least one object are combined. The image processing apparatus also has a movement control unit configured to move the object on the display screen displayed by the display control unit, based on a rotation direction and a rotation amount of the wheel device, while maintaining as is a distance between a center of the background image and a center of the object. The image processing device further includes a rotation control unit configured to rotate the object around the center of the object according to movement of the object by the movement control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect of the invention, a printing apparatus is provided that prints on a storage medium an image in which a background image and an object are combined. The printing apparatus includes a display screen configured to display an image, a wheel device configured to be operated by a user, and a display control unit configured to display on the display screen an image in which a circular background image and at least one object are combined. The printing apparatus also includes a movement control unit configured to move the object on the display screen displayed by the display control unit, based on a rotation direction and a rotation amount of the wheel device, while maintaining as is a distance between a center of the background image and a center of the object. The printer apparatus further includes a rotation control unit configured to rotate the object around the center of the object, according to movement of the object by the movement control unit, and a printing unit configured to print on a circular storage medium the image in which the object is combined with the background image at a position moved to by the movement control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In yet another aspect of the invention, a method is provided for processing an image to combine a background image and an object. The method includes displaying on a display screen an image in which a circular background image and at least one object are combined, moving the object on the displayed display screen based on an input instruction, while maintaining as is a distance between a center of the background image and a center of the object, and rotating the object around the center of the object according to movement of the object.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A to 3E</figref> are a series of diagrams illustrating operations of the present exemplary embodiment and of an example during preview of DVD/CD printing.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the present exemplary embodiment, the preview for printing the circular image on a DVD/CD can be displayed on the LCD <b>21</b>. When the object, such as a stamp image or text data, is combined with the circular image in the preview, the object is rotationally moved along, e.g., in synchronization with, the rotational movement of the wheel device <b>26</b>. According to the present exemplary embodiment, the object can be rotationally moved around the center of the preview display while the top and bottom of the object to be combined with the circular image are maintained as they are.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> illustrates an example of an object such as a stamp or text data, which is combined with a circular image to be printed on a DVD/CD.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the present exemplary embodiment, the circular image will be referred to as the &#x201c;background image&#x201d; with respect to the object such as the stamp and the text data.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a background image <b>41</b> is circularly cropped, and displayed on the LCD <b>21</b> as the printing image. A stamp <b>42</b> is an image which is to be combined with the background image <b>41</b>. Text <b>43</b> is text data which is to be combined with the background image <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">During the preview of the DVD/CD printing, a combination operation is performed by pasting and positioning the stamp <b>42</b> and text <b>43</b> to be combined with the background image <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> illustrates an example in which the stamp <b>42</b> and the text <b>43</b> are combined with the background image <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> illustrates an example in which the stamp <b>42</b> and the text data <b>43</b> are rotationally moved around a center of a preview display region displayed on the LCD <b>21</b> as a center point.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">When the wheel device <b>26</b> is rotated, the stamp <b>42</b> and the text <b>43</b> are rotationally moved as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> from the positions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. In this case, the wheel device <b>26</b> is rotated in the clockwise direction. The stamp <b>42</b> and text <b>43</b> move in a circle around a center point of the preview display region displayed on the LCD <b>21</b>. The background image <b>41</b> is also displayed in the preview display. Further, at this stage, each of the images of the stamp <b>42</b> and text data <b>43</b> is rotationally moved (moved along the circle) without being rotated on its own center.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Thus, according to the present exemplary embodiment, by just rotating the wheel device <b>26</b>, the combined stamp <b>42</b> and text <b>43</b> can be rotationally moved around the center of the preview, while maintaining the directions of the stamp <b>42</b> and the text <b>43</b> and the direction of the background image <b>41</b>. Further, by selecting a plurality of movement targets (e.g., the stamp <b>42</b>, the text <b>43</b>, etc.), these targets can be simultaneously moved by the wheel device <b>26</b>. Details of the operation will be described in descriptions of flowcharts illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> illustrates an outline of an example of a combined image which is moved by the up/down/right/left keys <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, when the stamp <b>42</b> is moved on the background image <b>41</b> to a destination, the stamp <b>42</b> may be further moved to a target destination by using the up/down/right/left keys <b>28</b> or the like, so that the operation may be complex. Further, the stamp <b>42</b> may be moved without maintaining the distance from the center of the DVD/CD. In other words, a movement method of the example may be suitable for an operation for slightly shifting the object up/down/right/left, but an operation such as positioning the stamp <b>42</b> along the circle or the like may be very complex. For example, a two-step operation may be required where the stamp <b>42</b> is first moved in an upwards direction by operating the up key, and then moved in a right direction using the right key. More specifically, it can be understood that the movement illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> provides a direct operation for rotationally moving the object.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> illustrates another example.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the position of the stamp <b>42</b> can be changed by rotating the background image <b>41</b> with the wheel device <b>26</b>. However, in this case, the directions of the background image <b>41</b> and the stamp <b>42</b> become different.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Since the direction of the background image <b>41</b> does not match the directions of the stamp <b>42</b> and the text <b>43</b>, a technique such as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D and 3E</figref> cannot be used for combining the images while maintaining the direction of the background image <b>41</b> and the directions of the stamp <b>42</b> and the text <b>43</b>. More specifically, it can be understood that the present exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> would be effective for changing the position of the objects.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">However, when the user actually performs the combination operation of a photograph and a stamp, in some cases the photograph itself, which was taken by the user, is slanted. In such a case, the background image slant may have to be corrected. The method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> may be effective for correcting the background image slant. Namely, to match the directions of the stamp and the background image, the user may adjust the direction of the background image according to the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, and then the stamp can be directly moved by the method for moving the stamp as described above, for example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In the following description, the object, such as the stamp and text data, is the image which is combined with the background image. However, objects other than the stamp and text data may also be treated as the &#x201c;object&#x201d;, as long as it is an image to be combined. Then, the combined image of the background image and the object can be printed by the recording unit <b>13</b> on a circular storage medium, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates an example of adjusting a radius length during the preview of DVD/CD printing.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the present exemplary embodiment, the radius length is adjusted by the up/down/right/left keys <b>28</b>. In this embodiment, while the up/down/right/left keys <b>28</b> are used as executing units for adjustment, a method other than up/down/right/left keys may also be used to adjust the radius length, for example so long as a method can adjust the length. Processing of adjusting the radius length will be described in more detail using a flowchart illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In one version, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, when moving a stamp <b>44</b>, radius adjustment is performed via the up/down/right/left keys <b>28</b>. The stamp <b>44</b> can be radially moved as illustrated by an arrow of a radial direction by operating the up/down/right/left keys <b>28</b>. Further, after adjusting the radius by the up/down/right/left keys <b>28</b>, the stamp <b>44</b> can be moved in a circle based on the adjusted radius length by operating the wheel device <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The stamp may be moved by controlling coordinate positions of the stamp that has a radius set as the distance from the center of the preview display region to the stamp, so as to move in a horizontal direction and in a perpendicular direction according to a rotation amount of the wheel device <b>26</b> detected by the CPU <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates an example of adjusting the radius length via the up/down/right/left keys <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In this example, when a stamp <b>45</b> is present in a top half, the up key lengthens the radius, and the down key shortens the radius. On the other hand, like a stamp <b>46</b>, when the stamp is present in a bottom half, the up key shortens the radius, and the down key lengthens the radius. Namely, the radius can be directly adjusted via the up/down/right/left keys <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates an example of adjusting the radius length via the up/down/right/left keys <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In this example, when a stamp <b>47</b> is present in a left half, the left key lengthens the radius, and the right key shortens the radius. On the other hand, like a stamp <b>48</b>, when the stamp is present in a right half, the left key shortens the radius, and the right key lengthens the radius. Namely, the radius can be directly adjusted via the up/down/right/left keys <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the above actions, up/down/right/left is not applied as is to the lengthening/shortening of the radius length based on the position of the stamp, but the radius length is lengthened or shortened in conjunction with the movement direction of the stamp. Thus, the up/down/right/left keys <b>28</b> and the radius length can be adjusted in a more direct manner.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> are explanatory diagrams of the object to be combined in the background image, which is rotated at the position where the object is positioned by operating the wheel device <b>26</b> during the preview of DVD/CD printing.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> illustrates an example of a case where only a stamp <b>51</b> is selected as target object of rotation, and is rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> illustrates an example of a case where a plurality of rotation target objects, such as a stamp <b>52</b> and text <b>53</b>, are selected, and are rotated.</p>

Moreover, when the original-size stamp <b>73</b> is further moved to fit within the preview screen, enlargement may be performed, so that the stamp <b>73</b> is enlarged to its original size, for example. In other words, a variable magnification of the object may be changed so that the object fits within an area of the background image, according to the arrangement position of the object as a result of the object rotational movement. A size when the object is initially arranged may have a reduce factor of 1. Further, when re-enlarging the object after reduction as a result of the rotational movement, the magnification may be controlled so as not to exceed 1. When the object is text data rather than a stamp, to ensure that the object does not protrude from the preview screen, control may also be performed by changing a font size.</p>

However, for example, the object may also be moved while changing its orientation direction on the display screen as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> or <b>3</b>E, while the wheel device is being rotated, and the orientation direction may also be adjusted after the rotation of the wheel device has stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In the present exemplary embodiment, while the rotation and rotational movement are performed using text data, objects (i.e., objects to be combined) other than text data may also be rotated and rotationally moved.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Further, in the present exemplary embodiment, as an example, the image is printed on a circular storage medium. However, so long as aspects according to the above described method for moving an object are employed, the invention is not limited to printing on the circular storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">While the image processing apparatus of the above exemplary embodiment is capable of printing an image, the present invention is not limited thereto. For example, the aspects of the present invention may also be employed in a digital camera and a mobile telephone having a wheel device. In such a case, for example, an image which combines a background image and an object may be printed by transmitting the image to a printing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Furthermore, aspects of the present invention may be applied to processing on apparatuses that do not have a wheel device or a display, such as a personal computer (PC). In this case, a PC performs processing based on, for example, instructions from a user input via a pointing device such as a mouse. The user can give instructions similar to the above-described wheel device by performing a drag operation to move an object displayed on a monitor over a circular image using the mouse.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Furthermore, in one embodiment a storage medium that contains computer executable instructions for realizing functions of the above exemplary embodiment may be supplied to a system or an apparatus such as a PC. In such a case, aspects of the present invention can be achieved by having a processing unit (or CPU or micro processing unit (MPU)) of that system or apparatus read and execute the computer-executable instructions of program code stored in the storage medium. In this case, the computer-executable instructions read from the storage medium may realize the functions of, for example, the above exemplary embodiment, so that the storage medium which stores the computer-executable instructions constitutes an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Examples of storage media for supplying the program code which may be used may include, but are not limited to, a floppy disk, a hard disk, an optical disk, a magneto-optical disk, CD-ROM, CD-recordable (CD-R), a magnetic tape, a non-volatile memory card, a ROM, a DVD and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all modifications, equivalent structures, and functions.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">This application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-004907 filed Jan. 11, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
