<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A receiving device may use various filters to select informative portions of a received signal and attenuate noise and interference portions from the received signal. For example, a digital video broadcast (DVB) receiver can include filters at the receiver front-end. The DVB receiver may receive a signal that may include DVB portions that can be transmitted according to a bandwidth assigned to a DVB standard, and out-of-band portions that can be noises and interferences due to co-existing transmissions of other standards. The filters can be used to attenuate the out-of-band portions, and select the DVB portions, before converting the received signal into a digital signal. Therefore, the filtered signal may result in a reduced error rate, and an increase digital video quality.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects of the disclosure can provide a second order low pass filter. The second order low pass filter can work in current domain, and have high linearity for in-band signals and out-of-band signals. Further, the second order low pass filter can be configured to be stackable to provide additionally filtering capability while consuming a reduced power. In addition, the second order low pass filter may include tunable components, thus the second order low pass filter may be adjustable to suit needs of a multi-standard system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Aspects of the disclosure can provide a receiver. The receiver may include a signal amplifier configured to output a voltage signal in response to a received signal, a voltage to current converter configured to output a current signal in response to the voltage signal, and a filter stage. The filter stage can include at least a first low pass filter. The first low pass filter can include a MOS transistor having a gate terminal, a current input terminal and a current output terminal, a first capacitor coupled between the current input terminal and a ground connection and a second capacitor coupled between the gate terminal and the current input terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The MOS transistor can be a P-type MOS transistor or an N-type MOS transistor. The filter stage can further include a bias resistor coupled between a DC reference and the gate terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the disclosure, the low pass filter can have a transfer function:</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a block diagram of a receiver example according to the disclosure. The receiver <b>100</b> may include a receiver front-end <b>110</b>, an analog to digital converter (ADC) <b>120</b>, a digital signal processor (DSP) <b>130</b> and a controller <b>140</b>. Theses elements can be coupled together as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The receiver front-end <b>110</b> may receive an electrical signal, for example via an antenna module. The electrical signal may include portions of information directed to the receiver <b>100</b>, and portions of noises and interferences due to co-existing transmissions in the air. The receiver front-end <b>110</b> may include one or more filter modules to select the portions of information and attenuate the portions of noises and interferences.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the disclosure, the receiver front-end <b>110</b> may include a low pass filter, which can operate in current mode. The low pass filter may be configured with regard to a standard used to transmit the portions of information. For example, the low pass filter may have a bandwidth with regard to the standard. The low pass filter can have a low in-band noise and a high linearity for both in-band portions and out-of-band portions of a signal. The in-band portions can refer to the portions having frequencies within the bandwidth of the low pass filter, and the out-band portions can refer to the portions having frequencies out of the bandwidth of the low pass filter. Further, the low pass filter can be stackable, and may consume a reduced power while providing additional filtering capability. Additionally, the low pass filter can be tunable, thus the low pass filter can be controlled to suit needs of a multi-standard system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The receiver front-end <b>110</b> may include other analog processing components, such as amplifiers, mixers, and the like, to process the received signal. For example, the amplifiers can be used to increase signal amplitudes, and the mixers can be used to convert signal frequencies to desired ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The ADC <b>120</b> may receive analog signals being processed by the receiver front-end <b>110</b>, and convert the analog signals into digital signals. For example, the ADC <b>120</b> may sample the analog signals, and convert sampled signals into digital values.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The DSP <b>130</b> may use digital signal processing techniques, such as decoding, decompression, and the like, to further process the digital signals.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The controller <b>140</b> may provide control signals to configure the components of receiver <b>100</b>. For example, the controller <b>140</b> may provide control signals to a tunable low pass filter in the receiver front-end <b>110</b>, and configure a bandwidth of the low pass filter with regard to a standard. Thus, the receiver <b>100</b> may operate in the bandwidth of the standard.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block diagram of a receiver front-end example <b>210</b> according to an embodiment of the disclosure. Similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the receiver front-end <b>210</b> may be coupled with an ADC <b>220</b> and a controller <b>240</b>. The receiver front-end <b>210</b> may include a low noise amplifier (LNA) module <b>250</b>, a voltage to current converter module <b>255</b>, a filter module <b>260</b>, a current source module <b>265</b>, another filter module <b>270</b>, a current mirror module <b>275</b>, a mixer module <b>280</b>, a gain/filter module <b>285</b>. These elements can be coupled as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The LNA module <b>250</b> can include any suitable circuitry that can be configured to receive a voltage signal, for example from an antenna module, amplify the voltage signal, and provide the amplified voltage signal to a subsequent processing circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The voltage to current converter module <b>255</b> may receive the amplified voltage signal from the LNA <b>250</b>, and convert the voltage signal to a current signal. The current signal can be provided to the filter module <b>260</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The filter module <b>260</b> can operate in a current mode. More specifically, the filter module <b>260</b> can receive the current signal from the voltage to current converter module <b>255</b>, and provide a filtered current signal to a subsequent processing stage. According to the disclosure, the filter module <b>260</b> may include one or more low pass filter stages. The one or more of the low pass filter stages can be stacked together, such that a DC current may sequentially flow through the one or more of the low pass filter stages. Thus, the stackable low pass filter stages can provide additional filtering capability with substantially the same power consumption.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, the filter module <b>260</b> may include tunable parameters, and can be tuned to adjust a bandwidth with regard to a standard. According to the disclosure, the filter module <b>260</b> may receive control signals from the controller <b>240</b>. The control signals can be used to adjust the tunable parameters to obtain an appropriate bandwidth. In an embodiment, the filter module <b>260</b> may include at least one capacitor array. The capacitor array may include multiple capacitor cells. The multiple capacitor cells can be respectively switched in or out of the filter module <b>260</b> based on the control signals. Thus, characteristics of the filter module <b>260</b> can be adjusted by scaling the capacitor array.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Additionally, the filter module <b>260</b> can have a high linearity for in-band and out-of-band signal portions and can have a low in-band noise.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The current source module <b>265</b> may receive the filtered current from the filter module <b>260</b>, and may provide a current to a next module based on the filtered current. According to the disclosure, a filter module may include a limited number of stacked filter stages due to a voltage drop across each of the stacked filter stages. In order to have additional filter stages, the current source <b>265</b> can be configured to fold a current direction.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The filter module <b>270</b> may additionally filter the current signal and provide a filtered current signal to the current mirror <b>275</b>. The current mirror <b>275</b> may provide a current signal corresponding to the filtered current signal.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The mixer module <b>280</b> can include any suitable circuitry, and can be configured to receive the current signal, and may convert frequencies of the current signal into an intermediate frequency (IF) range or a base-band frequency range. For example, the mixer module <b>280</b> may be coupled to an oscillator, such as a local oscillator, to receive a periodic signal. The periodic signal can be mixed with the current signal to obtain a frequency reduced signal.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The gain/filter module <b>285</b> may include a plurality of gain/filter stages. The plurality of gain/filter stages may include any suitable circuitry, such as a plurality amplifiers, filters, logic, and the like, that can further process the received signals.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">During operation, for example, the filter module <b>260</b> may receive control signals from the controller <b>240</b> to adjust a filter characteristic according to a standard, thus the receiver front-end may operate according to the standard. More specifically, the LNA module <b>250</b> may amplify an input voltage signal, and provide the amplified voltage signal to the voltage to current converter module <b>255</b>. The voltage to current converter module <b>255</b> can convert the amplified voltage signal to a current signal, and provide the current signal to the filter module <b>260</b>. The filter module <b>260</b> may select informative portions of the current signal, and attenuate noise and interference portions of the current signal according to the filter characteristic. Then, the filtered current signal can be provided to subsequent components of the receiver front-end for further processing.</p>

The low pass filter <b>300</b>A may include a MOS transistor <b>310</b>, a first capacitor <b>320</b>, a second capacitor <b>330</b>, and a resistor <b>340</b>. Theses components can be coupled as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>.</p>

Generally, the MOS transistor <b>310</b> may have a gate terminal <b>311</b>, a current input terminal <b>312</b>, a current output terminal <b>313</b>, and a body terminal <b>314</b>. The body terminal <b>314</b> may be tied to reduce body effect. For example, the body terminal <b>314</b> may be tied with the current input terminal <b>312</b> to reduce the body effect. The MOS transistor <b>310</b> may receive a current input from the current input terminal <b>312</b>, and provide a current output from the current output terminal <b>313</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to the disclosure, the low pass filter <b>300</b>A may be tunable by scaling the first and second capacitors C<sub>1 </sub>and C<sub>2</sub>. In an embodiment, the first and second capacitors C<sub>1 </sub>and C<sub>2 </sub>may be implemented as capacitor arrays. The capacitor arrays can be controlled to adjust the bandwidth characteristic of the low pass filter <b>300</b>A. According to another aspect of the disclosure, a product of the trans-conductance g<sub>m1 </sub>and the resistance R can be kept constant in the low pass filter <b>300</b>A, thus the shaping characteristic for the low pass filter <b>300</b>A can be appropriately controlled by the first and second capacitors C<sub>1 </sub>and C<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows an equivalent circuit diagram of the low pass filter <b>300</b>A for in-band signal portions. The in-band signal portion can be low frequency. For the low frequency signal portions, the first capacitor <b>320</b> and the second capacitor <b>330</b> are equivalent to open connections. Thus, the MOS transistor <b>310</b> can operate in a cascade configuration. More specifically, during operation, the MOS transistor <b>310</b> can receive the in-band signal portions at the current input terminal <b>312</b>, and output the in-band signal portions at the current output terminal <b>313</b>. Thus, the low pass filter <b>300</b> can have high linearity for in-band signal portions.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows an equivalent circuit diagram of the low pass filter <b>300</b>A for out-of-band signal portions. The out-of-band signal portions can be high frequency. For high frequency signal portions, the first capacitor <b>320</b> and the second capacitor <b>330</b> can be equivalent to short connections, and can shunt away the out-of-band current. Thus, low pass filter <b>300</b> can be equivalent to an open circuit to the out-of-band portions of input current, and thus can have high linearity for the out-of-band signal portions.</p>

The current output i<sub>out1 </sub>can be subsequently received by the second stage <b>420</b> as a current input i<sub>in2</sub>.

In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the low pass filter <b>500</b>A can include a pair of low pass filters including a first low pass filter <b>510</b> and a second low pass filter <b>520</b>.

These components can be coupled together as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Additionally, the first low pass filter <b>510</b> and the second low pass filter <b>520</b> can be configured to have substantially equivalent components. For example, the low pass filter <b>510</b> may include a NMOS transistor Mn<b>0</b>, a first capacitor C<b>1</b>, a second capacitor C<b>2</b>, and a resistor R<b>0</b>, and the low pass filter <b>520</b> can correspondingly have a NMOS transistor Mn<b>1</b>, a first capacitor C<b>3</b>, a second capacitor C<b>4</b>, and a resistor R<b>1</b>. The corresponding transistors, capacitors and resistors may be substantially the same, such as same sizes, same structures, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The first low pass filter <b>510</b> and the second low pass filter <b>520</b> may receive a pair of current inputs, and output a pair of current outputs. For example, the first low pass filter <b>510</b> may receive a positive current of the pair of current inputs, and output a positive current of the pair of current outputs; similarly, the second low pass filter <b>520</b> may receive a negative current of the pair of current inputs, and output a negative current of the pair of current outputs.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the low pass filter <b>500</b>B can also include a pair of low pass filters including a first low pass filter <b>530</b> and a second low pass filter <b>540</b>.

These components can be coupled together as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Additionally, the first low pass filter <b>530</b> and the second low pass filter <b>540</b> can be configured to have substantially equivalent components. For example, the low pass filter <b>530</b> may include a NMOS transistor Mn<b>0</b>, a first capacitor C<b>1</b>, and a resistor R<b>0</b>, and the low pass filter <b>540</b> can correspondingly have a NMOS transistor Mn<b>1</b>, a first capacitor C<b>3</b>, and a resistor R<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">It is noted that the capacitors in the low pass filter can be implemented by various switchable capacitor techniques, such as metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors with switches, metal-oxide-metal (MOM) capacitors with switches, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a schematic diagram for a capacitor cell example <b>600</b> according to an embodiment of the disclosure. The capacitor cell <b>600</b> may provide better parasitics to extend the tuning range of the low pass filter and allow a compact realization. The capacitor cell <b>600</b> may be included in a capacitor array for one of the capacitors in a low pass filter. Thus, the low pass filter characteristics may be tunable through control of the capacitor cell <b>600</b>. The capacitor cell <b>600</b> may include a capacitor <b>610</b>, and a switch <b>620</b>. These elements can be coupled as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The capacitor <b>610</b> may be in the form of a MOS transistor as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The MOS transistor can be configured into a MOS capacitor. For example, a gate terminal G of the MOS transistor can be configured as a first terminal of the capacitor <b>610</b>, and a source terminal S and a drain terminal D can be shorted and configured as a second terminal of the capacitor <b>610</b>. The second terminal of the capacitor <b>610</b> can be configured as a first terminal Cn of the capacitor cell <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The switch <b>620</b> may be in the form of a MOS transistor, such as a PMOS transistor as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The MOS transistor can be configured into a MOS switch. For example, a gate terminal G of the MOS transistor can be configured as a switch control, a drain terminal D may be coupled to the first terminal of the capacitor <b>610</b>, and the source terminal S may be configured as a second terminal Cp of the capacitor cell <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">During operation, the switch <b>620</b> can switch the capacitor <b>610</b> in or out of a circuit. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the switch control is high, the switch <b>620</b> is open, thus the capacitor <b>610</b> is switched out of the circuit. When the switch control is low, the switch <b>620</b> is closed, thus the capacitor <b>610</b> is switched in the circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Additionally, the capacitor cell <b>600</b> may be configured to have reduced parasitic parameters. For example, the switch <b>620</b> can be a PMOS transistor located in a N-type well, and the capacitor <b>610</b> can be a NMOS transistor located in an isolated P-type well. In addition, the P-type well may be located in a deep N-type well. The deep N-type well, the P-type well and the N-type well can be suitably biased to reduce the parasitic parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a flowchart outlining a process example for configuring a low pass filter module example according to the disclosure. The low pass filter module can be in any of the configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. The low pass filter module may include at least a tunable low pass filter, which can include a MOS transistor, a first capacitor, a second capacitor, and a resistor. At least one of the first capacitor and the second capacitor can be tunable. The process starts at step S<b>710</b>, and proceeds to step S<b>720</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In step S<b>720</b>, a controller, such as the controller <b>240</b>, may determine a filter characteristic for the tunable low pass filter. In an example, the low pass filter module can be used in a receiver, such as a digital video tuner. The controller may determine a bandwidth characteristic and a shaping characteristic based on a standard for transmitting digital video data. Then, the process proceeds to step S<b>730</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In step S<b>730</b>, the controller may configure a capacitor array based on the filter characteristic. In an example, the tunable low pass filter may include one or more capacitor arrays. Each capacitor array may include multiple capacitor cells. Each capacitor cell may include a capacitor, and a switch that can switch the capacitor in or out. The controller may determine control signals to the switches in the capacitor array to respectively switch in or out the capacitors, such that the tunable low pass filter can have the determined filter characteristic. Then, the process proceeds to step S<b>740</b>, and terminates.</p>
