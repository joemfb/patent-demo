<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to spinal support devices and, more specifically, to a flexible member having variable flexibility for use with a dynamic stabilization system to provide dynamic stability to a person's spine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The treatment of acute and chronic spinal instabilities or deformities of the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine has traditionally involved the implantation of rigid rods to secure the vertebrae of a patient. More recently, flexible materials have been utilized in connection with anchor members, e.g., pedicle screws, to provide a dynamic stabilization of the spinal column. Such dynamic stabilization systems or implants typically include a flexible member positioned between pedicle screws installed in adjacent vertebrae of a person's spine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Certain dynamic stabilization systems permit the top loading of a flexible member and connecting member between pedicle screws. One such top loading system is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0035366 to Walder et al., titled &#x201c;Pedicle Screw For Intervertebral Support Elements&#x201d;, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Another top loading system is disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/618,943 to Hestad et al., titled &#x201c;Spine Stiffening Device&#x201d;, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. Still other dynamic stabilization systems are adapted to securely retain the flexible member between pedicle screws without the use of a connecting member.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While current dynamic stabilization systems include flexible members, these flexible members are known to be composed, for example, of a specific material having a singular elasticity that does not allow for variability in flexibility, except by varying the length of the flexible member between pedicle screws. In other words, those flexible members provide an equal bending force in all directions, i.e., the flexible member is without variable flexibility. Such variability in flexibility could provide surgeons with greater options in selecting the most appropriate flexible member for placement at a specific location along a patient's spine, such selection being dictated by the desired bending movement of the flexible member at that location.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Accordingly, it would be desirable to provide flexible members having variable flexibility for use with dynamic stabilization systems to provide dynamic stability to a person's spine that addresses these and other deficiencies of current flexible members.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the present invention, a flexible member is provided having variable flexibility for use with a dynamic stabilization system or implant to provide dynamic stability to a person's spine. To that end, the flexible member generally includes a body having opposing first and second ends connected by an intermediate portion extending therebetween. Each opposing end is configured for cooperation with an anchor member, such as a pedicle screw. The body further includes at least one first portion including a first material having a first elasticity and at least one second portion including a second material having a second elasticity greater than the first to provide the flexible member with a variable flexibility. The body can further define a cylinder and may include an aperture extending lengthwise therethrough for receiving a connecting member to retain the flexible member between pedicle screws in the dynamic stabilization system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, the first material is a different material than the second material. In one example, the first portion of the flexible member includes a plurality of first portions including a first material and the second portion includes a plurality of second portions including a second material. The body further includes a lengthwise central axis, with the plurality of first and second portions extending along the length of the body and being alternately situated, e.g., symmetrically, about the axis thereof. In another example, the plurality of first and second portions are alternately situated circumferentially about the lengthwise central axis along the length of the body. In yet another example, the first portion spirals along the length of the body with a remainder of the body including the second portion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, the first and second materials are the same type of polymer, with the first and second materials having a predetermined stoichiometry and thermal history, thereby providing the first and second elasticity, respectively, for the first and second portions. In one example, the body defines a flexibility gradient that extends along the length thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The flexibility gradient can increase in flexibility from the first end to the opposing second end to define a plurality of elasticities, which includes the first and second elasticity for the first and second portions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, these and other various configurations of the flexible member can allow for easier bending of the flexible member in one direction relative to another, as compared to conventional flexible members which have equal bending force in all directions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">By virtue of the foregoing, there is provided a flexible member having variable flexibility for use with a dynamic stabilization system to provide dynamic stability to a person's spine.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> illustrate cut-away sections of a spine <b>10</b> having a dynamic stabilization system or implant <b>12</b> implanted therein. The systems <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> include a flexible member <b>14</b> having variable flexibility positioned between anchor members <b>16</b>, for example, pedicle screws, installed in adjacent vertebrae <b>20</b> of the spine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The anchor members <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> generally illustrate top loading pedicle screws that retain the flexible members <b>14</b> therebetween by means well known in the art. One such top loading type screw is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2002/0035366 to Walder et al., titled &#x201c;Pedicle Screw For Intervertebral Support Elements&#x201d;, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a connecting member <b>22</b> may be passed through an aperture <b>24</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) in the flexible member <b>14</b>, such connecting member <b>22</b> then being top loaded and secured within a top portion of each anchor member <b>16</b> by threadable cap members <b>26</b>. The connecting member <b>22</b> can be passed through the aperture <b>24</b> during or prior to implantation in a patient, or preformed or coupled to the flexible member <b>14</b> to form a unitary structure during manufacture of the dynamic stabilization system <b>12</b>. Once secured, that connecting member <b>22</b> retains the flexible member <b>14</b> between the anchor members <b>16</b> while cooperating with the flexible member <b>14</b> for permitting mobility of the spine <b>10</b>. In contrast, the flexible member <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is devoid of aperture <b>24</b> and corresponding connecting member <b>22</b> and, instead, is directly top loaded into anchor members <b>16</b> and securely held in place by threadable cap members <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the flexible members <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, respectively, include a cylindrical body <b>30</b> including opposing first and second ends <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> connected by an intermediate portion <b>36</b> extending therebetween. In this embodiment, each opposing end <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> is configured for cooperation with a corresponding anchor member <b>16</b>. The body <b>30</b> further includes a lengthwise central axis <b>38</b> and a plurality of first portions <b>40</b>, i.e., two first portions, including a first material, for example, a first polymeric material, having a first elasticity and a plurality of second portions <b>44</b>, i.e., two second portions, including a second material, for example, a second polymeric material, having a second elasticity greater than the first to provide the flexible member <b>14</b> with a variable flexibility. The first material may be a different material than the second material. In addition, the plurality of first portions <b>40</b> as well as the plurality of second portions <b>44</b> may have different elasticities and/or may be composed of different material, including, for example, polymeric, metal, or ceramic materials having a range of elasticities from flexible, to rigid, to semi-rigid that result in a flexible member that can be tailored to a particular surgical application.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Additionally, the first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> extend along the length of the body <b>30</b> and are alternately spaced symmetrically about the axis <b>38</b> of the body <b>30</b>. Although not shown, the first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> could be spaced asymmetrically about the axis <b>38</b>. The flexible member of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> further includes aperture <b>24</b> extending lengthwise through the body <b>30</b> for receiving the connecting member <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">While two first and two second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, in its simplest form one first portion <b>40</b> and one second portion <b>44</b> can be provided. In addition, the width of the portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> may be varied. And, despite the absence of a connecting member <b>22</b> in the system <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, it should be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that the flexible member <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> could be used with the system <b>12</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The flexible member <b>14</b> also may be provided in varying lengths, e.g., twelve-inch lengths, so that a surgeon can cut, or shape, the flexible member <b>14</b> to fit between opposing anchor members <b>16</b> along a specific section of spine <b>10</b> as well as to accommodate a desired bending movement of the flexible member <b>14</b>. The construction of flexible member <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> provides a cross-sectional flexibility gradient that is dependent upon the elastomeric characteristics of the first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Orientation of the flexible member <b>14</b>, e.g., inferior or superior positioning of one end <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> relative to the spine <b>10</b> and/or lateral versus anterior/posterior positioning of the first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>, is determined by the desired bending movement of the selected flexible member <b>14</b> at that specific section of spine <b>10</b>. In other words, orientation of the flexible member <b>14</b> is generally determined based upon the needs of the patient, with the flexible member <b>14</b> of the present invention allowing for tailoring thereof on a patient-by-patient basis. In addition, although the flexible member <b>14</b> is illustrated as being cylindrical, it should be understood by one having ordinary skill in the art that other desired shapes, for example, square, rectangular, oval, etc. may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With respect to the bending movement of the flexible member <b>14</b>, if the first material of the flexible member <b>14</b> is located anterior/posterior (A-P) relative to the spine <b>10</b> and the second material is located laterally, the flexible member <b>14</b> can allow for easier bending A-P as compared to laterally. Consequently, the flexible member <b>14</b> could be rotated <b>90</b> degrees and then the A-P bending would require more force to allow similar ease of bending in contrast to lateral bending. The surgeon implanting the dynamic stabilization system <b>12</b> can selectively take advantage of the varying elasticity of the portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> of flexible member <b>14</b> to treat an indication or condition in the patient. The surgeon can be provided with a plurality of pre-constructed systems <b>12</b> that have flexible members with varying flexibility characteristics, or, alternatively, be provided with a variety of flexible members with varying flexibility characteristics any one of which can be incorporated into a system <b>12</b> that is constructed during the surgical procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts another embodiment of flexible member <b>14</b>, which is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The flexible member <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> similarly includes the plurality of first portions <b>40</b> including a first material having a first elasticity and the plurality of second portions <b>44</b> including a second material having a second elasticity greater than the first to provide the flexible member <b>14</b> with variable flexibility. However, rather than two first portions <b>40</b> and two second portions <b>44</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the flexible member <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes three first portions <b>40</b> and three second portions <b>44</b>. The flexible member <b>14</b> further includes aperture <b>24</b> extending lengthwise through the body <b>30</b> for receiving connecting member <b>22</b>. It should be understood that the aperture <b>24</b> may be eliminated. The construction of flexible member <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> provides a cross-sectional flexibility gradient that is dependent upon the elastomeric characteristics of the first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts another embodiment of flexible member <b>14</b>, which includes the cylindrical body <b>30</b> including opposing first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> connected by the intermediate portion <b>36</b> extending therebetween. The body <b>30</b> includes one each of two first portions <b>40</b> defining the first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, respectively, and a second portion <b>44</b> defining the intermediate portion <b>36</b>. The first portions include a first material having a first elasticity and the second portion <b>44</b> includes a second material having a second elasticity greater than the first to provide the flexible member <b>14</b> with variable flexibility. The flexible member <b>14</b> further includes optional aperture <b>24</b> extending lengthwise through the body <b>30</b> for receiving connecting member <b>22</b>. The material and/or elasticity thereof for the first portions <b>40</b> may be the same or different. Alternatively, one each of two second portions <b>44</b> may define the first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, respectively, and a first portion <b>40</b> may define the intermediate portion <b>36</b>. This configuration may allow the ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> of the flexible member <b>14</b> to desirably conform to the anchor members <b>16</b>. The construction of flexible member <b>14</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> provides a cross-sectional flexibility gradient that is dependent upon the elastomeric characteristics of the first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts another embodiment of flexible member <b>14</b>, which is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Rather than two first portions <b>40</b> defining first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, respectively, two each of four first portions <b>40</b> substantially define the first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, respectively. To that end, each of the two first portions <b>40</b> of the first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> define opposing substantially semicircular portions, which together are situated only substantially circumferentially about the lengthwise central axis <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> depict another embodiment of flexible member <b>14</b>, which is also similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Specifically, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the first portion <b>40</b> defines a half-pipe shape that extends along the length of central axis <b>38</b>. The second portion overlays the half-pipe shape and generally defines a hemispherical shape, whereby the first portion <b>40</b> substantially defines the first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and the second portion <b>44</b> substantially defines the intermediate portion <b>36</b>. Thus, the first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> substantially include a first material having a first elasticity and the intermediate portion <b>36</b> substantially includes a second material having a second elasticity greater than the first to provide the flexible member <b>14</b> with variable flexibility. In an alternate embodiment, the second portion <b>44</b> defines the half-pipe shape and the first portion <b>40</b> overlays the half-pipe shape and generally defines the hemispherical shape. The flexible member <b>14</b> further includes optional aperture <b>24</b> extending lengthwise through the body <b>30</b> for receiving the connecting member <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts another embodiment of flexible member <b>14</b>, which includes cylindrical body <b>30</b> including opposing first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> connected by intermediate portion <b>36</b> extending therebetween. The body <b>30</b> further includes lengthwise central axis <b>38</b> and a plurality of first portions <b>40</b>, i.e., two first portions, including a first material having a first elasticity and a plurality of second portions <b>44</b>, i.e., two second portions, including a second material having a second elasticity greater than the first to provide the flexible member <b>14</b> with variable flexibility. The first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> are alternately situated circumferentially about the lengthwise central axis <b>38</b> along the length of the body <b>30</b>. The flexible member <b>14</b> further includes optional aperture <b>24</b> extending lengthwise through the body <b>30</b> for receiving connecting member <b>22</b>. As shown, first end <b>32</b> is less flexible than second end <b>34</b>, and the intermediate portion <b>36</b> has alternating regions of flexibility. In an alternate embodiment, the first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> may be switched such as to provide a variation in flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts another embodiment of flexible member <b>14</b>, which includes cylindrical body <b>30</b> including opposing first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> connected by intermediate portion <b>36</b> extending therebetween. The body <b>30</b> further includes lengthwise central axis <b>38</b> and first portion <b>40</b> including a first material having a first elasticity and second portion <b>44</b> including a second material having a second elasticity greater than the first to provide the flexible member <b>14</b> with variable flexibility. The first portion <b>40</b> spirals along the length of the body <b>30</b> with a remainder of the body <b>30</b> including the second portion <b>44</b>. As the spiral extends towards second end <b>34</b>, the spacing between the turns of the spiral increases to provide the flexible member <b>14</b> generally with a cross-sectional and lengthwise flexibility gradient. Other spiral variations may be provided. The flexible member <b>14</b> further includes optional aperture <b>24</b> extending lengthwise through the body <b>30</b> for receiving the connecting member <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As with each flexible member <b>14</b>, the flexible member <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> may be provided in varying lengths, e.g., twelve-inch lengths, so that a surgeon can cut, or shape, the flexible member <b>14</b> to fit between opposing anchor members <b>16</b> along a specific section of spine <b>10</b> as well as to accommodate a desired bending movement of the flexible member <b>14</b>. To that end, during surgery, a surgeon may cut flexible member <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, such as along line <b>50</b>, to provide the flexible members <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, respectively, which have different bending properties due to the spacing of the spiral, such spacing providing variable flexibility.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The spiral configuration of the flexible members <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref>, <b>9</b>A, and <b>9</b>B can allow for more consistent bending forces in all directions and can provide a desirable spring-action effect.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> depict yet another embodiment of flexible member <b>14</b>, which includes cylindrical body <b>30</b> including opposing first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> connected by intermediate portion <b>36</b> extending therebetween. The body <b>30</b> further includes lengthwise central axis <b>38</b> and first portion <b>40</b> including a first material having a first elasticity and second portion <b>44</b> including a second material having a second elasticity greater than the first to provide the flexible member <b>14</b> with variable flexibility. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, each of the first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> are generally triangular-shaped with each base situated at opposing ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, respectively, such that first portion <b>40</b> substantially defines the first end <b>32</b> and second portion <b>44</b> substantially defines the second end <b>34</b>. In other words, the first end <b>32</b> substantially includes the first material and the second end <b>34</b> substantially includes the second material. The flexible member <b>14</b> further includes optional aperture <b>24</b> extending lengthwise through the body <b>30</b> for receiving the connecting member <b>22</b>. This configuration provides one end <b>32</b> that is less flexible than the other end <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The above-described flexible members <b>14</b> can be manufactured using injection molding processes as are known in the art. To that end, the proposed configurations may be injection molded using, for example, a one-step process or a multi-step process involving the materials of the flexible member <b>14</b>. In addition, the desired flexible member <b>14</b> also may be extruded using a conventional thermoplastic extrusion process. Such process utilizes multiple extrusion heads having a die nozzle configuration to feed the materials into an extrusion die to form a well-fused combination of materials, i.e., to form the flexible member <b>14</b>. The flexible member <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> has a cross-sectional and lengthwise flexibility gradient.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> further depicts still another embodiment of flexible member <b>14</b>, which is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. However, the first and second materials of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> include the same type of polymer, e.g., polyurethane, wherein the first and second materials have a predetermined stoichiometry and thermal history, thereby providing the first and second elasticities, respectively, for the first and second portions. Such flexible member with its material may be formed using the precision polyurethane manufacture method and apparatus disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0049002 to Andrews et al., titled &#x201c;Precision Polyurethane Manufacture&#x201d;, which is expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the precision polyurethane manufacture process, a polyurethane having a predetermined stoichiometry and thermal history is generally formed by reacting a multifunctional isocyanate, a polyol and, optionally, a chain extender. At least two reagents selected from the isocyanate, the polyol, the chain extender, any mixture thereof and any pre-polymer formed therefrom are intensively mixed prior to being reactively extruded to form the polyurethane. The process is understood to allow control of reagent stoichiometry, while intimate mixing of the reagents at the molecular level allows the manufacture of tailored linear polyurethanes of narrow molecular weight distribution or narrow polydispersity. Moreover, a known and reproducible thermal history can be imparted to the polymer during synthesis, while overall thermal degradation can be minimized by reducing the number of melt cycles for polyurethane components. Such a process allows the integrated manufacture of a polyurethane resin, finished product or aqueous dispersion, while perturbations of the reaction stoichiometry allows the manufacture of polyurethanes with controlled composition and mass distributions.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the flexible member <b>14</b> includes cylindrical body <b>30</b> including opposing first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> connected by intermediate portion <b>36</b> extending therebetween. The body <b>30</b> further includes lengthwise central axis <b>38</b> and a plurality of first portions <b>40</b>, i.e., two first portions, including a first material having a first elasticity and a plurality of second portions <b>44</b>, i.e., two second portions, including a second material having a second elasticity greater than the first to provide the flexible member <b>14</b> with a variable flexibility. The first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b> extend along the length of the body <b>30</b> and are alternately spaced symmetrically about the axis <b>38</b> of the body <b>30</b>. Again, the first and second materials include the same type of polymer, e.g., polyurethane formed by the precision polyurethane manufacture method discussed above, wherein the material has a predetermined stoichiometry and thermal history thereby providing the first and second elasticities, respectively, for the first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>. The flexible member <b>14</b> further includes optional aperture <b>24</b> extending lengthwise through the body <b>30</b> for receiving the connecting member <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> depicts another embodiment of the flexible member <b>14</b>, which is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> insofar as the first and second materials of the flexible member <b>14</b> include the same type of polymer, e.g., polyurethane, wherein the first and second materials having a predetermined stoichiometry and thermal history, thereby providing the first and second elasticities, respectively, for the first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>. Such flexible member <b>14</b> with its material may be formed using the precision polyurethane manufacture method and apparatus as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">To that end, the flexible member <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> includes cylindrical body <b>30</b> including opposing first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> connected by intermediate portion <b>36</b> extending therebetween. The body <b>30</b> further includes lengthwise central axis <b>38</b> and first portion <b>40</b> including a first material having a first elasticity and second portion <b>44</b> including a second material having a second elasticity greater than the first to provide the flexible member <b>14</b> with a variable flexibility. More specifically, the body <b>30</b> of flexible member <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> defines a flexibility gradient that extends along the length thereof. The flexibility gradient increases in flexibility from the first end <b>32</b> to the opposing second end <b>34</b> to define a plurality of elasticities, which includes the first and second elasticity for the first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>, respectively. The first and second ends <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> substantially define first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>, which include first and second material respectively. That material has a predetermined stoichiometry and thermal history thereby providing the first and second elasticities, respectively, for the first and second portions <b>40</b>, <b>44</b>. In an alternate embodiment, the body <b>30</b> can define a flexibility gradient that extends radially outward from the lengthwise central axis <b>38</b>. Such flexibility gradient can increase or decrease in flexibility in a direction radially outwardly from and circumferentially about the lengthwise central axis. Other variations are contemplated and understood by one having ordinary skill in the art. The flexible member <b>14</b> further includes optional aperture <b>24</b> extending lengthwise through the body <b>30</b> for receiving the connecting member <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Accordingly, there is provided flexible member <b>14</b> having variable flexibility for use with a dynamic stabilization system <b>12</b> to provide dynamic stability to a person's spine <b>10</b>. Such variability in flexibility, for example, can provide surgeons with greater options in selecting the most appropriate flexible member <b>14</b> for placement at a specific location along the spine <b>10</b>, such selection being dictated by the desired bending movement of the flexible member <b>14</b> at that location.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The materials that are used in the flexible members <b>14</b> of the present invention may be selected from any suitable biocompatible material as known in the art. By way of example, the materials can include rigid or flexible metals, ceramic materials, carbon fiber, polymeric materials, and/or composite materials. The metals can include titanium or nickel-titanium alloy (NiTiNOL) wire, such as superelastic or shape memory NiTiNOL, for example. The polymeric materials can include, for example, hydrogels (e.g., polyacrylamides), silicone elastomers (natural or synthetic), epoxies (e.g., polyamide epoxy), urethanes, and thermoplastic materials, such as polyurethane, polyethylene (e.g., UHMWPE), polyethylene terephthalate (e.g., Sulene&#xae;), polypropylene, polyamide (e.g., Nylon), polyester, acetal, polycarbonate, thermoplastic elastomers, and the like. The composite materials may include, for example, resin impregnated graphite or aramid fibers (e.g., liquid crystal polymers such as Kevlar&#xae;), or NiTi dispersed in polyethylene terephthalate. The composite materials may be tailored to define a flexibility gradient, for example, by varying the type and/or amount of filler material therein, which may be controlled or metered during manufacture thereof. Such composite material, thus, can provide the flexible member <b>14</b> with a flexibility gradient.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Again, the selected second material has an elasticity different than, either greater or lower than, the first material to provide the flexible member <b>14</b> with a variable flexibility. Also, additional materials (third, fourth, fifth materials) with elasticities different than the first and second materials or the same as one of the first and second materials can be used. Determining the elasticity (or moduli of elasticity) of materials is well known in the art. It will be recognized that various other materials suitable for implantation of the flexible member <b>22</b> within the human body and for providing stabilization of the spine while maintaining flexibility may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The connecting member <b>22</b> generally includes a flexible structure made from materials such as NiTiNOL, a stainless steel coiled wire, or a polymer-based material like polyethylene-terephthalate. Alternatively, the connecting member <b>22</b> can be a rigid structure or a combination of a rigid and flexible structure for connection to anchors <b>16</b>. It will be recognized that various other materials suitable for implantation of the connecting member <b>22</b> within the human body and for providing stabilization of the spine while maintaining flexibility may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A-14C</figref>, an alternative embodiment of dynamic stabilization system or implant <b>12</b> is shown including flexible member <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> positioned between anchor members <b>16</b>. In this embodiment, the connecting members <b>22</b> include flanges <b>52</b> provided with outwardly projecting annular hubs <b>53</b> and a securing element in the form of a setscrew <b>54</b>. The setscrew <b>54</b> is seated within a threaded aperture <b>56</b> on the hub <b>53</b> to secure the flange <b>52</b> and hub <b>53</b> arrangement to shank <b>58</b> of the system <b>12</b> and against the flexible member <b>14</b>. The system <b>12</b> can be assembled pre- or intra-operatively. Once assembled, the system <b>12</b> is positioned in the top loading anchor members <b>16</b> and secured thereto by the threadable cap members <b>26</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, resulting in the arrangement and installation of the flexible member <b>14</b>. A cross-sectional view of the system <b>12</b> and associated anchor members <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>.</p>
