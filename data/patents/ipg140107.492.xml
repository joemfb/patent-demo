<p id="p-0006" num="0005">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates to chin guards for use with helmets. More particularly, the present invention relates to chin guards that have protective cups associated therewith for protection of the chin of the wearer. More particularly, the present invention relates to chin guards apparatus that have at least one resilient layer extending across an interior surface of the protective cup.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Including Information Disclosed Under 37 CFR 1.97 and 37 CFR 1.98.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention relates to improvements in protective headgear such as football helmets, lacrosse helmets, hockey helmets, bull riding helmets, motorcycle and bicycle helmets, and helmets for other activities where protection from head impact and injury is desirable. The invention also relates to protective pads, particularly chin pads.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Protective helmets to minimize head injuries have been known and used for many years. For example, football helmet shells have been produced from injection molded ABS, or polycarbonate plastic. Helmets intended for youth usage have usually been produced from ABS plastic, and helmets for adult usage have usually been produced from polycarbonate plastic. ABS plastic is significantly less expensive than polycarbonate, but ABS plastic is not as structurally rigid as polycarbonate. As the level of intensity of contact in youth football is significantly lower than that at the adult level, ABS has been accepted as a satisfactory material for use at the youth level. For adult helmets, however, the structural rigidity of the polycarbonate material is essential to minimize the flex and deformation of the shell under extreme impact conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment (NOCSAE) has been responsible for setting minimal performance criteria for football helmets. The minimum standard acceptance level measured by the Severity Index (IS) is set at 1200. Through the continuous testing of NOCSAE, it has been established that the rigidity of polycarbonate shells, in comparison to ABS shells, leads to significantly lower IS results. From these tests, it is believed that there is a correlation between the rigidity of the shell material and improved safety performance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Protection can also be improved by the addition of a face mask attached to the helmet. For example, football helmets are usually equipped over the exposed face area with a vinyl coated wire or other metal structure, or an injection molded plastic face mask. The obvious purpose of the face mask is to protect the face of the player from injury, while not obstructing the player's vision unnecessarily. The addition of a face mask can also increase the rigidity of the shell which improves the IS performance. Helmets are usually tested without face masks so that the IS performance of a helmet with the mask will somewhat exceed the test standard.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Face masks have been mounted to the exterior surface of the helmet shell behind the front edge of the helmet face opening. This design can, under certain conditions, contribute to serious injury. Helmet shells are specifically designed with smooth spherical surfaces to allow the shells to glance and slide on impact.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Protective helmets usually include a chin strap to retain the helmet, particularly during impact. In the past, chin straps were frequently constructed using a molded plastic cup made of compression or injection-molded plastic material. A pad, usually of a felt or foam material, was bonded or otherwise attached to the plastic cup. This cup construction is preferable to non-padded chin straps which have been standard equipment on football helmets. Non-padded chin straps do not offer any impact protection to the chin area, and only serve to secure the helmet to the player's head. Padded chin cups provide an added measure of protection to the chin from impacts, in addition to securing the helmet to the player's head.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Improvement in the impact absorption performance of padded chin straps is desirable. Most molded plastic chin cups currently used are molded in a manner which allows the formed cup to flex upon impact. An improved construction is a rigid material which does not flex on impact to an undesirable degree, thus distributing the impact force over a larger area of the chin.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present inventor is the owner of U.S. Pat. No. 6,298,493, issued on Oct. 1, 2001 to Schiebl et al. U.S. Pat. No. 6,298,493 describes a protective headgear that comprises a rigid shell with face pads that can be released and removed while the headgear is still on a person's head. A protective chin guard is attached to the headgear by way of the face pads. The chin guard includes a substantially rigid shell with an insert made of a flexible bladder filled with a shock-absorbing fluid. The headgear includes a shell made of an inner and outer material layered over an internal foam core to effect both strength and lightweight construction.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The cup associated with the protective shell of the chin strap often has had an imperfect fit with the wearer's chin. In certain circumstances, the user may desire to have enhanced protection against impacts. The wearer may also desire a more comfortable fit with the cup of the shell of the protective chin strap and more comfortable contact between the chin and an interior surface of the chin guard.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In prior art chin straps, there is often an inferior connection between the actual chin guard and the straps. In order to achieve maximum integrity, it is important for the straps to be securely connected to the chin guard. If the strap should become disconnected or torn from the chin guard, then inadequate protection of the person wearing the chin guard will result. Additionally, many connecting structures between the straps in the chin guard involve a rather complicated looping of straps through multiple slots formed on the chin guard. This can create an unattractive appearance and an inadequate fit. As such, a need has developed so as to provide a chin guard wherein the straps can be easily and adjustably connected to the chin guard in a secure and stable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">It is an object of the present invention to provide a chin guard apparatus which maximizes the protection and comfort of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a chin guard apparatus whereby the cushion of the cup can be adapted to properly fit the facial configuration and desires of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It is another object of the present invention to provide a chin guard apparatus that enhances shock absorption.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It is another object of the present invention to provide a chin guard which allows the straps to be easily and securely connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It is a further object of the present invention to provide a chin guard whereby the straps of the chin guard are more securely retained by the chin guard.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is still another object of the present invention to provide a chin guard which avoids unnecessary looping and buckling of the straps to the chin guard.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is another object of the present invention to provide a chin guard apparatus that is relatively inexpensive, easy to manufacture and easy to assemble.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a reading of the attached specification and appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention is a chin guard apparatus for use with a helmet. The chin guard has a shell with a cup suitable for fitting upon a human chin. The shell has a first strap-receiving slot on one side thereof and a second strap-receiving slot on an opposite side thereof. Each of the first and second strap-receiving slots open through a thickness of the shell. A resilient layer is received within the cup of the shell. This resilient layer is suitable for contacting the human chin</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, each of the first and second strap-receiving slots extend transverse to a longitudinal axis of the shell. The first strap-receiving slot is a single slot on the one side of the shell. The second strap-receiving slot is a single slot on the opposite side of the shell.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The resilient layer is in surface-to-surface contact with an inner surface of the shell. The resilient layer has a padded section formed centrally on a side of the resilient layer opposite the shell.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment of the present invention, the resilient layer is of a foam material. In other embodiments of the present invention, the resilient layer can be of a fabric, rubber, elastomeric, silicone or other soft materials.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A first strap extends through the first strap-receiving slot. A second strap extends through the second strap-receiving slot. Each of the first and second straps has a portion positioned between an inner surface of the resilient layer and an inner surface of shell.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The shell has an outer peripheral edge. The shell also has first channel extending from the first strap-receiving slot to the outer peripheral edge. The first strap has a portion extending along this first channel. The shell further has a second channel extending from second strap-receiving slot to the outer peripheral edge. The second strap has a portion extending along this second channel</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The single strap-receiving slot on opposite sides of the shell assures a proper and secure connection between the straps and the chin guard. Since the slots are formed through the rigid polymeric material of the shell, the straps are connected to a rigid material rather than a flexible, and possibly tearable, material. The use of the transverse orientation of the slots assures a proper threading of the strap through the shell of the chin guard. The alignment of the strap is assured through the use of the channels associated with each of the slots. The present invention avoids the unnecessary looping and cross-threading associated with other chin guards. As such, the straps can be installed in a quick, easy and secure manner. The strap can have portions that extend outwardly from the shell of the chin guard so as to be secured to the high and low hook-ups of a helmet.</p>

Holes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are formed through the shell <b>12</b> so as to allow air circulation to contact the chin of the user. Similarly, as will be described hereinafter, the resilient layer <b>14</b> also includes holes <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> which are aligned with the through holes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and <b>26</b>, respectively, of the shell <b>12</b>. This arrangement of aligned holes ensures proper air circulation to the chin of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The shell <b>12</b> also includes a first generally semi-circular opening <b>36</b> and a second semi-circular opening <b>38</b> formed centrally of the cup <b>16</b>. The semi-circular openings <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> will receive semi-circular shaped insert members <b>40</b> and <b>42</b>, respectively, of the resilient layer <b>14</b>. A bumper member <b>44</b> is received between the semi-circular openings <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> so as to extend thereacross. Bumper member <b>44</b> can provide shock absorbency at the very center of the shell <b>12</b>. The bumper member <b>44</b> can be formed of various materials.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The shell <b>12</b> includes a slot <b>46</b> formed on one side and another slot formed on the opposite side. The slot <b>46</b> is suitable for receiving the strap which serves to connect the chin guard <b>10</b> to a helmet. A suitable channel <b>48</b> can be formed on the resilient member <b>14</b> generally adjacent to the slot <b>46</b> so as to provide a suitable guide for the chin strap extending thereacross.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The shell <b>12</b> is formed of a rigid polymeric material while the resilient layer <b>14</b> is formed of a foam or other soft material. Since there are only two main components of the chin guard <b>10</b> of the present invention, the chin guard <b>10</b> can be assembled in an easy manner. Additionally, the manufacturing costs associated with forming the chin guard <b>10</b> of the present invention are minimal. These goals can be accomplished while, at the same time, providing maximum protection to the wearer of the chin guard. Since the resilient layer <b>14</b> overlies the outer peripheral edge <b>18</b> of the shell <b>12</b>, sharp contacts between the outer peripheral edge <b>18</b> of the shell <b>12</b> and the face of the wearer are effectively cushioned.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a front view of the chin guard <b>10</b> of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the holes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> are fully illustrated. Each of these holes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> has a generally oval or oblong configuration. The respective holes <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>50</b> of the resilient layer <b>14</b> are illustrated as aligned with the respective holes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. The oval nature of the holes <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> assures full air circulation to the wearer even in the event that the resilient layer <b>14</b> has shifted slightly out of position. The semi-circular openings <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are illustrated as located within the center of the cup <b>16</b> of shell <b>12</b>. The bumper member <b>44</b> has a generally reverse Z-shaped configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can be seen that there is a first strap <b>47</b> that extends through the slot <b>46</b>. Another strap <b>49</b> extends through the slot <b>52</b>. Each of these slots <b>46</b> and <b>52</b> extends in an orientation generally transverse to a longitudinal axis of the shell <b>12</b>. It can be seen that there is a single slot <b>46</b> on one side of the shell <b>12</b> and a single slot <b>52</b> on an opposite side of the shell <b>12</b>. Each of the slots <b>46</b> and <b>52</b> extends through the thickness of the polymeric material used to form the shell <b>12</b>. The first strap <b>47</b> extends through the slot <b>46</b>. It can be seen that the strap <b>47</b> has a portion <b>51</b> that will extend along the channel <b>48</b> formed adjacent to the slot <b>46</b>. As such, the channel <b>48</b> will assure the proper alignment of the strap <b>47</b>. The strap <b>47</b> also has another portion <b>53</b> that extends outwardly from the backside of the shell <b>12</b>. This second portion <b>53</b> will extend between the inner surface of the shell <b>12</b> and the inner surface of the resilient layer <b>14</b>. Each of the portions <b>51</b> and <b>53</b> extends outwardly of the shell <b>12</b>. A suitable mechanism, such as a strap splitter, can be utilized so as to properly align the portions <b>51</b> and <b>53</b> so that the opposite ends of the strap <b>47</b> can be secured to the high or low hook-ups of a football helmet.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The strap-receiving slot <b>52</b> is formed on the opposite side of the shell <b>12</b> from the strap-receiving slot <b>46</b>. The strap <b>49</b> will extend through the slot <b>52</b>. As can be seen, the strap <b>49</b> has a first portion <b>55</b> that will extend along the channel associated with this slot <b>52</b>. The strap <b>49</b> will also have a second portion <b>57</b> that will extend between the inner surface of the shell <b>12</b> and the inner surface of the resilient layer <b>14</b>. Each of the portions <b>55</b> and <b>57</b> can be threaded through a suitable strap splitter, or other mechanism, so as to be secured to the high or low hook-ups of a football helmet.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The orientation of the straps <b>47</b> and <b>49</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is a significant improvement over the prior art. In the present invention, there are only single slots <b>46</b> and <b>52</b> provided on opposite sides of the shell <b>12</b>. As such, it is not necessary to thread and loop the portions of the respective straps <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> a variety of holes and/or slots. The threading of the strap <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> through the respective slots <b>46</b> and <b>52</b> provides a neat appearance in the area of connection between the straps and the chin guard <b>10</b>. Additionally, since the slots <b>46</b> and <b>52</b> are formed through the thickness of the rigid polymeric material of the shell <b>12</b>, there is an absolutely secure and sound fit between the respective straps <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> and the shell <b>12</b>. As such, any tearing or ripping of the strap is effectively avoided. The respective channels associated with the slots <b>46</b> and <b>52</b> will assure the proper alignment of the portion <b>51</b> of strap <b>47</b> and the portion <b>55</b> of strap <b>49</b>. As such, this can provide an easy guide whereby the straps can be properly secured in a desired location to the helmet.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the interior of the chin guard <b>10</b> of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the resilient layer <b>14</b> is particularly illustrated. The resilient layer <b>14</b> has padded surfaces <b>60</b> formed therein. The padded surfaces <b>60</b> include a rectangular portion <b>62</b> extending centrally across a support layer <b>64</b> of the resilient layer <b>14</b>. The support layer <b>64</b> is positioned so as to be in surface-to-surface contact with the interior surface of the shell <b>12</b>. The padded surfaces <b>60</b> are integrally formed with the support layer <b>64</b>. Finger members <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> and <b>74</b> are also integrally formed with the support layer <b>64</b> and extend in generally spaced relationship to the edges of the rectangular portion <b>62</b>. The finger <b>66</b> has an adjoining portion <b>76</b> connected to the rectangular portion <b>62</b>. The finger <b>68</b> has an adjoining portion <b>78</b> connected to the rectangular portion <b>62</b>. The finger <b>70</b> has an adjoining portion <b>80</b> connected to the rectangular portion <b>62</b>. The finger <b>74</b> has an adjoining portion <b>82</b> connected to the rectangular portion <b>62</b>. The adjoining portions <b>76</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>82</b> are located in a central area of the rectangular portion <b>62</b>. The spacing between the fingers <b>66</b>, <b>68</b>, <b>70</b> and <b>74</b> and the rectangular section <b>62</b> is intended to accommodate the through holes <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and <b>50</b> which are formed through the support layer <b>64</b> are aligned with the respective through holes formed in the shell <b>12</b>. As such, the arrangement of the various padded surfaces <b>60</b> in the resilient layer <b>14</b> assures a proper air flow through the through holes to the chin of the wearer.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a plan view of the chin guard <b>10</b> of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it can be seen that the resilient layer <b>14</b> has a peripheral surface <b>20</b> which overlies and extends rearwardly over the outer peripheral edge <b>18</b> of the shell <b>12</b>. This lengthy overlying relationship assures a protective cushioning effect against any sharp edges of the rigid shell <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the resilient layer <b>14</b> is further illustrated as having its outer periphery <b>20</b> extending over and beyond the outer peripheral edge <b>18</b> of the shell <b>12</b> on opposite sides of the shell <b>12</b>. The channel <b>48</b> is illustrated as formed in a surface of the outer periphery <b>20</b> of the resilient layer <b>14</b> so as to generally align with the slot <b>46</b> formed in the shell <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the manner in which the resilient layer <b>14</b> is received within the shell <b>12</b> of the chin guard <b>10</b> of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the shell <b>12</b> has cup <b>16</b> which serves to receive the cup area <b>90</b> of the resilient layer <b>14</b>. The semi-circular insert members <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are positioned so as to be received by the semi-circular indentations <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> located centrally on the shell <b>12</b>. This arrangement serves to retain the resilient layer <b>14</b> removably within the interior of the cup <b>16</b> of the shell <b>12</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows that the through holes of the resilient layer <b>14</b> are aligned with the through holes of the shell <b>12</b> when the insert members <b>40</b> and <b>42</b> are received within the semi-circular openings <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> of the shell <b>12</b>. The shell <b>12</b> is illustrated as having its outer peripheral edge <b>18</b> slighted flanged outwardly of the shell <b>12</b>. The outer peripheral edge <b>20</b> has a suitable size so as to completely cover this outer peripheral edge <b>18</b> and to provide effective protection against sharp impacts caused by the outer peripheral edge <b>18</b> against the face of the wearer. The resilient layer <b>14</b> is illustrated as having a channels <b>48</b> and <b>54</b> formed on opposite sides thereof so as to align with the strap-receiving slots formed on the shell <b>12</b>. These surfaces provide a guide for the strap which emanates through the slots on the shell <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows he strap splitters <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> which assure the divergent relationships of the respective straps <b>47</b> and <b>49</b>. In particular, strap <b>47</b> extends from the slot in the shell <b>12</b> and has the strap splitter <b>90</b> extending thereover. Strap splitter <b>90</b> has slots formed therein which causes the portions <b>51</b> and <b>53</b> to extend in different direction away from each other. Similarly, strap splitter <b>92</b> has slots formed therein which cause the portions <b>55</b> and <b>57</b> to extend in different directions away from each other. As a result of the strap splitters <b>90</b> and <b>92</b>, the respective portions can be properly directed to the high and/or low hook-ups of the helmet. In the strap splitters <b>90</b> and <b>92</b>, the respective straps <b>47</b> and <b>49</b> will enter generally aligned with each other and then diverge at the opposite end of the strap splitters.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an alternative embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the chin guard assembly <b>100</b> has a shell <b>102</b> and a resilient layer <b>104</b>. The shell <b>102</b> and the resilient layer <b>104</b> have a configuration similar to the previous embodiment. The shell has a first strap-receiving slot <b>106</b> and a second strap-receiving slot <b>108</b>. A first strap <b>110</b> extends through the first strap-receiving slot <b>106</b>. A second strap <b>112</b> extends through the second strap-receiving slot <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Unlike the strap splitters <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> utilizes stops in order to allow the position of the straps <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> to be adjustably fixed. In particular, strap <b>110</b> has a first rivet <b>114</b> affixed to a first portion <b>116</b> adjacent to one side of the strap-receiving slot <b>106</b>. Strap <b>110</b> has a second rivet <b>118</b> affixed to a second portion <b>120</b> adjacent to an opposite of the strap-receiving slot <b>106</b>. Similarly, the strap <b>112</b> has a first rivet <b>122</b> adjacent one side of strap-receiving slot <b>108</b> and a second rivet <b>124</b> adjacent to an opposite side of the strap-receiving slot <b>108</b>. The rivets <b>114</b>, <b>118</b>, <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> extend outwardly of a surface of the respective straps so as to have a thickness greater than the width of the respective strap-receiving slots <b>106</b> and <b>108</b>. As such, the rivets act as stops so as to prevent excessive movement of the shell <b>102</b> relative to the straps <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The use of the rivets (or stops) unexpectedly facilitates the ability to angularly adjust the straps <b>110</b> and <b>112</b> relative to the high and low hook-ups of the helmet. The rivets can be conveniently installed subsequent to the connection of the shell <b>102</b> with the straps <b>110</b> and <b>112</b>. As such, the length of the straps can be widely adjustable to the preferences of the user. The number of separable components is significantly reduced. Additionally, the costs associated with the rivets is minimal. In certain helmets with broadly extending face masks, the rivets will not interfere with such face masks.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The foregoing disclosure and description of the invention is illustrative and explanatory thereof. Various changes in the details of the illustrated construction can be made within the scope of the appended claims without departing from the true spirit of the invention. The present invention should only be limited by the following claims and their legal equivalents.</p>
