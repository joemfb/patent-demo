<p id="p-0006" num="0005">1. Technical Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention relates generally to golf training aids, and more specifically to a pair of glasses utilized to maintain vision on a golf ball during a swing of a golf club.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One of the most difficult tasks during play of the game of golf is that of keeping one's head still to maintain eye contact with the ball that is the object of a golf swing. If the player of a golf stroke does not keep his/her eyes on the ball, typically the ball will be driven on an erroneous, inaccurate, course other than that desired by the golfer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">When making a golf stroke, a golfer may often believe that he/she is keeping his/her eyes on the ball, when, in fact, only peripheral vision is being utilized to observe the ball, which means that the golfer's head is actually turned. Accordingly, it is desirable to prevent the use of peripheral vision as much as possible, keeping the golfer's eyes directly upon the ball.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One previous approach to resolving the above-referenced problem was to provide rectangular slit openings in the normal plane of a pair of opaque eyeglasses. However, due to the proximity of the eyeball to the lens, quite a bit of peripheral vision is permitted by this previous device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Various other devices have also tried to address the problem of keeping a golfer's eyes upon the ball by providing different shapes of slits in either an opaque lens, by providing blocking panels of various shapes on the lens, or by providing registration lines on the lens. Again, the close proximity to the golfer's eyeball permits a large amount of peripheral vision to be utilized, thereby defeating the ability to control the golfer's head movement.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Other devices provide an aperture positioned well forward of the eyeball of a golfer, but does not obscure side vision, thereby permitting distraction of the golfer since his/her peripheral vision is not restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Therefore, it is readily apparent that there is a need for a pair of golf training glasses that prevent the use of peripheral vision, thereby preventing distraction of the golfer and helping the golfer to maintain his/her head aligned with the ball and his/her eyes upon the ball.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Briefly described, in a preferred embodiment, the present invention overcomes the above-mentioned disadvantages and meets the recognized need for such a device by providing a pair of golf training glasses having protruding apertures extending forward from the plane of the normal lens portion of the glasses which are opaque. The protruding apertures are angled on their sides to allow some directed movement of the eyeball to observe other than directly forward when necessary, while at the same time restricting peripheral vision along a line parallel to the line formed between the golfer's head and the ball that is the object of the golf swing.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to its major aspects and broadly stated, the present invention in its preferred form is a pair of golf training glasses comprising a front having left and right extensions extending generally perpendicular to the front and forwardly disposed from the front, and arms that extend rearward to support the golf training glasses on a golfer's head. The left and right extensions respectively comprise left outside and right outside panels that are disposed at an angle of approximately ninety degrees to the front and the left and right extensions also respectively comprise left inside and right inside panels disposed at an angle of approximately one hundred and twenty degrees to the front. The left and right extensions each further comprise top panels and bottom panels. The inside panels, outside panels top panels and bottom panels form a visual aperture in the extensions.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The front may be slightly curved, wherein the left and right extensions extend generally perpendicular to a line tangential to the front.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A golfer's eyes are maintained focused on a golf ball by disposing a pair of the golf training glasses on the golfer's head. The golfer addresses the golf ball with a golf clubhead. The golfer's eyesight is restricted and constrained along sight lines by the left outside and right outside panels while the golfer performs a golf swing by impacting the golf ball with the golf clubhead. By these means, peripheral vision is prevented beyond a defined sight area, thereby avoiding distractions and facilitating maintenance of the golfer's eyes upon the ball.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">More specifically, the present invention is a pair of golf training glasses having a front, a left extension, a right extension, arms, a nosepiece, an upper portion and a base portion. The left extension comprises a left aperture and the right extension comprises a right aperture. The right and left apertures comprise top panels and bottom panels.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The left extension comprises a left inside panel and a left outside panel and the right extension comprises a right inside panel and a right outside panel. The left inside panel forms an angle of approximately one hundred and twenty degrees to the front and the left outside panel forms an angle of approximately ninety degrees to the front. The right inside panel forms an angle of approximately one hundred and twenty degrees to the front and the right outside panel forms an angle of approximately ninety degrees to the front.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In use, a golfer places the golf training glasses on his/her head, thereby restricting the golfer's sight along generally parallel sight lines that define a sight area that includes a golf ball suitably teed up, or placed on a ground surface, and the clubhead portion of a selected golf club disposed behind the golf ball as the golfer addresses the ball. As the golfer withdraws the clubhead in performing a golf swing, the golfer keeps his/her head positioned so that the ball remains within the sight area, thereby minimizing any movement of his/her head. Additionally, the left outside panel and the right outside panel prevent the golfer from distraction to peripheral vision of any objects or any movements outside of the sight lines, which is particularly important during the golf swing. The golfer's vision is further focused directly on the ball via the left inside panel or the right inside panel depending on whether the golfer is right-handed or left-handed, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The front may have a general curvature or may be planar. When the front is planar, the front is disposed generally perpendicular to the golfer's sight area. If the front is curved, the front comprises a tangential line that is disposed generally perpendicular to the golfer's sight area.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Accordingly, a feature and advantage of the present invention is its ability to assist a golfer to keep his/her eyes focused upon the golf ball while performing a golf swing.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Another feature and advantage of the present invention is its ability to prevent distractions that might impact a golfer's peripheral vision.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Still another feature and advantage of the present invention is its ability to prevent a golfer from utilizing his/her peripheral vision during a golf swing.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Yet another feature and advantage of the present invention is its ability to help a golfer keep his/her head still during a golf swing.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Still a further feature and advantage of the present invention is that it reduces common swing errors and results in more accurate golf shots.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Yet still another feature and advantage of the present invention is that it helps a golfer keep his/her head still.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent to one skilled in the art from the following description and claims when read in light of the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, the present invention in a preferred embodiment is pair of golf training glasses <b>10</b>, wherein golf training glasses <b>10</b> comprise front <b>20</b>, left extension <b>30</b>, right extension <b>40</b>, arms <b>50</b>, nosepiece <b>60</b>, upper portion <b>110</b> and base portion <b>120</b>. Left extension <b>30</b> comprises left aperture <b>100</b> and right extension <b>40</b> comprises right aperture <b>90</b>. Right and left apertures <b>90</b>, <b>100</b> comprise top panels <b>70</b> and bottom panels <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Left extension <b>30</b> further comprises left inside panel <b>31</b> and left outside panel <b>33</b> and right extension <b>40</b> further comprises right inside panel <b>41</b> and right outside panel <b>43</b>. Left inside panel <b>31</b> forms angle <b>34</b> of approximately one hundred and twenty degrees to front <b>20</b> and left outside panel <b>33</b> forms angle <b>32</b> of approximately ninety degrees to front <b>20</b>. Right inside panel <b>41</b> forms angle <b>44</b> of approximately one hundred and twenty degrees to front <b>20</b> and right outside panel <b>43</b> forms angle <b>42</b> of approximately ninety degrees to front <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Optionally, left extension <b>30</b> or right extension <b>40</b> could be covered by cap <b>25</b>, wherein cap <b>25</b> comprises, for exemplary purposes only, rubber, and wherein cap <b>25</b> covers whichever of left extension <b>30</b> or right extension <b>40</b> to which it is applied, thereby blocking vision from that extension.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In use, golfer G places golf training glasses <b>10</b> on his/her head H, wherein golf training glasses <b>10</b> are disposed to provide sight lines SL, and wherein sight lines SL define sight area SA. Golfer G addresses ball G, placing clubhead C behind ball. As golfer G withdraws clubhead C in performing a golf swing, golfer G keeps head H positioned so that ball B remains within sight area SA, thereby minimizing any movement of head H. Additionally, left outside panel <b>33</b> and right outside panel <b>43</b> prevent golfer G from distraction to peripheral vision by any objects or movement outside of sight lines SL, particularly during swinging action to drive ball B with clubhead C.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, left inside panel <b>31</b> and/or right inside panel <b>41</b> narrow golfer G's eyesight within sight lines SL, particularly concentrating vision on the ball via the left eye of a right-handed golfer or the right eye of a left-handed golfer. Further, top panels <b>70</b> and bottom panels <b>80</b> prevent distractions from above and below golfer's vision.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When desired, cap <b>25</b> is disposed selectively on left extension <b>30</b> or right extension <b>40</b>, thereby blocking vision through the selected extension. In such fashion, golfer G can focus on better control of his/her swing via concentration of vision on his/her stronger or weaker eye E.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Front <b>20</b> may have a curvature or be planar. When front <b>20</b> is planar, front <b>20</b> is disposed generally perpendicular to golfer's sight area SA. If front <b>20</b> is curved, front <b>20</b> comprises tangential line <b>21</b>, wherein tangential line <b>21</b> is disposed generally perpendicular to golfer's sight area SA.</p>
