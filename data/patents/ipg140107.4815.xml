<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application relates to digital image files.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">When a user captures an image using a digital camera, for example, this single exposure can result in a pair of image files associated with the captured image. One of the pair is an image file in the raw format, which has not been processed or compressed and thus has all of the original image information available. The second file of the pair is a processed and/or compressed image file that typically has lost some of the pixel information compared to the raw image file. One example of the corresponding pair of image files is the RAW+JPEG pair, where JPEG is a common file format technology used by digital cameras. The RAW image file represents an unprocessed image file that retains all of the originally obtained pixel data. The JPEG image file is a compressed image file that, as a result of the compression, has lost some of the original pixel data of the captured image. The JPEG image file necessarily loses at least some pixel information because standard JPEG compression is lossy.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The JPEG image file may be visibly different from the RAW image file because the JPEG image file has gone through camera processing&#x2014;for example, white balance processing, data compression and the like. For example, the JPEG image file may look more saturated than the RAW image file. The JPEG image file typically is a result of processing the RAW image by decreasing the dynamic range and performing compression. The resulting JPEG image file is small in size and easy to work with.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The RAW+JPEG pair format can allow a user to obtain two image files from a single exposure (e.g. capturing an image) on a camera device. After shooting a RAW image file on a camera device, a corresponding JPEG image file can be generated at the same time. The RAW+JPEG pair is not obtained from two different exposures in that the shutter of the camera is not fired twice, but rather the image is captured once and saved in the two different formats.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Methods, systems and computer program products are described for managing RAW+JPEG pairs.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, a method includes displaying, at a data processing device, a preview of images available for import from a storage device. Each image is associated with a pair of image files obtained from a single image capture. The image file pair includes a compressed image file and a raw image file. Additionally, the method includes importing, at the data processing device, both the raw image file and the compressed image file of the pair associated with at least one of the images. The method includes receiving user input identifying, at the data processing device, one of the pair of corresponding image files as a master image file for the associated image. Also, the method includes displaying, at the data processing device, the identified master image file for the associated image.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Implementations can optionally include one or more of the following features. The master image file can be displayed to the user to receive user modification of the image file pair through the master image file. Identifying at least one of the pair of corresponding image files as a master image file for the associated image can include presenting a choice to the user to dock the raw image file and the corresponding compressed image file together for the associated image as linked image files or to identify the image files in the pair as independent image files. When the image files in the pair are docked together, one of the linked image files can be identified as the master image file one at a time. When the image files in the pair are independent image files, both image files in the pair can be identified as the master file at the same time. Displaying the identified master image file for the associated image can include displaying one of the linked image files at a time or displaying both of the independent image files at the same time based on the identifying. The compressed image file can include a Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) compatible file. The storage device can be included in a digital camera.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another aspect, a method can include displaying, at a data processing device, a preview of images available for import from a storage device. Each image is associated with a pair of image files obtained from a single image capture. The image file pair includes a compressed image file and a raw image file. The method includes importing, at the data processing device, the compressed image file of the pair for each imported image. The method includes receiving, at the data processing device, user input adjusting an import setting to identify a corresponding raw image file for at least one of the imported compressed image files. Additionally, the method includes importing, at the data processing device, the corresponding raw image file from the storage device based on the adjusted import setting.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Implementations can optionally include one or more of the following features. The method can include receiving user input applying metadata to at least one of the imported compressed image files. The user input adjusting the import setting can include information to adjust a filter parameter based on the applied metadata. The corresponding raw image file can be automatically identified for at least one of the imported compressed image files based on the filter parameter. Applying the metadata can include creating a file containing the metadata and pointing the created metadata file to both the compressed image file and the corresponding raw image file. The applied metadata can include non-pixel information related to at least one of caption, global positioning satellite (GPS) coordinate, sharpness or white balance. Applying the metadata can include creating a separate file for the raw image file and the compressed image file. Applying the metadata can include applying a rating to the at least one imported compressed image file. Automatically identifying the corresponding raw image file for at least one of the imported compressed image files based on the filter parameter can include searching for raw image files that meet the applied rating; and importing the corresponding raw image files that meet the applied rating. Additionally, the compressed image file can include a Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) compatible file.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In another aspect, a method includes importing, at a data processing device, one of a pair of image files associated with a captured image. The image file pair includes a compressed image file and a raw image file. The method includes receiving user input applying, at the data processing device, an image adjustment to the imported one of the corresponding pair. The method includes identifying, at the data processing device, whether the applied adjustment is designated for automatic association with the both the compressed image file and the raw image file in the image file pair. The method includes associating, at the data processing device, the applied image adjustment to the other file in the image file pair when identifying the applied adjustment as being designated for association with both the compressed image file and the raw image file in the image file pair. Additionally, the method includes displaying, at the data processing device, one or both of the compressed image file and the raw image file in the image file pair associated with the captured image with the applied image adjustment based on the identifying and associating.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Implementations can optionally include one or more of the following features. The compressed image file can include a Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) compatible file. The image adjustment can include metadata generated by the user. The method can include applying the image adjustment to both the compressed image file and the raw image file of the image file pair based on the receiving, identifying and associating. Identifying the applied image adjustment as being designated for association with both the compressed image file and the raw image can include identifying the applied image adjustment as matching one of available image adjustments designated to be applied to both the compressed image file and the raw image file. The available image adjustments designated to be applied to both the compressed image file and the raw image file can include at least one of crop, flip or straighten. Identifying the applied image adjustment as being designated for association with both the compressed image file and the raw image can include identifying the applied image adjustment as not matching one of available image adjustments not designated to be applied to both the compressed image file and the raw image file. The available image adjustments not designated to be applied to both the compressed image file and the raw image file comprises at least one of tone or white balance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect, a system includes an image management system to import a select image from a storage device. The image management system can include a preview unit to present a choice of images available or import. Each image is associated with a pair of image files obtained from a single image capture. The image file pair includes a compressed image file and a corresponding raw image file. The image management system includes an import unit to import at least one of the available images from the storage device including importing both the raw image file and the corresponding compressed image file of the pair associated with each imported image. The image management system includes an image identification unit to identify the raw image file, the corresponding compressed image file or both files of the pair associated with each imported image to be displayed. The system includes a user input unit to communicate with the image management system. The user input unit is configured to receive a selection of at least one of the available images and, a selection of at least one of the pair of files associated with the selected image for display. The system includes a display unit to communicate with the image management system. The display unit is configured to display the selected image file of the pair associated with the imported image based on the received selection.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Implementations can optionally include one or more of the following features. The compressed image file can include a Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) compatible file.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another aspect, a computer-readable medium embodying instructions, when executed by a processor, causes a data processing device to perform operations including displaying a preview of images available for import from a storage device. Each image is associated with a pair of image files obtained from a single image capture, and the image file pair includes a compressed image file and a raw image file obtained from a single image capture. The operations include importing at least one of the image files available from the storage device that includes importing one of the two files from the pair for each imported image. Importing at least one of the image files includes applying metadata to the imported file from the pair for at least one of the imported image. Importing at least one of the image files includes automatically associating the applied metadata to the other file in the pair. Importing at least one of the image files includes identifying at least one imported image to import the other file in the image file pair based on the applied metadata. Additionally, importing at least one of the image files includes importing the other file in the image file pair for the identified at least one imported image.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Implementations can optionally include one or more of the following features. Importing one of the two files from the corresponding pair for each imported image can include importing the compressed image file; and identifying at least one imported image to import the other file in the pair based on the applied metadata including setting a filter parameter based on the applied metadata. Applying the metadata can include creating a file containing the metadata; and pointing the created metadata file to both the compressed image file and the corresponding raw image file. The applied metadata can include a user rating of the image associated with the imported file. Applying the metadata can include creating a separate file for the raw image file and the compressed image file; and sync the two separate metadata files.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The subject matter described in this specification can potentially provide one or more advantages. For example, managing the RAW+JPEG pairs as described can provide various camera support function. By importing the JPEG files of the corresponding pairs first, the images can be imported faster than importing both file types. Because the JPEG files are smaller in size, due to its compressed nature, JPEG files are easier to adjust. Any adjustments applied to the JPEG files can be automatically attributed or associated with the RAW files of the corresponding pairs. Thus, a user can import one of the two image files from each corresponding pair (e.g., the JPEG file) and import the other file (e.g., RAW file) from the corresponding pair at a later time. Once the JPEG files are imported, metadata, such as user ratings, can be assigned to the imported JPEG files. Then, filter functions can be set to import a subset of all available RAW image files that match the desired metadata information. Also, when viewing the images, the JPEG, the RAW or both image files can be displayed to the user. The displayed files can be deemed to be the master file to be manipulated by the user. Also, both files in the corresponding pair can be displayed separately as two different masters. In this case, both files can be manipulated by the user separately.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The subject matter described in this specification can be implemented as a method or as a system or using computer program products, tangibly embodied in computer readable medium, such as a CD-ROM, a DVD-ROM, a semiconductor memory, and a hard disk. Such computer program products may cause a data processing apparatus to conduct one or more operations described in this specification.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In addition, the subject matter described in this specification can also be implemented as a system including a processor and a memory coupled to the processor. The memory may encode one or more programs that cause the processor to perform one or more of the method acts described in this specification. Further the subject matter described in this specification can be implemented using various data processing machines.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Techniques, apparatus, systems and computer program product are described for managing RAW+JPEG pairs associated with each image file captured from a digital camera device, for example. Managing the RAW+JPEG pairs can include selectively importing the RAW and JPEG images from the pairs by adjusting the import settings. The imported RAW+JPEG pairs can be displayed with the RAW, the JPEG or both image files designated as the master image file. The designated and displayed master image file can be modified by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Selecting RAW or JPEG as Master when Importing Images</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows an example graphical user interface (GUI) (<b>100</b>) that can be used to import one or more images from a data repository, such as a memory or storage device on a digital camera. The GUI (<b>100</b>) can include an image preview area (<b>112</b>) for previewing the image files available for import. Each previewed image file (e.g., <b>114</b> or <b>120</b>) can include a file name (e.g., <b>116</b> or <b>122</b>) and a visual indicator (e.g., <b>118</b> or <b>124</b>) for selecting the previewed image file. The file name (e.g., <b>116</b> or <b>122</b>) displayed with the corresponding previewed image file (e.g., <b>114</b> or <b>120</b>) can indicate whether the previewed image is a RAW image file (e.g., <b>120</b>, &#x201c;RWL&#x201d;) or a JPEG (e.g., processed) image file (e.g., <b>114</b>, &#x201c;JPG&#x201d;). The visual indicator (e.g., <b>118</b> or <b>124</b>) for selecting the previewed image file can include a user-selectable interface, such as a box that can be checked to select the corresponding image file. Other user-selectable interface can be used to select the corresponding image file, including a radio button, a box that can be &#x201c;x-ed,&#x201d; etc. Also, the previewed image file or the displayed file name can be highlighted to visually indicate that the corresponding image file has been selected.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The GUI (<b>100</b>) can also include a user interface for selecting or unselecting all of the previewed image files (e.g., <b>126</b>, <b>128</b>). For example, a user-selectable button can be implemented to automatically select (e.g., <b>126</b> to check a box) all of the previewed image files at once. Also, a user selectable button can be implemented to automatically unselect (e.g., <b>128</b> to uncheck a box) all of the previewed image files at once.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The GUI (<b>100</b>) can include a user interface for adjusting the import settings (<b>130</b>). The user interface for adjusting the import settings (<b>130</b>) can include a user interface that can provide different options for importing the RAW+JPEG pair (<b>132</b>). For example, the import settings can be adjusted to import both the RAW image file and the JPEG image file together with the JPEG image file designated as the master image file. The master image file is displayed to the user, and the user can apply adjustments, metadata, etc. to the master image file. By adjusting the import settings, both the RAW image file and the JPEG image file from the corresponding RAW+JPEG pair can be imported together with the RAW image file as the master. The import settings can be adjusted to import the JPEG image file from the selected RAW+JPEG pair(s) without importing the corresponding RAW image file. Also, the import settings can be adjusted to import the RAW image file from the selected RAW+JPEG pair(s) without importing the corresponding JPEG image file. In addition, the import settings can be adjusted to import both the RAW image file and the corresponding JPEG image file together with each image file designated as a separate master file.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When the two image files in the corresponding RAW+JPEG pair are linked together, either one of the two files can be selected as the master file. For example, the import settings can be adjusted to import both files with the JPEG image file selected as the master file. Alternatively, the import settings can be adjusted to import both image files with the RAW image file selected as the master file.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">When one of the two image files from the corresponding RAW+JPEG pair is selected and displayed as the master file, the other file in the corresponding RAW+JPEG pair is not visible to the user. However, the user can easily switch between the two files in the corresponding RAW+JPEG pair as the master file. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a GUI (<b>102</b>) for presenting the available operations for the imported image files. The GUI (<b>102</b>) can include a main image display area (<b>140</b>) and a preview area (<b>150</b>). Also, the GUI (<b>102</b>) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> can include a menu (<b>160</b>) for presenting a choice of operations available for the imported image files. The menu (<b>160</b>) can include an option to switch the designated master file (<b>162</b>). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the JPEG image file is currently set as the master file, as indicated by the letter &#x201c;J&#x201d; displayed on the previewed image. The menu (<b>160</b>) presents an option to switch the master file to the RAW image file of the corresponding pair. Also, the menu (<b>160</b>) can include an option to delete the other file in the corresponding pair not visible to the user (in this example, the RAW image file) to save space, for example. The menu (<b>160</b>) can include another option to split the linked image files in the corresponding pair as separate master image files using a menu option named &#x201c;Separate RAW+JPEG,&#x201d; for example. When the two image files in the corresponding pair are separated, an option can be provided to take the two separate image files of the RAW+JPEG pair and make them a linked pair using a menu option named &#x201c;Combine RAW+JPEG,&#x201d; for example.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The process for importing one or more RAW+JPEG pairs can be described using a process flow diagram as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. A system or an apparatus can implement a GUI (e.g., <b>100</b> or <b>102</b>) to present a preview of image files available for import (<b>210</b>). Using the GUI, one or more of the available image files can be imported based on received user input (<b>220</b>). For example, user input indicating selection of one or more of the available image files can be received using the checked-boxes. Those selected image files can be imported. Importing the image files can include importing the raw image file (e.g., RAW), the corresponding compressed image file (e.g., JPEG) or both from the RAW+JPEG pair (<b>222</b>). When importing the image files, the raw image file, the corresponding compressed image file or both can be selected to be displayed as the master image file (<b>224</b>). The selected master file(s) is displayed to the user using the GUI, for example (<b>226</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As described above, the selected master file(s) from the corresponding RAW+JPEG pair can be displayed to the user, and the user can apply the desired metadata or adjustments to the displayed master file(s). If the applied metadata and adjustments are identified as those that should be associated with the other image file, the metadata and adjustments can be automatically associated with the other image file in the corresponding RAW+JPEG pair. Also, when the RAW image file is linked to the JPEG image file, the applied metadata and adjustments can be automatically associated with the other image file in the corresponding RAW+JPEG pair.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Importing Corresponding RAW Files Using First Imported JPEG Files</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A</figref>, <b>3</b>B, <b>3</b>C, <b>3</b>D and <b>3</b>E show example GUIs that illustrate a process for importing RAW+JPEG pairs. Rather than importing both files in the corresponding RAW+JPEG pair, one of the two files can be imported first. The RAW image files are larger in size than the corresponding JPEG files, and thus it may be more efficient, with respect to time and storage space, to import the JPEG files first without the RAW files. From the imported JPEG files, a select number of corresponding RAW image files can be imported. This process can eliminate the need to import all of the RAW image files at the beginning.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows an example GUI (<b>300</b>) that can be used to import the RAW+JPEG pairs. The GUI can include a user interface to adjust the import settings (<b>130</b>) to import the JPEG image files first without the RAW image files (<b>132</b>). When the import settings (<b>130</b>) are adjusted to import the JPEG image files first without the corresponding RAW image files from the corresponding RAW+JPEG pairs, the available RAW image files shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> above can be removed from the import view (<b>112</b>) automatically. Importing the JPEG image files first without the corresponding RAW image files can be useful when the user doesn't have time or adequate memory space to import all of the corresponding RAW image files. The corresponding RAW images files are much larger in size than the corresponding JPEG files and thus may need a longer wait time to import. Also, these larger sized RAW image files may need a larger available storage space to import.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, three of the imported JPEG image files are selected (e.g., the associated boxes are checked) for import (<b>310</b>). The rest of the imported JPEG image files are selectively excluded. In this manner, the GUI (<b>300</b>) can be used to allow the user to select any of the available image files for importing the corresponding RAW image files.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> shows a GUI <b>302</b> for importing and displaying the imported image files. The GUI (<b>302</b>) can include a main image display area (<b>320</b>) and an image preview area (<b>330</b>) for displaying the imported image files. The main image display area (<b>320</b>) can display one of the imported image files previewed in the image preview area (<b>330</b>). The imported image file (<b>340</b>) displayed in the main display area (<b>330</b>) can be displayed larger than the previewed image files. The imported image file (<b>340</b>) selected and displayed in the main display area (<b>320</b>) can be identified to the user using a visual indicator (<b>346</b>). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the left-most image file in the preview area (<b>340</b>) is highlighted to identify the selected image file to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Also, the image files displayed in the main display area (<b>320</b>) and the preview area (<b>330</b>) can also include a visual indication (<b>342</b>) of the file type: raw image file (e.g., RAW) or processed image file (e.g., JPEG). For example, the displayed image files can include a &#x201c;J&#x201d; or &#x201c;R&#x201d; over a portion of the displayed files to identify the image files as RAW image files or JPEG image files. Other visual indicators can be used, such as JPEG, JPG, RAW, RWL, etc. Also, the visual indicator is not limited to textual information and can include non-textual information, such as different shaped objects, different colored objects, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The imported image files (the JPEG image files in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) indicated and displayed as the master files can be adjusted or have metadata associated with the master files. For example, the displayed master file (e.g., JPEG image file <b>340</b>) has been edited to associate user desired metadata with the master image file. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a user indicated rating (e.g., two stars out of maximum 5 stars <b>344</b>) has been associated with the JPEG image file (<b>340</b>) displayed. Other ratings can be used as the metadata, such as a numbered rating (e.g., a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best rating) or color-coded ratings, for example. Moreover, the metadata applied or associated with the image files can include other non-pixel information that identifies the user generated description of the image files. The metadata associated with the image files are non-pixel information in that the images files are not processed or compressed by the metadata. Other types of metadata can include changing the spatial position of the image files, such as rotating the image files. The metadata associated with the first imported image files (e.g., the imported JPEG image files) can be used to further adjust the import settings and narrow the list of corresponding RAW image files to import.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows a GUI (<b>304</b>) that can be used to allow the user to adjust the import settings (<b>130</b>). For example, after selecting the three JPEG image files in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the import settings (<b>130</b>) can be adjusted to import a subset of the available RAW image files. The import settings (<b>130</b>) can include an import file-type setting (<b>132</b>) and an import filter setting (<b>134</b>). The import file-type setting (<b>132</b>) can be selected to import all matching or corresponding RAW image files (or JPEG files when RAW files are imported first). The import filter setting (<b>134</b>) can be adjusted to further narrow the list of corresponding RAW files to include all matching files. In response to the request to import all matching RAW image files including all matching files, the three RAW image files corresponding to the three imported JPEG image files are displayed in the preview area (<b>112</b>) of the GUI.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref> shows a GUI (<b>306</b>) that can be used to import the RAW image files corresponding to the first imported JPEG image files using an import filter setting. The import filter setting (<b>130</b>) can be adjusted based on the metadata associated with the imported JPEG image files (e.g., the master image files). The GUI (<b>306</b>) includes an import setting (<b>130</b>) for selecting image files to import. The import setting (<b>130</b>) includes an import file type setting (<b>132</b>) and an import filter setting (<b>134</b>). In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, the import file type setting (<b>132</b>) is set as all matching RAW image files. However, the import filter setting (<b>134</b>) is set to all unrated or better image files. From the three imported JPEG image files in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> above, one was assigned a two-star rating, one was indicated as a rejected image file, and the third was unrated. Thus, in response to the import filter setting of &#x201c;unrated or better,&#x201d; two of the corresponding RAW image files are displayed in the preview area <b>112</b>. The RAW image file corresponding to the rejected JPEG image file is excluded by the above described filter setting.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> shows another GUI (<b>308</b>) that can be used to import the RAW image files corresponding to the first imported JPEG image files using an import filter setting. The import filter setting can be adjusted based on the metadata assigned to the imported JPEG image files (e.g., the master image files). In this example, the import filter setting <b>134</b> is set as the current filter. The current filter can be set or adjusted by the user based on the metadata assigned to the JPEG image files. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, the current filter is set as a two-star rating. In response to the import filter setting of &#x201c;current filter&#x201d; (e.g., two-star rating), one of the RAW image files is displayed in the preview area <b>112</b>. The displayed RAW image file corresponds to the imported JPEG image file with the two-star rating.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref> shows a GUI (<b>309</b>) that can be used to display an image file imported using an import filter. The GUI (<b>309</b>) includes an image display area <b>320</b> and a preview area <b>330</b>. The preview area <b>330</b> displays all of the imported image files, and the image display area <b>320</b> displays the selected one of the imported image files. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>, a RAW image file <b>342</b> is imported and displayed based on the import filter set to &#x201c;current filter&#x201d; as described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref> above. Because only one RAW image file is imported based on the import filter, the preview area <b>330</b> displays the one imported RAW image file. The image display area <b>320</b> displays the RAW image file selected from the choice of imported image files previewed in the preview area <b>330</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The process for importing the RAW image files corresponding to the first imported JPEG image files illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-F</figref> can be described using process flow diagrams as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. A system or an apparatus can implement a GUI (e.g., <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> and <b>309</b>) to displaying a preview of image files available for import (<b>410</b>). The GUI can be used to importing one or more user selected image files from the available image files (<b>420</b>). When importing the user selected image files, the compressed image files (e.g., JPEG image files) can be selected and imported first (<b>422</b>) before importing the corresponding RAW image files. A corresponding RAW image file for at least one of the first imported JPEG image files can be selected to import (<b>424</b>). The selected corresponding RAW image files can be imported and displayed to the user (<b>426</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">To identifying a corresponding RAW image file for at least one of the imported JPEG image files (<b>424</b>), metadata can be applied to at least one of the imported JPEG image files (<b>421</b>). Based on the applied metadata, a filter parameter can be set to selectively identify the corresponding RAW image file (<b>423</b>). The filter parameter can be used to import a subset of the available corresponding RAW image files.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Associating METADATA with RAW+JPEG Pair</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">When assigning or associating metadata with the two linked image files in a corresponding RAW+JPEG pair, the desired metadata can be applied to the currently designated master image file only and the metadata can be automatically associated with the other image file in the corresponding pair. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a process flow diagram showing a process for associating metadata with the image files in a corresponding RAW+JPEG pair. A system or apparatus can implement a GUI (e.g., <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> and <b>309</b>) to present a preview of image files available for import from a digital camera, for example (<b>510</b>). The GUI can be implemented to import one of the two image files from a corresponding pair associated with a captured image (<b>520</b>). The imported image file is set as the master file. The GUI can be implemented to apply the user desired metadata to the imported image file (e.g., the master file) from the corresponding pair (<b>530</b>). The GUI can be implemented to automatically associate the applied metadata to the other image file in the corresponding pair (<b>540</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although the other image file in the corresponding pair has not yet been imported, the metadata can be automatically assigned to the other image file as long as the two image files are linked together. For example, if the JPEG image file from a corresponding pair is imported first and the metadata applied, the RAW image file can have the same metadata associated with it. When the other image file in the corresponding pair is selectively imported, using the import settings for example (<b>550</b>), the imported other image file in the corresponding pair can be set as the master file and displayed to the user along with the associated metadata (<b>560</b>). However, because the other image file in the corresponding pair need not be imported, the associated metadata on the other image file may not be visible to the user until imported and displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The metadata can be applied to the two image files in the corresponding par using a single metadata file that includes the applied metadata. The metadata file can be generated and point to the two image files in the corresponding pair. The image file selected as the master file is displayed to the user along with the applied metadata. The metadata applied to the image files can include user rating, caption, GPS coordinate, sharpness, white balance, etc. Thus, Metadata can include any data about that captured image except for any modification to the pixels.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the two image files are not linked together but rather separated as separate master files, the metadata applied to one image file is not automatically associated with the other image file in the corresponding pair. In this example, two different metadata files are implemented with each pointing to a separate master image file.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In addition, the GUI can be implemented to import both image files rather than just one of the corresponding pair. As described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>2</b>, both image files in a corresponding pair can be imported together with one image file (e.g., RAW or JPEG) designated as the master file. When the metadata is applied to the master image file (e.g., the image file displayed to the user), the metadata can be automatically associated with the other image file in the corresponding pair. The associated metadata can be presented to the user when the master image file is switched to the other image file. For example, the GUI can be implemented to import both image files with the JPEG image file designated as the master image file. The GUI can be implemented to assign a two-star rating to the master image file (e.g., the displayed JPEG image file). Then the two-star rating can be automatically associated with the not yet displayed RAW image file. Because the metadata is automatically associated with the corresponding RAW image file, the GUI can be used to adjust the import filter settings to eliminate some of the RAW image files based on the associated metadata. Also, when the RAW image file is set as the master image file, the associated metadata can be displayed to the user along with the RAW image file.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Associating Adjustments to RAW+JPEG Pair</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition to associating metadata to the RAW+JPEG pair, different image adjustments can be applied. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a process flow diagram showing a process for associating image adjustments to a RAW+JPEG pair. A system or apparatus can implement a GUI (e.g., <b>100</b>, <b>102</b>, <b>300</b>, <b>302</b>, <b>304</b>, <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> and <b>309</b>) to present image files available for import (<b>610</b>). The GUI can be implemented to import one of the two image files from a corresponding pair associated with a captured Image (<b>620</b>). The GUI can be implemented to apply an image adjustment to the imported one of the corresponding Pair (<b>630</b>). The system or the apparatus can identify whether the applied adjustment is designated for automatic association with the other image file in the corresponding pair (<b>640</b>). Even if the two image files are linked together, it may not be desirable to automatically associate all image adjustments to both image files in the corresponding pair. The different types of image adjustments are described further below. The GUI can be implemented to automatically associate the applied image adjustment to the other image file in the corresponding pair when the applied adjustment is identified as being designated for association with both files in the corresponding pair (<b>650</b>). The GUI can be implemented to display the JPEG or RAW or both image files from the corresponding pair associated with the captured image along with the applied image adjustment based on the identifying and associating (<b>660</b>). The image adjustment is displayed with the selected master image file. For example, when the JPEG image file is displayed as the master file, the applied image adjustment is shown with the displayed JPEG image file. When the RAW image file is displayed as the master file, the applied image adjustment is shown with the displayed RAW image file.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Examples of image adjustments can include crop, flip and straighten that can be designated for association with both JPEG and RAW image files. Examples of the image adjustments that may not be automatically associated with both the JPEG and RAW image files can include tone and white balance. The different treatment of different image adjustment can be attributed to the desire to process the JPEG image file differently from the RAW image file. For example, the JPEG image file may be white balanced differently than the RAW image file.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Also, the JPEG and RAW image files may have different height and width information. Thus, when applying the different image adjustment to the JPEG and RAW image files, these differences in the height and width of the image files can be compensated using a corrective relative spatial location determination. For example, when the color of a jacket worn by a person in the JPEG image file is adjusted, the pixel location of the jacket can be different in the RAW image file. Thus, the relative location of the jacket with respect to a reference point can be calculated in the JPEG image file and extrapolated onto the RAW image file. For example, the jacket location can be calculated from the center of the JPEG image or from the edges of the JPEG image or both. Other spatial corrective techniques can be used to determine the correct location of the image adjustment.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The user may be presented with the control over which image adjustments carry over to both the JPEG and RAW image files. Also, the applied adjustments are removable or non-destructive. Rather than directly modifying the pixel information of the image files, a record or file can be generated with the desired image adjustment information. The record with the desired image adjustment is associated with the corresponding image files, such that when either or both image files are displayed, the image adjustment information from the image adjustment file is used to apply the image adjustment to the displayed image(s).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, the GUI can be implemented to import both image files from the corresponding pair rather than just one. As described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>2</b>, both image files in a corresponding pair can be imported together with one image file (e.g., RAW or JPEG) designated as the master file. When the image adjustment is applied to the master image file (e.g., the image file displayed to the user), the image adjustment can be automatically associated with the other image file in the corresponding pair based on whether the image adjustment should carry over to both image files.</p>
