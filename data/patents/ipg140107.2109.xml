<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A sealer for a sample testing instrument is disclosed that cuts and seals a fluid conduit that connects a test sample device with a fluid receptacle containing a fluid sample. The sealer includes an enclosure and a protective shield to protect a user or technician from contact with the cutting element assembly in the sealer. The cutting element assembly includes a spring-loaded element that engages the test sample device and holds it in a fixed position while a cutting element (e.g., hot wire) cuts the fluid conduit. A motor driving the cutting element assembly is positioned at an angle having both vertical and horizontal components, whereby adjustment of the motor firmware allows for adjustment of the position of the cutting element relative to the instrument in both horizontal and vertical directions.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates to devices and related instruments and systems that test biological, microbiological, chemical or other types of samples. The invention in particular relates to a sealer assembly for sealing test sample devices that are supplied with a fluid sample via a transfer tube.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Biological samples can be reacted and subjected to chemical or optical analysis using various techniques, including transmittance and/or fluorescence optical analysis. The purpose of the analysis may be to identify an unknown biological agent or target in the sample, to determine the concentration of a substance in the sample, or determine whether the biological agent is susceptible to certain antibiotics, as well as the concentration of antibiotics that would be effective in treating an infection caused by the agent.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the mid-to late 1970's, engineers and scientists working with the applicants' assignee and its predecessor in interest developed a technique for conducting optical analysis of biological samples using a sealed test sample card containing a plurality of small sample wells. The technique, and related instruments and devices, came to be known in the industry as the &#x201c;Vitek&#xae; System&#x201d;. The Vitek&#xae; System was (and continues to be) a commercial success.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The cards used in the Vitek System are known in the patent literature, see e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,118,280, 3,963,355, 4,018,65; 4,116,775 and 4,038,151. More recent versions of the cards are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. Des. 382,647, Des. 414,272, 5,609,828, 5,746,980, 5,766,553, 5,843,380, 5,869,005, 5,916,812, 5,932,177, 5,951,952, and 6,045,758.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Cards were developed for both identification of unknown microorganisms that may be present in a sample and susceptibility of a known organism to precisely calibrated concentrations of antibiotics. During manufacture of the cards, the wells are filled with either various types of growth media for various biological agents, or else concentrations of different antibiotics, and covered with a transparent sealing tape.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The cards have an external transfer tube port as a mechanism for allowing a fluid sample to enter the card. The cards further include an internal fluid passageway structure for allowing fluid to enter the wells of the card from the transfer tube port. One end of straw-like transfer tube is inserted into the transfer tube port. The other end is inserted into an open receptacle (e.g., test tube) containing the fluid sample to be tested. In accordance with the teaching of the prior art Charles et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,188,280, the card with attached transfer tube and test tube are placed into a stand-alone vacuum and filling sealing machine, known as the Vitek&#xae; Filler Sealer. The filling and sealing machine generates a vacuum. When the vacuum is released, the fluid sample is drawn from the test tube into the transfer tube and through the internal channels of the card and into all of the sample wells. In the instrument of the prior art Charles et al. '280 patent, after the wells of the card are loaded with the sample, the cards are manually inserted into a slot in a sealer module in the machine, where the transfer tube is cut and melted, sealing the interior of the card.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The cards are then manually removed from the filler/sealer module and loaded into a reading and incubating machine, known as the VITEK&#xae; Reader, also described in the Charles et al. '280 patent. The reading and incubating machine incubates the cards at a desired temperature. An optical reader is provided for conducting transmittance testing of the wells of the card. Basically, the cards are stacked in columns in the reading machine, and an optical system moves up and down the column of cards, pulling the cards into the transmittance optics one at a time, reading the cards, and placing the cards back in the column of cards.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The arrangement of the early Vitek System (as described in the Charles et al. '280 patent) has several limitations, in that two machines, a filler/sealer and a reader, are required to process and analyze the cards. Furthermore, additional time and labor are required to conduct the complete analysis of the card. The applicants' assignee later developed and commercialized a fully automated instrument, referred to herein and known in the art as the &#x201c;Vitek 2&#x201d; instrument. The Vitek 2 instrument automates both the vacuum loading and sealing operations and combined them with incubation and reading in a single instrument.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Briefly, the &#x201c;Vitek 2&#x201d; system provides an automated sample testing machine that performs dilutions for susceptibility testing, fills the cards with the samples at a vacuum station, and seals the card by cutting the transfer tube, and conducts incubation and optical transmittance and fluorescence analysis of the cards, all automatically. The machine provides for novel pipetting and diluting stations, permitting fluids to be added to the test tubes or transferred from one test tube to another. The machine is capable of conducting simultaneous susceptibility and identification testing of a sample placed in a single test tube. The machine provides for rapid, automatic identification and susceptibility testing of the sample.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The instrument uses a sample tray or &#x201c;boat&#x201d; and a test sample positioning or transportation system that moves the &#x201c;boat&#x201d; in four separate paths around a rectangular base pan among the various stations. The user places a cassette loaded with cards and test tubes containing samples into the boat at a loading station. The design of the positioning system is such that it permits essentially a custom configuration of stations above the base pan. Expansion of the machine to include additional carousels and reading stations, or addition types in intermediate procession stations such as dilution stations or vacuum stations, can be readily accomplished.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The overall instrument is described in several patents, including U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,762,873 and 6,086,824, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. The cutting and sealing station that cuts the transfer tubes to seal the cards is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,396, particularly in FIGS. 1, 4 and 5 thereof and at columns 15 and 16 thereof. The entire content of the above-listed patents is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various aspects of the present invention provide an improvement to the sealing arrangement described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,396. In particular, the present arrangements provide for easier and more accurate alignment of the sealer to the test devices and transfer tubes, a pre-loading feature that allows for cutting of the transfer tubes with tighter tolerances, and safety features that prevent inadvertent touching of the hot cutting wire.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a first aspect, a safety feature is provided for a sealer that involves the design of an enclosure for the sealer and a retractable shield that prevents inadvertent user contact with the cutting assembly. In particular, a sealer for cutting and sealing a conduit connecting a test sample device to a fluid receptacle containing a fluid sample is provided. The sealer includes an enclosure having an aperture and shield moveable between a first position covering the aperture and a second, retracted position. The sealer includes a moveable cutting element assembly (e.g., heated wire and associated structures) that has a home position located within enclosure. The sealer further includes a motor for moving the cutting element assembly through the aperture to a deployed position, in which the cutting element assembly is positioned external to the enclosure at a position for cutting the conduit. The action of movement of the cutting element assembly through the aperture causes the shield to move to the retracted position. Furthermore, the action of movement of the cutting assembly from the deployed position to the home position causes the shield to retract to the first position covering the aperture. Accordingly, when the cutting element is in the home position the shield and the enclosure prevent inadvertent contact with the cutting assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a second aspect, a sealer is designed such that the cutting of the fluid conduit (transfer tube) is controlled more precisely. This is achieved by a spring loaded member or &#x201c;shoe&#x201d; and corresponding fixed structure in the instrument that, together, hold the test sample device in position and prevent lateral movement while the cutting element cuts through the transfer tube. In this embodiment, the sealer is installed in an automated sample testing instrument. The moveable cutting element assembly has a home position and a deployed position. The cutting element assembly comprises a cutting wire and the spring-loaded member or &#x201c;shoe&#x201d;. The shoe engages with the test sample device when the cutting element assembly is moved to the deployed position. The sealer further includes a motor for moving the cutting element assembly from the home position to the deployed position. Operation of the shoe is such that when the cutting element assembly is moved to the deployed position, the engagement of the shoe with the test sample device urges the test sample device against the fixed structure in the instrument (e.g., horizontally extending rail) to thereby hold the test sample device while the cutting wire cuts and seals the conduit. The fixed structure can be any suitable structure (surface, rail, or specially designed structure), that is positioned relative to the sealer such that when the sealer's cutting element is in the deployed position, the spring loaded member engages the test sample device and hold the device, i.e., prevent lateral movement, while the cutting wire cuts the conduit. The cutting action may occur by movement of the test device past the wire, in which case the spring loaded member permits the motion of the test device past the wire in the direction of travel but still holds the device against the fixed structure to prevent substantial lateral movement (movement perpendicular to the direction of travel of the test sample device past the wire).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In another aspect, the positioning of the cutting assembly relative to the test sample device and the conduit to be cut and sealed is more closely by means of a unique arrangement in which a single motor moves the cutting assembly in a direction having both vertical and horizontal components (i.e., at an angle). Changing the operation of the motor (such as by adjusting the motor firmware to set limits on motor travel), adjusts the position of the cutting element assembly in both the horizontal and vertical directions. In particular, a sealer for cutting and thereby sealing a conduit connecting a test sample device to a fluid receptacle containing a fluid sample is provided. The sealer is installed in an automated sample-testing instrument. The sealer includes the moveable cutting element assembly and the motor for moving the cutting element assembly from the home position to the deployed position. The motor is constructed and arranged such that the motor drives the cutting element assembly relative to the enclosure in a direction having both vertical and horizontal components relative to the instrument, whereby adjustment of the operation of the motor results in adjustment of the position of the cutting element assembly relative to the instrument in both horizontal and vertical directions.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">These and other features of the sealer arrangements will be more fully appreciated after consideration of the following detailed description and the appended drawing figures.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The present invention relates to a sealing mechanism for sealing a transfer tube or like structure in a test sample device. A presently preferred embodiment of a sealer station <b>400</b> in an automated sample testing instrument <b>10</b> is described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>17</b>, <b>18</b>, and <b>22</b>-<b>24</b>. In order to appreciate how the illustrated embodiment of the sealer invention operates, the specification will describe the invention in the context of a particular sample testing instrument and test sample device format. However, the invention can be practiced in other environments and the present description is provided by way of illustration and not limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">System Overview</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">An overview of a compact, high throughput instrument for processing test samples will now be described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>. The details on the construction and operation of the instrument will be described later in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-34</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The instrument <b>10</b> processes a batch of test sample devices in the form of multi-well test sample cards in the illustrated embodiment. A representative test sample card <b>100</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and will be described subsequently. The cards <b>100</b> are initially loaded in a cassette (carrier) <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-15</figref>. The carrier <b>200</b> further carries a set of fluid receptacles (test tubes) <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) that contain a fluid sample. Each test sample device <b>100</b> is placed into fluid communication with an associated fluid receptacle <b>106</b> by means of a transfer tube <b>102</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. The sample is loaded into the card by means of a vacuum loading station in the instrument <b>10</b> in the manner described below.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The instrument <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> is a sample processing and data collection portion of an overall sample testing system. The overall system includes a separate stand-alone identification station where bar codes on the test sample devices are scanned, the cards are loaded into the carrier <b>200</b>, and the carrier is applied with a bar code and scanned. These functions are similar to the separate identification system described in the patent of Fanning et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,869,006, incorporated by reference herein. The overall system further includes a workstation having a computer processing system that receives data from the reading system in the instrument. These identification and computer processing aspects of the overall system are not particularly pertinent to the present invention and only insofar as they are relevant will they be discussed further.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The illustrated instrument was designed as a smaller and lower-cost alternative to more complex sample testing instruments, such as the system described in the above-referenced Fanning et al. patent, for use in low to medium range applications in both the clinical and industry markets. The instrument provides for semi-automated filling, sealing, and loading of the test sample devices, as will be described in detail below. However, whereas the prior art Fanning et al. '006 patent and the Vitek 2 instrument supported automated diluting and pipetting functions, these functions are performed off-line by the user either manually or using other equipment. In other words, the user prepares the samples so that they can be directly loaded into the test sample devices from their associated test tube. These off-line tasks will be discussed in more detail in conjunction with the work flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As in the case with the Vitek 2 instrument, the instrument <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1-5</figref> provides a vacuum station <b>300</b> for inoculation of the fluid samples into the wells <b>104</b> of the test sample card <b>100</b> <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. However, in the present system the vacuum loading is performed semi-automatically as described herein, not fully automatically. In particular, the user manually places the loaded carrier into the vacuum station. When the fluid samples enter the wells <b>104</b> of the card <b>100</b>, the fluid sample rehydrates reagents previously loaded into the wells of the card at the time of manufacture.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">After vacuum loading, the carrier <b>200</b> is then manually placed into a separate compartment in the instrument <b>10</b> containing a carrier and test sample device processing subsystem <b>50</b>. This subsystem <b>50</b> includes a sealing station <b>400</b> which operates to seal the cards by cutting the fluid transfer tube <b>102</b>. The instrument <b>10</b> includes a card autoloader sub-system <b>500</b> that automatically loads the cards <b>100</b> one at a time into an incubation station <b>600</b>. The incubation station <b>600</b> includes a rotating carousel that holds the cards. The cards are held at a precisely controlled temperature. The incubation system includes a card eject mechanism that ejects the cards from the carousel one at a time and places the cards on a transport assembly <b>700</b> that carries the cards to a card reader subsystem <b>800</b>. The card reader subsystem <b>800</b> includes transmittance optics stations that perform periodic colorimetric readings of the wells <b>104</b> of the cards <b>100</b>. A software algorithm determines changes in patterns of individual reagent wells <b>104</b> and translates those patterns into organism identification or sets of antimicrobial results. When the reading is deemed complete, the cards <b>100</b> are sent by the card transport assembly <b>700</b> to a card disposal system <b>900</b>, which holds the cards for removal from the instrument by the user. If further reading is required, the cards are moved back into the incubation station <b>600</b> for further incubation and additional reading.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A carrier transport system <b>1000</b> is provided in the instrument for moving the loaded carrier <b>200</b> back and forth within the interior of the carrier and test sample device processing subsystem <b>50</b> of the instrument <b>10</b>. The transport assembly <b>1000</b> is described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-33</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The instrument of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> and <b>16</b>-<b>33</b> can be scaled up or down to offer capacity for processing 60 test sample cards at the same time, or even more. The present discussion will focus on an embodiment for processing six fully loaded carriers (60 test sample devices). It will be appreciated that by providing a larger carousel incubation station or a second incubation station and second optics station and associated card transport assemblies the capacity could double.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The instrument <b>10</b> performs all control of sample well (test sample card) filling and incubation/optical reading. The instrument <b>10</b> also supports a two-step user workflow for test pre-processing: reagent hydration and sample inoculation (vacuum loading). The test pre-processing is followed by the steps performed automatically in the instrument: cassette and test setup verification using strategically placed bar code reader in the instrument, card transfer tube sealing, loading of test sample cards into the incubation station, reading of the cards, and unloading and return to the user of the processed carrier and test tubes. Upon loading of the cards <b>100</b> into the incubation system <b>600</b>, the instrument controls incubation temperature, optical reading, and data transfer to the workstation computer processing system during the test processing period. The instrument then ejects the cards upon test finalization, by means of transport of the test sample cards into the card disposal system <b>900</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Door and User Interface Features (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3B</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Referring primarily now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3B</figref>, the instrument <b>10</b> includes a set of panels <b>12</b> that cover the internal sample processing apparatus. The internal processing apparatus is described in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> et seq. The panels <b>12</b> include a hinged vacuum door <b>302</b> that provides access to a vacuum chamber <b>304</b>, which are part of the vacuum loading system <b>300</b> in the instrument. The user places a fully or partially loaded cassette <b>200</b> (a set of up to 10 test sample cards <b>100</b>, each connected to an associated test tube <b>106</b> via a transfer tube <b>102</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) into the vacuum chamber <b>304</b> in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> and closes the vacuum door <b>302</b>. A vacuum is drawn in the chamber <b>304</b> and the release of vacuum loads the fluid samples into the wells of the test sample cards <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the vacuum system <b>300</b> further includes a vacuum pump assembly <b>306</b> that supplies vacuum to the vacuum chamber <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The instrument further includes a hinged load/unload door <b>14</b>. The user opens this door to expose a carrier loading and unloading station <b>16</b>, best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, and introduces the carrier (loaded) into the carrier and test sample device processing subsystem <b>50</b>. The loaded carrier <b>200</b> (with the vacuum loading just complete) is placed inside the machine at the carrier loading station <b>16</b> for subsequent processing in the instrument (sealing, incubation, reading, disposal). The transport system <b>1000</b> in the instrument engages the loaded carrier <b>200</b> and proceeds to move the carrier as a unit to stations in the instrument as described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The instrument further includes a waste access door <b>902</b> which is part of the card disposal system <b>900</b>. The door <b>902</b> is the means by which the user gains access to a waste compartment <b>904</b>. A removable receptacle in the form of a bucket (<b>906</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) is placed in the waste compartment <b>904</b>. The test sample cards are dropped into the bucket <b>906</b> after the reading process is complete. When the bucket is full, the bucket is removed, the cards are discarded, and the bucket is replaced into the waste compartment <b>904</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The instrument further includes a front user access door <b>18</b>, a top user access door <b>20</b>, and top service panel side and rear panels, which are not relevant to the present discussion. These doors provide access for periodic cleaning of the instrument or service of components in the instrument. Access to the interior of the instrument <b>10</b> is restricted during processing for the safety of the user and to ensure uninterrupted processing of the cards. The instrument <b>10</b> monitors the status of all the doors via sensors. Doors that provide access to moving parts, such as the front user access door <b>18</b> and load/unload door <b>14</b>, also have door locks that are monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The vacuum door <b>302</b> and load/unload door <b>14</b> are round recessed doors. The doors pivot in opposite directions to provide an unobstructed transfer of the cassette <b>200</b> from the vacuum chamber <b>304</b> to the loading station <b>16</b>. A detent in the hinge for these doors allows the door to stay open greater than 90&#xb0; until the user is ready to close it. The hinges are recessed and hidden from view when the doors are closed.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The instrument includes a compact user interface <b>22</b>. The user interface includes a keypad and LCD screen, which are located on the user interface front panel, at the top left of the instrument <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The instrument uses the screen to communicate messages about its operation and its status. An audible indictor is also used in conjunction with the LCD display to notify the user when a task is complete or if an error has occurred. The keypad is used to respond to instructions, send commands to the instrument, and perform other functions. Indicator lights located next to the Vacuum Door and Load/Unload Doors provide additional status information to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Test Sample Device <b>100</b> Features (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The illustrated embodiment is designed to process test sample devices in the form of multi-well test sample cards. Persons skilled in the art will appreciate that the instrument, and its constituent components, can be configured to process other types of test sample apparatus, and the invention is not limited to any particular format or design for test sample apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A representative test sample card is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The card <b>100</b> is a flat, thin object having front and rear surfaces that are covered with a clear, oxygen permeable transparent sealing tape. The card contains 64 test sample wells <b>104</b> and an internal fluid passage network <b>108</b> that connects each of the wells to a fluid intake port <b>110</b> and fluid distribution manifold. The fluid transfer tube <b>102</b> is automatically inserted in the fluid intake port <b>108</b> in the manner shown and locked in place using the teachings of O'Bear et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,309,890. During vacuum loading of the card, the fluid sample <b>120</b> enters the card <b>100</b> from the fluid transfer tube <b>102</b> and travels along the course of the internal fluid passage network <b>108</b>. The fluid sample fills the wells <b>104</b> of the cards, where the fluid rehydrates dried reagents or growth media. Under conditions of incubation, a reaction occurs between the reagents in the wells of the card and the microorganism in the fluid sample. As a result of this reaction, the transmittance of light though the wells changes. The optics in the instrument <b>10</b> periodically read the wells of the card <b>100</b> by obtaining transmittance measurements at particular wavelengths of light.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The cards for use with the illustrated embodiment are described at length in the patent literature and therefore a more detailed discussion is omitted. The reader is directed to the following U.S. Patents for further details: U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,609,828; 5,746,980; 5,670,375; 5,932,177; 5,916,812; 5,951,952; 6,309,890 and 5,804,437. Each of these patents is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Carrier <b>200</b> Features (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-15</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-15</figref>, the carrier <b>200</b> or cassette is a molded plastic component that holds a set of test sample cards <b>100</b> and associated test tubes <b>106</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the carrier <b>200</b> holds a maximum of 10 test cards in specially fitted slots <b>202</b>. The front portion <b>204</b> of the cassette <b>200</b> has a test tube slot <b>206</b> for each test tube <b>106</b>. The slots are numbered 1-10 across the front of the cassette for identification purposes. A handle <b>208</b> on the right side allows for one-handed carrying capability. A removable bar code label <b>210</b> is applied to the opposite side of the carrier <b>200</b> in the flat panel portion <b>215</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 14</figref>). The bar code <b>210</b> provides cassette identification when read by a bar code reader in the instrument <b>10</b>. Each of the test sample cards is applied with a bar code <b>120</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The user loads the carrier <b>200</b> with tubes <b>106</b> of patient isolates (or, more generally, a fluid sample) and test cards <b>100</b> before placing the carrier in the vacuum chamber <b>304</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) for the filling process. The asymmetrical shape of the carrier <b>200</b> and receiving structures in the vacuum chamber <b>304</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> ensures that the carrier <b>200</b> is properly loaded into the instrument (i.e., the handle <b>208</b> is towards the front of the instrument). Upon completion of the vacuum loading process, the user opens the door <b>302</b> to the vacuum chamber <b>304</b> and removes the carrier <b>200</b> from the vacuum chamber <b>304</b> and places it in the load/unload station <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The carrier <b>200</b> is a main component of the transport system <b>1000</b>. A special block feature in the transport system <b>1000</b> enables the transport system to move the carrier through the processing stations in the carrier and test sample device processing subsystem <b>50</b> and back to the load/unloading station <b>16</b>. Optical interrupt sensors in the transport system detect slots <b>212</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>15</b>) that are formed into the bottom of the carrier <b>200</b>. The optical interrupt sensors and the slots allow the instrument microcontroller to track the cassette location. The interrupt slots <b>212</b> are U-shaped voids formed in a rib <b>214</b> formed in the bottom of the carrier <b>200</b>. Each slot <b>212</b> is positioned in registry with the position of the card directly above it. Therefore, when the interrupt sensors detect the position of a slot <b>212</b>, they are also detecting the position of the associated card. This feature facilitates precise carrier positioning for automated sealing operations and automatic loading of the cards from the carrier <b>200</b> into the entrance slot in the incubation station.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> and <b>7</b>, the user places a carrier <b>200</b> loaded with test sample cards <b>100</b> and test tubes <b>106</b>, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, into the vacuum chamber <b>304</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and closes the door <b>302</b>.

A silicon seal <b>306</b> on the vacuum chamber door <b>302</b> presses against the front panel surface <b>308</b>, sealing the vacuum chamber <b>304</b>. The vacuum pump in the vacuum pump assembly <b>306</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>17</b>) starts drawing the air from the chamber <b>304</b>. The air escapes from the card channels and wells via the transfer tubes and up through the suspension or fluid sample in the test tubes <b>106</b>. The channels and wells inside of each card are now in a vacuum.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The vacuum station fills the card with the inoculation suspension in the test tubes <b>106</b> using vacuum displacement principles taught in Fanning et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,965,090, the content of which is incorporated by reference herein. The rate of change of the vacuum is monitored and regulated by a pneumatic servo feedback system under microcontroller control.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In particular, after a short period, the vacuum is released at a controlled rate from the vacuum chamber. The increasing air pressure inside the chamber forces the suspension from each test tube <b>106</b> through the transfer tube <b>102</b> and into the internal fluid channels and wells <b>104</b> of the card <b>100</b>. This process of course occurs simultaneously with all the cards in the carrier in the vacuum chamber. The result is vacuum loading of all cards <b>100</b> in the carrier <b>200</b>. The carrier <b>200</b> is now ready for insertion into the loading station <b>16</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and processing therein by the carrier and test device processing subsystem <b>50</b> in the remainder of the instrument <b>10</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Now that the carrier <b>200</b> and test devices <b>100</b> have been processed in the vacuum station <b>300</b>, the carrier <b>200</b> is now ready for placement into the loading station <b>16</b> and processed by the remainder of the instrument's subsystems, collectively referred to herein as the carrier and test sample device processing subsystem <b>50</b>. This group of components includes the transport system <b>1000</b>, sealing station <b>400</b>, card autoloader subassembly <b>500</b>, incubation station <b>600</b>, card transport subsystem <b>700</b>, optical reading station <b>800</b> and disposal system <b>900</b>. These features will be described in further detail in this section.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Carrier Loading and Unloading Station <b>16</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>A, <b>16</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The load/unload station <b>16</b> is where the operator manually loads the carrier of filled cards to start the sealing, incubation, and reading processes. The load/unload door <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) will remain locked at all times unless the user is ready to load or unload a carrier. The door <b>14</b> is shown removed from the instrument in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> in order to better illustrate the loading/unloading station <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The loaded carrier <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B</figref>, <b>7</b>) is loaded into the instrument <b>10</b> through the open load/unload station door <b>14</b>. A reflective sensor <b>1040</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) in the load area is used to sense the presence of a carrier <b>200</b> in the load/unload station <b>16</b>. An indicator light <b>32</b> above the load/unload station <b>16</b> indicates the status of the load/unload station to the user. Once the door <b>14</b> is closed, the processing cycle automatically initiates.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The transport system <b>1000</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-33</figref>) moves the carrier <b>200</b> by pulling or pushing it through each processing station within the instrument in the manner described below. The instrument microcontroller keeps track of where the carrier <b>200</b> is located and the status of the transport system utilizing the slots <b>212</b> molded into the bottom of the carrier (described above) and optical sensors <b>1050</b> A-C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) that are strategically placed in the transport system <b>1000</b>. The transport system <b>1000</b> moves the carrier from the load/unload station <b>16</b> to a bar code scanner where the carrier bar code (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and test sample bar codes are read, the sealer station <b>400</b>, the card autoloader station <b>500</b> where the cards are loaded into the carousel incubation station <b>600</b>, and back to the load/unload station <b>16</b> for removal of the carrier <b>200</b> and the test tubes plus transfer tube <b>102</b> remnants. The carrier is parked at the load/unload station <b>16</b>, the door <b>14</b> unlocked and the operator notified by the load/unload indicator light <b>32</b>. The carrier <b>200</b> can then be removed allowing disposal of the processed test tubes <b>106</b> and transfer tube <b>102</b> waste, making the carrier ready for testing of the next batch of test cards and associated fluid samples.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Bar Code Reader Station <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>20</b>, <b>17</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A bar code reader station <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>) is positioned in the instrument <b>10</b> generally below the reading station <b>800</b>. The station <b>60</b> automatically scans the bar code information on each carrier <b>200</b> and test card within the carrier <b>200</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) as they pass through the station. The bar code reader station <b>60</b> consists of a bar code scanner <b>62</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>) and a card sensor <b>1042</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). The card sensor <b>1042</b> is located on the housing of the incubation assembly <b>600</b> as close to the cards in the cassette as possible. The card sensor <b>1042</b> confirms the presence of a card <b>100</b> in the carrier <b>200</b> and the slot location. The slots <b>212</b> in the bottom of the carrier allow the transport system <b>1000</b> to position each card in front of the bar code scanner <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, each card <b>100</b> has a factory applied bar code <b>120</b> that includes information such as test type, lot number, expiration date and a unique sequence number. When the card bar codes <b>120</b> are scanned at the separate workstation at the time of loading cards into the carrier <b>200</b>, the instrument's bar code reader <b>62</b> provides an additional level of security by verifying that the cards <b>100</b> are loaded as indicated by the user. If the bar codes are not scanned at the separate workstation (&#x201c;load and go&#x201d; mode), the lab technician's worksheet can be used for verifying that cards <b>100</b> are loaded in the carrier <b>200</b> as indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Successfully scanned carriers <b>200</b> and test cards <b>100</b> are allowed to continue to the sealer station <b>400</b>. Carriers <b>200</b> and cards <b>100</b> that cannot be read at the station <b>60</b> due to errors such as missing or damaged bar codes, expired cards, and unsupported card types, are returned to the load/unload station <b>16</b> and the user notified via the user interface <b>22</b> or indicator light <b>32</b>. The user is given the opportunity to correct the problem and reload the carrier <b>200</b> within a limited amount of time.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Sealer Station <b>400</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>17</b>-<b>24</b>, <b>35</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>17</b>-<b>24</b> and <b>35</b>, before a test card <b>100</b> can be incubated and read, the wells <b>104</b> of the test sample card must be sealed off from the outside environment. The sealer station <b>400</b> provides this function for all cards loaded into the carrier <b>200</b>, one at a time. The sealer station <b>400</b> melts and seals the transfer tube <b>102</b> using a retractable heated nichrome wire <b>402</b>, and thereby seals the cards. This operation will now be described in further detail.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">After a carrier <b>200</b> is loaded into the instrument, a transport block in the transport system <b>1000</b> engages with the carrier <b>200</b> and pulls the cassette <b>200</b> along the transport system track through a carrier sensor <b>1040</b>, a card sensor <b>1042</b>, and the bar code scanner <b>62</b>. If the carrier passes inspection, it is moved back along the transport system <b>1000</b> track toward the load/unload door <b>14</b> where the sealer station <b>400</b> operates to cut and seal all the cards in the carrier <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In particular, as the carrier <b>200</b> moves through the station <b>400</b>, the hot wire <b>402</b> is translated downwardly and at an angle through an aperture <b>404</b> in an enclosure or housing <b>406</b> to the same elevation of the transfer tubes <b>102</b> in the carrier <b>200</b>, and thereby exposed to each transfer tube <b>102</b>. As the carrier <b>200</b> is slowly advanced by the carrier transport system <b>1000</b> each transfer tube is forced past the hot wire <b>402</b>. The hot wire <b>402</b> causes the plastic transfer tube <b>102</b> to melt, separating the majority of the transfer tube, which falls into the test tube <b>106</b>. The remainder of the transfer tube forms a short, sealed stub (e.g., 1.5 mm in length) extending outward from the fluid intake port <b>110</b> in the card (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). At the completion of the sealing processing, power is cut off to the wire <b>402</b> and it is retracted back into it's housing <b>406</b> to eliminate user contact. The temperature of the wire <b>402</b> is controlled by a microcontroller controlled constant current source, as described in Karl et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,891,396, which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The overall operation of the sealer to cut the transfer tubes <b>102</b> is similar to the process described in the Karl et al. '396 patent. As cards <b>100</b> move past the sealer, the transfer tubes <b>102</b> are forced past the hot wire <b>402</b> melting the plastic and sealing the cards. The wire <b>402</b> and its associated assembly <b>408</b> then retracts into the housing <b>406</b>. The carrier <b>200</b> is then moved to the card autoloader station <b>500</b>, which moves the cards laterally off of the carrier <b>200</b> and into the entrance aperture of the incubation system <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The sealer assembly <b>400</b> is unique in several respects: a) its method of electronic control, b) its mechanical alignment, c) a preloading feature where each card is biased against fixed structures in the instrument prior to cutting and sealing the transfer tubes, and d) features preventing unauthorized user access.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As for feature a), a microcontroller ensures reliable cutting and sealing by maintaining a constant current in the hot wire <b>402</b> while retracting or extending the wire <b>400</b> through the aperture <b>404</b> per the card/cassette cycle requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As for feature b), the sealer housing or enclosure <b>406</b> orients a wire assembly <b>408</b> and associated drive mechanism <b>410</b> at an angle allowing alignment of the wire <b>402</b> using only one motor <b>412</b> to control the horizontal and vertical position. The wire alignment is achieved by adjusting the mounting of the housing <b>406</b> in the instrument or the alignment of the drive mechanism <b>410</b> to the housing, and/or setting the limit positions of the motor <b>412</b> in firmware.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As for feature c) and d), the wire <b>402</b> and its associated assembly <b>408</b>, and the drive mechanism <b>410</b> are ordinarily placed within the housing <b>406</b>. A shield <b>416</b> covers the entrance aperture <b>406</b>. When a card is in position for sealing, the motor <b>412</b> is energized and the motor operates to move the wire assembly <b>408</b> down and at an angle through the aperture <b>406</b>. This action causes the shield <b>416</b> to move out of the way to a retracted position. A spring-loaded pad <b>414</b> in the wire assembly <b>408</b> and located in front of the wire <b>402</b> makes contact with the edge of a card <b>100</b> and preloads or biases the cards <b>100</b> using a coil spring <b>415</b> against a fixed structure or stop in the instrument. The fixed structure is in the form of a rail <b>604</b> extending lengthwise along the face of the incubation station <b>600</b> housing <b>602</b>. (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>). Other constructions are of course possible. The wire <b>402</b> then cuts through the transfer tube to produce uniform stubs lengths as the cards <b>100</b> are moved past the stationary sealer wire <b>402</b>. After the sealing operation is completed, the motor <b>412</b> is energized to retract the wire assembly <b>408</b> into the housing <b>406</b>. As it does so, the rotating shield <b>416</b> retracts by gravity to a closed position covering the aperture <b>404</b>. This covering of the aperture <b>404</b> prevents the user from gaining access to the retracted hot wire <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As the carrier <b>200</b> approaches the sealer station, the transport system <b>1000</b> slows its movement to a slow speed. The motor <b>412</b> in the sealer station <b>400</b> energizes to move the wire subassembly <b>408</b> through the aperture <b>404</b> and expose the wire <b>402</b>. The pad or &#x201c;shoe&#x201d; <b>414</b> is mounted approximately 2.0 mm in front of the sealer wire <b>402</b>. The shoe is spring loaded by a compression spring <b>415</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. The shoe or pad <b>414</b> mounts with a single shoulder screw <b>420</b> and incorporates an anti-rotation feature. As the card <b>100</b> approaches the hot wire <b>402</b>, the shoe <b>414</b> makes initial contact with the card, deflecting the spring <b>415</b> and preloading the card <b>100</b> against the rail <b>604</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>) on the incubation assembly panel <b>602</b>. This insures consistency in transfer tube stub length. Forward motion of the carrier <b>200</b> past the hot wire <b>402</b> cuts the transfer tube <b>102</b>, melting the plastic transfer tube <b>102</b> and sealing each card. After all the cards <b>100</b> in the carrier are sealed, the transport system <b>100</b> again reverses direction along its track and each of the cards is placed in registry with the card autoloader system <b>500</b> for loading into carousel incubation station <b>600</b> to incubate.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The sealer wire <b>402</b> in the preferred embodiment is a heated 18 Gauge Chromel A wire mounted on a sliding block mechanism <b>422</b> inside the metal enclosure or housing <b>406</b>. The housing <b>406</b> positions the drive mechanism <b>410</b> at an angle, and locates the extended sealer wire/preload shoe <b>414</b> at the correct height, and prevents user access to the sealer wire <b>402</b> and drive mechanism. The drive mechanism <b>410</b> is mounted at an angle (&#x3b1; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>) to simplify the horizontal and vertical alignment. A stepper motor <b>412</b> extends the hot wire mounting-block <b>426</b> at a 30&#xb0; angle from horizontal to simultaneously adjust the horizontal and vertical position. This angle can of course vary in different embodiments and could vary for example between 20 and 70 degrees. The exact alignment of the sealer wire <b>402</b> is adjustable by firmware controlling the limits of the motor <b>412</b> to ensure a uniform stub length between 1.0 and 2.5 mm. When the cutting and sealing operation is finished, the stepper motor <b>412</b> retracts the hot wire assembly <b>408</b> until a flag <b>424</b> on the block <b>426</b> in the drive system is sensed by home position sensor <b>428</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>). The assembly includes a chain <b>448</b> that serves to protect a wire <b>446</b> supplying current to the cutting wire <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As the hot wire assembly <b>408</b> and mounting-block <b>426</b> is retracted, the rotating shield <b>416</b> drops down by gravity and covers the housing opening <b>404</b>. The shield <b>416</b> has a tang <b>430</b> and flange <b>452</b>. The flange <b>452</b> is positioned inside the elongate opening <b>454</b> in the housing <b>406</b> when the unit is assembled. The flange <b>452</b> contacts the shoulder <b>426</b> of the mounting-block <b>426</b> as the block <b>426</b> nears the retracted home position. The tang <b>430</b> and flange <b>452</b> prevents the user from lifting the shield <b>416</b> and gaining access to the hot wire. When the sealer motor <b>412</b> is energized, it causes the pin <b>462</b> to slide through the slot <b>460</b> in the drive mechanism <b>410</b> and thereby extends the hot wire mounting-block <b>422</b>. The protective shield <b>406</b> is pushed open by the contact between the face of the block <b>422</b>, which causes the shield to rotate upward, exposing the hot wire <b>402</b> and preload shoe <b>414</b>. The microcontroller supplies a constant current to the wire <b>402</b> sufficient to produce the proper temperature for cutting through the transfer tubes as the cards pass by, melting the plastic and leaving a small stub of the tube to seal the interior of the card from the atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Card Autoloader Station <b>500</b> (FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>25</b>-<b>28</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring now to FIGS. <b>20</b> and <b>25</b>-<b>28</b>, the instrument <b>10</b> further includes a card autoloader station <b>500</b> that loads sealed cards <b>100</b> into the incubation station <b>600</b>. After the cards have been sealed, the carrier <b>200</b> is moved to the autoloader station <b>500</b>. The slots <b>212</b> in the bottom of the carrier <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) allow the transport system <b>1000</b> to position each card directly in front of the incubator <b>600</b> entrance slot <b>610</b>, shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. The slot in the carrier is determined and tracked automatically by the instrument's internal microcontroller.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The autoloader station <b>500</b> includes a reciprocating, motor-driven pusher mechanism <b>502</b>, located above the carrier <b>200</b>. The mechanism <b>502</b> pushes the card <b>100</b> laterally off of the carrier <b>200</b> into the carousel (not shown) in the incubation station <b>600</b>. The incubation station <b>600</b> carousel is a circular carousel oriented on its side (rotating about a horizontal axis) having 30 or 60 slots. One of the slots is positioned at the 6 o'clock position directly in alignment with the card entrance slot <b>610</b>. The pusher mechanism <b>502</b> returns home and the transport system <b>1000</b> and carousel index to the next card position. The loading of the next card in the carrier <b>200</b> proceeds in the same fashion. Upon completion of loading all the cards, the transport system <b>1000</b> returns the carrier <b>200</b> and test tubes <b>106</b> to the load/unload station <b>14</b> and notifies the user via the indicator <b>32</b> and user interface <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Referring now in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25-28</figref>, the autoloader includes a motor <b>504</b> that drives a block <b>506</b> attached to the card pusher mechanism <b>502</b>. The block <b>506</b> has internal threads that engage a threaded shaft <b>510</b> extending laterally across the path of the carrier <b>200</b>. As the motor <b>504</b> drives the block <b>506</b>, the block <b>506</b> and attached pusher <b>502</b> slides along a guide <b>508</b>. The pusher <b>502</b> contacts the cards <b>100</b> in the carrier and inserts them automatically into the slot <b>610</b> in the incubation station <b>600</b>. The tips <b>512</b> and <b>514</b> of the shaft <b>510</b> and guide <b>508</b> are received in apertures in a plate <b>612</b> mounted to the housing <b>602</b> of the incubation station as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27 and 28</figref>. A pair of guides <b>612</b> guide the cards <b>100</b> into the slot <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Incubation Station <b>600</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-20</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The incubation station <b>600</b> in the instrument <b>10</b> will now be described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16-20</figref>. The incubation station includes a circular carousel. The circular carousel is not shown in the drawings, as it is covered by a removable access cover <b>630</b> forming an incubation enclosure. The carousel is rotated by means of a motor <b>632</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. The structure and operation of the incubation station <b>600</b> and its associated carousel is basically the same as set forth in the patent literature, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,024,921; 6,136,270 and 6,155,565, the contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. See also U.S. Pat. No. 5,762,873. Accordingly, a detailed description of the construction of the incubation station <b>600</b> is omitted for the sake of brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Once the test sample cards have been sealed and the cards loaded into the carousel via the entrance slot <b>610</b>, they remain in the carousel for the duration of the test period (up to 18 hours) or until the predetermined time allotment is met. The time allotment varies for each reagent or type of card. The carousel is contained in a temperature-controlled chamber (incubator), enclosed by the access panel <b>630</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The carousel itself in a preferred embodiment is composed of four quadrants (called quadrocells or quads), as taught in U.S. Pat. No. 6,136,270, together capable of holding up to 60 test cards within the incubator. Alternative configurations are possible. Positioning of the carousel is accomplished by optical sensors located at the top and bottom of the carousel, which read positioning slots on the outside edge of the carousel. Each carousel quadrant can be removed independently for cleaning. However, all four carousel quads must be in place in order for cards to be processed.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The incubator system regulates the temperature of the cards in the carousel. The temperature is monitored and controlled through the use of precision thermistors monitored by a microcontroller maintaining at an average carousel temperature of 35.5&#xb1;1&#xb0; C. Access for a separate user installed probe thermometer has been provided to the front of the Incubator Cover. This allows the user to verify the accuracy of the incubator temperature using an independent calibrated thermometer. The rotating carousel system delivers test cards to the card transport system <b>700</b>, which moves the cards to the reader station <b>800</b> four times an hour until the test is completed. The reader head optics scans each card and returns them to the incubator. The carousel includes a card eject mechanism <b>640</b> shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> that ejects a card from the 12 o'clock position in the carousel and places it in a test card transport system <b>700</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) for transfer to the optics station <b>800</b> and return to the incubation station <b>600</b>. This is the same as described in e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,762,873.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Card Transport System <b>700</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>17</b> and <b>20</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>17</b> and <b>20</b>, the instrument includes a card transport system <b>700</b> that transfers the cards from the incubation station <b>600</b> past the optical reading station <b>800</b> for reading of the wells <b>104</b> in the cards <b>100</b>. The card transport system <b>700</b> is essentially the same as described in the prior U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,798,085; 5,853,666; and 5,888,455, which are incorporated by reference herein. Accordingly, a more detailed description is omitted for the sake of brevity. Basically, the card is held in a vertical attitude between a belt <b>704</b> and a ledge <b>702</b> and moved from right to left and left to right by means of a motor driving the belt <b>704</b> back and forth. The ledge includes a slot feature for holding cards in the vertical position as the belt drives the cards back and forth. As the cards are moved past the transmittance optics heads, the cards are moved in a precise fashion as explained below to obtain transmittance measurements for each of the wells in the card at a multitude of positions across the width of the wells. The card includes built-in alignment sensor stop holes <b>130</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) to accurately position the wells in the optical system.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Reading Station <b>800</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>16</b> and <b>17</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Once the cards are placed in the card transport system <b>700</b>, they are moved past the reading station <b>800</b>. The reading station includes two transmittance optics modules <b>802</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>) that are oriented vertically, in the same direction as the columns of wells in the card. Each module <b>802</b> obtains measurements from one column of wells. Together, the modules <b>802</b> obtain transmittance measurements of the wells of the card in two columns of wells at the same time. The construction and manner of operation of the optical reader station <b>800</b> is essentially the same as described in the prior U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,798,085; 5,853,666; and 5,888,455, therefore only a general overview and discussion will be set forth herein for sake of brevity. Unlike these patents, the illustrated embodiment provides only transmittance measurements, but of course fluorescence measurements could be taken as described in these patents by either replacing one of the modules <b>802</b> with a fluorescence module (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,925,884) or adding a fluorescence module to provide three modules. Additional modules of course could be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The card <b>100</b> is positioned and read by the transmittance optical system modules <b>802</b> and returned to the carousel slot from which it was ejected. No data analysis takes place in the instrument; optical data is collected and transmitted to a remote workstation for analysis. Raw data may be queued and transmitted to the workstation later, in the event that communications between the instrument and workstation is not occurring.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The reader station <b>800</b> scans each of the cards <b>100</b> once every fifteen minutes, for four scans per hour. Each time the card is read, it returns to the carousel to be incubated until the next reading cycle. After the last reading cycle is complete, the card is transported through the optics to the card disposal system <b>900</b> for card ejection into the waste collection container.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The reader system <b>800</b> and card transport system <b>700</b> together performs card positioning and optical data collection in order to periodically monitor the growth of organisms inside the wells of the test cards. Optical transmittance data is used to quantify organism growth by measuring the optical transmittance of each well versus time. The illustrated embodiment currently supports two types of optics modules <b>802</b>. The first module <b>802</b> has 660 nm LEDs illumination sources for each well. The other module <b>802</b> has 428 nm and 568 nm LEDs for each well. Development of a third module with additional wavelengths is of course possible.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Each optics module <b>802</b> has 8 measurement LEDs so that it can read 8 sample wells per column. Each card has 8 (or 16) columns of wells for a total of 64 wells per card. Each module <b>802</b> includes not only the transmittance LED light source for each well but also a detector for each well that captures the LED light after passing through the well. The detectors use silicon photodiodes. Sampling takes place as the card, with its 8 columns of 8 sample wells, moves through the optical path (from LED to photodiode) of the modules <b>802</b>. The reading system scans across each well as the card is moved by the transport system <b>700</b> in 16 spatially separated steps, taking 3 readings per step. This data is then processed to reduce the effect of any bubbles that may have formed in the wells. The readings are smoothed and the peak value is chosen.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The emitter and detector housings in the modules <b>802</b> are hinged for ease of servicing and access to the optics area for cleaning. This detection system is capable of auto calibrating internally through air for 30% to 100% transmission (no light to full light). The optics is calibrated to 100% transmission through air automatically before reading each card.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Disposal System <b>900</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16</figref>, <b>17</b>, <b>20</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Once incubation and optical testing of a test sample card <b>100</b> is complete, the card is automatically removed from the carousel in the incubation station <b>600</b>, passed through the reader station <b>800</b>, and transferred to a disposal system <b>900</b>. The disposal system includes a disposal enclosure <b>904</b> that holds a waste container or bucket <b>906</b>, and a ramp <b>908</b> that directs the card from the edge of the card transport system <b>700</b> into a chute <b>910</b> positioned directly above the waste container <b>906</b>. The waste container is removable from the instrument <b>10</b> and is accessed via the door <b>902</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The card is transported to the ramp <b>908</b> simply by operating the belt in the transport system <b>700</b> to the left to carry the card past the edge of the left-hand ledge <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The waste collection station <b>900</b> is located below the vacuum station <b>300</b> at the front of the instrument <b>10</b>. It houses a removable waste container <b>906</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) and a sensor (not shown) to detect when the container is installed. The user is notified when the waste container <b>906</b> is full or jammed by means of the user interface <b>22</b>. Software in the instrument tracks the number of cards added to the container after it has been emptied.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Carrier Transport system <b>1000</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-33</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The instrument <b>10</b> includes a system <b>1000</b> for transporting the carrier <b>200</b> from the loading and unloading station <b>16</b> through the carrier and test device processing subsystem <b>50</b>. The transport system <b>1000</b> is shown isolated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29-33</figref> in order to better illustrate the components of the system. Their interrelationship with the various modules in the instrument <b>10</b> will be appreciated from inspection of the remaining figures, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17</figref>, <b>19</b> and <b>20</b>, and from the following discussion.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Basically, the transport system <b>100</b> includes the carrier <b>200</b> and a transport subassembly <b>1002</b> that moves the carrier <b>200</b> back and forth. The transport subassembly <b>1002</b> includes a cassette-engaging member <b>1004</b> in the form of a block that that is adapted to engage the carrier in the manner described below. The transport subassembly <b>1002</b> is constructed and arranged such that it moves the block <b>1004</b> and the carrier <b>200</b> back and forth along a single longitudinal axis between the carrier loading and unloading station <b>16</b>, the sealing station <b>400</b>, and the incubation loading station <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The transport subassembly <b>1002</b> includes a linear actuator motor <b>1006</b> that rotates a threaded shaft <b>1010</b>. The threaded shaft <b>1010</b> is received in a threaded nut <b>1005</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>) that is attached to the block <b>1004</b>. A cylindrical guide member <b>1008</b> extends between a motor/guide rod mount <b>1018</b> and a front bearing mount <b>1020</b>. The front bearing mount <b>1020</b> is fastened to the base <b>1016</b> of the transport subassembly <b>1002</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. A pair of lift pins <b>1012</b> extend upwards from a drive nut engagement slide <b>1022</b> through apertures <b>1024</b> in the block <b>1004</b>. The lift pins are biased by springs <b>1026</b> to a lower position, such that when the block <b>1004</b> is positioned at the loading/unloading station <b>14</b>, the lower edge of the lift pins <b>1012</b> are in contact with a ramp or cam surface <b>1014</b> formed in the base <b>1016</b>. When the block <b>1004</b> is moved by the motor <b>1006</b> towards the rear of the instrument, the lift pins ride up the ramp <b>1014</b> and thereby extend through the apertures <b>1024</b>. In this upper position, the lift pins can then make contact with features on the underneath side of the carrier <b>200</b> and thereby pull the carrier along the track <b>1030</b> as the motor <b>1006</b> moves the block <b>1004</b> towards the rear of the instrument to the bar code reading station <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In operation, a reflective sensor <b>1040</b> positioned on the side of the incubation station housing as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> detects the presence of a carrier in the loading and unloading station <b>16</b>. As the linear actuator motor <b>1006</b> rotates the shaft <b>1010</b>, the block <b>1004</b> is moved from the front of the instrument <b>10</b> and the two lift pins <b>1012</b> are lifted to engage the test sample carrier <b>200</b>. The pins <b>1012</b> are lifted by means of the cam surface <b>1014</b> molded into the base <b>1016</b> of the transport subassembly <b>1002</b>. The pins <b>1012</b> are attached to the drive nut engagement slide <b>1022</b>, which holds ball bearing wheels (not shown). The ball bearings ride up the cam surface <b>1014</b>, lifting the pins <b>1012</b>, when the motor <b>1006</b> is indexed to move the block <b>1004</b> to the rear of the instrument. The carrier <b>200</b> is then dragged into the instrument past a second reflective sensor <b>1042</b> (also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>), which counts the number of test sample cards and determines their location in the carrier. The carrier <b>200</b> and its test sample cards are then presented to the bar code reader station <b>60</b>, which reads the bar codes on the test sample cards <b>100</b> and the carrier <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">After the bar codes are read, the motor reverses and moves the carrier toward the front of the instrument towards the loading and unloading station <b>14</b>. During the forward travel the hot wire in the sealing station <b>400</b> is deployed and the test sample cards are sealed. The motor <b>1006</b> reverses again and the carrier <b>200</b> is moved to the card autoloader station <b>500</b> and placed into position where the test sample cards can be pushed off the carrier <b>200</b> and into the incubation station <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Three optical interrupt sensors <b>1050</b>A, <b>1050</b>B and <b>1050</b>C (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>) track the position of the carrier <b>200</b> over the entire travel. The three sensors <b>1050</b> are mounted to a single printed circuit board <b>1052</b> that is snapped into the transport subassembly base <b>1016</b>. The carrier <b>200</b> slides over removable and replaceable wear strips <b>1054</b>. The wear strips <b>1054</b> minimize friction between the carrier <b>200</b> and the base <b>1016</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">As noted above, the linear actuator stepper motor <b>1006</b> moves the block <b>1004</b>. The block <b>1004</b> restrains the lift pins <b>1012</b>. The motor's shaft <b>1010</b> extends nearly the entire length of the subassembly <b>1002</b>. The end of the shaft <b>1010</b> rotates in a pillow block bearing <b>1020</b> shown best in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. The motor end mounts into an aluminum bracket <b>1018</b>. The motor <b>1006</b> is mounted to the bracket <b>1018</b> indirectly via four vibration control grommets and shoulder screws.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The rotating motor <b>1006</b> drives an acme threaded nut <b>1005</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>) along the length of the shaft <b>1010</b>. The nut <b>1005</b> is pressed into the aluminum block <b>1056</b>, which is coupled indirectly to the drive block <b>1004</b> via two vibration control grommets <b>1058</b> and shoulder screws <b>1060</b>. The shoulder screws <b>1060</b> allow the nut <b>1005</b> to self align, preventing the nut <b>1005</b> from binding with the shaft <b>1010</b>. The grommets <b>1058</b> prevent noise generated by the nut <b>1005</b> from transmitting through the drive block <b>1004</b> and into the base <b>1016</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The drive block <b>1004</b> is moved horizontally by the nut <b>1005</b>. When moving toward the front of the instrument, a bearing surface <b>1060</b> on the block <b>1004</b> pushes the rear surface <b>220</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) of the carrier <b>200</b>. When moving toward the back of the instrument, the two lift pins <b>112</b> lift through the holes <b>1024</b> in the drive block to engage a rib <b>222</b> on the underside of the sample carrier (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">When the drive block <b>1004</b> is at the front, the block functions as a stop for a new sample carrier <b>200</b> being inserted into the instrument. When the drive block <b>1004</b> is at the back of the instrument, a reflective sensor <b>1064</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>) detects it and indicates to the instrument microcontroller that the block <b>1004</b> is in its home position.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Three optical interrupt sensors <b>1050</b>A, <b>1050</b>B and <b>1050</b>C are mounted to the printed circuit board <b>1052</b>. The use of the circuit board <b>1052</b> eliminates the wires screws required when mounting the sensors directly to the base <b>1016</b>. The sensors <b>1050</b>A, <b>1050</b>B and <b>1050</b>C detect the notches <b>212</b> on the underside of the carrier <b>200</b>, as explained above. Each notch corresponds to the location of a test sample card. The sensors are located on the printed circuit board at the card counter reflective sensor position (sensor <b>1050</b>A), the bar code reading position (sensor <b>1050</b>B), and the incubator loading position (sensor <b>1050</b>C). The sensors <b>1050</b> A-C allow the carrier's position to be continuously monitored.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">The lift pin subassembly consists of two vertical pins <b>1012</b> mounted into an aluminum block <b>1022</b> containing two ball bearing rollers (not shown) at the base of the pins, functioning as wheels. The horizontal surface <b>1066</b> the wheels roll on is stepped near the front of the instrument to provide the cam or ramp surface <b>1014</b>. The step is angled to allow the wheels to roll up and down, raising and lowering the pins <b>1012</b>. Compression springs <b>1070</b> on the pins between the drive block <b>1004</b> and the body of the lift pin subassembly ensure that lift pin subassembly drops when rolling down the cam <b>1014</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Rails <b>1072</b> are provided to constrain the carrier's motion to forward and backward. The wear strips <b>1054</b> are mounted on the left and right horizontal surfaces of the base <b>1016</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> to provide a low friction and wear surface for the carrier <b>200</b> to slide on.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The front cover <b>602</b> of instrument incubator station <b>600</b> provides three functions for the transport system. Firstly, a horizontal rib <b>1080</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) prevents test sample cards from sliding off the right side of the carrier <b>200</b> prior to insertion into the incubation station <b>600</b>. Secondly, the reflective sensor <b>1040</b> (also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>) mounted near the front determines when the carrier <b>200</b> is present in the loading station. Thirdly, the sensor <b>1042</b> mounted just behind the sensor <b>1040</b> counts the test sample cards <b>100</b> and determines their location on the carrier <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 16</figref>, the front panel of the instrument has a tapered entryway in the loading and unloading station <b>16</b> for loading for the carrier <b>200</b>. The carrier <b>200</b> is inserted until it contacts the drive block <b>1014</b>. The door <b>14</b> is closed and the sensor <b>1040</b> registers the carrier's presence. The space between the door <b>14</b> and drive block <b>1004</b> is such that the reflective sensor <b>1040</b> will always detect the carrier <b>200</b> if it is present in the loading and unloading station.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Control Electronics and Firmware</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The instrument <b>10</b> includes control electronics and firmware for controlling the operation of the various modules and subsystems of the instrument. The control electronics is conventional. Such electronics and firmware can be developed with ordinary effort by persons skilled in the art from the present disclosure, given the present state of the art.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Work Flow (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>)</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The work flow and processing steps for the instrument <b>10</b> will now be described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> together with the other Figures. At step <b>1100</b>, the user prepares the sample inoculum off line, loads the fluid samples into the test tubes, scans the bar codes on the cards <b>100</b>, and loads the cards <b>100</b> and test tubes into the carrier (cassette) <b>200</b>. The bar code may be scanned off line with a separate bar code scanner. The scanning steps may be performed at a separate identification station having a workstation or computer programmed to receive information regarding the samples being tested, the scans of the bar codes on the cards being used, and the scan of the carrier bar code.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">At step <b>1102</b>, the user opens the vacuum chamber door <b>302</b> and loads the loaded carrier (as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) into the vacuum chamber <b>304</b>, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. The user then closes the door <b>302</b> to thereby seal the chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">At step <b>1104</b>, the user initiates the vacuum cycle filling the cards via the user interface <b>22</b> keypad.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">At step <b>1106</b>, the vacuum pump is energized and a vacuum is generated inside the vacuum chamber <b>304</b>. The vacuum displacement fills the cards in the carrier in the manner described above.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">At step <b>1108</b>, a test is made to see if the reagent fill was successful. The vacuum slope and time are monitored to insurer reagent fill.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">At step <b>1110</b>, if the reagent fill was not successful, the carrier processing is aborted as indicated at step <b>1112</b> and the user removes the carrier <b>200</b> the vacuum station <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">At step <b>1114</b>, if the reagent fill was successful, the user unloads the carrier <b>200</b> from the vacuum chamber <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">At step <b>1116</b>, the user opens the door <b>14</b> and manually places the carrier into the loading and unloading station <b>16</b>. The detection of the carrier is made by the sensor <b>1040</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">At step <b>1118</b>, the transport system <b>1000</b> moves the carrier <b>200</b> to the bar code reader station <b>60</b>. En route, the cards <b>1000</b> loaded into the carrier are detected by the card sensor <b>1042</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">At step <b>1120</b>, the bar codes in the carrier and on the cards are read by the bar code scanner in the reader station <b>60</b>. The bar codes for the carrier and the cards are compared to the bar codes scanned off-line (if such scanning was done).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">At step <b>1122</b>, the instrument determines whether the bar code read was successful. If not, the process proceeds to step <b>1124</b> where the transport system <b>1000</b> moves the carrier back to the loading/unloading station <b>16</b> and the door <b>14</b> is unlocked. At step <b>1126</b>, the user corrects errors if possible.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">If the bar code read was successful, the process proceeds to step <b>1128</b>. At this step, the transport system moves the carrier to the sealer station <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">At step <b>1130</b>, the sealer station <b>400</b> operates to seal each of the test sample cards in the carrier in the manner described above. The transfer tube remnants fall into the test tubes. The remaining stub seals the test sample cards.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">At step <b>1132</b>, a check is made to determine whether the seal of all the cards was successful. This is done by monitoring the hot sealer wire current, monitoring the sealer motor steps, and monitor the transport motor steps, and if there are no errors, the sealer worked.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">If the sealing step was not successful, the process proceeds to step <b>1142</b> and the test is aborted and the processing proceeds to step <b>1138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">If the sealing step was successful, the transport system <b>1000</b> moves the carrier <b>200</b> to the card autoloader system <b>500</b>, as indicated at step <b>1134</b>. The card autoloader is described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">At step <b>1136</b>, the card autoloader station <b>500</b> operates to load the cards one at a time into the carousel in the incubation station <b>600</b>. The incubator carousel may rotate or index to any available position to accommodate the next card.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">At step <b>1138</b>, after step <b>1136</b> is completed, the transport system <b>1000</b> moves the carrier <b>200</b> with the test tubes and transfer tube remnants to the loading and unloading station <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">At step <b>1140</b>, the user removes the carrier <b>200</b> and disposes of the test tubes and their contents. The carrier is now ready for reuse.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">At step <b>1144</b>, the cards <b>100</b> are now housed in the incubation station <b>600</b> where they are incubated at a constant temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">At step <b>1146</b>, the cards are periodically pushed out of their slot in the carousel and placed into the card transport system <b>700</b>, where they are shuttled back and forth to the reading system <b>800</b>. The reading of all the wells in the card is designed to occur at every 15 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">At step <b>1148</b>, the transmittance measurements obtained by the optics modules <b>802</b> are transmitted to the separate workstation via communications ports or interfaces in the instrument <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">At step <b>1150</b>, a check is made to determine if the reading of the cards is complete. This would occur such as by whether a reaction has occurred in one or more of the wells such that the periodic reading of the cards indicates that identification of the sample or susceptibility of the sample can be determined. If the test is not complete (i.e., more reading needs to occur), the processing proceeds to path <b>1152</b> and the card is sent back to its slot in the carousel for more incubation and additional reading, and steps <b>1144</b>, <b>1146</b>, <b>1148</b> and <b>1150</b> repeat.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">If, at step <b>1150</b>, the reading is complete, a check is made to see if the waste container in the disposal station enclosure <b>904</b> is full. If so, the user is notified at step <b>1158</b>. If not, the card transport system <b>700</b> moves the card all the way to the left past the end of the ledge <b>702</b> and the card falls into the disposal system chute <b>910</b> and lands in the waste container in the enclosure <b>904</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">At step <b>1162</b>, the user periodically empties the waste container.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Variation from the specifics of the disclosed embodiments are to be expected depending on the configuration of the test devices and other factors. The scope of the invention is to be determined by reference to the appended claims, in view of the above.</p>
