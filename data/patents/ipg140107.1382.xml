<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-211261, filed on Aug. 20, 2008. The entire disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-211261 is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to a backlight device for a liquid crystal module. More specifically, the present invention relates to a backlight device for a liquid crystal module.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Information</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional liquid crystal module includes a liquid crystal cell and a backlight device. The backlight device is disposed directly behind the liquid crystal cell.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The backlight device mainly includes a linear light source, a light reflecting member, a plurality of optical sheets and a frame. The linear light source includes a straight tube or U-tube fluorescent tube. Electrodes at the ends of the linear light source are fitted into a power socket. The light reflecting member is disposed at the back of the linear light source. The light reflecting member includes a reflecting face. The light from the linear light source is reflected by the light reflecting member, and shines from the back onto the liquid crystal cell. The optical sheets include a light diffusing plate, and are disposed in the required type and number between the light reflecting member and the liquid crystal cell. The light reflected by the reflecting face of the light reflecting member passes through the optical sheets, and shines on the liquid crystal cell from the back, which maintains the brightness balance of an image display face of the liquid crystal cell. The frame supports the linear light source, the light reflecting member and the optical sheets. The frame is made of molded resin or sheet metal.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The linear light source and the light reflecting member are mounted in the frame. All or substantially all of the surface of the light reflecting member is a reflecting face. The reflecting face is divided into one wide, rectangular center region located at the back of the linear light source, and slender, trapezoidal peripheral regions that are raised up in a slanted orientation from four sides of the center region.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">With the conventional backlight device, the light reflecting member is formed by combining a sheet that can be bent, and frame pieces. The frame pieces are formed from resin by injection molding.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The sheet is bent along straight bending lines set at places near the two long sides, and has a silhouette shape that is substantially rectangular. The sheet is bent and held so that the rectangular center region and two of the trapezoidal peripheral regions on either side of the center region are formed in the sheet. In the two peripheral regions formed by the sheet, the ends in the lengthwise direction of each of the peripheral regions are formed in a shape such that the spacing between the ends of each of the peripheral regions widens moving away from the bending lines. Thus, the peripheral regions are formed in a trapezoidal shape.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The frame piece is a resin molding formed by injection molding. The frame piece has a slender, slanted, trapezoidal reflecting face. The frame pieces are disposed symmetrically on either side in the lengthwise direction of the sheet. The slender, trapezoidal reflecting faces of the frame pieces are used as the other two peripheral regions. The ends of the slender, trapezoidal reflecting faces of the frame pieces are butted against the ends of the slender, trapezoidal peripheral regions formed by the sheet, and the butting configuration of the four peripheral regions forms a rectangular shape.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Meanwhile, with another conventional backlight device, the light from a light source is reflected by a reflecting plate (see Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Nos. 2004-102119 and 2004-55182, for example). In the conventional backlight device, uneven brightness is avoided by providing a peaked portion to the reflecting plate. Furthermore, warping of the reflecting plate is prevented by using a multilayer structure for the reflecting plate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, when the light reflecting member is a combination of the sheet with the two frame pieces, three components are required to form the light reflecting member, namely, the sheet and the two frame pieces. This not only increases the cost, but also makes the assembly process more complicated and diminishes productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In view of the above, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure that there exists a need for an improved backlight device. This invention addresses this need in the art as well as other needs, which will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this disclosure.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention is conceived in light of the above-mentioned problems. One object of the present invention is to provide a backlight device whose production cost is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a backlight device for a liquid crystal module includes a linear light source and a light reflecting member. The linear light source is configured to emit light. The light reflecting member is arranged to reflect the light emitted from the linear light source toward a liquid crystal cell of the liquid crystal module. The light reflecting member includes a center reflecting face, a pair of first peripheral reflecting faces and a pair of second peripheral reflecting faces. The center reflecting face is formed in a rectangular shape and disposed rearward with respect to the linear light source. The pair of first peripheral reflecting faces is formed in a trapezoidal shape and extends from a pair of first opposing side portions of the center reflecting face frontward and outward with respect to the center reflecting face, respectively. The pair of second peripheral reflecting faces is formed in a trapezoidal shape and extends from a pair of second opposing side portions of the center reflecting face frontward and outward with respect to the center reflecting face, respectively. The center reflecting face and the first and second peripheral reflecting faces are integrally formed from a sheet-like member as a one-piece, unitary member.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With the backlight device of the present invention, it is possible to provide a back light device whose production cost is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">These and other objects, features, aspects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following detailed descriptions, which, taken in conjunction with the annexed drawings, disclose selected embodiments of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Selected embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the drawings. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art from these disclosures that the following descriptions of the selected embodiments of the present invention are provided for illustration only and not for the purpose of limiting the invention as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A liquid crystal module includes a liquid crystal cell (not shown) and a backlight device. The backlight device is disposed directly behind the liquid crystal cell. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref>, the backlight device mainly includes a pair of linear light sources <b>1</b>, a light reflecting member <b>3</b>, a plurality of optical sheets <b>4</b> and a frame <b>5</b>. The linear light sources <b>1</b> emit light. Each of the linear light sources <b>1</b> includes a U-shaped fluorescent tube. The linear light source <b>1</b> has electrodes at ends of the linear light source <b>1</b>. The electrodes are inserted into power sockets <b>2</b> to supply electronic power to the linear light source <b>1</b>. The light reflecting member <b>3</b> is disposed at the back (e.g., the rear side) of the linear light source <b>1</b>, and has a reflecting face. The light from the linear light source <b>1</b> is reflected by the light reflecting member <b>3</b>, and shines from the back toward the liquid crystal cell. The light reflecting member <b>3</b> is formed as a one-piece, unitary member. The optical sheets <b>4</b> includes a light diffusing plate, and are disposed in the required type and number between the light reflecting member <b>3</b> and the liquid crystal cell. The light reflected by the reflecting face of the light reflecting member <b>3</b> passes through the optical sheets <b>4</b>, and shines on the liquid crystal cell from the back. As a result, the brightness balance of a display face of the liquid crystal cell is maintained. The linear light source <b>1</b>, the light reflecting member <b>3</b> and the optical sheets <b>4</b> are supported on the frame <b>5</b>. The frame <b>5</b> is made of molded resin or sheet metal.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the light reflecting member <b>3</b> is made of a sheet (e.g., sheet-like member) <b>8</b>. The entire light reflecting member <b>3</b> is formed by just the single sheet <b>8</b> as a one-piece, unitary member. In other words, the light reflecting member <b>3</b> is not formed by combining a sheet with frame pieces, as the conventional light reflecting member. All or substantially all of the surface of the light reflecting member <b>3</b> is a reflecting face.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The sheet <b>8</b> has a center region (e.g., center reflecting face) Z<b>1</b>, a pair of top and bottom peripheral regions (e.g., a pair of first peripheral reflecting faces) Z<b>2</b> and Z<b>4</b>, and a pair of left and right trapezoidal peripheral regions (e.g., a pair of second peripheral reflecting faces) Z<b>3</b> and Z<b>5</b>. The center region Z<b>1</b> is formed in a rectangular shape. The center region Z<b>1</b> is located at the back of the linear light source <b>1</b>. The peripheral regions Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>4</b>, and Z<b>5</b> are formed in a trapezoidal shape. The peripheral regions Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>4</b>, and Z<b>5</b> are raised up in a slanted orientation from four sides <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b> of the center region Z<b>1</b>. Specifically, the top and bottom peripheral regions Z<b>2</b> and Z<b>4</b> extend from top and bottom long side portions (e.g., a pair of first opposing side portions) of the center region Z<b>1</b> frontward and outward with respect to the center region Z<b>1</b>. The left and right peripheral regions Z<b>3</b> and Z<b>5</b> extend from left and right short side portions (e.g., a pair of second opposing side portions) of the center region Z<b>1</b> frontward and outward with respect to the center region Z<b>1</b>. The sheet <b>8</b> is bent at four places around the periphery of the center region Z<b>1</b> along straight bending lines (e.g., bent portions) L<b>11</b>, L<b>12</b>, L<b>13</b>, and L<b>14</b>, which forms the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>4</b>, and Z<b>5</b>, and also forms the center region Z<b>1</b> having the four sides <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b> that are formed by the bending lines L<b>11</b>, L<b>12</b>, L<b>13</b>, and L<b>14</b>. Therefore, the center region Z<b>1</b> has a wide, rectangular region bounded by the four sides <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b>. Also, the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>4</b>, and Z<b>5</b> has slender, trapezoidal regions that are raised up in the slanted orientation from the four sides <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b> of the center region Z<b>1</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">When the sheet <b>8</b> is spread out as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the sheet <b>8</b> has a shape in which V-shaped cuts C having the same shape are formed at four corners of a rectangular sheet material. The straight lines that connect the bottom points (e.g., the vertex) of the cuts C correspond to the bending lines L<b>11</b>, L<b>12</b>, L<b>13</b>, and L<b>14</b>. The rectangular region bounded by the bending lines L<b>11</b>, L<b>12</b>, L<b>13</b>, and L<b>14</b> corresponds to the center region Z<b>1</b>. Therefore, the places where the bending lines L<b>11</b>, L<b>12</b>, L<b>13</b>, and L<b>14</b> are formed correspond to the four sides <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b> of the center region Z<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Outer regions of the four bending lines L<b>11</b>, L<b>12</b>, L<b>13</b>, and L<b>14</b> are trapezoidal in shape.

With the sheet <b>8</b>, slender extension tabs <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, and <b>84</b> are provided to outer edges of the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>4</b>, and Z<b>5</b>, respectively. The extension tabs <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, and <b>84</b> are narrow in width.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">When the trapezoidal regions are bent in the slanted orientation along the four straight bending lines L<b>11</b>, L<b>12</b>, L<b>13</b>, and L<b>14</b>, and the sheet <b>8</b> is held in the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, this forms the center region Z<b>1</b> and the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>4</b>, and Z<b>5</b> that are raised up in the slanted orientation from the four sides <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, and <b>14</b> of the center region Z<b>1</b>, respectively. In between each one of adjacent pairs of the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>4</b>, and Z<b>5</b> that are adjacent to one another and flank respective one of the corners of the rectangular center region Z<b>1</b> (e.g., the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b> and Z<b>3</b>, the peripheral regions Z<b>3</b> and Z<b>4</b>, the peripheral regions Z<b>4</b> and Z<b>5</b>, and the peripheral regions Z<b>5</b> and Z<b>2</b>), the ends (e.g., end portions) of the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>4</b>, and Z<b>5</b> are butted together to form butt joints (e.g., corner sections) a so that there is no gap in between. The extension tabs <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, and <b>84</b> of the outer edges of the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>4</b>, and Z<b>5</b> are bent outward. The extension tabs <b>81</b>, <b>82</b>, <b>83</b>, and <b>84</b> correspond to the portions supported by the frame <b>5</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the U-shaped fluorescent tubes are used for the linear light source <b>1</b>. The end electrodes of the linear light source <b>1</b> are connected to the power sockets <b>2</b> disposed in the empty space at the back of the peripheral region Z<b>5</b> of the sheet <b>8</b>. The linear light source <b>1</b> passes through holes <b>87</b> formed in the peripheral region Z<b>5</b> and sticks out to the rear of the peripheral region Z<b>5</b>, where it is connected to the power sockets <b>2</b>. Each of the through holes <b>87</b> has a closed hole with a continuous periphery. On the back side of the sheet <b>8</b>, a fixing piece <b>9</b> is affixed to the frame <b>5</b>. The fixing piece <b>9</b> has clamps <b>91</b>. The clamps <b>91</b> stick out to the front side of the sheet <b>8</b> from openings <b>92</b> made at places on the center region Z<b>1</b> of the sheet <b>8</b>. The clamps <b>91</b> support the linear light sources <b>1</b> at suitable locations, such as the two locations of the bent portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With the backlight device, the light reflecting member <b>3</b> is formed by just a single sheet <b>8</b>, and furthermore the sheet <b>8</b> is formed by bending a substantially rectangular sheet material with the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> at an angle and at four places around the periphery of the material. Thus, the cost of producing the light reflecting member <b>3</b> is markedly lower than the conventional light reflecting member. Also, the assembly process for the light reflecting member <b>3</b> involves merely bending a single sheet material at four places around its periphery and at an angle. Thus, the process is much simpler than the conventional light reflecting member that requires skill to combine the sheet with the frame pieces. Therefore, this promotes a simpler assembly process for the backlight device, and the productivity tends to be higher. Furthermore, no gaps are produced at the boundary between each one of the adjacent pairs of the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>4</b>, and Z<b>5</b> (e.g., at the butt joints a). As a result, the light is appropriately reflected, and it is unlikely that the brightness of the liquid crystal cell is uneven.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">With the backlight device, the reflecting faces are formed on the light reflecting member <b>3</b>. Specifically, the center region Z<b>1</b> located at the back of the linear light source <b>1</b> and the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>4</b>, and Z<b>5</b> that are raised up in a slanted orientation from the four sides <b>11</b> to <b>14</b> of the center region Z<b>1</b>, are all formed by just the one sheet <b>8</b>. Accordingly, there is no need to form the center region Z<b>1</b> and the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>4</b>, and Z<b>5</b> by combining the conventional sheet with the conventional frame pieces. Thus, the light reflecting member <b>3</b> can be formed by just the one sheet <b>8</b>. As a result, there is no need to using extra components such as the frame pieces, and the number of parts that are needed can be correspondingly reduced. This promotes a simpler assembly process. Furthermore, the sheet <b>8</b> is more readily available and much less expensive than a resin molding formed by injection molding, which is expensive and demands sophisticated technology, as with the conventional frame pieces. Therefore, with the backlight device, it is possible to provide a backlight device much more inexpensively. Furthermore, this helps reduce the weight of the backlight device.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the linear light sources <b>1</b> include the U-shaped fluorescent tubes, and the bent portions of the linear light sources <b>1</b> are supported by the clamps <b>91</b> at locations between the peripheral regions Z<b>3</b> and Z<b>5</b>. However, the bent portions of the linear light sources <b>1</b> can be positioned on the back side of the peripheral region Z<b>3</b>, and be supported by clamps formed on the frame <b>5</b> at locations back side of the peripheral region Z<b>3</b>. In this case, the peripheral region Z<b>3</b> also has through holes through which the linear light sources <b>1</b> are disposed. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the linear light sources <b>1</b> can include a plurality of (four in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) straight tubes. In this case, the peripheral region Z<b>3</b> has two pairs of through holes <b>88</b> through which the left end portions of the linear light sources <b>1</b> are disposed, and the peripheral region Z<b>5</b> has two pairs of through holes <b>87</b> through which the right end portions of the linear light sources <b>1</b> are disposed.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a backlight device in accordance with a second embodiment will now be explained. In view of the similarity between the first and second embodiments, the parts of the second embodiment that are identical to the parts of the first embodiment will be given the same reference numerals as the parts of the first embodiment. Moreover, the descriptions of the parts of the second embodiment that are identical to the parts of the first embodiment may be omitted for the sake of brevity. The parts of the second embodiment that differ from the parts of the first embodiment will be indicated with a double prime (&#x2033;).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a detail development view of the sheet <b>8</b>&#x2033; in accordance with the second embodiment. The sheet <b>8</b>&#x2033; has a coupling portion that couples the top and bottom peripheral regions Z<b>2</b> and Z<b>4</b> with the left and right peripheral regions Z<b>3</b> and Z<b>5</b>, respectively. The coupling portion includes four insertion tabs <b>85</b> and four slits <b>86</b>. The insertion tabs <b>85</b> are provided to and extend from horizontal end portions of the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b> and Z<b>4</b>. The slits <b>86</b> are formed at vertical end portions of the peripheral regions Z<b>3</b> and Z<b>5</b>. Each of the insertion tabs <b>85</b> is inserted into the corresponding one of the slits <b>86</b>. For example, the insertion tab <b>85</b> is provided to the end of one peripheral region (such as the peripheral region Z<b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) out of any one of the adjacent pairs of the peripheral regions (such as the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b> and Z<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that are adjacent to one another and flank one of the corners of the center region Z<b>1</b>. The slit <b>86</b> is formed at the end of the other peripheral region (such as the peripheral region Z<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The insertion tab <b>85</b> is inserted into the slit <b>86</b>, and latched to the slit <b>86</b> to couple the one peripheral region with the other peripheral region. The insertion tab <b>85</b> can also be formed at the end of one peripheral region out of any one of the adjacent pairs of the peripheral regions (e.g., the peripheral regions Z<b>3</b> and Z<b>4</b>, the peripheral regions Z<b>4</b> and Z<b>5</b>, the peripheral regions Z<b>5</b> and Z<b>2</b>, etc.) that are adjacent to one another and flank one of the corners of the center region Z<b>1</b>, and the slit <b>86</b> can be formed in the other peripheral region.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With the sheet <b>8</b>&#x2033;, the sheet <b>8</b>&#x2033; can be held in the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by bending at an angle along the bending lines L<b>11</b>, L<b>12</b>, L<b>13</b>, and L<b>14</b>. The insertion tabs <b>85</b> on the one peripheral regions are inserted into the insertion slits <b>86</b> on the other peripheral regions from either inside or outside of the one peripheral regions. When the insertion tabs <b>85</b> are thus inserted into the slits <b>86</b>, the adjacent pairs of the peripheral regions (the peripheral regions Z<b>2</b> and Z<b>3</b>, the peripheral regions Z<b>3</b> and Z<b>4</b>, the peripheral regions Z<b>4</b> and Z<b>5</b>, and the peripheral regions Z<b>5</b> and Z<b>2</b>) are linked at the places where the insertion tabs <b>85</b> are inserted into the slits <b>86</b>. Accordingly, this improves the ability of the sheet <b>8</b>&#x2033; to maintain the shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As a result, the stability of light reflection by the sheet <b>8</b>&#x2033; is increased. Furthermore, it becomes less likely that the brightness of the liquid crystal cell is uneven.</p>
