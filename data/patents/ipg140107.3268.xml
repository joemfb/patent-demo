<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and structures to achieve improved TFTs and high fill-factor pixel circuits are provided. This system relies on the fact that jet-printed lines have print accuracy, which means the location and the definition of the printed lines and dots is high. The edge of a printed line is well defined if the printing conditions are optimized. This technique utilizes the accurate definition and placement of the edges of printed lines of conductors and insulators to define small features and improved structures.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">When printing electronic features using inkjet printing, the width of printed lines of the features often impacts the performance of the resulting device. In thin-film-transistors (TFTs), the line width of conductors impacts the size and parasitic capacitances of the transistor. High capacitances, e.g. gate-source or gate-drain capacitances, negatively impact the switching speed of TFTs. In active-matrix pixel circuits, high parasitic capacitances can lead to high feedthrough voltages. Moreover, in pixel circuits, the fill-factor of a pixel is negatively affected by wide data bus lines.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is thus advantageous to minimize the width of printed lines in such environments. However, the line width is usually determined by the ejected fluid, the aperture of the print head nozzle and the applied waveform (in the case of a piezo-electric print head)&#x2014;all of which have a practical limit of adjustment. So, the lines can only be minimized to a limited degree&#x2014;which may not be sufficient for some applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">More particularly, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an illustration of a conventional printed TFT <b>10</b> (bottom-gate configuration in cross-section). A source <b>12</b>, gate <b>14</b>, drain <b>16</b>, gate dielectric <b>17</b> and semiconductor <b>18</b> comprise the transistor <b>10</b>&#x2014;which is formed on a substrate <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As shown, the width of the gate <b>14</b> is fixed (determined by the printing process) and, thus, is a limitation on the configuration. The source <b>12</b> and drain <b>16</b> have a certain overlap <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> with the gate <b>14</b>. Since a small channel width is generally desirable, this overlap <b>13</b>, <b>15</b> can be large, causing significant parasitic capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An active-matrix pixel circuit <b>30</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As shown, jet-printed features, such as data (or source) line(s) <b>32</b> and gate line(s) <b>34</b> are limited by the size (e.g. width) of the printed lines. Also, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> clearly shows that the fill-factor (area of the drain or pixel pad(s) <b>36</b> divided by the total pixel area) in such pixel circuits is limited by the width of the printed lines. In an embodiment such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a typical pixel pitch may be approximately 680 microns with 60 micron wide data and gate lines, resulting in a fill factor of about 70%. For smaller pixel sizes the fill factor decreases, which is a problem. A high fill-factor is desirable for image sensors and displays. For example, wide data lines, such as data lines <b>32</b>, pose a problem in displays because the varying voltage potential on the data lines can affect the display media and degrade the image. Moreover, the overlap of the gate lines, such as gate line <b>34</b>, with pixel pads, such as pixel pad <b>36</b>, can cause a substantial feedthrough voltage. As noted in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a large overlap of the source and drain with the gate in a TFT is generally undesirable because of the parasitic capacitance.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The presently described embodiments relate to a method and structures to achieve improved TFTs and high fill-factor active-matrix pixel circuits. The concept relies on the fact that jet-printed lines of electrically conducting material may be relatively wide as a result of various limitations including drop-size and the liquid-surface interaction. However, print accuracy of jet-printed lines, e.g. the location and the definition of the printed lines and dots, is high. The edge of a printed line is well defined if the printing conditions are optimized. This technique utilizes the accurate definition and placement of the edges of printed lines of conductors and insulators to define small features and improved structures.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It should be appreciated that this technique allows patterning of higher performing transistors. Moreover, improved high fill-factor active-matrix pixel arrays for displays, image sensors and other sensor arrays will be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a transistor <b>100</b> is shown in a bottom-gate configuration. In one form, the transistor <b>100</b> is a printed thin film transistor formed of any of a variety of suitable, printable materials. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the transistor <b>100</b> is formed on a substrate <b>101</b>. In this embodiment, a drain pad or area <b>102</b> is printed or patterned as close as possible to one edge of a gate line or area or pattern (e.g. a gate electrode) <b>104</b> on a gate dielectric or pattern <b>105</b>. In at least one form, this is possible with high accuracy (e.g. 5 microns) using any of a variety of jetting and/or printing devices. The electrically conducting material for the gate, source and drain may be a solution deposited conducting polymer such as PEDOT:PSS, polyaniline, etc., or solution deposited metal nanoparticles (such as silver nanoparticles which may be subsequently sintered), conducting nanotubes (e.g. carbon nanotubes), nanowires (e.g. metal nanowires), conductive oxides (e.g. indium tin oxide nanoparticles), mixtures of organic conductors and inorganic conducting nanoparticles, conductors deposited from precursors for conducting electrodes such as silver salts, etc. The insulating layer that forms the gate dielectric <b>105</b> may be deposited from a solution by jet-printing, doctor-blading, spin-coating, slot-coating, Langmuir-Blodgett, spray coating or other common solution deposition methods. This layer is typically thin in order to obtain a high specific capacitance. The layer may be as thin as a few nanometers up to several micrometers and typically several hundred nm. The gate dielectric <b>105</b> may comprise materials such as self assembled monolayers, polymer dielectrics or composite or multilayer dielectrics. Examples of materials are polyvinylphenol (PVP), polyvinylcinnamate, polystyrene, polyvinylalcohol (PVA), fluorinated polymers such as CYTOP (from Asahi Glass), epoxy-based polymers such as SU-8 (MicroChem, Corp.), polysilsesquioxanes, polyimide, PMMA, composites of polymer with titania nanoparticles, etc. The gate dielectric <b>105</b> may also be deposited by non-solution processes, such as thermal evaporation, atomic layer deposition (ALD), chemical vapor deposition (CVD), lamination, etc. In one example, the gate dielectric comprises ALD deposited aluminum oxide or hafnium oxide. In another example it comprises evaporated Parylene. Although the main focus is on printing methods, the gate electrode may be deposited and patterned by more conventional methods such as sputtering or evaporation followed by photolithography and etching techniques such as wet chemical etching. The gate electrode may be also patterned using laser ablation or laser deposition. Moreover, the gate electrode or gate electrode level may be patterned by shadow mask evaporation. The gate electrode level may be also deposited by electroplating or electroless plating. The gate dielectric may be also grown directly on the gate metal by oxidation or by anodization methods. Particularly when using a metal such as aluminum or tantalum, good dielectric layers are formed through oxidation or anodization (aluminum oxide or tantalum oxide).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As noted above, in a conventional method, in order to keep a small channel length (the gap between source electrode and drain electrode defines the transistor channel), the overlap of a source line or area or pattern <b>106</b> with the gate line <b>104</b> would typically be large, resulting in a high source-gate parasitic capacitance. Here, to reduce this parasitic capacitance, a decoupling insulator or decoupling insulating pattern <b>108</b> is printed onto a region of the gate line <b>104</b> over the gate dielectric <b>105</b>. So, the direct overlap in the area where only the thin gate dielectric layer <b>105</b> is present, as shown at <b>110</b> and <b>111</b>, is relatively narrow. The decoupling insulator <b>108</b> is, in one form, substantially thicker than the gate dielectric <b>105</b> and it serves to electrically decouple (e.g. lower the capacitance between) the source line <b>106</b> and the gate line <b>104</b>. The printed decoupling insulator <b>108</b> could take a variety of forms, including a printed UV curable polymer or any other dielectric material. In one example, the polymer is formed of the epoxy polymer SU-8 (MicroChem Corp.) material and jet-printed from a solution of SU-8 in gammabutyrol-lactone. In another example, the polymer is PVP (polyvinylphenol) jet-printed from a solution of PVP in propylene glycol methyl ether acetate (PGMEA). In a third example the material is a radiation curable material such as polyvinylcinnamate or one of the HexiJet UV curable inkjet inks from Hexion Speciality Chemicals, Inc. Low dielectric constant (low-k) polymers, such as Cytop (Asahi Glass), are also materials that could be used. Dielectrics that have a dielectric constant less than 4, are often considered as low-k dielectric materials. Moreover, the same solution-based materials as described above for the gate dielectric may be used. Furthermore, the material <b>108</b> may be a phase-change material that is deposited in a melted state and which then solidifies after being deposited. A wax such as a stearyl stearamide (Kemamade) is an example and another example are radiation curable gel inks such as the ones disclosed in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/0120924, which is hereby incorporated herein by this reference in its entirety. Some radiation curable materials such as UV curable polymers that do not substantially rely on solvent evaporation are also included in the class of phase-change polymer since they are transferred from a liquid state into a solid state upon UV exposure. In at least one form, the positioning of the printed polymer is very accurate and depends on the printhead. Afterwards, in at least one form, the source line or feature <b>106</b> is printed so that it only slightly extends over the printed decoupling insulator onto the gate line region <b>104</b>. A semiconductor <b>112</b> is then deposited. The semiconductor may be a solution deposited organic semiconductor such as a polythiophene (e.g. P3HT, PQT-12), or a small-molecule semiconductor deposited from a precursor (e.g. TIPS-pentacene). It may also be a semiconductor based on inorganic nanoparticles such as silicon nanoparticles, CdSe-, CdS-, ZnS-nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, nanowires (e.g. silicon nanowires) or precursors of inorganic semiconductors. The semiconductor may be also deposited with a non-solution deposition method such as an evaporation method. For example, the semiconductor may be deposited through a shadow mask by thermal evaporation of a material such as pentacene. It should be noted that in the described process the semiconductor is deposited after depositing the source and drain layer <b>106</b> and <b>102</b>, forming a bottom contact thin film transistor. However, the structure should not be limited to this. The semiconducting layer may also be deposited before depositing the source and drain contacts. For example, after depositing the decoupling insulating layer <b>108</b>, the semiconducting layer may be deposited. Thereafter, the source and drain electrodes are deposited, forming a top contact thin-film transistor. Moreover, the transistor structure may be also a combination of top-contact and bottom contact transistor. For example, the semiconductor may be deposited after depositing the source electrode <b>102</b> and before depositing the drain electrode <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the previously described structure, which is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the decoupling insulating layer <b>108</b> is only patterned under part of the source electrode. However, a similar layer may be also patterned under the drain electrode <b>102</b>. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In this embodiment, the decoupling insulating layer <b>108</b> under the drain electrode <b>102</b> reduces capacitive coupling between the drain electrode <b>102</b> and the gate electrode <b>104</b>. It should be noted, that the decoupling insulating material <b>108</b> may be chosen so that the source and/or drain electrode material, when deposited from solution, fluidically pins to this material. If this is the case, the deposition process for the source and/or drain electrode material is quasi-self-aligned. This requires, of course, that the gate dielectric material repels the solution of the deposited source and/or drain electrode material. This may be the case if the gate dielectric or the surface of the gate dielectric has a low surface energy. For example, if the gate dielectric, or part of it, is coated with a layer of a hydrophobic methylated polysilsesquioxane (PSSQ) and the insulator <b>108</b> comprises polyvinylphenol (PVP), an aqueous solution of PEDOT:PSS (Clevios from N.C. Starck) will be pinned on the rather hydrophilic PVP and be repelled by the PSSQ surface. See, for example, U.S. application Ser. No. 12/324,304, filed on Nov. 26, 2008, entitled, &#x201c;An Electronic Circuit Structure and Method for Forming Same,&#x201d; and naming Daniel et al. as inventors and U.S. application Ser. No. 12/324,250, filed on Nov. 26, 2008, entitled &#x201c;Method and Structure for Establishing Contacts in Thin Film Transistor Devices,&#x201d; naming Daniel et al. as inventors, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Although the process described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3(A)</figref> and (B) deposits the semiconductor after depositing the gate electrode (bottom gate transistor configuration), in a variation of the process, the semiconducting layer is deposited before depositing the gate electrode (top gate transistor configuration).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a transistor <b>600</b> is shown. The transistor <b>600</b> is a top gate transistor formed on a substrate <b>601</b> to which the presently described embodiments are applied. In this regard, the transistor <b>600</b> includes a drain electrode or area <b>602</b>, a source electrode or area <b>606</b> and a gate electrode or area <b>604</b>. A semiconductor <b>612</b> extends between source and drain regions or areas. The semiconductor may be deposited before the source and drain electrodes are deposited or it may be deposited afterwards, resulting in a bottom or top contact top gate TFT. A gate dielectric <b>605</b> is formed over source and drain electrode and semiconductor region. In accordance with the presently described embodiments, decoupling insulator portions <b>608</b> are formed over at least part of the source and drain electrodes. In this top gate embodiment, the gate <b>604</b> is formed between the decoupling insulator portions <b>608</b> and over the transistor channel region which is the region between source and drain electrodes. Of course, the addition of the decoupling insulator portions <b>608</b> provide the transistor <b>600</b> with reduced parasitic capacitance, as explained above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The overlap capacitance between the gate electrode and source and drain electrodes is reduced. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the transistor structure may only utilize one decoupling insulator region over at least part of the source or the drain region. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the decoupling insulator is shown over the drain electrode region. In this case, the gate electrode would be printed so that the overlap with the source electrode region is as small as possible (in order to reduce capacitive coupling).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this improved printed TFT (in any of the forms shown above), a decoupling insulator, such as a polymer, is strategically deposited by printing, such as jet-printing. The decoupling insulator can be relatively wide, but the overriding aspect is good definition of the edge of the printed line. The printed insulator, which may be a polymer, increases the thickness of the gate dielectric layer and, thus, reduces the capacitive coupling. In this regard, for improved results, a low-k insulator may be used. The insulator may also be chosen to have a wetting property (surface energy) that allows good deposition of the subsequent conducting lines. In one example, the polymer is a crosslinkable polyvinylphenol (PVP) with a water-contact angle between 40 and 70 deg and the printed conductor is a silver nanoparticles solution based on ethyleneglycol and water (Cabot Corp.).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates the implementation of a decoupling insulator as applied to active-matrix pixel structures, such as a portion <b>200</b> of a pixel array. Gate lines <b>202</b> and data or source lines <b>204</b> are printed in an array. A polymer or insulating layer or line, such as that shown at <b>206</b>, is printed partially over the data lines <b>204</b> before pixel pads <b>208</b> are deposited. The decoupling insulator <b>206</b> allows the pixel pads <b>208</b> to partially cover the data lines which results in a higher pixel fill factor (ratio of pixel pad area to total pixel area). Usually, the data lines and the pixel pads are deposited on the same level. However, when using printing techniques such as inkjet printing, it is easy to print a different material, such as an insulator, in-between. In that case, first the data lines <b>204</b> would be deposited, then the insulating features <b>206</b> and then the pixel pads <b>208</b>. Capacitive coupling between the data lines <b>204</b> and the pixel pads is undesirable, therefore the decoupling insulator <b>206</b> would have to be relatively thick or/and of an insulator with low dielectric constant k. Also shown are semiconductor pads <b>210</b>, which may be deposited at the end.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The pixel fill factor is increased because the pixel pads <b>208</b> can extend over the data lines <b>204</b>. The polymer or insulating layer <b>206</b> is, in one form, sufficiently thick and, the dielectric constant is preferably low&#x2014;to avoid feed-through from the data lines <b>204</b> to the pixel pad <b>208</b>. The insulating layer can also serve as a barrier for the semiconductor <b>210</b>&#x2014;which is deposited afterwards. Often, the semiconductor <b>210</b> tends to spread to a neighboring pixel. The polymer layer may act as a barrier and prevent this from happening. The barrier may be a mechanical barrier which prevents the semiconductor solution from spreading or it may be a low surface energy barrier that repels the semiconductor solution. The pixel pad is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> as printed completely after the deposition of the insulator <b>206</b>. However, the pad may be also printed in two steps in which first a small pad is printed around the same time the data lines are printed, then the insulator <b>206</b> is deposited. This insulator layer may even be partially deposited over the small pixel pad area. Afterwards, the second section of the pixel pad is printed partially over the insulating layer <b>206</b> and making electrical contact to the small pixel pad.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the fill-factor can be further improved by covering the data lines to a greater extent with an extended insulator or polymer portion. In this regard, a pixel circuit <b>300</b> is shown. It is to be appreciated that the pixel circuit <b>300</b> is of substantially the same configuration as the pixel circuit <b>200</b> of FIG. <b>7</b>&#x2014;, with the exception of the following. The pixel circuit <b>300</b> includes extensions or additional pads of insulating or polymer material <b>302</b>. Likewise, the corresponding pixel pad <b>208</b> includes an extension or additional electrically conductive material <b>304</b>. This extension <b>304</b> results in improved fill factor for the pixel circuit. The insulating material or polymer <b>302</b> may also partially confine the semiconductor <b>210</b> and prevent excessive spreading. Excessive spreading otherwise could result in un-gated semiconductor regions. It should be appreciated that the extensions <b>302</b> and <b>304</b> may be incorporated in the circuit in a variety of manners. For example, the extensions may be applied as a separate step of the fabrication process using the same printing technique as is used for the formation of the insulating layer and/or the pixel pad. Or, the extension may be integrated into the configuration of the insulating layer and/or the pixel pad so that it is printed at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9(A)</figref> and (B) show a pixel structure <b>400</b> for a TFT in which multiple printed insulator layers, e.g. two layers, are used. As shown, the structure <b>400</b> includes a substrate <b>402</b>, a drain <b>404</b>, a gate <b>406</b>, a gate dielectric <b>405</b>, a source <b>408</b>, a metal layer <b>410</b> and a semiconductor <b>412</b>. Notably, a first insulating layer <b>420</b> is disposed between the gate <b>406</b> and the source <b>408</b>. A second insulating layer <b>430</b> is disposed between the source <b>408</b> and the metal layer <b>410</b>. Of course, these insulating layers may take a variety of forms, including that of a polymer material. It should also be appreciated that the number of insulating layers could vary. Each insulator layer may also comprise a double layer. For example, a lower thicker layer with a low dielectric constant to reduce capacitive decoupling and an upper layer to provide an optimized surface with a surface energy that is compatible with the printing of the conducting lines. Such structure may be achieved by first printing a layer of polyvinylcinnamate and then a thin layer of polyvinylphenol on top, for example. In this example, polyvinylcinnamate would provide the low-dielectric constant layer and polyvinylphenol (which has a higher dielectric constant) would provide a surface onto which silver lines can be printed very reliably. Such a double insulator structure may be also achieved by printing a blend of polymers and relying on phase separation to let rise one polymer to the top during drying.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates an application of the presently described embodiments for reducing the cross-over capacitance between two crossing conductor lines (separated by a thin insulating layer) by printing two thicker insulating or polymer areas before depositing the upper line. As shown, (data) line <b>502</b> intersects (gate) line <b>504</b>. Insulating or polymer pads <b>510</b> and <b>520</b> are printed as shown and may be formed as drops having a rounded surface. The data line <b>502</b> becomes effectively more narrow as it settles between the drops <b>510</b> and <b>520</b>. This is because the two areas <b>510</b> and <b>520</b> form a structural barrier for the ink of the data-line or the two areas <b>510</b> and <b>520</b> may also comprise a material that repels the ink. Of course, the insulating or polymer layer <b>510</b> or <b>520</b> could be a continuous area at the cross-over point, but having two opposing areas may lower the risk of line-breakup during printing.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The presently described embodiments are described using printing techniques, in particularly inkjet printing (e.g. piezo, thermal, continuous or electrostatic inkjet). However, it equally applies to other printing or deposition techniques, such as, dip-pen-like printing methods (e.g. Nanoink, Inc.) or aerosol printing (Optomec, Inc.).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It will be appreciated that various of the above-disclosed and other features and functions, or alternatives thereof, may be desirably combined into many other different systems or applications. Also that various presently unforeseen or unanticipated alternatives, modifications, variations or improvements therein may be subsequently made by those skilled in the art which are also intended to be encompassed by the following claims.</p>
