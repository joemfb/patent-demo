<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Aspects of the disclosure relate generally to healthcare transaction processing, and more particularly, to the processing of healthcare transactions to identify Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) compliance.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A wide variety of drugs and/or other products are dispensed by healthcare providers, such as pharmacies. The risk for fraud and abuse rises when the drugs being prescribed and dispensed are controlled substances or scheduled drugs. Scheduled drugs are those drugs classified in one of five schedules as determined by the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The five schedules are categories separated by the abusive and/or addictive nature of the drug and include:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0003">Schedule I&#x2014;a category of drugs not considered legitimate for medical use (e.g., heroin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), etc.)</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0004">Schedule II&#x2014;a category of drugs considered to have a strong potential for abuse or addiction but that also have legitimate medical use (e.g., opium, morphine, etc.)</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0005">Schedule III&#x2014;a category of drugs that have less potential for abuse or addiction than Schedule I or II drugs and have a useful medical purpose (e.g., short-acting barbiturates and amphetamines, etc.)</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0006">Schedule IV&#x2014;a medically useful category of drugs that have less potential for abuse or addiction than those of Schedules I, II, and III (e.g., diazepam and chloral hydrate, etc.)</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0007">Schedule V&#x2014;a medically useful category of drugs that have less potential for abuse or addiction than those of Schedules I through IV (e.g., anti-diarrhea medication, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0008">For such controlled substances as well as other prescription drugs, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is placing an increasing emphasis on Risk Minimization Action Plans (RiskMAPs) and Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) at the point of granting drug product approvals. A RiskMAP or a REMS program is typically a strategic safety program designed to meet specific goals and objectives in minimizing known risks of a product while preserving its benefits. Typically, a suitable RiskMAP or REMS program targets one or more safety-related health outcomes or goals and uses one or more tools to achieve those goals. Over time, the effectiveness of the tools is evaluated and the benefit-risk balance for the product is reassessed. Appropriate adjustments are then made to the risk minimization tools to further improve the benefit-risk balance.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0009">A RiskMAP or REMS program may incorporate a plan for controlling and closely monitoring drug inventories and drug supply ordering. However, when it comes to drug inventory management, many pharmacies participate in an open distribution model in which a virtually unlimited number of wholesalers distribute products dispensed by any number of pharmacies. This open distribution model typically does not support product distribution and product dispensing controls and monitoring desirable for high risk drug products. Accordingly, there is an opportunity for improved systems and methods for identifying RiskMAP and/or REMS compliance. Additionally, there is an opportunity for improved systems and methods for detecting potential fraud in association with the distribution of drugs and/or other products.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0010">Some or all of the above needs and/or problems, as well as additional needs and/or problems, may be addressed by certain embodiments of the disclosure. Embodiments of the disclosure may include systems and methods for identifying REMS compliance and/or potential fraud in association with the distribution of one or more products. In one embodiment, there is disclosed a method for identifying REMS compliance. A service provider system that includes one or more computers may route one or more healthcare transactions submitted by a healthcare provider to one or more claims processor computers. One or more respective adjudicated replies received from the one or more claims processor computers for the one or more healthcare transactions may then be routed by the service provider system to the healthcare provider. Based at least in part upon information included in the routed healthcare claim transactions and adjudicated replies, an amount of a product dispensed by the healthcare provider may be determined by the service provider system. The determined dispensed amount may be compared to a purchased amount of the product. Based at least in part upon the comparison, a determination may be made as to whether a REMS condition associated with the product is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0011">In another embodiment, there is disclosed a system for identifying and/or facilitating REMS. The system may include at least one memory and at least one processor. The at least one memory may be configured to store computer-executable instructions. The at least one processor may be configured to access the at least one memory and execute the computer-executable instructions to: direct the routing of one or more healthcare transactions submitted by a healthcare provider to one or more claims processor computers; direct the routing, to the healthcare provider, of one or more respective adjudicated replies received from the one or more claims processor computers for the one or more healthcare transactions; determine, based at least in part upon information included in the routed healthcare claim transactions and adjudicated replies, an amount of a product dispensed by the healthcare provider; compare the determined dispensed amount to a purchased amount of the product; and determine, based at least in part upon the comparison, whether a REMS condition associated with the product is satisfied.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0012">Additional systems, methods, apparatus, features, and aspects may be realized through the techniques of various embodiments of the disclosure. Other embodiments and aspects of the disclosure are described in detail herein with reference to the description and to the drawings and are considered a part of the claimed invention.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0017">Embodiments of the disclosure now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which embodiments of the disclosure are shown. The invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth, herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like numbers refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">Embodiments of the disclosure may include systems, methods, and apparatus for identifying REMS and/or RiskMAP compliance. Additionally, embodiments of the disclosure may include systems, methods, and apparatus for identifying potential fraud and/or abuse in association with the distribution of one or more prescription products, such as controlled substances or drugs. Healthcare transactions may be evaluated as they are routed through a service provider system in order to determine or estimate an amount of a product dispensed by a healthcare provider. For example, an amount of a product dispensed during a given period of time may be determined from evaluating healthcare billing and/or claim transaction data. The estimated dispense or distribution amount may then be compared to purchase information for the product, such as invoice data obtained from one or more product manufacturers, suppliers, and/or distributors. In this regard, a determination may be made as to whether purchased amounts for the product correspond to amounts that are distributed and included in billing transactions. For example, an amount of the product that is likely distributed may be determined from purchase or ordering information, and the likely distributed amount may be compared to a dispensed amount determined from billing activity. The amounts may then be compared in order to evaluate any number of REMS conditions and/or to determine whether potential fraudulent activity exists.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">In one example embodiment, a service provider system may be configured to route one or more healthcare transactions and associated adjudicated replies between healthcare providers (e.g., pharmacies, hospitals, etc.) and claims processors. For example, a healthcare transaction may be received from a healthcare provider computer, and the service provider system may route the healthcare transaction to a claims processor computer for adjudication. An adjudicated reply may then be received by the service provider system from the claims processor computer, and the adjudicated reply may be routed to the healthcare provider computer. A wide variety of suitable types of healthcare transactions may be routed as desired in various embodiments of the invention, such as healthcare claim transactions and claim reversal transactions.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">During the routing of healthcare transactions, the service provider system and/or an associated REMS adherence module or system may be configured to collect respective dispense information associated with a wide variety of products, such as controlled substances, that are dispensed by various healthcare providers. In one example embodiment, a dispense amount for a product may be maintained over a desired period of time, such as a previous month, a previous three-month period, or some other period of time. Approved healthcare claim transactions may be evaluated or processed in order to increment the dispense amount Similarly, approved reversal transactions may be evaluated or processed in order to decrement the dispense amount. In this regard, a dispense amount for the product may be dynamically determined and/or maintained based upon billing transaction information.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">Additionally, respective product ordering and/or purchase information may be obtained for the various healthcare providers. For example, order data, invoice data, shipment data, and/or receipt data may be obtained from any number of suitable sources, such as product manufacturers, product suppliers, product distributors, and/or healthcare provider back office computers or systems. In this regard, amounts of products that are likely distributed by a healthcare provider during the period of time may be determined. In other words, based upon an amount of a product that is ordered and/or supplied to a healthcare provider over time, a likely amount of the product that is distributed or dispensed by the healthcare provider may be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">Once a dispense amount associated with a product is determined from healthcare transaction information and a likely distribution amount is determined from ordering and/or purchase information, the two amounts may be evaluated in order to facilitate REMS compliance and/or to identify potentially fraudulent activity. A wide variety of suitable methods and/or techniques may be utilized to evaluate the dispense amount and the likely distribution amount. For example, the two amounts may be compared and, as desired, a difference and/or a deviation may be determined between the dispense amount and the likely distribution amount. As desired, the results of the comparison may be evaluated utilizing a wide variety of different threshold conditions and/or REMS parameters. For example, a determination may be made as to whether a deviation between the two amounts exceeds a threshold condition. In this regard, a determination may be made as to whether a REMS condition is satisfied and/or whether potentially fraudulent activity exists. For example, a determination may be made as to whether a healthcare provider is purchasing a greater amount of a product (e.g., a controlled substance) than the amount associated with healthcare transactions submitted by the healthcare provider.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0023">In the event that a REMS condition is determined to not be satisfied or in the event that potentially fraudulent activity is identified, a wide variety of suitable control actions may be taken by the service provider system and/or the REMS adherence module. For example, a suitable alert message may be generated and communicated to any number of suitable recipients, such as a REMS administrator or a healthcare provider back office computer or system (e.g., a central office associated with a pharmacy chain, etc.). Additionally, as desired, a wide variety of REMS reports may be generated and distributed to designated recipients.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0024">Additionally, in certain embodiments, the service provider system and/or an associated module may maintain inventory information on behalf of any number of healthcare providers. Based at least in part upon the processing and/or evaluation of healthcare transactions, inventory amounts for various products may be dynamically maintained. The inventory amounts may then be compared to one or more suitable threshold values, such as an ordering threshold value. In the event that a threshold value is satisfied, one or more messages associated with the ordering of additional product may be generated and communicated. For example, a message may be communicated to a healthcare provider indicating that additional product should be ordered. As another example, an ordering message may be communicated to a supplier on behalf of a healthcare provider.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">System Overview</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0040">A REMS adherence module <b>180</b> or REMS adherence application may also be operative with the service provider computer <b>104</b>. The REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may include computer-executable instructions for identifying REMS and/or RiskMAP compliance and/or identifying potential fraud and/or abuse in association with the distribution of one or more prescription products, such as controlled substances or drugs. In operation, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may evaluate healthcare transactions and/or adjudicated replies as they are routed through the service provider computer in order to determine or estimate an amount of a product dispensed by a healthcare provider. For example, an amount of a product dispensed during a given period of time (e.g., a previous month, a prior three-month period, etc.) may be determined from evaluating healthcare billing and/or claims transaction data. The estimated dispense or distribution amount may then be compared to purchase information for the product, such as invoice data obtained from one or more product manufacturers, suppliers, and/or distributors (and/or purchase information obtained from the inventory management module <b>184</b>). In this regard, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may make a determination as to whether purchased amounts for the product correspond to amounts that are distributed and included in billing transactions. As a result, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may evaluate any number of REMS conditions and/or determine whether potential fraudulent activity exists.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0041">In one example operation, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may receive information associated with a healthcare transaction from a service provider computer <b>102</b>. For example, a healthcare transaction may received by the service provider computer <b>104</b> from a healthcare provider computer <b>102</b> and/or an adjudicated reply received from a claims processor computer <b>110</b> may be provided to the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> for evaluation. Information associated with a wide variety of suitable types of healthcare transactions may be received, such as healthcare claim transactions and claim reversal transactions. The REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may evaluate the received healthcare transaction information in order to track respective amounts of various healthcare products (e.g., controlled substances, etc.) that are dispensed by various healthcare providers and included in billing transaction information (e.g., submitted healthcare claims, etc.). For example, a dispense amount for a product may be maintained over a desired period of time, such as a previous month, a previous three month period, or some other period of time. Approved healthcare claim transactions may be evaluated or processed by the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> in order to increment the dispense amount. Similarly, approved reversal transactions may be evaluated or processed by the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> in order to decrement the dispense amount. In this regard, a dispense amount for the product may be dynamically determined and/or maintained based upon billing transaction information.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0042">Additionally, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may obtain respective product ordering and/or purchasing information for the various healthcare providers. For example, order data, invoice data, shipment data, and/or receipt data may be obtained from any number of supplier computers <b>108</b>, such as supplier computers associated with product manufacturers, product suppliers, and/or product distributors. As another example, ordering and/or purchasing information may be obtained from the inventory management module <b>184</b>. In this regard, amounts of products that are likely distributed by a healthcare provider during the period of time may be determined. In other words, based upon an amount of a product that is ordered and/or supplied to a healthcare provider over time, a likely amount of the product that is distributed or dispensed by the healthcare provider may be determined by the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>. The REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may then compare the dispense amount determined from healthcare transaction information to the likely distribution amount determined from ordering and/or purchasing information. In this regard, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may perform a wide variety of REMS compliance functions and/or the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may identify potentially fraudulent activity.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0043">A wide variety of suitable methods and/or techniques may be utilized to evaluate the dispense amount and the likely distribution amount. For example, the two amounts may be compared and, as desired, a difference and/or a deviation may be determined between the dispense amount and the likely distribution amount. As desired, the results of the comparison (e.g., a difference, a deviation, etc.) may be evaluated utilizing a wide variety of different threshold conditions and/or REMS parameters. For example, a determination may be made as to whether a deviation (e.g., a standard deviation, etc.) between the two amounts exceeds a threshold condition. In this regard, a determination may be made as to whether a REMS condition is satisfied and/or whether potentially fraudulent activity exists. For example, a determination may be made as to whether a healthcare provider is purchasing a greater amount of a product (e.g., a controlled substance) than the amount associated with healthcare transactions submitted by the healthcare provider.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044">As an alternative to maintaining a dispense amount for a product, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>, either by itself or in conjunction with the inventory management module <b>184</b>, may maintain an inventory amount of the product at the healthcare provider. The inventory amount may be incremented or decremented based upon the evaluation of healthcare transactions. Additionally, as desired, a dispense amount over a desired period of time may be derived from the management of the inventory amount. In certain embodiments, as explained in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a maintained inventory amount may also be evaluated based upon ordering and/or purchasing information. For example, if it is determined that an amount of a product that is ordered results in an inventory that exceeds an inventory threshold (e.g., a threshold associated with a maximum inventory allowed for the product), then a potentially fraudulent situation may be identified.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">In the event that a REMS condition is determined to not be satisfied or in the event that potentially fraudulent activity is identified, a wide variety of suitable control actions may be taken by the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>. For example, a suitable alert message may be generated and communicated to any number of suitable recipients, such as a REMS administrator <b>190</b> or a healthcare provider back office computer <b>195</b> (e.g., a central office associated with a pharmacy chain, etc.). Additionally, as desired, a wide variety of REMS reports may be generated and distributed to designated recipients.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">Additionally, as desired, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may store or direct the storage of information associated with the processing of healthcare transactions in the databases or data storage devices <b>182</b>. For example, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may store information associated with received healthcare transactions, received adjudicated replies, invoice and/or purchasing information, determined dispense amounts associated with various products and healthcare providers, determined likely distribution amounts determined for various products and healthcare providers, generated alerts, and/or information associated with other processing performed by the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>. In certain embodiments, the stored information may be utilized for billing and/or reporting purposes. For example, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may utilize at least a portion of the stored information to bill pharmacies, pharmacy chains, and/or a REMS administrator for the services provided by the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0050">A few examples of the operations of the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> and/or the data storage devices <b>182</b> are described in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref>. Additionally, although the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> is described as processing healthcare claim transactions and reversal transactions, as desired, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may also process information associated with cash transactions. For example, in the event that a patient purchases a controlled substance using cash, a healthcare provider may prepare and communicate a healthcare transaction associated with the cash transaction to the service provider computer <b>104</b> for evaluation by the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>. In this regard, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may dynamically maintain a dispense amount for the healthcare provider even when patients purchase a product with cash. Indeed, in light of the risk associated with certain products, the healthcare providers may be required to communicate a healthcare transaction even if a purchase is made with cash.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">As desired, an inventory management module <b>184</b> or inventory management application may also be operative with the service provider computer <b>104</b>. Additionally, in certain embodiments, the service provider system and/or an associated module may maintain inventory information on behalf of any number of healthcare providers. Based at least in part upon the processing and/or evaluation of healthcare transactions, inventory amounts for various products may be dynamically maintained. The inventory amounts may then be compared to one or more suitable threshold values, such as an ordering threshold value. In the event that a threshold value is satisfied, one or more messages associated with the ordering of additional product may be generated and communicated. For example, a message may be communicated to a healthcare provider indicating that additional product should be ordered. As another example, an ordering message may be communicated to a supplier on behalf of a healthcare provider.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0052">As desired, the inventory management module <b>184</b> may include a back-end analytic, editing, messaging, and reporting system for transactions between prescribing entities, healthcare providers, and wholesalers or other distributors. The inventory management module <b>184</b> may allow a healthcare provider (e.g., a pharmacy, etc.) to automatically order a particular product (or additional inventory of a product) via the submission of prescription claim transactions and/or other healthcare transactions to the service provider computer <b>104</b>. The inventory management module <b>184</b> may reconcile healthcare transaction data (e.g., healthcare claim transactions, reversal transactions, etc.) to determine when a product order is desired. In one example operation, the inventory management module <b>184</b> may maintain a perpetual &#x201c;on hand&#x201d; inventory value for a particular product supply at a particular healthcare provider. For example, the inventory management module <b>184</b> may &#x201c;net out&#x201d; prescription claims and reversals on a daily basis. That is, an approved prescription claim transaction may decrement the &#x201c;on hand&#x201d; inventory value, while a claim reversal transaction may increment the &#x201c;on hand&#x201d; inventory value for a particular product supply at a particular healthcare provider. The inventory management module <b>184</b> may then compare the &#x201c;netted out&#x201d; activity for a particular product supply with a particular healthcare provider to a stored threshold value associated with the &#x201c;on hand&#x201d; inventory to determine if a product order transaction is desirable. In an example embodiment of the invention, the inventory management module <b>184</b> may initiate a product order transaction if the &#x201c;on-hand&#x201d; inventory is equal to (or less than) a threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0053">When a product inventory has met the threshold value (e.g., equaling the threshold value or falling below the threshold value), the inventory management module <b>184</b> may create daily drug product order files for each wholesaler. In an example embodiment of the invention, the inventory management module <b>184</b> may create one consolidated product order file per supplier and send that product order file to the wholesaler. In an example embodiment, the product order file may be automatically created and sent to the supplier once the inventory level for a particular product has reached or gone beyond a preset threshold value (e.g., equaling the threshold value or falling below the threshold value), where the threshold value reflects an acceptable level of &#x201c;on hand&#x201d; inventory for a particular product where product ordering is desirable. In an alternative embodiment, a message may be generated and sent to the healthcare provider computer <b>102</b> contemporaneously with the delivery of the product order file to the supplier computer <b>108</b>, or a message may be created and sent to the healthcare provider computer <b>102</b> for approval of the product ordering prior to the product order file being sent to the supplier computer <b>108</b>.</p>

As desired, the service provider computer <b>104</b> and/or an associated transaction processing module <b>142</b>, may perform one or more pre-edits on the healthcare transaction <b>202</b>. The pre-edits may verify, add, and/or edit information included in the healthcare transaction <b>202</b> prior to the healthcare transaction <b>202</b> being communicated to an appropriate recipient. According to an example embodiment, the service provider computer <b>104</b> and/or the transaction processing module <b>142</b> may utilize at least a portion of the information included in the healthcare transaction <b>202</b>, such as a BIN/PCN, to identify the claims processor computer <b>110</b> as an appropriate recipient for routing. The service provider computer <b>104</b> may also include a routing table, perhaps stored in memory, for determining a recipient. Once identified, the healthcare transaction <b>202</b> or a copy thereof may be routed to the claims processor computer <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0103">The claims processor computer <b>110</b> may receive and adjudicate or otherwise process the healthcare transaction <b>202</b>. For example, the recipient may determine benefits coverage for a healthcare claim transaction according to an adjudication process associated with eligibility, pricing, and/or utilization review. As another example, the claims processor computer <b>110</b> may process a received reversal transaction in order to facilitate a reversal of a previously approved claim transaction. Following the adjudication, the claims processor computer <b>110</b> may transmit an adjudicated response <b>206</b> or adjudicated reply for the healthcare transaction <b>202</b> to the service provider computer <b>104</b>. The service provider computer <b>104</b> may receive the adjudicated response <b>206</b> from the claims processor computer <b>110</b> and provide the adjudicated response <b>206</b> to the transaction processing module <b>142</b>. As desired, the transaction processing module <b>142</b> may perform any number of post-edits on the adjudicated response <b>206</b>. The adjudicated response <b>206</b> or a copy thereof may then be routed or otherwise communicated to the healthcare provider computer <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0104">Based at least in part upon the processing of the healthcare transaction <b>202</b> and/or the adjudicated response <b>206</b> by the transaction processing module <b>142</b>, the transaction processing module <b>142</b> may communicate inventory update information <b>208</b> and/or other information to the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>. For example, in the event that the healthcare transaction <b>202</b> is a healthcare claim transaction that has been approved (as indicated by the adjudicated response <b>206</b>), then dispense increment information or inventory decrement information may be communicated to the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>. As one example, a product associated with the healthcare transaction <b>202</b> and an amount of the product may be determined and utilized to communicate dispense increment information. As another example, in the event that the healthcare transaction <b>202</b> is a reversal transaction that has been approved (as indicated by the adjudicated response <b>206</b>), then dispense decrement information or inventory increment information may be communicated to the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>. In this regard, a dispensed amount of the product may be dynamically maintained by the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0105">As an alternative to communicating increment and/or decrement information to the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>, in certain embodiments, the transaction processing module <b>142</b> may communicate information extracted from the healthcare transaction <b>202</b> and/or adjudicated response <b>206</b> to the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>. For example, product identifying information (e.g., an NDC code, etc.) and dispense amount information may be provided to the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>. The REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may then process the information in order to determine increments and/or decrements of a total dispensed amount by the healthcare provider and/or a product inventory. In yet other embodiments, a copy of the healthcare transaction <b>202</b> and/or the adjudicated response <b>206</b> may be communicated to the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> for processing in order to maintain and/or determine a total dispensed amount of a product associated with the healthcare transaction <b>202</b>. Regardless of the information communicated to the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>, in certain embodiments, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may be selectively invoked based upon an identification of a product associated with the healthcare transaction <b>202</b>. For example, a product identifier (e.g., an NDC code, etc.) may be compared to a list of product identifiers associated with the invocation of the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> (e.g., a list of controlled substances, etc.), and the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may be selectively invoked based upon a determination of whether a product identifier is included in the list.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0106">The REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may receive information from the transaction processing module <b>142</b>, and the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may process at least a portion of the received information in order to determine and/or maintain a dispensed amount (or inventory) for a product provided by a healthcare provider associated with the healthcare transaction <b>202</b>. In certain embodiments, the dispensed amount may be determined and/or maintained over any desired period of time. For example, the dispensed amount of a product may be determined and/or maintained over a previous month, a previous three months, and/or any other time period. In this regard, dispense information for a product and a healthcare provider may be dynamically maintained by the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> based upon an analysis of billing and/or claim transaction information for the healthcare provider.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0107">Additionally, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may obtain order and/or purchase information <b>210</b> associated with the product. As desired, order and/or purchase information <b>210</b> may be obtained from a wide variety of different sources. For example, order and/or purchase information <b>210</b> may be obtained from a supplier computer <b>108</b> associated with a manufacturer, distributor, and/or supplier of the product. As another example, order and/or purchase information <b>210</b> may be obtained from an inventory management module, such as the inventory management module <b>184</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A wide variety of different types of order and/or purchase information <b>210</b> may be obtained as desired, including but not limited to, invoice data, shipment data, and/or billing data. Based at least in part upon an analysis and/or evaluation of the obtained order and/or purchase information <b>210</b>, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may determine or estimate a distribution amount (or available inventory) for the product. In other words, based upon an evaluation of the amount of a product ordered and/or supplied to a healthcare provider, an estimate of the amount of product distributed or dispensed by the healthcare provider may be determined. As desired, the distribution amount may be determined over any desired period of time, such as the same period of time utilized to evaluate healthcare transaction information.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0108">As desired in various embodiments, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may compare a determined or maintained dispense amount (e.g., an amount determined from healthcare transaction data) to a determined or estimated distribution amount (e.g., an amount determined or estimated from ordering information). As desired, a determination may be made as to whether the two amounts correspond to one another. In this regard, a determination may be made as to whether a healthcare provider is ordering a greater amount of a product (e.g., a controlled substance) than the amount of the product reported by healthcare transactions. For example, a difference and/or deviation between the two amounts may be determined and compared to one or more threshold values and/or REMS conditions in order to determine whether a correspondence exists. In the event that a determination is made that the two amounts do not correspond to one another, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may identify a potentially fraudulent situation. As desired, a suitable alert message <b>214</b> associated with the potentially fraudulent situation may be generated and communicated to one or more suitable recipients, such as a REMS administrator <b>190</b> and/or a healthcare provider back office computer <b>195</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0109">According to an aspect of the invention, the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may store information <b>212</b> associated with the processed healthcare transaction <b>202</b> and/or ordering information for a wide variety of reporting and/or billing purposes.

<p id="p-0083" num="0120">The method <b>300</b> may end following either block <b>320</b> or block <b>345</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram of an example method <b>400</b> for identifying potential fraud and/or abuse in association with the distribution of a product, according to an illustrative embodiment. The method <b>400</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be an example implementation of block <b>325</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As such, the method <b>400</b> may be performed by a suitable service provider computer and/or REMS adherence module, such as the service provider computer <b>104</b> and/or the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The method <b>400</b> may begin at block <b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0122">At block <b>405</b>, information associated with a healthcare transaction may be received by the REMS adherence module <b>180</b>. For example, a copy of the healthcare transaction and/or information extracted from the healthcare transaction may be received. At block <b>410</b>, a product associated with the healthcare transaction may be identified. For example, an NDC code, other product identifier (e.g., Universal Product Code, etc.), or product name included in the healthcare transaction may be identified. At block <b>415</b>, a determination may be made as to whether the identified product is a REMS product or a product for which a REMS adherence service should be provided. For example, a determination may be made as to whether the identified product is a controlled substance designated for REMS monitoring. A wide variety of suitable methods and/or techniques may be utilized to determine whether the identified product is a REMS product. For example, product identifying information may be compared to stored information associated with REMS products (e.g., a list of REMS products, etc.), and the product may be identified as a REMS product in the event that a match or correspondence is identified. If it is determined at block <b>415</b> that the product is not a REMS product, then operations of the method <b>400</b> may end. If, however, it is determined at block <b>415</b> that the product is a REMS product, then operations may continue at block <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0123">At block <b>420</b>, a dispense amount and/or inventory information for the product and the healthcare provider may be determined. For example, a stored dispense amount associated with the product and the healthcare provider may be accessed from memory and/or obtained from an external source. In certain embodiments, the stored dispense amount may monitor or track a dispensed amount of the product based upon healthcare transactions submitted by the pharmacy. As desired, the stored dispense amount may be derived from healthcare transactions submitted for any desired historical period of time, such as the last month, the last three months, or some other period of time. As another example, a stored inventory amount may be accessed from memory and/or obtained from an external source. The inventory amount may track and/or estimate an available inventory of the product at the healthcare provider based upon the processing of healthcare transactions. For example, an initial inventory may be determined, and the inventory may be modified based upon processed healthcare transactions. Additionally, as explained in greater detail below with reference to block <b>450</b>, the inventory may be modified based upon order and/or purchase information.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0124">At block <b>425</b>, a determination may be made as to whether the healthcare transaction has been approved. For example, a received adjudication response for the healthcare transaction may be evaluated in order to determine whether the underlying healthcare transaction has been approved by a claims processor. If it is determined at block <b>425</b> that the healthcare transaction has not been approved, then the method <b>400</b> may end. If, however, it is determined at block <b>425</b> that the healthcare transaction has been approved, then operations may continue at block <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0125">At block <b>430</b>, a determination may be made as to whether the healthcare transaction is a reversal transaction. In other words, a determination may be made as to whether the healthcare transaction is a healthcare claim transaction associated with a dispense of the product or a reversal transaction intended to reverse a previously processed healthcare claim transaction. If it is determined at block <b>430</b> that the healthcare transaction is a reversal transaction, then operations may continue at block <b>435</b>. At block <b>435</b>, it may be assumed that an amount of the product associated with the healthcare transaction has not been dispensed. As a result, a dispense amount associated with the product may be decremented by an amount of the product associated with the reversal transaction. For example, if a reversal transaction reverses a previous claim for 30 units of the product, the dispense amount associated with the product may be decremented by 30 units. Alternatively, an inventory amount associated with the product may be incremented by an amount of the product associated with the reversal transaction. Operations may then continue at block <b>445</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0126">If, however, it is determined at block <b>430</b> that the healthcare transaction is not a reversal transaction, then operations may continue at block <b>440</b>. At block <b>440</b>, it may be determined that the healthcare transaction is a healthcare claim transaction. Additionally, it may be assumed that an amount of product associated with the healthcare transaction has been dispensed by the healthcare provider to a patient. As a result, a dispense amount associated with the product may be incremented by an amount of the product associated with the healthcare transaction. Alternatively, an inventory amount associated with the product may be decremented by an amount of the product associated with the healthcare transaction. Operations may then continue at block <b>445</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0127">At block <b>445</b>, which may be reached from either block <b>435</b> or block <b>440</b>, a dispense or distribution amount for the product by the healthcare provider may be determined over a predetermined period of time, such as a previous month, a previous three-month period, or some other period of time. In certain embodiments, a dispense amount maintained by the REMS adherence module <b>180</b> may track a rolling period of received and processed healthcare transactions associated with the product. In this regard, dispensing activity for the product, as reflected by submitted healthcare transactions, may be maintained over a desired time period. In other embodiments, inventory information associated with the desired time period may be evaluated in order to determine a dispense or distribution amount of the product over the desired time period. For example, a current inventory amount for the product may be subtracted from an inventory amount at the beginning of the desired time period to determine a dispense amount of the product. As desired, the monitoring of inventory amounts may be adjusted based upon known purchasing and/or ordering activity. Additionally, in certain embodiments, a dispense amount may be derived from a combination of monitored dispenses and/or inventory information. Indeed, a wide variety of suitable methods and/or techniques may be utilized to determine a dispense amount over a predetermined period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0128">At block <b>450</b>, order and/or purchase information for the product may be obtained from a wide variety of suitable sources. For example, order and/or purchase information may be obtained from a supplier computer associated with a manufacturer, distributor, and/or supplier of the product. As another example, information may be obtained from the inventory management module <b>184</b>. A wide variety of different types of order and/or purchase information may be obtained as desired, including but not limited to, invoice data, shipment data, and/or billing data. The purchase information may be indicative of an amount of product that has likely been distributed by the healthcare provider over any desired period of time. For example, the purchase information may be evaluated in order to determine an amount of product supplied or provided to the healthcare provider. Taking stocking and/or inventory considerations into account, an amount of the product that has likely been distributed by the healthcare provider may be estimated.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0129">At block <b>455</b>, the purchase information (or likely distribution amount) may be compared to the dispense information (i.e., the dispense/distribution information obtained from healthcare transaction monitoring). For example, an amount of the product supplied to the healthcare provider over a period of time may be compared to the claim and/or billing transaction data submitted by the healthcare provider for the product. In this regard, a wide variety of REMS compliance may be evaluated and/or potentially fraudulent situations may be identified.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0130">A wide variety of suitable methods and/or techniques may be utilized to evaluate the purchase information and the dispense information. For example, the results of a comparison may be evaluated utilizing any number of suitable threshold conditions and/or REMS parameters. As one example, a difference between a purchase amount and a determined dispense amount may be compared to one or more threshold conditions. As another example, a deviation (e.g., a standard deviation, etc.) between a purchase amount and a determined dispense amount may be compared to one or more threshold conditions. In this regard, a determination may be made as to whether the healthcare provider is ordering a greater amount of product than the amount of dispensed product indicated in healthcare transaction activity. For example, if a deviation between a determined dispensed amount and an ordered or purchased amount exceeds a threshold, then a potentially fraudulent situation in which a healthcare provider may be dispensing product (e.g., controlled substances) without submitting healthcare transactions may be identified. As another example, a potentially fraudulent situation may be identified if a difference between a managed inventory amount (i.e., an inventory amount managed in conjunction with healthcare transaction activity) and an expected inventory from purchasing information exceeds a predetermined threshold. Indeed, a wide variety of different types of thresholds and/or conditions may be evaluated in order to identify potentially fraudulent activity.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0131">At block <b>460</b>, a determination may be made as to whether one or more threshold conditions have been satisfied by an evaluation of purchase information and distribution/dispense information. If it is determined at block <b>460</b> that the one or more threshold conditions have been satisfied (i.e., no potentially fraudulent activity is identified), then the method <b>400</b> may end. If, however, it is determined at block <b>460</b> that one or more threshold conditions have not been satisfied, then operations may continue at block <b>465</b>. At block <b>465</b>, a potentially fraudulent situation or other situation associated with failure to satisfy REMS conditions may be identified. Additionally, a suitable alert message associated with the potentially fraudulent situation (or other situation) may be generated and communicated to one or more suitable recipients, such as a REMS administrator and/or a healthcare provider back office computer.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0132">The method <b>400</b> may end following either block <b>415</b>, block <b>425</b>, block <b>460</b>, or block <b>465</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0133">The operations described and shown in the methods <b>300</b>, <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref> may be carried out or performed in any suitable order as desired in various embodiments of the invention. Additionally, in certain embodiments, at least a portion of the operations may be carried out in parallel. Furthermore, in certain embodiments, less than or more than the operations described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-4</figref> may be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0134">Accordingly, example embodiments of the disclosure can provide the technical effects of evaluating healthcare transactions to determine dispense and/or inventory amounts for various products distributed by a healthcare provider. Additionally, the determined dispense and/or inventory amounts may be compared to and/or otherwise evaluated in association with ordering and/or purchasing information for the products by the healthcare providers. In this regard, potential fraud and/or potential REMS non-compliance by the healthcare provider may be identified.</p>
