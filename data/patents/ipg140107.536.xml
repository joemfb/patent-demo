<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to door hinges, and, more particularly, to hinges used on heavy doors such as on commercial refrigerators and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Heavy doors, such as those used on walk-in refrigerators, are often mounted to jambs by large industrial type hinges. Sometimes, these large hinges also lift the door when it is swung open, and use gravity to assist in the closing of the door. These hinges usually have two barrels mounted one above the other which include low friction bearings press fitted therein.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A problem occurs when through use of the door the internal bearings becomes worn and the hinge ceases to operate in the correct manner. When this occurs, the installer typically replaces the entire hinge. This problem is especially prevalent when the hinge is a riser type hinge which includes caroming components that increase the wear due to the forced rising of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It thus is seen that a need remains for a heavy duty hinge which alleviates problems associated with those of the prior art. It is to the provision of such therefore that the present invention is primarily directed.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In a preferred form of the invention, a hinge for doors being suited from mating engagement with an associated cabinet or jamb comprises a mounting flange adapted to be mounted to a jamb, the mounting flange having an upper hinge arm and a lower hinge arm, and a strap assembly adapted to be mounted to a door and pivotally coupled to the mounting flange. The strap assembly including a strap, a cylinder portion coupled to the strap, and a mounting assembly coupled to the cylinder portion. The cylinder portion has an elongated slot with an enlarged portion straddled by two oppositely disposed narrowed portions. The enlarged portion has a select width and the narrowed portions each having a select width less than the enlarged portion select width. The mounting assembly includes a lower strap bearing removably mounted to a lower end of the cylinder portion, an upper strap bearing removably mounted to an upper end of the cylinder portion, and a mounting rod extending through the upper hinge arm, the upper strap bearing, the lower strap bearing, and the lower strap arm. The lower strap bearing has a locking flange with a narrow portion configured to be received within one of the cylinder portion elongated slot narrowed portion and an enlarged portion configured to be removably received within the other cylinder portion elongated slot enlarged portion. The upper strap bearing has a locking flange with a narrow portion configured to be received within one of the cylinder portion elongated slot narrowed portion and an enlarged portion configured to be removably received within the other cylinder portion elongated slot enlarged portion.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">With reference next to the drawings, there is shown a riser hinge <b>10</b> according to the present invention. The hinge <b>10</b> includes a mounting flange assembly <b>12</b> pivotally coupled to a strap assembly <b>15</b>. It is to be appreciated that the hinge <b>10</b> shown in the drawings is configured for use with a walk-in refrigerator or freezer door. The jamb and doors are well-known in the art and need not be disclosed further herein. It is to be further appreciated that the hinge <b>10</b>, either alone or in combination with another hinge in accordance with the present invention, support a door (not shown) in the usual manner.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The mounting flange assembly <b>12</b> includes a mounting flange <b>16</b> having four mounting holes <b>17</b> therethrough adapted to receive unshown mounting bolts or screws, a lower hinge arm <b>18</b> generally extending perpendicularly from the mounting flange <b>16</b>, and an upper hinge arm <b>19</b> generally extending perpendicularly from the mounting flange <b>16</b>. The upper hinge arm <b>19</b> has an inwardly tapered groove <b>20</b> extending from a bottom surface <b>21</b> and a rod mounting hole <b>22</b> extending therethrough. Similarly, the lower arm <b>18</b> has an inwardly tapered groove <b>24</b> extending from the top surface <b>25</b> and a rod mounting hole <b>26</b> extending therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The strap assembly <b>15</b> includes a caroming assembly <b>27</b> having a multi-lobed cam <b>28</b> coupled to the lower hinge arm <b>18</b> which enables the hinge to be a riser type hinge. The cam <b>28</b> has a lower plate <b>29</b> and a cylindrical camming portion <b>30</b> extending upwardly from the lower plate <b>29</b> and having a top surface <b>31</b> opposite the lower plate <b>29</b>. The lower plate <b>29</b> has two oppositely disposed guides or guide blocks <b>32</b> configured to removably mate with the tapered groove <b>24</b> extending from the lower hinge arm <b>18</b> to prevent relative rotation therebetween. The camming portion <b>30</b> and lower plate <b>29</b> have a central rod mounting hole <b>33</b> therethrough. The camming portion <b>30</b> is made entirely of a smooth, low-frictional, plastic material such as nylon.</p>

The first and second grooves <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> are positioned laterally offset from each other so that therebetween the camming portion is formed with a large lobe <b>38</b> and a small lobe <b>39</b>. The large lobe <b>38</b> has an upwardly extending, helical top bearing surface which extends to a generally flat, large top dwell surface or landing <b>42</b>. The small lobe <b>39</b> has an upwardly extending, helical top bearing surface <b>43</b> which extends to a generally flat, small top dwell surface or landing <b>44</b>. The large and small top dwell surfaces generally form top surface <b>31</b>. The large lobe top dwell surface <b>41</b> is of a select size (arcuate span or length), while the small lobe top dwell surface <b>44</b> has with a select size (arcuate span or length) smaller than that of the large top dwell surface <b>42</b>. The large top dwell surface <b>42</b> extends arcuately approximately 140 degrees about the center of the camming portion. The small lobe top dwell surface <b>44</b> extends arcuately approximately 60 degrees about the center of the camming portion. As such, the camming portion first groove has a first top opening <b>45</b> with a spacing of approximately 80 degrees about the center and the second groove <b>36</b> has a second top opening <b>46</b> with a spacing of approximately 80 degrees about the center.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The strap assembly <b>15</b> also includes a strap <b>51</b> extending from a cylinder portion or barrel <b>52</b>. The strap <b>51</b> includes four mounting holes <b>53</b>. The term cylinder portion is meant to describe the enlarged casing located at the end of the strap. The term cylinder portion is not intended to be limited to a cylinder shape, as this portion or parts of this portion may be of many known shapes and are not necessarily cylindrical in shape. The cylindrical portion <b>52</b> includes an upper strap bearing <b>54</b> mounted partially within the cylindrical portion <b>52</b>, and a lower strap bearing <b>55</b>, in the form of a cam follower <b>56</b>, mounted partially within the cylindrical portion <b>52</b>. The cam follower <b>56</b> is a component of the camming assembly <b>27</b>. The upper strap bearing <b>54</b> has a central rod mounting hole <b>58</b> therethrough. The lower strap bearing <b>55</b> has a central rod mounting hole <b>60</b> therethrough. A shoulder bolt or rod <b>61</b> extends through the upper hinge arm mounting rod hole <b>22</b>, the upper strap bearing mounting hole <b>58</b>, the lower strap bearing mounting hole <b>60</b>, and through the lower hinge arm mounting rod hole <b>26</b>. A locking c-ring <b>62</b> is mounted into a ring groove <b>63</b> on both the upper and lower ends of the rod <b>61</b> to maintain it in place.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The cam follower <b>56</b> has a lower plate <b>65</b> and a cylindrical cam following portion <b>66</b> defined by a cylindrical exterior wall <b>67</b> extending upwardly from the lower plate <b>65</b>. The cam follower <b>56</b> is made entirely of smooth, low-frictional, plastic material such as nylon. The cylindrical cam following portion <b>66</b> has two asymmetrically positioned helical grooves <b>68</b> therein which form two asymmetrical cam following ridges <b>69</b>. The asymmetrical configuration of the grooves <b>69</b> creates a first, large ridge <b>70</b> and a second, small ridge <b>71</b>. The large ridge <b>70</b> has a large bottom bearing surface <b>73</b> having a helical rising portion <b>74</b> extending to a generally flat resting or dwell portion <b>75</b>. The large bottom bearing surface <b>73</b> is configured to mate with the large lobe top bearing surface <b>41</b>. The small ridge <b>71</b> has a small bottom bearing surface <b>77</b> having a helical rising portion <b>78</b> extending to a generally flat resting or dwell portion <b>79</b>. The small bottom bearing surface <b>77</b> is configured to mate with the small lobe top bearing surface <b>43</b>. The resting portions <b>75</b> and <b>79</b> each extend arcuately approximately 50 degrees about the center of the cylindrical portion <b>66</b>. The large ridge <b>70</b> is sized and shaped to fit within the first groove <b>35</b> of the cam <b>28</b> while the small ridge <b>71</b> is sized and shaped to fit within the second groove <b>36</b> of the cam <b>28</b>. As such, the bottom bearing surface <b>77</b> of the small ridge <b>71</b> rides upon or bears against the top bearing surface <b>43</b> of the small lobe <b>39</b>. Similarly, the bottom bearing surface <b>73</b> of the large ridge <b>70</b> rides upon or bears against the top bearing surface <b>41</b> of the large lobe <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The strap cylinder portion <b>52</b> has a gap, groove, or space <b>82</b> adjacent the strap <b>51</b>. The space <b>82</b> includes an enlarged portion <b>83</b> flanked by narrowed portions <b>84</b> at stop ledges <b>85</b>. The upper strap bearing <b>54</b> and cam follower <b>56</b> each have a vertically oriented, elongated, locking tongue or flange <b>87</b> with a narrowed portion <b>88</b> extending to an enlarged portion or stop <b>89</b>. The narrowed portion <b>88</b> is configured to fit within the narrowed portion <b>84</b> of the space <b>82</b>, while the enlarged portion <b>89</b> is configured to removably fit within the enlarged portion <b>83</b> of the space <b>82</b>. With this construction, the upper strap bearing <b>54</b> and cam follower <b>56</b> may be removed from the cylinder portion <b>52</b> by first horizontally and then vertically forcing the cam and cam follower enlarged portions <b>89</b> over the stop ledges <b>85</b> of the space <b>82</b> and into the narrowed portions <b>84</b> of the space, thereby releasing them and allowing them to be vertically removed and easily replaced in the event of excessive wear upon these components. The cam follower and upper strap may include screw holes to allow screws to be passed through thereby securing these components together.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In use, the hinge <b>10</b> is mounted to the refrigerator or freezer door in the conventional manner as is well known in the art. The mounting flange <b>16</b> is secured to the jamb by the use of screws (not shown) that extend through the mounting flange mounting holes <b>17</b> and into the jamb. A conventional walk-in refrigerator or freezer door is similarly secured to the hinge <b>10</b> by four screws (not shown) that extend through the four mounting holes <b>53</b> of the strap assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As the door is swung open, from a door closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref>, the cam follower <b>56</b> rotates about the hinge rod <b>61</b> and upon the underlying cam <b>28</b>. As this occurs, the helical cam follower large ridge <b>70</b> and small ridge <b>71</b> ride upwardly upon the cam large lobe <b>38</b> and small lobe <b>39</b>, respectively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 7</figref>. The cam follower <b>56</b> rotates in this manner until the cam follower rising portions <b>74</b> and <b>78</b> crest the cam lobe top bearing surfaces <b>41</b> and <b>43</b> and the cam follower flat resting portions <b>75</b> and <b>79</b> ride onto the cam top dwell surfaces <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>. The initial movement of the cam follower causes it to rise relative to the cam, and thus the door rises relative to the structure to which it is mounted and underlying floor. Once the cam follower flat resting portions <b>75</b> and <b>79</b> ride onto the cam top dwell surfaces <b>42</b> and <b>44</b> the lifting of the door ceases and the door simply continues to rotate open without any vertical movement, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 8</figref>. Thus, if the door is now released it will tend to remain stationary. Conversely, should the door be released before this occurs, the weight of the door will cause the caroming to close the door as the cam follower rides down the cam and is returned to its at rest, closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be understood that if the cam grooves and resulting lobes were symmetrical the over rotation of the door opening movement would cause the ridges <b>70</b>, <b>71</b> to fall into the opposite grooves <b>35</b>, <b>36</b> causing a disastrous situation. Also, the door would not be capable of moving much further past its dwell point due to the limited amount of dwell contact surface between the cam top dwell surfaces and cam follower flat resting portions. However, by creating an asymmetrical arrangement of the cam grooves <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> and large and small lobes <b>38</b> and <b>39</b>, and the asymmetrical arrangement of the cam follower grooves <b>68</b> and large and small ridges <b>70</b> and <b>71</b> this situation does not occur. As the cam follower is rotated past the initial dwell point the ridges' flat resting portions <b>75</b> and <b>79</b> ride upon the lobe top dwell surfaces <b>42</b> and <b>44</b>, wherein the extended length (large arcuate length) of the large lobe top dwell surface <b>41</b> allows extended contact and thus rotation. Additionally, this insures that contact always exists between the lobes and the ridges as they are laterally offset from each other, as the cam large lobe top dwell surface <b>42</b> is larger than the opposite groove opening between the cam follower ridges flat resting portions <b>75</b> and <b>79</b>, i.e., the cam large lobe top dwell spans or bridges the space of the opposite groove and the large ridge flat resting portion remains on the large lobe top dwell surface even when the small ridge flat resting portion extends over the first groove top opening <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It should also be understood that the upper hinge arm <b>19</b> also includes a tapered groove <b>20</b> even though such is not utilized in the drawings. However, should an installer wish to install the hinge as a left hand hinge, as opposed to the right hand hinge arrangement shown in the drawings, the installer simply inverts the mounting flange <b>16</b> so that the upper hinge arm <b>19</b> becomes a lower hinge arm <b>18</b>, the upper strap bearing <b>54</b> and lower strap bearing <b>55</b> are removed and replaced with oppositely oriented bearings within the strap cylindrical portion <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It should be understood that the positioning, configuration, or orientation of the cam and cam follower may be reversed, as such, the terms cam and cam follower may be used interchangeably. It should also be understood that while the space <b>82</b> is shown as one continuous space, it could be formed as two spaces extending from opposite ends of the cylinder portion. In such a case, the centrally located enlarged portion <b>83</b> would have two separate enlarged portions rather than the one continuous enlarged portion which comprises of two co-extending enlarged portions.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It thus is seen that a riser hinge is now provided which overcomes problems long associated with those of the prior art. It should, however, be understood that the just described embodiments merely illustrate principles of the invention in two preferred forms. Many modifications, additions and deletions may, of course, be made thereto without departure from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the following claims.</p>
