<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The disclosure relates to a flat speaker unit and a flat speaker device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Vision and audition are two most direct sensory responses of human beings. Thus, scientists have been dedicated to develop various renewable vision and audition related systems. Moving coil speaker is still the major product in the market among all the existing renewable speakers. However, along with people's increasing demand to high quality sensory enjoyment and the ever-decreasing sizes of 3C products (Computer, Communication, and Consumer Electronics), speakers having low power consumption, light weights, and small sizes that are designed according to human engineering, and such speaker can be used in either large-size flat speakers or small walkman headphones and stereo mobile phones, and in a foreseeable future, such technology may have a plenty of demands and application development.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The existing speakers can be categorized into direct and indirect types according to their radiation patterns or can be categorized into moving coil speaker, piezoelectric speaker, and electrostatic speaker according to the driving patterns thereof. The moving coil speaker is currently the most commonly used and most mature product. However, a moving coil speaker cannot be flattened due to a physical structure shortage thereof. Accordingly, moving coil speaker is not suitable for 3C products and home entertainment systems that have a developing trend of flattening.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A piezoelectric speaker pushes a membrane to produce sounds based on a piezoelectric effect of a piezoelectric material (i.e., the material is deformed when an electric field is supplied thereon). Such piezoelectric speaker has a flat and small structure. Main products of the electrostatic speaker in the market include hi-end earphones and loudspeakers. According to the operation principle of a conventional electrostatic speaker, a conductive membrane is clamped between two fixed porous electrode plates to form a capacitor, and by supplying a DC bias to the vibrating membrane and an AC voltage to the two fixed electrode plates, an electrostatic force generated by positive and negative electric fields drives the conductive membrane to vibrate, so as to produce sounds. The conventional electrostatic speaker requires a DC bias of up to hundreds or even thousands voltages, so that a high-price and large-size amplifier is required to be connected, which is a reason why the conventional electrostatic speaker is not popularized.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Audio is a major element in the future applications of flexible electronics. However, the flexible electronics has to have the characteristics of softness, thinness, low driving voltage, and high flexibility. Thus, how to break through the conventional design to fabricate elements having the characteristics required by the flexible electronics has become a major subject.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF DISCLOSED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The disclosure provides a flat speaker unit, which can resolve a problem of a conventional technique that a speaker structure and a driving circuit thereof are too complicated when a sound-pressure power is increased, and improve design and application diversity of the product. The flat speaker unit of the disclosure has a simple structure, which can be mass-produced according to existing techniques and fabrication processes.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the flat speaker unit or the flat speaker device of the disclosure, two ends of a signal source are electrically connected to porous electrodes and/or a vibrating membrane in the flat speaker unit, so as to drive the flat speaker unit or the flat speaker device to produce sounds to achieve a low Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) effect.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">One of the embodiments provides a flat speaker unit including a first porous electrode, a second porous electrode and a vibrating membrane with an electret layer and an electrode layer disposed there between. An air gap suitable for producing sounds is formed between the first porous electrode and the vibrating membrane, or between the second porous electrode and the vibrating membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an embodiment, a plurality of supporting members are disposed between the first porous electrode and the vibrating membrane, or/and between the second porous electrode and the vibrating membrane.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an embodiment, the flat speaker unit is fixed by a frame supporter, and the first porous electrode, the second porous electrode and the vibrating membrane having the electret layer and the electrode layer are stacked inside the frame supporter, wherein a plurality of supporting members are added therein, and the supporting members can be designed to have certain patterns according to actual requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">An embodiment of the disclosure provides a flat speaker device, which includes a plurality of the aforementioned flat speaker units, wherein the flat speaker units are at least stacked into a two-layer structure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one of the embodiments, the first and the second porous electrodes respectively include a conductive layer and a non-conductive layer, where relative stacking positions of the conductive layer and the non-conductive layer of the first or the second porous electrode can be arbitrarily combined. Or, the first and the second porous electrodes both include a conductive layer.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an embodiment, at least one of the non-conductive layer faces to the vibrating membrane in the stacking structure. For example, the conductive layer of the first porous electrode faces outwards, and the non-conductive layer thereof faces to the vibrating membrane. Now, the conductive layer of the second porous electrode can face outwards or face to the vibrating membrane. Such design is because that a thickness of the fat speaker unit is rather thin, and when the first and the second porous electrodes and the vibrating membrane vibrate to make sounds, the electrode layer of the electret layer probably contacts the first or the second porous electrode to cause short circuit due to vibration of the electret layer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An embodiment of the disclosure provides a flat speaker device formed by one or a plurality of flat speaker units of the aforementioned embodiments. By respectively connecting audio signals of different polarities to the first and second porous electrodes, or in another embodiment, connecting the audio signal of the same polarity to the first and second porous electrodes and connecting the audio signal of another polarity to the vibrating membrane including the electret layer, the vibrating membrane having the electret layer is vibrated to drive the flat speaker device to make sounds. For example, when a first end of a signal source is connected to the first porous electrode, a second end of the signal source is connected to the second porous electrode. The signals with positive and negative polarities of the signal source are alternately connected to the first and the second porous electrodes through the first and the second ends, and based on charge characteristics of the electret layer of the vibrating membrane, the vibrating membrane is vibrated to push the air in the air gap to produce corresponding sounds. In another embodiment, signals of different polarities can be applied to the first and second porous electrodes or the vibrating membrane to produce sounds.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The above connection method is to achieve a low THD, i.e. reduce the THD phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Electret Material</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the aforementioned flat speaker unit, based on the charge characteristics and an electrostatic effect of the electret material, when the electret vibrating membrane is stimulated by an external voltage, a surface of the vibrating membrane is deformed, so as to drive the air surrounding the vibrating membrane to produce sound. As known from an electrostatic force formula and energy laws, the force applied on the vibrating membrane equals to the capacitance of the whole speaker multiplied by an intensity of an internal electric field and a sound voltage signal input from external, and the larger the force applied on the electret vibrating membrane is, the louder the output sound is.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The speaker unit of the disclosure has a simple structure, which can be mass-produced according to the existing techniques and fabrication processes, so that fabrication cost thereof can be effectively reduced. The embodiment enhances reliability and the sounding efficiency of the flat speaker, which is one of techniques the flat speaker. Regarding a constitution of the flat speaker unit, a flexible speaker unit with flexible and bendable characteristics can be used. Certainly, materials whose characteristics remain unaffected in a bended state should be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Based on the charge characteristics and the electrostatic effect of the electret material, when the electret vibrating membrane is stimulated by the external voltage, deformation vertical to the surface of the vibrating membrane is generated. Namely, if four sides of the vibrating membrane are fixed, deformation parallel to the surface of the vibrating membrane is avoided, and the deformation vertical to the surface of the vibrating membrane is generated, so as to drive the air around the vibrating membrane to generate sound. As known from the electrostatic force formula and the energy laws, the force applied on the vibrating membrane equals to the capacitance of the whole speaker multiplied by an intensity of an internal electric field and a sound voltage signal input from external, and the larger the force applied on the electret vibrating membrane is, the louder the output sound is, and a principle thereof is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the Coulomb's Law, a product of charges of two charged objects is directly proportional to an electrostatic force interacted there between, and inversely proportional to a square of a distance between the two objects. If the two charges are both positive or negative, the objects are repelled by a repulsive electrostatic force. If one of the charges is positive, and the other is negative, the objects are attracted by an attractive electrostatic force. The electret material utilized in the flat speaker unit of the embodiment is an electret composite material electro-sound actuator having micro-scale or nano-scale pores. In the flat speaker unit, an electret vibrating membrane is clamped symmetrically or asymmetrically between two charged porous electrode plates, which has a structure similar to that of a capacitor, and the porous electrode plates are respectively applied with positive and negative voltages (from the signal source). According to the Coulomb's Law, the electret vibrating membrane in the middle is forced by an attractive and a repulsive electrostatic forces at the same time, and the electrostatic force applied on a unit area of the vibrating membrane can be represented by a following equation (1):</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Where, a vacuum permittivity &#x2208;<sub>o</sub>=8.85*10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>F/m, an electret dielectric constant is &#x2208;<sub>e</sub>, a thickness of the electret material is S<sub>e</sub>, a thickness of an air layer is S<sub>a</sub>, an input signal voltage is V<sub>in</sub>, a voltage of the electret material is V<sub>e</sub>, and the electrostatic force applied to a unit area of the vibrating membrane is P. As known from the equation (1), the electrostatic force is directly proportional to a product of the bias and the audio signal voltage, and is inversely proportional to a distance between the porous electrode plate and the electret vibrating membrane. Therefore, in case of a same distance, if the electrostatic speaker can provide a high charge maintaining effect, the audio AC power can achieve the required electrostatic force through a relatively low voltage. In the present embodiment, electret composite materials with micro-scale or nano-scale pores are used to provide a charge maintaining amount of over hundreds to thousands of volts. According to the above electrostatic equation, the audio voltage can be reduced to a dozen of volts, so as to improve the practicality of the flat speaker of the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">According to the aforementioned principle, under a function of the positive and negative biases of the two porous electrode plates, the electret vibrating membrane is forced by a push-pull electrostatic force, such that the electret vibrating membrane is vibrated to compress the surrounding air to produce sound.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the embodiment, the electret vibrating membrane can be an electret vibrating membrane that a dielectric material is electrized to be able to keep static charges for a long period of time. Moreover, the electret vibrating membrane is a vibrating membrane manufactured from a single-layered dielectric material or multi-layered dielectric materials, and the dielectric material is, for example, fluorinated hylenepropylene (FEP), polytetrafluoethylene (PTFE), polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), partial fluorine-contained polymers, or other suitable materials. The dielectric material may include micro-scale or nanometer-scale pores. Since the electret vibrating membrane is capable of maintaining the static charges for a long time after it is electrized, after corona charging, dipolar charges are generated in the material to generate the electrostatic effect.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Currently, the sound-pressure of the flat speaker unit cannot achieve a sound volume increasing effect in a short period of time due to the materials or design factors thereof, and improvements thereof are all focusing on increasing the charge maintaining amount of the electret vibrating membrane or improving an acoustic structure design. However, the above methods both require time-consuming studies and cannot fulfil an application design requirement of increasing the sound volume within a short time. Therefore, a method of increasing the sound volume through the unit structure design improvement is one of the benefits of the embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In another embodiment, the flat speaker units are integrated, though the sounding effect of driving a plurality of the flat speaker units can be achieved without changing a design of the input signal source, so as to quickly resolve the problem of material limitation, etc.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the present embodiment, based on the charge characteristics and the electrostatic effect of the electret material, where the vibrating membrane can be an electret composite material, and positive charges and negative charges can be injected thereon to achieve different effects.
