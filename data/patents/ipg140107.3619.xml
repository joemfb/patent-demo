<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A power-oscillator-starting circuit for an electronic high frequency induction-heater driver. The induction-heater driver, upon receipt of a turn-on signal, generates a high frequency alternating current, wherein the alternating current through an induction-heater coil is magnetically coupled to an appropriate loss component for a variable-spray fuel-injection system. The induction-heater driver uses a power oscillator that is started and restarted as is appropriate based on a threshold current limit referenced to the supply voltage of the induction-heater driver.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Embodiments of the invention relate generally to power oscillators for induction heaters and more particularly to such power oscillators for variable spray fuel injectors.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a continued need for improving the emissions quality of internal combustion engines. At the same time, there is pressure to minimize engine crank times and time from key-on to drive-away, while maintaining maximum fuel economy. Those pressures apply to engines fueled with alternative fuels such as ethanol as well as to those fueled with gasoline.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">During cold temperature engine start, the conventional spark ignition internal combustion engine is characterized by high hydrocarbon emissions and poor fuel ignition and combustibility. Unless the engine is already at a high temperature after stop and hot-soak, the crank time may be excessive, or the engine may not start at all. At higher speeds and loads, the operating temperature increases and fuel atomization and mixing improve.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">During an actual engine cold start, the enrichment necessary to accomplish the start leaves an off-stoichiometric fueling that materializes as high tail-pipe hydrocarbon emissions. The worst emissions are during the first few minutes of engine operation, after which the catalyst and engine approach operating temperature. Regarding ethanol fueled vehicles, as the ethanol percentage fraction of the fuel increases to 100%, the ability to cold start becomes increasingly diminished, leading some manufacturers to include a dual fuel system in which engine start is fueled with conventional gasoline and engine running is fueled with the ethanol grade. Such systems are expensive and redundant.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another solution to cold start emissions and starting difficulty at low temperature is to pre-heat the fuel to a temperature where the fuel vaporizes quickly, or vaporizes immediately (&#x201c;flash boils&#x201d;), when released to manifold or atmospheric pressure. Pre-heating the fuel replicates a hot engine as far as fuel state is considered.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A number of pre-heating methods have been proposed, most of which involve preheating in a fuel injector. Fuel injectors are widely used for metering fuel into the intake manifold or cylinders of automotive engines. Fuel injectors typically comprise a housing containing a volume of pressurized fuel, a fuel inlet portion, a nozzle portion containing a needle valve, and an electromechanical actuator such as an electromagnetic solenoid, a piezoelectric actuator or another mechanism for actuating the needle valve. When the needle valve is actuated, the pressurized fuel sprays out through an orifice in the valve seat and into the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">One technique that has been used in preheating fuel is to inductively heat metallic elements comprising the fuel injector with a time-varying magnetic field. Exemplary fuel injectors having induction heating are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,677,468, U.S. Patent Application No's: 20070235569, 20070235086, 20070221874, 20070221761 and 20070221747, the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. The energy is converted to heat inside a component suitable in geometry and material to be heated by the hysteretic and eddy-current losses that are induced by the time-varying magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The inductive fuel heater is useful not only in solving the above-described problems associated with gasoline systems, but is also useful in pre-heating ethanol grade fuels to accomplish successful starting without a redundant gasoline fuel system.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Because the induction heating technique uses a time-varying magnetic field, the system includes electronics for providing an appropriate high frequency alternating current to an induction coil in the fuel injector.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Conventional induction heating is accomplished with hard-switching of power, or switching when both voltage and current are non-zero in the switching device. Typically, switching is done at a frequency near the natural resonant frequency of a resonator, or tank circuit. The resonator includes an inductor and capacitor that are selected and optimized to resonate at a frequency suitable to maximize energy coupling into the heated component.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The natural resonant frequency of a tank circuit is fr=1/(2&#x3c0;&#x221a;{square root over (LC)}), where L is the circuit inductance and C is the circuit capacitance. The peak voltage at resonance is limited by the energy losses of the inductor and capacitor, or decreased quality factor, Q, of the circuit. Hard-switching can be accomplished with what are called half-bridge or full-bridge circuits, comprising a pair or two pairs of semiconductor switches, respectively. Hard-switching of power results in the negative consequences of switching noise, and high amplitude current pulses at resonant frequency from the voltage supply, or harmonics thereof. Also, hard switching dissipates power during the linear turn-on and turn-off period when the switching device is neither fully conducting nor fully insulating. The higher the frequency of a hard-switched circuit, the greater the switching losses.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The preferred heater circuit therefore provides a method of driving a heated fuel injector wherein switching is done at the lowest possible interrupted power. This heater circuit was disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,628,340, Title: Constant Current Zero-Voltage Switching Induction Heater Driver for Variable Spray Injection. Ideally, energy should be replenished to the tank circuit when either the voltage or the current in the switching device is zero. It is known that the electromagnetic noise is lower during zero-voltage or zero-current switching, and is lowest during zero-voltage switching, this is the method of U.S. Pat. No. 7,628,340. It is also known that the switching device dissipates the least power under zero switching. That ideal switching point occurs twice per cycle when the sine wave crosses zero and reverses polarity; i.e., when the sine wave crosses zero in a first direction from positive to negative, and when the sine wave crosses zero in a second direction from negative to positive.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Given the above heater driver implementation, as well as any power oscillator, there remains a possible problem, which is the oscillator failing to oscillate, due to a load impedance from the induction heating coil that is too low, or due to a supply voltage to the heater driver that is too low, or due to a transient interruption of the oscillation from some other source. When the oscillator fails to oscillate, the consequence is a failure to inductively heat and possible damage due to excessive current in a component of the power oscillator. The latter may be addressed with a current limit or fault shutdown. But the oscillator still failed to oscillate and inductively heat. An additional oscillator may be used to start the power oscillator upon diagnostic detection. But it does not prevent or utilize the excessive fault current condition inherently, nor does it synchronize the normal current with the fault current to better enable oscillation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It would advance the state of the art, therefore, to detect the failure to oscillate, start&#x2014;or restart&#x2014;the oscillator as is appropriate, and synchronize the oscillator start&#x2014;or restart&#x2014;to the excessive fault current such that the fault current is contributing to the oscillation attempt.</p>

Deviations from a full-bridge driver include that: (1) the bridge is fed from a constant-current source inductor, and (2) the load section of the conventional full bridge is replaced with the resonant tank circuit. The oscillator-synchronous inherent zero-switching topology that drives the gates of the complimentary pairs of transistors in alternating sequence of diagonal pairs is a further deviation from a conventional full-bridge.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Ideally, energy should be replenished to the tank circuit when either the voltage or the current in the switching device is zero. The electromagnetic noise is lower during zero-voltage or zero-current switching and is lowest during zero-voltage switching. The switching device dissipates the least power under zero switching. That ideal switching point occurs twice per cycle when the sine wave crosses zero and reverses polarity; i.e., when the sine wave crosses zero in a first direction from positive to negative, and when the sine wave crosses zero in a second direction from negative to positive. The energy replenishment is enabled by semiconductor switches and the zero-voltage switching is synchronized with the resonance of the oscillator tank circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Embodiments of the invention provide for a means of detecting an excessive current condition, and using that confirmation as an indicator of oscillator stalling and concurrently as an input state to help decide which of the oscillator power switching devices are the current-carrying devices and therefore reverse their state. The integrated functions of the reference oscillator will be an example oscillator that is disclosed in 2011E00364US as a synchronous full-bridge power oscillator heater driver and that will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which is a simplified representation of the oscillator circuit with many of the basic components not shown for clarity.

Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b> are enhancement-type N-MOSFET (N-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) switches that alternatively connect tank resonator, C tank and L<b>3</b>, circuit to ground and, when each is turned on in the respective state, enables current to flow through induction heater coil and ground. Q<b>5</b> and Q<b>6</b> are enhancement-type P-MOSFET (P-channel Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor) switches that alternatively connect tank resonator, C tank and L<b>3</b>, circuit to the voltage supply sourced through L<b>2</b>, and with Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b> in the appropriate state, enable current to flow through induction heater coil.

<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The zero-switching power oscillator circuit should be self-starting in oscillation, but may be forced into oscillation by selectively sequencing the switching of Q<b>3</b>-Q<b>6</b> in a full-reversing H-bridge strategy. The embodiment of this invention takes advantage of this for this type of oscillator. The complimentary pairs, or here, the pairs of transistors that are flowing current between the MOSFET &#x2018;drain&#x2019; and &#x2018;source&#x2019; at the same time are Q<b>6</b> and Q<b>3</b> or Q<b>5</b> and Q<b>4</b>. It is not desirable to have Q<b>3</b> flowing current when Q<b>5</b> flows current, and likewise, it is not desirable to have Q<b>4</b> flowing current when Q<b>6</b> flows current. When Q<b>5</b> is flowing current, current passes through the induction heater coil L<b>3</b> and then through Q<b>4</b> to ground. When Q<b>6</b> is flowing current, current passes through the induction heater coil L<b>3</b> in the reverse direction as when Q<b>5</b> was flowing current, and then through Q<b>3</b> to ground, this is &#x2018;full-reversal&#x2019; of current.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A MOSFET is a device that has a threshold for an amount of Coulomb charge into the gate, which is drain-source current-dependent. Satisfying the charge threshold enhances the device into an &#x2018;on&#x2019; state. First and second gate resistors R<b>10</b>, R<b>11</b> supply the gate charging current to first and second legs of the H-bridge. R<b>10</b> supplies current to gates of Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>5</b>, R<b>11</b> supplies current to the gates of Q<b>4</b> and Q<b>6</b>, respectively, and R<b>10</b>, R<b>11</b> limit the current flowing into first and second gate diodes D<b>4</b>, D<b>5</b>, respectively. Q<b>5</b> and Q<b>6</b>, P-MOSFET conduct between drain and source when source is more positive than gate. Q<b>3</b> and Q<b>4</b>, N-MOSFET conduct between drain and source when source is more negative than gate.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The loading caused by the resistive and hysteretic loss of the heated component reflects back as a loss in the resonant tank circuit. That loss is replenished by current flowing from a current source inductor L<b>2</b> to the top bridge transistors, Q<b>5</b> and Q<b>6</b>. Depending on the state of reversal of the H-bridge in which the current flows, the current will flow either through Q<b>5</b> or Q<b>6</b> and then through induction heater coil L<b>3</b>. L<b>2</b> supplies current to the tank circuit from the energy stored in its magnetic field. That energy is replenished from the supply voltage as a current that constantly flows into L<b>2</b> during operation of the synchronous full-bridge power oscillator. L<b>2</b> also provides transient separation of tank circuit from voltage source such that the tank voltage may be instantaneously higher than the source voltage during oscillation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If current is flowing through Q<b>5</b>, as determined by the polarity of the sine wave half-cycle at that time, then the conduction to ground from Q<b>4</b> drain-to-source is pulling charge out of the gate of Q<b>5</b> and Q<b>3</b> through forward biased D<b>4</b>. Q<b>3</b> is also now not conducting and does not pull the gate charge out of Q<b>6</b> and Q<b>4</b> to ground through D<b>5</b>. Meanwhile R<b>10</b> draws current from the supply voltage. But the IxR voltage drop across R<b>10</b> cannot charge the gate of Q<b>5</b> and Q<b>3</b> with the gate shunted to ground by conduction through Q<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the sine wave crosses zero, then Q<b>4</b> becomes reverse biased across the switching junction and forward biased across the internal intrinsic diode and therefore conducts current through the internal intrinsic diode to reverse-bias D<b>4</b>. D<b>4</b> stops conducting current away from the Q<b>5</b> and Q<b>3</b> gate, and R<b>10</b> can charge the gate of Q<b>5</b> and Q<b>3</b>, which then stops conduction in Q<b>5</b> and starts conduction in Q<b>3</b> to begin conducting current for the continuing sine half-cycle. Q<b>3</b> also pulls the gate charge out of Q<b>6</b> and Q<b>4</b> to ground through the now forward biased D<b>5</b> and holds Q<b>4</b> in a non-conducting state which continues to allow R<b>10</b> to enhance Q<b>3</b>. And Q<b>6</b> conducts.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">That process repeats as the sine wave alternates polarity, crossing zero in a first direction from negative to positive, and then in a second direction from positive to negative. This generates full-reversal of current in L<b>3</b>, the induction heater coil. Current continues to be replenished in the tank circuit from L<b>2</b>. An IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor) device can replace the N-MOSFET in this embodiment if the intrinsic diode of the N-MOSFET is represented by the addition of an external diode across the drain and source of the IGBT. This summarizes the reference oscillator operation.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The remaining functions of the embodiment described in this specification, including embodiments of the invention disclosed herein, will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. Ancillary components, which may be included around the synchronous full-bridge power oscillator in accordance with embodiments of the invention, will now be described. R<b>14</b> is an &#x201c;unbalancing&#x201d; resistor of relatively small value to help initiate oscillation at start-up. If all components matched perfectly with perfect symmetry and stray impedances, and there was no random thermal noise, the oscillator may not begin oscillation at all. Zener or avalanche diodes D<b>2</b>, D<b>3</b>, D<b>6</b>, D<b>7</b>, D<b>11</b>, D<b>12</b>, and additionally on incoming supply voltage, D<b>14</b>, provide for overvoltage protection and voltage limiting for the protection of the gate structures of the power switching devices and also the control electronics. Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are utilized as control switches for the control interface to the oscillator power switches. C<b>34</b> and C<b>35</b> synchronizing gates of Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> to power oscillator when Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are not actively utilized for control. Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> are used to force state changes of power switches Q<b>4</b>, Q<b>6</b> and Q<b>3</b>, Q<b>5</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Additional ancillary components include U<b>0</b>, C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, L<b>1</b>, and D<b>1</b>, comprising a 5 Volt DC supply for control electronics. Decoupling and noise capacitors are distributed throughout the circuit and include C<b>4</b>, C<b>5</b>, C<b>6</b>, C<b>7</b>, C<b>8</b>, C<b>9</b>, C<b>10</b>, C<b>11</b>, C<b>13</b>, C<b>15</b>, C<b>16</b>, C<b>17</b>, C<b>18</b>, C<b>19</b>, C<b>24</b>, C<b>25</b>, C<b>26</b>, C<b>28</b>, and C<b>29</b>. R<b>2</b> and R<b>7</b> ensure unconnected state at external junctions J<b>1</b> and J<b>3</b>, respectively, do not turn on heater driver unintentionally. Inverting Schmidt-trigger U<b>3</b>, pin-set <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, along with LED, &#x2018;Light-Emitting Diode&#x2019; and resistor combinations R<b>5</b> with D<b>21</b> and R<b>4</b> with D<b>22</b> provide for visual fault indication. As will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art, other suitable ancillary components may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In accordance with embodiments of the invention, a temperature control of the load within L<b>3</b> is enabled as a function of variation in the power oscillator tank frequency, here, the variable spray fuel injector containing L<b>3</b>, as a magnetic characteristic of the load changes as a function of temperature. In various embodiments, temperature control may include an interrogation of the tank frequency from the parameter, such as the time varying gate charge of one or more of the oscillator power switches. Such a method of utilizing gate charge to determine tank frequency has been previously disclosed, referenced as U.S. Published Application Number: 20100288755, &#x201c;Frequency to Voltage Converter Using Gate Voltage Sampling of Power Oscillator&#x201d;, and is hereby included in its entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In accordance with embodiments of the invention, gate voltage is sampled, as a threshold compared to a reference at comparator or operational-amplifier inputs of U<b>1</b>, pin-set <b>1</b>,<b>2</b>,<b>3</b>, which generates pulse edges synchronous with power oscillator frequency. These pulse edges are buffered and noise filtered utilizing Schmidt-trigger hysteresis by series of inverting gates U<b>3</b>, pin-sets <b>1</b>,<b>2</b> and <b>3</b>,<b>4</b>. The pulse edges are then utilized as clock pulse inputs to flip-flop U<b>5</b>, pin-set <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>. R<b>28</b> and R<b>29</b> with C<b>27</b> and R<b>27</b> comprise an R&#xd7;C timing circuit with D<b>13</b> around flip-flop to create a pulse of pre-determined width with a voltage pre-determined by logic voltage that generates a packet of charge through R<b>30</b> which charges C<b>20</b> to a voltage that is now a function of tank frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The voltage as a function of tank frequency is presented to a differential error amplifier or error comparator U<b>2</b>, pin-set <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>. Error is determined as the difference from a reference pre-determined by a voltage, here, from resistive divider R<b>34</b>, R<b>35</b>, R<b>36</b>. Some PID servo function, or &#x201c;Proportional, Integral and Derivative&#x201d;, is provided by the differential error amplifier, with C<b>21</b> providing derivative compensation, C<b>22</b> and C<b>23</b> providing integral compensation and global proportional gain determined by ratio of R<b>31</b> and R<b>32</b>, here provided R<b>33</b>=R<b>31</b> and R<b>37</b>=R<b>32</b>. R<b>38</b> and C<b>23</b> integrate the error between target voltage reference and voltage as a function of tank frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">This error is compared to a triangle wave of pre-determined frequency at comparator or operational-amplifier U<b>1</b>, pin-set <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>. This generates a PWM, or &#x201c;Pulse-Width Modulated&#x201d; signal ultimately utilized to regulate power of oscillator as a function of temperature-determined tank frequency. Triangle wave is generated by triangle wave generator comprised of U<b>1</b> pin-sets <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> and <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, <b>14</b>, along with R<b>39</b>, R<b>40</b>, R<b>41</b>, R<b>42</b>, with frequency set by R&#xd7;C timer formed with R<b>43</b> and C<b>12</b>. Range of triangle generator waveform excursion is selected to allow PWM signal to vary between 0% and 100% power duty-cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In accordance with embodiments of the invention, the excessive current condition in the power switches is determined by comparison of a voltage, representing current level, to a threshold at comparator or operational amplifier U<b>2</b>, pin-set <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>. The voltage representing a current level is obtained as an IxR drop across a current sense resistor, comprised of resistors R<b>8</b> and R<b>9</b> in parallel. The threshold compared with the current level is determined from a voltage proportional to power oscillator supply voltage, here, comprising voltage divider R<b>16</b> and R<b>17</b>, with D<b>9</b> providing a maximum limit to current threshold reference voltage level as a function of the forward-biased diode drop voltage. It is desirable to have the threshold level vary with supply voltage as the current in the current sense resistor is also a function of supply voltage, therefore, the change in current as a function of oscillator status should be separated from a change in current as a function of supply voltage. The threshold level as a function of supply voltage is selected such that the current builds at a rate in L<b>3</b> that if it reaches an excessive level results in a time constant proportional to a frequency lower than the normal operating frequency of the power oscillator. As such, once the power oscillator is oscillating, the current level will be less than the excessive current threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When an excessive current condition exists, the output of U<b>2</b>, pin-set <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, goes to a logic &#x2018;LOW&#x2019; state, presented to inverting Schmidt-trigger U<b>3</b>, pin-set <b>13</b>, <b>12</b>, now presents a logic &#x2018;HI&#x2019; state to inputs of AND gates U<b>4</b>, pin-sets <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, and <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b>. The voltage from power switch gates is provided as a logic input to the AND gates as well, here, from R<b>12</b> and R<b>13</b>. When the logic condition of AND is satisfied, the output of the respective gate turns on either Q<b>1</b> or Q<b>2</b>, depending on which power switch gates are charged during the excessive current condition. Q<b>1</b> or Q<b>2</b> then deplete charge of the respective sequence of power switches that are carrying the excessive current.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">What has been described is a method that determines an excessive current condition, determines the contributing complimentary pair of oscillator power switches, and changes their state such that excessive current condition is interrupted. Concurrently, when one complimentary pair has a state change, this causes a state change of the other complimentary pair of power switches, now building current again in L<b>3</b> but fully-reversed. Current again is monitored by the current-sense resistor, and a determination is again made for excessive current condition. This cycle continues alternatively until the oscillator functions normally, at which point the frequency should increase such that excessive current is no longer obtained in either complimentary pair of power switches, and Q<b>1</b> and Q<b>2</b> synchronize themselves to the power oscillator, and both AND gates U<b>4</b>, pin-sets <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>10</b> have outputs in the &#x2018;LOW&#x2019; logic state.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">If an excessive current condition persists for numerous cycles, the logic state at inverting Schmidt-trigger U<b>2</b>, pin-set <b>12</b>, <b>13</b>, remains &#x2018;HI&#x2019; for a duty-cycle sufficient to charge C<b>14</b>, through R<b>18</b> and D<b>10</b>, greater than the discharge rate through R<b>19</b>. This results in the voltage on C<b>14</b> reaching the logic threshold &#x2018;HI&#x2019; input state on inverting Schmidt-trigger U<b>3</b>, pin-set <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>. The inverting state now presents a logic &#x2018;LOW&#x2019; to the input of inverting Schmidt-trigger U<b>3</b>, pin-set <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>, which results in a logic &#x2018;HI&#x2019; at reset pin of flip-flop U<b>5</b>, pin-set <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, which serves as a resettable fault latch. Additionally, as determined by a NTC, or &#x2018;Negative Temperature Coefficient&#x2019; device, R<b>21</b>, forming a divider with R<b>20</b>, an over-temperature condition would also set a logic &#x2018;LOW&#x2019; at inverting Schmidt-trigger U<b>3</b>, pin-set <b>8</b>, <b>9</b>. Reset of fault is provided at J<b>3</b>, through R<b>6</b>. Fault condition logic state is presented to J<b>2</b> through R<b>3</b>. Fault latch provides appropriate logic state, combined with logic state of J<b>1</b> &#x201c;Heater Enable&#x201d; at AND gate U<b>1</b>, pin-set <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, to satisfy logic condition at AND gate U<b>4</b>, pin-set <b>1</b>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, such that PWM signal from U<b>1</b>, pin-set <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, passes to control switch Q<b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Control switch Q<b>9</b>, in the configuration of &#x2018;high-side&#x2019; power regulation of the example embodiment, disclosed separately, ultimately determines the average voltage at L<b>2</b> and thereby controls the power to the power oscillator as a function of power oscillator frequency. Q<b>9</b> pulls charge out of P-MOSFET Q<b>8</b> through D<b>16</b> to allow current to flow between source and drain of Q<b>8</b> to L<b>2</b>. To minimize switching losses of Q<b>8</b> during turn-off, Q<b>7</b> bipolar transistor with Baker circuit comprised of D<b>17</b>, D<b>18</b> and D<b>19</b>, enable faster charging of Q<b>8</b> from supply voltage. Q<b>9</b> also turns off Q<b>7</b> through Baker circuit and D<b>15</b>. Q<b>7</b> is turned on by current through R<b>44</b> and Baker circuit. R<b>45</b> allows gate of Q<b>8</b> to reach substantially full supply voltage and avoid diode drop voltage differential across junction of Q<b>7</b>.</p>
