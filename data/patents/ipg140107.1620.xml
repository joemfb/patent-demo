<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-131948, which was filed on Jun. 1, 2009, the disclosure of which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a gaming machine which is executable a rescue process in which a payout, bonus, or the like is awarded in response to a predetermined game repeat count or lost game repeat count, and a gaming method of the gaming machine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional slot machine is arranged so that, when a player inserts a game value such as a coin and bill into an insertion slot of the slot machine and pushes a spin button, plural symbols are scroll-displayed in a display mounted on a front of a cabinet and each of the symbols is then stopped automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In such slot machine, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,604,999 B2, U.S. Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 2002065124A1, or U.S. Laid-Open Patent Publication No. 20040053676A1 for example, when the symbols stopped on a winning line constitute a predetermined combination, a predetermined number of game values is paid out. This slot machine is arranged so that a player first of all determines the number of game values to be inserted and runs a game after inserting the game values into the insertion slot of the slot machine, and receives the payout of game values when a predetermined combination (winning combination) is achieved or loses the inserted game values when the player lose the game.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Whichever the reels are stopped in response to the operation of the stop button or each reel is automatically stopped at a random timing, the ratio (payout rate) of accumulated game values obtained by previous winnings to the number of game values inserted into the insertion slot of the slot machine prior to the start of each game becomes more or less constant as many games are repeatedly played in the slot machine. For the reason above, the frequency of winning with which a lot of game values are paid out only by achieving a single winning and with which a benefit game (bonus game) in which a winning is achievable quite easily is generally arranged to occur for example once in 100 games, in consideration of the payout rate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Because the frequency of winning is determined in consideration of probability as above, in some cases the great winning occurs twice in 100 games and in other cases the great winning does not occur in 200 or 300 games. When no winning is achieved after playing a lot of games, the player keeps losing the game values and hence he/she may lose interest in continuing the games.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To solve this problem of the loss of interest in the games, slot machines which are arranged so that the player does not lose interest in games even if the number of game values decreases have been developed. Such slot machines are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,178,390, U.S. Pat. No. 5,820,459, U.S. Pat. No. 6,695,697, U.S. Pat. No. 6,254,483, U.S. Pat. No. 5,611,730, U.S. Pat.

The slot machines disclosed in these documents have a rescue process function with which a payout or bonus is awarded in response to a predetermined game repeat count or lost game repeat count.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described above, it has been desirable for slot machines to have various rescue process functions to keep the players not to lose expectation on payout and bonus.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An objective of the present invention is to provide a gaming machine which is able to keep a player not to lose expectation by means of a rescue process function and a playing method thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention provides a gaming machine having the following structure.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Namely, the gaming machine includes a symbol display device which rearranges plural symbols, and a controller programmed to execute the following steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">(a1) on condition that a game value is bet, running a base game in which the symbols are rearranged on the symbol display device and a base payout is awarded according to the rearranged symbols;</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">(a2) on condition that the symbols are rearranged in a predetermined condition in the base game, running a bonus game in which the symbols are rearranged with a condition (e.g. the number of free games or wild symbols is increased) in which a payout rate is higher than that of the base game and a bonus payout is awarded according to the rearranged symbols;</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">(a3) making an insurance bet by using at least a part of the bonus payout awarded in the bonus game;</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">(a4) if the insurance bet has been made, determining whether a rescue start condition (e.g. when the base game is excessively repeated or when the total amount of obtained payout is excessively small) is established; and</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">(a5) if the rescue start condition has been established, performing a rescue process (e.g. the number of free games or wild symbols is increased or an insurance payout is awarded).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the arrangement above, a bonus game is run when the symbols are rearranged in a predetermined condition in the base game. When a bonus payout is awarded as a result of the bonus game, an insurance bet is made by using at least a part of the bonus payout, with the result that a rescue process automatically becomes executable without letting the player notice the operation of the insurance bet. Thereafter, the running of the base game and bonus game is continued, and the rescue process is executed when the rescue start condition is established. In this way, even if the base game or the like is repeated while the rescue start condition is not established, it is possible to let the player continue the game with the expectation of the rescue process.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention may be arranged so that, in the step (a2), a free game which does not require the betting of the game value is run as the bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the arrangement above, a bonus game is run by a free game and hence it is unnecessary to bet a game value during the bonus game. Therefore the present invention allows the player to easily recognize that the bonus game is being run and to easily recognize that the payout rate in the bonus game is higher than that of the base game.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention may be arranged so that, in the step (a3), the least bonus payout among bonus payouts awarded according to the symbols in the bonus game is used.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to this arrangement, it is possible to prevent a problem such that, when an insurance bet is made by using a bonus payout, i.e. when an insurance bet is collected from a bonus payout, the insurance bet cannot be made because of the shortage of the bonus payout.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention may be arranged so that, in the step (a2), the bonus payout according to the symbols is awarded at once after the bonus game ends.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to this arrangement, an awarded bonus payout is often large when the bonus payout is awarded at once after the end of the bonus game. In this case, the player does not easily notice the reduction from a bonus payout because a bonus payout is still large even after an insurance bet is collected therefrom. By the present invention, therefore, the player does not easily notice that an insurance bet is made by using a bonus payout.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The present invention may be arranged so that, in the step (a4), whether the rescue start condition has been established is determined according to whether the number of repetition of the base game has reached a predetermined number.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to this arrangement, the number of repetition of the base game is used as the rescue start condition and hence it is possible to remove a major reason of the player's loss of interest in the game after the repetition of the base game.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The present invention may be arranged so that, in the step (a5), a free game which does not require the betting of the game value is run as the rescue process.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to this arrangement, the running of a free game in the rescue process causes the player to easily recognize that the rescue process is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The present invention may be arranged so that, in the step (a5), the free game is run with a game repeat count corresponding to an average bet amount until the rescue process is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to this arrangement, a game repeat count of a free game is changeable in accordance with an average bet amount. It is therefore possible to adjust the number of repetition of a free game in the rescue process so that a large gain is awarded to a player having a low average bet amount, i.e. a player who has lost a large amount of game values.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The present invention may be arranged so that, in the step (a5), the free game is run with a payout amount corresponding to an average bet amount until the rescue process is performed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to the arrangement above, an amount of payouts in a free game is changeable in accordance with an average bet amount. It is therefore possible to adjust an amount of payouts in a free game in the rescue process so that a large gain is awarded to a player having a low average bet amount, i.e. a player who has lost a large amount of game values.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The present invention provides a gaming machine having the following structure.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">(b3) making an insurance bet by using the lowest bonus payout among bonus payouts which are awarded in accordance with the symbols in the bonus game;</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">(b4) if the insurance bet has been made, determining whether a rescue start condition (e.g. when the base game is excessively repeated or when the total amount of obtained payout is excessively small) has been established according to whether the number of repetition of the base game has reached a predetermined number; and</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">(b5) if the rescue start condition has been established, performing a rescue process (e.g. the number of free games or wild symbols is increased) with at least one of game modes of a game repeat count and a payout amount corresponding to an average bet amount until the rescue process is performed.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Gaming Machine Overview</heading>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a gaming machine <b>300</b> has a slot machine <b>10</b> which collects an insurance bet from a bonus payout. This slot machine <b>10</b> in the present embodiment may be an independent slot machine <b>10</b> intended for a single player, or a slot machine <b>10</b> connected to and in communication with another slot machine <b>10</b> so that the and the other slot machines <b>10</b> as a whole enable participation of plural players as described later.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Specifically, the slot machine <b>10</b> as a gaming machine <b>300</b> includes, in a first arrangement, a symbol display device <b>16</b> which rearranges symbols <b>501</b> and a controller programmed to execute the following processes of (a1) to (a5).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In (a1), a base game, which awards a base payout according to symbols <b>501</b> rearranged on the symbol display device <b>16</b>, is run on condition that a game value is bet. In (a2), on condition that the symbols <b>501</b> are rearranged in a predetermined condition in the base game, a bonus game is run which awards a bonus payout according to the rearranged symbols <b>501</b> so that the payout rate is higher than that of the base game. In (a3), an insurance bet is made by using at least a part of the bonus payout awarded in the bonus game. In (a4), whether a rescue start condition is established is determined when the insurance bet is made. In (a5), a rescue process is carried out when the rescue start condition is established.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The symbols <b>501</b> include &#x201c;specific symbols&#x201d; <b>503</b> in addition to ordinary symbols <b>502</b>. That is, the &#x201c;symbols <b>501</b>&#x201d; is a superordinate conception of the specific symbols <b>503</b> and ordinary symbols <b>502</b>. The specific symbols <b>503</b> include a wild symbol <b>503</b><i>a </i>and a trigger symbol <b>503</b><i>b</i>. The wild symbol <b>503</b><i>a </i>is a symbol substitutable for any type of symbol <b>501</b>. Trigger symbol <b>503</b><i>b </i>is a symbol serving as a trigger for starting at least a bonus game. That is, the trigger symbol <b>503</b><i>b </i>triggers transition from the base game to the bonus game, and triggers stepwise increases in the number of specific symbols <b>503</b> at intervals from the start of the bonus game. Further, the trigger symbol <b>503</b><i>b </i>triggers increases in the number of specific symbols <b>503</b> in the bonus game, that is, the trigger symbol <b>503</b><i>b </i>triggers increases in the number of trigger symbols <b>503</b><i>b </i>and/or wild symbols <b>503</b><i>a</i>. Note that the trigger symbol <b>503</b><i>b </i>may trigger increases in the game repeat count of the bonus game in the bonus game.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The game value is a coin, bill, or valuable information corresponding to these. Note that the game value in the present invention is not particularly limited. Examples of the game value includes medals, tokens, cyber money, tickets. The ticket is not particularly limited, and a later-mentioned ticket with a barcode may be adopted for example.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The &#x201c;bonus game&#x201d; is identical with &#x201c;feature game&#x201d;. In the present embodiment, the bonus game is a game in which a free game is repeated. However, the bonus game is not particularly limited and may be any type of game, provided that the bonus game is more advantageous than the base game for a player. Another bonus game may be adopted in combination, provided that the player is given a more advantageous playing conditions than the base game. For example, the bonus game may be a game that provides a player with a chance of winning more game values than the base game or a game that provides a player with a higher chance of winning game values than the base game. Alternatively, the bonus game may be a game that consumes less number of game values than the base game. Further, the bonus game may be a game that provides a combination of these and other advantageous conditions to a player.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">A game runnable with a bet of less game values than the base game is referred to as &#x201c;free game&#x201d;. Note that &#x201c;bet of less game values&#x201d; encompasses betting of zero game value. The &#x201c;free game&#x201d; therefore may be a game runnable without a bet of game value, which awards an amount of game values according to symbols <b>501</b> having been rearranged. In other words, &#x201c;free game&#x201d; is a game which is started without the premise of consuming a game value. To the contrary, a later-mentioned &#x201c;base game&#x201d; is a game runnable on condition that a game value is bet, which awards an amount of game values according to symbols <b>501</b> rearranged. In other words, &#x201c;base game&#x201d; is a game which starts on the premise that a game value is consumed.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The expression &#x201c;rearrange&#x201d; means dismissing an arrangement of symbols <b>501</b>, and once again arranging symbols <b>501</b>. An &#x201c;arrangement&#x201d; in this specification means a state of symbols <b>501</b>, which can be visibly confirmed by a player.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The expression &#x201c;base payout according to rearranged symbols <b>501</b>&#x201d; means a base payout corresponding to a rearranged winning combination. The expression &#x201c;bonus payout according to rearranged symbols <b>501</b>&#x201d; means a bonus payout corresponding to a rearranged winning combination. The expression &#x201c;winning combination&#x201d; means that a winning is achieved. The winning combination is detailed later.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The &#x201c;condition in which the payout rate is higher than that of the base game&#x201d; is, for example, the running of a free game, increases in the number of wild symbols <b>503</b><i>a </i>and trigger symbols <b>503</b><i>b</i>, or the running of a game using a symbol table in which a symbol has been replaced with another symbol. The &#x201c;rescue start condition&#x201d; is, for example, a condition in which a base game is excessively repeated, i.e. a base game is repeated more than a predetermined number of times, or a condition in which the total number of obtained payout is excessively small, i.e. the number of base payout and bonus payout obtained after a single player repeats the game more than a predetermined number of times is not higher than a predetermined number. The &#x201c;rescue process&#x201d; is a process to rescue a player. Examples of the rescue process include the running or a free game, increases in the number of wild symbols <b>503</b><i>a </i>and trigger symbols <b>503</b><i>b</i>, the running of a game using a symbol table in which a symbol has been replaced with another symbol, and the awarding of an insurance payout.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The slot machine <b>10</b> (gaming machine <b>300</b>) having the above-described arrangements realizes a gaming method of collecting an insurance bet from a bonus payout. In other words, the slot machine <b>10</b> (gaming machine <b>300</b>) is arranged to be operable at least by a control method of collecting an insurance bet from a bonus payout.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">More specifically, the gaming method (control method) of the slot machine <b>10</b> includes the steps of: running a base game in which symbols <b>501</b> are rearranged on condition that a game value is bet and a base payout is awarded according to the rearranged symbols <b>501</b>; running a bonus game in which, when the symbols <b>501</b> are rearranged with a predetermined condition in the base game, symbols <b>501</b> are rearranged with a condition of a higher payout rate than that of the base game and a bonus payout is awarded according to the rearranged symbols <b>501</b>; making an insurance bet by using at least a part of the bonus payout awarded in the bonus game; when the insurance bet is made, determining whether a rescue start condition is established; and when the rescue start condition is established, executing a rescue process.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">With the gaming machine <b>300</b> having the first arrangement or the playing method (control method) including the above mentioned steps, a bonus game is run when symbols <b>501</b> are rearranged in a predetermined condition in a base game. When a bonus payout is awarded as a result of the bonus game, an insurance bet is made by using at least a part of the bonus payout, with the result that a rescue process automatically becomes executable without letting the player notice the operation of the insurance bet. Thereafter, the running of the base game and bonus game is continued, and the rescue process is executed when the rescue start condition is established. In this way, even if the base game or the like is repeated while the rescue start condition is not established, it is possible to let the player continue the game with the expectation of the rescue process.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The slot machine <b>10</b> may have, in addition to the first arrangement, a second arrangement in which a free game which does not require the betting of a game value is run as a bonus game in (a2). In the slot machine <b>10</b> having the second arrangement, a bonus game is run by a free game and hence it is unnecessary to bet a game value during the bonus game. Therefore the slot machine <b>10</b> allows the player to easily recognize that the bonus game is being run and to easily recognize that the payout rate in the bonus game is higher than that of the base game.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The slot machine <b>10</b> may include, in addition to the first and second arrangements, a third arrangement in which the lowest bonus payout among the bonus payouts awarded in accordance with the symbols <b>501</b> in the bonus game is used in (a3). In the slot machine <b>10</b> having the third arrangement, it is possible to prevent a problem such that, when an insurance bet is made by using a bonus bet, i.e. when an insurance bet is collected from a bonus bet, the insurance bet cannot be made because of the shortage of the bonus payout.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The slot machine <b>10</b> may have, in addition to one of the first to third arrangements, a fourth arrangement in which in (a2) a bonus payout corresponding to symbols <b>501</b> is awarded at once after the end of the bonus game. In the slot machine <b>10</b> having the fourth arrangement, an awarded bonus payout is often large when the bonus payout is awarded at once after the end of the bonus game. In this case, the player does not easily notice the reduction from a bonus payout because a bonus payout is still large even after an insurance bet is collected therefrom. By the present invention, therefore, the player does not easily notice that an insurance bet is made by using a bonus payout.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The slot machine <b>10</b> may have, in addition to one of the first to fourth arrangements, a fifth arrangement in which in (a4) whether the rescue start condition is established is determined based on whether the number of repetition of the base game reaches a predetermined number. In the slot machine <b>10</b> of the fifth arrangement, the number of repetition of the base game is used as the rescue start condition and hence it is possible to remove a major reason of the player's loss of interest in the game after the repetition of the base game.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The slot machine <b>10</b> may have, in addition to one of the first to fifth arrangements, a sixth arrangement in which in (a5) a free game which does not require the betting of a game value is run as a rescue process. According to this arrangement, the running of a free game in the rescue process causes the player to easily recognize that the rescue process is executed.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The slot machine <b>10</b> may have, in addition to one of the first to sixth arrangements, a seventh arrangement in which in (a5) a free game is run with a game repeat count corresponding to an average bet amount until the execution of the rescue process. In the slot machine <b>10</b> having the seventh arrangement, a game repeat count of a free game is changeable in accordance with an average bet amount. It is therefore possible to adjust the number of repetition of a free game in the rescue process so that a large gain is awarded to a player having a low average bet amount, i.e. a player who has lost a large amount of game values.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The slot machine <b>10</b> may have, in addition to one of the first to seventh arrangements, an eighth arrangement in which in (a5) a free game is run with a payout amount corresponding to an average bet amount until the rescue process is executed. The payout amount in this case may be an amount of game values or a payout multiplying factor by which the bet amount is multiplied. According to the arrangement above, an amount of payouts in a free game is changeable in accordance with an average bet amount. It is therefore possible to adjust an amount of payouts in a free game in the rescue process so that a large gain is awarded to a player having a low average bet amount, i.e. a player who has lost a large amount of game values.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The slot machine <b>10</b> may have, in addition to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth arrangements, at least one of the sixth and seventh arrangements.</p>

<p id="p-0128" num="0127">First, a base game is run (A<b>1</b>). Specifically, a series of the following operations are performed.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">(Coin Insertion/Start-Checking)</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">First, the gaming machine <b>300</b> checks if the bet button unit <b>601</b> is pressed by a player, and if the spin button unit <b>602</b> is pressed by the player.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">(Symbol Determination)</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Next, when the player presses the spin button unit <b>602</b>, the gaming machine <b>300</b> samples a random number for symbol determination.

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">(Symbol Display)</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Next, the gaming machine <b>300</b> starts scrolling the symbol column on the video reels, and stops the scrolling so as to present to the player the selected symbols <b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">(Winning Determination)</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">When the scrolling of the symbol columns on the video reels is stopped, the gaming machine <b>300</b> determines whether the combination of the symbols <b>501</b> presented to the player relates to a winning.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">(Payout)</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Next, when it is determined that the combination of the symbols <b>501</b> presented to the player relates to a winning, the gaming machine <b>300</b> awards a benefit to the player according to the combination of the symbols <b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">For example, when the combination of symbols <b>501</b> displayed relates to payout of coins, the gaming machine <b>300</b> pays out to the player a predetermined number of coins according to the combination of the symbols <b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Next, whether a bonus combination is formed is determined (A<b>2</b>). When a bonus combination is formed (A<b>2</b>: YES), a bonus game process is executed (A<b>3</b>) and then an insurance bet is collected from the bonus payout (A<b>4</b>). On the other hand, when no bonus combination is formed (A<b>2</b>: NO) or an insurance bet is collected from the bonus payout (A<b>4</b>), whether the rescue start condition is established is determined (A<b>5</b>). More specifically, the game repeat count unit <b>631</b> counts the number of repetition of the base game. Then the rescue game start determination unit <b>632</b> determines whether the number of repetition of the base game reaches a predetermined number.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">When the rescue start condition is not established (A<b>6</b>: NO), the step A<b>1</b> is executed again. On the other hand, when the rescue start condition is established (A<b>6</b>: YES), after the execution of the rescue process (A<b>6</b>) the step A<b>1</b> is executed again. More specifically, when the rescue start condition is established, the rescue process is executed with at least one of the game modes of game repeat count and payout amount corresponding to an average bet amount until the execution of the rescue process.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">As a result of this, when a bonus payout is awarded on account of the running of a bonus game, an insurance bet is made by using at least a part of the bonus payout. Therefore the rescue process automatically becomes executable without letting the player notice the operation of the insurance bet. Thereafter, the running of the base game and bonus game is continued, and the rescue process is executed when the rescue start condition is established. In this way, even if the base game or the like is repeated while the rescue start condition is not established, it is possible to let the player continue the game with the expectation of the rescue process.</p>

Symbols <b>501</b> forming a symbol matrix are scrolled at least when the start button <b>23</b> is pressed to start a game. The scrolling of the symbols <b>501</b> stops (symbols <b>501</b> are rearranged), when a predetermined period elapses after the start of scrolling.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Further, for each symbol <b>501</b>, various winning combinations are set beforehand. Each winning combination means a winning is achieved. A winning combination is a combination of symbols <b>501</b> stopped on the payline L, which is advantageous for a player. The wording &#x201c;advantageous&#x201d; means that: a predetermined number of coins according to the winning combination are paid out; the payout number of coins are added to the credit; a bonus game is started; or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In the present embodiment, a winning combination is a combination of symbols <b>501</b> which is rearranged on an activated payline L and includes a predetermined number of at least one of the following symbols <b>501</b>: &#x201c;WILD&#x201d;, &#x201c;FEATURE&#x201d;, &#x201c;A&#x201d;, &#x201c;Q&#x201d;, &#x201c;J&#x201d;, &#x201c;K&#x201d;, &#x201c;BAT&#x201d;, &#x201c;HAMMER&#x201d;, &#x201c;SWORD&#x201d;, &#x201c;RHINOCEROS&#x201d;, &#x201c;BUFFALO&#x201d;, and &#x201c;DEER&#x201d;. When a predetermined type of symbols <b>501</b> is set as a scatter symbol, a winning combination is regarded as to be formed if a predetermined number or more of scatter symbols are rearranged, irrespective of the activation/inactivation status of the paylines L.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Specifically, a winning combination with &#x201c;FEATURE&#x201d; (a trigger symbol <b>503</b><i>b</i>) stopped on a payline L serves as a bonus trigger and causes (i) transition of the gaming mode from the base game to the bonus game and (ii) a payout according to the bet amount. Further, when the winning combination includes a symbol <b>501</b> &#x201c;BAT&#x201d; stopped on the payline L during the base game, there is paid out an amount of coins (value) which is a product of a basic payout amount of &#x201c;BAT&#x201d; multiplied by the bet amount.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">(Base Game Symbol Table)</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a table used for determining symbols <b>501</b> to be rearranged during a base game. The base game symbol table indicates a symbol <b>501</b> on a display block <b>28</b> forming a symbol column, a code No. associated with the symbol <b>501</b>, and a number range associated with the code No. The number range is one of twenty ranges which cover 0 to 65535.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Note that the above numbers may be equally divided into twenty ranges or unequally divided into twenty ranges. The latter case enables adjustment of a winning possibility for each symbol <b>501</b> by adjusting the associated range of random numbers. Further, the range of random numbers associated with a specific symbol <b>503</b>, i.e. &#x201c;FEATURE&#x201d; serving as the trigger symbol <b>503</b><i>b </i>or &#x201c;WILD&#x201d; serving as a wild symbol <b>503</b><i>a</i>, may be narrower than ranges of random numbers associated with other symbols <b>501</b>. This allows easier adjustment of winning or losing, by adjusting the possibility of winning a valuable symbol <b>501</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">For example, when a random number randomly selected for the first column is &#x201c;10000&#x201d;, the symbol &#x201c;J&#x201d; whose code No. &#x201c;3&#x201d; is associated with a range of random numbers including &#x201c;10000&#x201d; is selected as a symbol to be rearranged in the first pseudo reel <b>151</b>. Further, for example, when a random number randomly selected for the fourth column is &#x201c;40000&#x201d;, the symbol &#x201c;FEATURE&#x201d; whose code No. &#x201c;12&#x201d; is associated with a range of random numbers including &#x201c;40000&#x201d; is selected as a symbol to be rearranged in the fourth pseudo reel <b>151</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0194" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 to 9</figref> are tables each for use at the time of determining symbols <b>501</b> to be rearranged during a bonus game. It is noted that this table may be used for a game in the rescue process. As is the base game symbol table, the bonus game symbol table contains a symbol <b>501</b> of a display block <b>28</b> of a symbol column, a code No. associated with the symbol <b>501</b>, and a number range associated with the code No. The number range covers 0 to 65535. These numbers 0 to 65535 are divided into the ranges as is the case of the base game symbol table.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">Further, the bonus game symbol table includes additional specific symbols <b>503</b> or specific symbols <b>503</b> replacing the other symbols. The wording &#x201c;replacing&#x201d; means that new symbol data is written over already existing symbol data.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The number of additional symbols or the number of symbols replacing the other symbols, or the symbol column in which the addition or replacement takes place may be randomly determined or determined beforehand.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">In the present embodiment, an increase is determined based on the additional wild symbol count determination table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and the additional trigger symbol count determination table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. When symbol data is replaced with another set of symbol data, an image based on the overwritten data (replacement data) may be displayed, in place of a symbol <b>501</b> having been stopped and displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">For example, in the bonus game symbol table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, ten wild symbols <b>503</b><i>a </i>are evenly added to symbol columns (L<b>1</b>) to (L<b>5</b>). This achieves conditions whereby a wild symbols <b>503</b><i>a </i>is more likely to be selected through random selection, in all the symbol columns (L<b>1</b>) to (L<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Further, for example, the bonus game symbol table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> with five trigger symbols <b>503</b><i>b </i>being added to at least the first symbol column (L<b>1</b>). This achieves conditions whereby a trigger symbols <b>503</b><i>b </i>is more likely to be selected through random selection, in the first symbol column (L<b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">For example, the bonus game symbol table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is the same as the table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> except in that a predetermined number of symbols are replaced with the wild symbols <b>503</b><i>a</i>. This achieves conditions whereby a wild symbol <b>503</b><i>a </i>is more likely to be selected through random selection, although odds table used is the same as that for the base game. Note that the replacement is done so that the fifth symbol column (L<b>5</b>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> only includes specific symbols <b>503</b>. A player therefore is encouraged by having a feeling that a specific symbol <b>503</b> is always selected through the random selection in the fifth symbol column (L<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">(Symbol Column Determination Table)</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a symbol column determination table used at the time of determining a symbol column, out of the symbol columns (L<b>1</b>) to (L<b>5</b>), in which addition of or replacement with the specific symbols <b>503</b> takes place. The symbol column determination table indicates a symbol column No. and a random number associated with the symbol column No. The symbol column No. <b>1</b> corresponds to the first column of the display blocks <b>28</b>; the symbol column No. <b>2</b> to the second column of the display blocks <b>28</b>; the symbol column No. <b>3</b> to the third column of the display blocks <b>28</b>; the symbol column No. <b>4</b> to the fourth column of the display blocks <b>28</b>; and the symbol column No. <b>5</b> to the fifth column of the display blocks <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">The present embodiment deals with a case where an increase in the number of specific symbols <b>503</b> or the number of specific symbols <b>503</b> to replace the other symbols is determined for each symbol column based on the random number sampled and the symbol column determination table. The present invention however is not limited to this. For example, the number of specific symbols <b>503</b> increased or substituted may be determined in advance for each symbol column. Further, an increase in the number of specific symbols <b>503</b> or the number of specific symbols <b>503</b> to replace the other symbols may be determined for each type of the specific symbols <b>503</b>. In addition to the above, when the rescue process is carried out, an increase in the number of specific symbols <b>503</b> or the number of specific symbols <b>503</b> to replace the other symbols may be larger than the number in the cases other than the rescue process.</p>

<p id="p-0211" num="0210">(Payout Table)</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a payout table for managing payout awarded based on the winning combination. This payout table is stored in the ROM <b>242</b> of the main control board <b>71</b>, and payout information (payout multiplying factor) is associated with each type of winning combination. For example, a payout multiplying factor corresponding to a winning combination including three &#x201c;A&#x201d; is &#x201c;4&#x201d;. Therefore, a payout calculated by multiplying the bet amount by 4 is awarded to the player in this case. A payout multiplying factor corresponding to a winning combination including five &#x201c;BUFFALO&#x201d; is &#x201c;100&#x201d;. Note that the payout multiplying factor for the base game is the same as that of the free game; however, the present invention is not limited to this. That is, the payout multiplying factor may be different between the base game and the free game.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">(Rescue Setting Table)</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows a rescue setting table which is provided for determining at least one of an additional rate and an added game repeat count corresponding to an average bet amount, and is used in a rescue process. This setting table is stored in the ROM <b>242</b> of the main control board <b>71</b>. The rescue setting table includes an average bet amount list, an additional rate list, and an added game repeat count list.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The average bet amount list has five number ranges from the minimum bet amount &#x201c;1&#x201d; to the maximum bet amount &#x201c;500&#x201d;. More specifically, the average bet amount list has the number ranges of &#x201c;1 to 100&#x201d;, &#x201c;101 to 200&#x201d;, &#x201c;201 to 300&#x201d;, &#x201c;301 to 400&#x201d;, and &#x201c;401 to 500&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">The additional rate list is associated with the average bet amount list. Rescue setting items of the additional rate are rates by which the above-described payout multiplying factor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is multiplied, and increase a payout awarded to the player. More specifically, the average bet amount list has number ranges of &#x201c;1.2&#x201d;, &#x201c;1.4&#x201d;, &#x201c;1.6&#x201d;, &#x201c;1.8&#x201d;, and &#x201c;2.0&#x201d;. According to the list, for example, the additional rate is &#x201c;1.4&#x201d; when the average bet amount is &#x201c;151&#x201d;, and hence the quadruple of the payout multiplying factor which corresponds to the winning combination of three &#x201c;A&#x201d; is multiplied by 1.4. Therefore, the payout awarded to the player in this case is calculated by multiplying the bet amount by 4.8. When the average bet amount is &#x201c;245&#x201d;, the additional rate is &#x201c;1.6&#x201d;. Therefore 100-fold of the payout multiplying factor which corresponds to the winning combination of five &#x201c;BUFFALO&#x201d; is multiplied by 1.6.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The added game repeat count list is associated with the average bet amount list in the same manner as the additional rate list. Rescue setting items of the added game repeat count are game repeat counts which are added to predetermined fixed game repeat count such as &#x201c;40 games&#x201d;, which are repeatedly carried out in the rescue process. More specifically, the added game repeat count list has number ranges of &#x201c;10&#x201d;, &#x201c;20&#x201d;, &#x201c;30&#x201d;, &#x201c;40&#x201d;, and &#x201c;50&#x201d;. Therefore, when for example the average bet amount is &#x201c;151&#x201d;, the added game repeat count is &#x201c;20&#x201d; and hence <b>20</b> is added to the fixed game repeat count. As a result, the player is allowed to play the free game 60 times in the rescue process.</p>

Therefore, the possibility of winning is higher. In S<b>35</b>, the main CPU <b>41</b> counts the number of each type of symbols rearranged along the same payline L in S<b>34</b>. Then, the main CPU <b>41</b> determines if there is a counted value which equals or surpasses &#x201c;2&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">If it is determined that a winning is achieved, the main CPU <b>41</b> performs a process related to coin payout (S<b>36</b>). As discussed later, the payout of each free game is stored as an accumulated payout amount, and payout of coins is carried out at once after the bonus game is finished.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">When it is determined that a winning is not achieved in S<b>35</b>, or after the process of S<b>36</b>, the main CPU <b>41</b> determines whether three or more trigger symbols <b>503</b><i>b </i>are rearranged (S<b>37</b>). In this process, whether or not three or more trigger symbols <b>503</b><i>b </i>are rearranged in the display blocks <b>28</b> is determined, without taking into consideration the paylines L. In S<b>38</b>, if it is determined that the number of trigger symbols <b>503</b><i>b </i>rearranged is three or more, then the CPU <b>41</b> executes the additional trigger symbol count determining process, adds &#x201c;1&#x201d; to the bonus game stock number (carry-over number), and displays the stock number on the bonus game stock display unit <b>413</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">Next, the main CPU <b>41</b> determines whether the remaining count (T) is &#x201c;0&#x201d;, based on the remaining game data stored in the free game count recording region of the RAM <b>43</b> (S<b>39</b>). If it is determined that the remaining game count (T) is not &#x201c;0&#x201d;, the main CPU <b>41</b> brings the process back to S<b>34</b>. On the other hand, if it is determined that the remaining game count (T) is &#x201c;0&#x201d;, the main CPU <b>41</b> proceeds to S<b>40</b> on condition that the carry-over number of the bonus game is &#x201c;0&#x201d;. If the bonus game carry-over number is not &#x201c;0&#x201d;, the bonus game is run until the carry-over number is &#x201c;0&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">When the bonus game is finished, it is then determined whether the accumulated payout amount exists (S<b>40</b>). If the accumulated payout amount does not exist (S<b>40</b>, NO), the main CPU <b>41</b> ends the routine. On the other hand, if the accumulated payout amount exists (S<b>40</b>, YES), an insurance bet is taken from the accumulated payout amount (S<b>41</b>). This insurance bet is arranged to be equal to the lowest bonus payout among the bonus payouts corresponding to the symbols <b>501</b>, which payouts may be awarded in the bonus game. This makes it possible to prevent the occurrence of a case where an insurance bet cannot be done because the bonus payout is not large enough to allow the insurance bet to be collected therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">Thereafter, the bonus payout corresponding to the accumulated payout amount is awarded at once (S<b>42</b>). As such, a bonus payout which is awarded at once after the bonus game is finished is often large. In this case, the player does not easily notice that the bonus payout is reduced because the insurance bet has been collected from the bonus payout. As a result, the insurance bet is likely to be automatically carried out by using the bonus payout, without being noticed by the player. In other words, the switching from the uninsured mode to the insured mode is likely to be automatically carried out without being noticed by the player.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Thereafter, the insurance flag is changed to the on state (S<b>43</b>), and the main CPU <b>41</b> ends the routine.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">Next, the following describes a bonus payout process, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a flowchart showing a sub routine of the bonus payout process carried out in the bonus game running process.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">When the bonus payout process is carried out, a payout multiplying factor is determined with reference to the payout table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and in accordance with the symbols <b>501</b> and the rearranged number (S<b>51</b>). Then a payout amount is calculated by multiplying the bet amount of the current free game by the payout multiplying factor (S<b>52</b>). Thereafter, the payout amount is accumulated as an accumulated payout amount, and the accumulated payout amount is paid out at once after the bonus game is finished (S<b>53</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Next, the following describes a bonus payout process, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a flowchart of a sub routine of the rescue process carried out in the base game running process.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">First, whether an insurance flag is in the on state is determined (S<b>61</b>). If the insurance flag is not in the on state (S<b>61</b>, NO), it is determined that an insurance bet has not been done, i.e. a uninsured mode has been set and the main CPU ends the routine.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">On the other hand, if the insurance flag is in the on state (S<b>61</b>, YES), it is determined that an insurance bet has been done, i.e., an insured mode has been set, and a process to counts up the total game count is carried out (S<b>62</b>). In other words, each time a base game is run, &#x201c;1&#x201d; is added to a total game count recording region. As a result, the number of repetition of the base game is obtained from the total game count. Thereafter, a process to add the total bet amount is carried out (S<b>63</b>). That is to say, each time a base game is run, a bet amount which is bet on the base game is added to a total bet amount recording region (S<b>63</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Thereafter, whether the total game count matches with the notice setting value is determined (S<b>64</b>). If matched (S<b>64</b>, YES), the color of the rescue display unit <b>417</b> is changed from blue to yellow (S<b>75</b>), and the main CPU ends the routine. This allows the player to notice that a rescue process will start soon even if s/he has continuously failed to win in the base games.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">On the other hand, if the total game count does not mach with the notice setting value (S<b>64</b>, NO), then whether the total game count matches with a rescue start value (S<b>65</b>). If not matched (S<b>65</b>, NO), the main CPU ends the routine. On the other hand, if matched (S<b>65</b>, YES), an average bet amount is calculated by subtracting the total game repeat count from the total bet amount (S<b>66</b>). Then a rescue setting item is randomly selected with reference to a rescue setting item table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. In other words, at least one of the additional rate and the added game repeat count is randomly selected (S<b>67</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Thereafter, a setting value for the rescue process is determined based on the selected rescue setting item and average bet amount. That is to say, when the selected rescue setting item is the additional rate, the additional rate is &#x201c;1.4&#x201d; if the average bet amount is &#x201c;151&#x201d;, for example. Therefore, when three &#x201c;A&#x201d; are rearranged, the quadruple of the payout multiplying factor corresponding to the winning combination is multiplied by &#x201c;1.4&#x201d;. Therefore, the setting value of the rescue process in this case is a payout multiplying factor calculated by multiplying the bet amount by 4.8.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">In the meanwhile, when the selected rescue setting item is the added game repeat count, the added game repeat count is &#x201c;20&#x201d; if the average bet amount is &#x201c;151&#x201d;, for example. As a result, the setting value of the rescue process is a game repeat count calculated by adding 20 to the fixed game repeat count.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Thereafter, a notification of rescue start is displayed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (S<b>69</b>). At the same time, the selected rescue setting item is also displayed. This allows the player to recognize that the rescue process will start and what kind of rescue process will be carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Subsequently, the color of the rescue display unit <b>417</b> is changed from yellow to red (S<b>70</b>). This allows the player to always recognize that the rescue process is in progress. Then a free game running process is carried out to repeat the free game corresponding to the setting value of the rescue process (S<b>71</b>). When the rescue process ends, the total game count is set to &#x201c;0&#x201d; (S<b>72</b>) and the insurance flag is changed to the off state to indicate the uninsured mode (S<b>73</b>). Subsequently, after the color of the rescue display unit <b>417</b> is changed from red to blue (S<b>74</b>), the main CPU ends the routine.</p>

<p id="p-0282" num="0281">(System Structure of Gaming Machine <b>300</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">The gaming machine <b>300</b> includes plural slot machines <b>10</b>, and an external controller <b>200</b> connected to the slot machines <b>10</b> via a communication line <b>301</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">The external controller <b>200</b> is for controlling the slot machines <b>10</b>. In the present embodiment, the external controller <b>200</b> is a so-called hall-server provided in a gaming facility having plural slot machines <b>10</b>. Each slot machine <b>10</b> is given a unique identification number. The external controller <b>200</b> identifies the source of data from any slot machine <b>10</b>, by referring to the identification number. The identification number is also used for designating the destination, when transmitting data from the external controller <b>200</b> to any slot machine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Note that the gaming machine <b>300</b> may be built in plural gaming facilities or a single gaming facility such as a casino where various games are provided. Further, when building the gaming machine <b>300</b> in a single gaming facility, the system of the gaming machine <b>300</b> may be built in each floor or each section of the gaming facility. The communication line <b>301</b> may be wired or wireless. For example, an exclusive line, switched line, or the like may be adopted.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">(Specific Structure of Gaming Machine <b>300</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">Next, the following describes the specific structure of the gaming machine <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the gaming machine <b>300</b> has a shared display <b>201</b>, a rail <b>271</b>, a not-shown drive motor, and the not-shown external controller <b>200</b>. The shared display <b>201</b> is connected to and in communication with the slot machines <b>10</b> each of which is a terminal device capable of running a game independently of the others. This shared display <b>201</b> displays an image related to a shared game. The rail <b>271</b> and the drive motor moves the shared display <b>201</b> to immediately above any of the slot machines <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">The external controller <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> includes a rescue setting table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> and an insurance management table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. The insurance management table is for managing the state of the insurance flag in each slot machine <b>10</b>, the state of the total frequency of betting, and the state of the total bet amount. More specifically, the table includes a machine number list, an insurance flag list, a total betting frequency list, and a total bet amount list. The machine number list stores sets of number data being unique to the respective slot machines <b>10</b>. The insurance flag list stores flag data indicating whether the insurance flag is in the on state or the off state. The total betting frequency list stores the number of repetition of a base game. The total bet amount list stores the sum total of bet amounts bet on the base game.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">The operation of the gaming machine <b>300</b> arranged as above will be described. First, each slot machine <b>10</b> executes a base game running process identical with the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. When the bonus running process starts, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, an insurance bet is collected after the bonus game ends (S<b>41</b>). After the payout is carried out at once (S<b>42</b>), an onset signal is transmitted to the external controller <b>200</b> (S<b>143</b>). It is noted that the operations in S<b>30</b> to S<b>42</b> are identical with those in the bonus running process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, in the bonus payout process of the bonus running process, after a payout amount is calculated (S<b>52</b>), an information signal indicating the payout amount is transmitted to the external controller <b>200</b> (S<b>153</b>). Thereafter, an accumulated payout amount is obtained from the information signal transmitted from the external controller <b>200</b> (S<b>154</b>). It is noted that the operations in S<b>51</b> and S<b>52</b> are identical with those in the bonus running process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, each slot machine <b>10</b> executes the rescue process when the rescue start condition is established in the base game process.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">More specifically, bet amount information is transmitted to the external controller <b>200</b> (S<b>161</b>). Then, whether displayed color information has been obtained is determined by determining whether the displayed color information has been transmitted from the external controller <b>200</b> to the slot machine <b>10</b> receiving that displayed color information (S<b>162</b>). When the displayed color information has not been obtained (S<b>162</b>, NO), the routine shifts to S<b>164</b>. On the other hand, when the displayed color information has been obtained (S<b>162</b>, YES), a process to display the rescue display unit <b>417</b> is carried out, and the rescue display unit <b>417</b> is displayed in blue for example (S<b>163</b>), and then S<b>164</b> is carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Thereafter, whether rescue setting item information to the above-described slot machine <b>10</b> has been obtained is determined (S<b>164</b>). When the rescue setting item information to the above-described slot machine <b>10</b> has not been obtained (S<b>164</b>, NO), the main CPU ends the routine. On the other hand, when the rescue setting item information to the above-described slot machine <b>10</b> has been obtained (S<b>164</b>, YES), notification of rescue start is displayed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> (S<b>165</b>). Thereafter, a free game running process is carried out as a rescue process (S<b>166</b>). After the rescue process ends, an offset signal is transmitted to the external controller <b>200</b> (S<b>117</b>). After the rescue display unit <b>417</b> is changed to blue and displayed (S<b>168</b>), the main CPU ends the routine.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">When each slot machine <b>10</b> operates as above, the external controller <b>200</b> operates as below while performing data communications with each slot machine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">First, as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>, whether bet amount information has been received from each slot machine <b>10</b> is determined (S<b>171</b>). When the bet amount information has not been received (S<b>171</b>, NO), the CPU of the external controller <b>200</b> ends the routine. On the other hand, when the bet amount information has been received (S<b>171</b>, YES), the sender of the bet amount information is specified (S<b>172</b>). Thereafter, with reference to an insurance management table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, whether the insurance flag corresponding to the machine number of the sender is in the on state is determined (S<b>173</b>). When the flag is not in the on state (S<b>173</b>, NO), the CPU of the external controller <b>200</b> ends the routine. On the other hand, when the flag is in the on state (S<b>173</b>, YES), the total game count is counted up (S<b>174</b>), and the total bet amount is added up (S<b>175</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">Thereafter, whether the total game count matches with the notice setting value is determined (S<b>176</b>). When matched (S<b>176</b>, YES), the displayed color information indicating yellow color is transmitted to the slot machine <b>10</b> which is the sender. On the other hand, when the total game count does not match with the notice setting value (S<b>176</b>, NO), whether the total game count is less than the rescue start value is determined (S<b>177</b>). When the total game count is less than the rescue start value (S<b>177</b>, YES), the CPU of the external controller <b>200</b> ends the routine.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">On the other hand, when the total game count is not less than the rescue start value (S<b>177</b>, NO), an average bet amount is calculated (S<b>178</b>) and a rescue setting item is randomly selected (S<b>179</b>). Thereafter, a setting value is determined based on the rescue setting item and the average bet amount (S<b>180</b>). It is noted that the steps (S<b>177</b> to S<b>180</b>) above are identical to S<b>65</b> to S<b>68</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>. Subsequently, after the displayed color information indicating red color is transmitted to the slot machine <b>10</b> which is the sender (S<b>182</b>), the CPU of the external controller <b>200</b> ends the routine.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">In addition to the above, the external controller <b>200</b> carries out the setting information updating process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, in parallel to the execution of the aforesaid controller insurance betting process.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, whether an onset signal is received from each slot machine <b>10</b> is determined (S<b>191</b>). If received (S<b>191</b>, YES), the slot machine <b>10</b> which is the sender of the onset signal is specified (S<b>192</b>). Thereafter, with reference to the insurance bet management table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the recording region of the insurance flag list associated with the machine number of the sender is changed to the on state (S<b>193</b>). Then the CPU of the external controller <b>200</b> ends the routine.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">On the other hand, if the onset signal has not been received (S<b>191</b>, YES), whether an offset signal has been received is determined (S<b>194</b>). If not received (S<b>194</b>, NO), the CPU of the external controller <b>200</b> ends the routine. On the other hand, if received (S<b>194</b>, YES), the receiver of the offset signal is specified (S<b>195</b>). Thereafter, with reference to the insurance bet management table shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the recording region of the total game count list associated with the machine number of the sender is set to &#x201c;0&#x201d; (S<b>196</b>). Subsequently, after the recording region of the insurance flag list associated with the machine number of the sender is changed to the off state (S<b>196</b>), the CPU of the external controller <b>200</b> ends the routine.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">The embodiments 1 and 2 deal with cases where the number of payline L is 25; however, the number of paylines is not limited in the present invention. For example, the number of paylines may be 30.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">The embodiments 1 and 2 deal with cases where winning of bonus is achieved when three or more trigger symbols are rearranged. However, winning of bonus is not limited to this. For example, winning of bonus may be achieved when a predetermined time has elapsed since the last bonus game has ended.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">Further, in the present embodiment, the free game is a game in which displaying of symbols on display blocks <b>28</b> are varied and stopped, and then a payout amount is determined according to the symbols having stopped or a combination of the stopped symbols (i.e. a game normally run in a slot machine). However, the free game of the present invention is not limited to this, and the free game may be different from a game run in a slot machine. Examples of the free game include: a card game such as poker, a shooting game, a fighting game, or the like. The free game may be a game that awards a game medium or a game awarding no game medium. Further, the following is also possible. Namely, a free game is run on condition that the number of base games counted during the insured mode reaches a predetermined number. Then, when the number of base games counted during the insured mode once again reaches a predetermined number, a free game which is different from the previous free game is run. The free game in the present invention may be suitably designed, and is not particularly limited, as long as the free game requires no bet of a game medium.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">The above embodiments 1 and 2 thus described solely serve as specific examples of the present invention, and the present invention is not limited to such an example.
