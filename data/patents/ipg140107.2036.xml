<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed to operation of a fluid purification system, including operational control systems and methods, safety systems and methods, temperature control systems and methods, power control systems and methods, fluid pumping systems and methods, and air filtration and fluid removal systems and methods. In particular, the fluid purification operational systems and methods are directed to systems and methods that control and provide safe operation of a fluid purification system in various environments.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Fluid purification apparatuses, systems and methods with which the present fluid purification operational apparatuses, systems and methods may be used are disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 11/948,210 and 11/948,256. It is believed that certain of those fluid purification apparatuses, systems and methods would benefit from improved operational and control systems and methods.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Fluid purification apparatuses, systems and methods sometimes operate in extreme conditions or under varying circumstances. For example, certain fluid purification apparatuses and systems operate in vehicles and are subject to extreme cold temperatures. Thus, it is believed that there is a need for apparatuses, systems and methods of maintaining fluid purification operation in cold temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Other fluid purification apparatuses and systems operate in vehicles that would be better served by fluid purification apparatuses and systems that include circuitry for safe operation. Thus, it is believed that there is a need for devices, systems and methods that provide for safe operation of fluid purification apparatuses in various applications.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Pressure restricting devices are sometimes used in fluid purification apparatuses and systems. For example, in fluid purification apparatuses that separate and remove water from the fluid, pressure is frequently reduced to introduce the fluid into an evaporator chamber through which air is circulated. Such pressure restricting devices may reduce pressure at the outlet of the fluid purification apparatus to an undesirable extent. Thus, it is believed that there is a need for apparatuses, systems and methods of pumping fluid from a fluid purification apparatus and for applying energy acquired from a pressurized fluid entering a fluid purification apparatus to fluid leaving the fluid purification apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Fluid purification apparatuses, systems and methods also sometimes operate in systems using fluid storage tanks, such as hydraulic fluid tanks, and those fluid storage tanks are sometimes vented to the atmosphere. Accordingly, it is believed that there is a need for improved devices, systems and methods for treating atmospheric gases entering or leaving such a fluid storage tank.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is directed to systems, methods and apparatuses for purifying fluids. In accordance with one embodiment of the present fluid purification invention, there is provided a fluid purification apparatus, having a filter chamber, an evaporator chamber, a bypass valve, and a level sensor. The evaporation chamber is positioned adjacent the filter chamber, and has a cavity to receive fluid. The bypass valve has a first port coupled to one of the fluid purification apparatus filter chamber and the evaporator chamber, a second port for coupling to a fluid inlet line to the fluid purification apparatus, and a third port for coupling to a fluid outlet line from the fluid purification apparatus. The level sensor is disposed in the evaporator chamber cavity and coupled to actuate the bypass valve so as to position the bypass valve to prevent fluid flow through the evaporator chamber when the level of fluid in the evaporator chamber is not appropriate for operation of the evaporator chamber and to position the bypass valve for flow through the evaporator chamber when the level of fluid in the evaporator chamber is appropriate for operation of the evaporator chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another embodiment, a fluid purification apparatus includes a filter chamber, an evaporator chamber positioned adjacent the filter chamber, the evaporator chamber having a cavity to receive fluid, a pre-heater disposed on one of the filter chamber, the evaporator chamber, and a fluid inlet line conducting fluid to the fluid purification apparatus, and a level sensor disposed in the evaporator chamber cavity and coupled to energize the pre-heater when the level of fluid in the evaporator chamber is not appropriate for operation of the evaporator chamber and de-energize the pre-heater when the level of fluid in the evaporator chamber is appropriate for operation of the evaporator chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In yet another embodiment, a method of preventing an evaporator chamber of a fluid purification apparatus from flooding with fluid is provided. The method includes sensing a level of a fluid in the evaporator chamber and actuating at least one of a pre-heater and a bypass valve if the level of the fluid in the evaporator chamber is above a desired level.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present filtration apparatuses and methods provide advantages that may include improved fluid flow from a pressure reducing filtration apparatus in a pressurized fluid system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, the present invention provides solutions to the shortcomings of prior filtration apparatuses, systems, and methods. Those of ordinary skill in fluid purification will readily appreciate that those details described above and other details, features, and advantages of the present invention will become further apparent in the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of an embodiment of a fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>. The fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> includes a filter chamber <b>102</b>, an evaporator chamber <b>104</b>, and a filter base <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The filter chamber <b>102</b> includes a filter cavity <b>110</b> and a filter canister <b>112</b>. A filter or filter media <b>156</b> may be placed in the filter cavity, for example, by unscrewing the filter canister <b>112</b> from the base <b>105</b>, placing the filter media <b>156</b> in the filter canister <b>112</b>, and screwing the filter canister <b>112</b> back in place on the base <b>105</b>. The filter chamber <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further includes a perforated tube <b>114</b>, having perforations <b>115</b>. The perforated tube <b>114</b> is situated to pass through a central cylindrical opening in the filter media <b>156</b>, such that fluid may flow into the filter chamber <b>102</b>, through the filter media <b>156</b>, into the perforated tube <b>114</b> and pass from the perforated tube <b>114</b> into the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> through an inner-chamber opening <b>111</b>. In one embodiment, the filter chamber <b>102</b> is a particulate filter chamber and functions to remove particulates from the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The evaporator chamber <b>104</b> includes a heater wiring inlet <b>134</b>, a heater <b>130</b>, an evaporation tube <b>132</b>, an evaporator gas inlet <b>129</b>, and an evaporator gas outlet <b>126</b>. A level sensor <b>210</b>, such as a float switch or other level sensor, and a temperature sensor <b>214</b>, such as a high temperature switch or other temperature sensor, may be disposed in a cavity <b>103</b> of the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> or positioned near the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the evaporation tube <b>132</b> is fitted around the heater <b>130</b> and fluid passes from the filter chamber <b>102</b> into the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> through a fluid heating channel <b>136</b> formed between the heater <b>130</b> and an inner surface <b>138</b> of the evaporation tube <b>132</b>. The heated fluid flows out from the evaporator end <b>147</b> of the evaporation tube <b>132</b> after it passes through the fluid heating channel <b>136</b>. The heated fluid then passes over an outer surface <b>140</b> of the evaporation tube <b>132</b> and into the evaporation chamber <b>104</b> where certain volatiles of the heated fluid, such as water and uncombusted fuel, turn to a gas and are vented from the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> through the evaporator gas outlet <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The evaporation tube <b>132</b> may be in contact with the divider <b>116</b> and may furthermore be attached to the divider <b>116</b> or formed with the divider <b>116</b>. The evaporation tube <b>132</b> may also be shaped with a conically shaped outer surface <b>140</b> that is pinched <b>141</b> near where the evaporation tube <b>132</b> meets the divider <b>116</b>. Fluid passing out of the fluid heating channel <b>136</b> may flow along the outer surface <b>140</b> of the evaporation tube <b>132</b> into a fluid reservoir <b>152</b> in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The base <b>105</b> includes the divider <b>116</b> that at least partially separates the filter chamber <b>102</b> from the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>. The base <b>105</b> may also include a circular wall <b>118</b> that extends from the divider <b>116</b> to at least partially enclose the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>. An evaporator chamber cap <b>120</b> may be attached to the base <b>105</b> to cover and provide access to the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>. The evaporator chamber cap <b>120</b> may be attached to the base <b>105</b> as desired and may, for example, be attached by way of screws extending through holes <b>119</b> in the evaporator chamber cap <b>120</b> and threaded into threaded holes <b>121</b> formed in the circular wall <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A threaded circular portion <b>122</b> may also extend from the divider <b>116</b> portion of the base <b>105</b>, opposite the circular wall <b>118</b>, for attachment of the filter canister <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a high temperature switch <b>214</b> is located on the base <b>105</b> of the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>. The high temperature switch <b>214</b> may alternately be located in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> or elsewhere so as to sense the temperature of the fluid in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> or the temperature in the vicinity of the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>. The high temperature switch <b>214</b> may be wired directly to the heater <b>130</b> power to de-energize the heater <b>130</b> when the temperature sensed by the high temperature switch <b>214</b> rises above the set point of the high temperature switch <b>214</b>. Alternately, any type of temperature sensor coupled to a controller or relay to control operation of the heater <b>130</b> may comprise or be included with the high temperature switch <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Also in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a pre-heater <b>204</b> is wrapped around the base <b>105</b> or the filter canister <b>112</b> to warm the fluid in cold conditions. The pre-heater <b>204</b> may alternately or in addition be located so as to warm fluid prior to the fluid entering the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes an inlet <b>106</b> leading to the filter chamber <b>102</b> and an outlet <b>108</b> leading from the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>. A pump <b>206</b>, a bypass valve <b>208</b>, and a pressure sensor <b>212</b> are shown adjacent to the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> near the inlet <b>106</b> and outlet <b>108</b>. One or more of those components <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>, and <b>212</b> may alternately be incorporated into the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> or installed in a fluid inlet line <b>146</b> or an fluid outlet line <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> may be used in various applications including filtration of lubricants in engines of various types and in pressurized fluid applications such as hydraulic fluid system. Oil, hydraulic fluid, or another fluid may pass through the filter chamber <b>102</b> and the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> in series and in either order or may pass through the filter chamber <b>102</b> or the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> individually or in parallel.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a control circuit <b>200</b> for an embodiment of a fluid purification apparatus control system. The control circuit <b>200</b> shows the evaporator chamber heater <b>130</b>, the pre-heater <b>204</b>, the pump <b>206</b>, and the bypass valve <b>208</b> controlled by the level sensor <b>210</b>, the pressure sensor <b>212</b>, the temperature switch <b>214</b>, a pump relay <b>216</b>, an evaporator relay <b>218</b>, and a filter heater relay <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, power is provided to the control circuit <b>200</b> when the system to which the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> is coupled is in operation. For example, if the fluid purification system is coupled to a vehicle started by a key, power that is energized when the key is turned to the on position may also power the control circuit <b>200</b>. Alternately, the control circuit <b>200</b> may be energized by power from a desired circuit of the system to which the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> is coupled or through a sensor, such as a system pressure sensor <b>213</b>, which may be a pressure switch or sensor/controller arrangement that indicates the fluid is under pressure and, from that, the system using the fluid is in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Where the control circuit <b>200</b> is energized by a system pressure sensor <b>213</b>, that system pressure sensor <b>213</b> may be located anywhere pressure is applied to the fluid under normal system operation, such as for example, in a fluid line near a system fluid pump (not shown) or near the inlet <b>106</b> of the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, a fluid purification apparatus or system includes a fluid purification apparatus, such as the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and an electrical circuit, such as the control circuit <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In such an embodiment, it may be desirable to energize the control circuit <b>200</b> only when a system served by the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> is in operation. For example, when the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> is operating on oil in an engine, it may be desirable to operate the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> only when the engine is running. Alternately, when the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> is serving a hydraulic fluid system, it may be desirable to operate the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> only when the hydraulic fluid system is operating. To accomplish fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> operation only when the system served by the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> is operating, system power that is on only when the system served by the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> is operating may be used to power the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>. Alternately, a sensor that senses operation of the system served by the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> may be used to energize the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> through its control circuit <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an embodiment, the system pressure sensor <b>213</b> is used to sense operation of the system served by the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> and energize and de-energize the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> through its control circuit <b>200</b>. The system pressure sensor <b>213</b> in the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is disposed to sense pressure of fluid adjacent the inlet <b>106</b> of the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> and is coupled, by wiring for example, to de-energize the control circuit <b>200</b> when pressure of the fluid is below a desired level and to energize the control circuit <b>200</b> when pressure of the fluid is above the desired level. The system pressure sensor <b>213</b> may have a switch to control operation of the control circuit <b>200</b> or may be of the sensor controller type and may operate one or more relays, such as relays <b>216</b>, <b>218</b>, and <b>220</b> where appropriate. The system pressure sensor <b>213</b> may furthermore operate using hysteresis and may have a fixed or adjustable set point.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the heater <b>130</b> warms fluid in an evaporator chamber of a fluid purification apparatus, such as the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> of the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The heater <b>130</b> warms the fluid so as to cause volatiles such as water in the fluid to evaporate so that, once separated, the volatiles may be removed from the fluid. If overheating occurs, however, the fluid may be damaged or degraded. Therefore, the temperature switch <b>214</b> is incorporated into the control system circuit <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to de-energize the heater <b>130</b> if the temperature in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> exceeds the set point of the temperature switch <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment, a bi-metal temperature controller, such as a thermostatic temperature controller, is used as the temperature switch <b>214</b> to de-energize the heater <b>130</b> if the fluid becomes too warm. The temperature controller type temperature switch <b>214</b> may have a temperature sensitive element, such as the bi-metal element, placed near the heated fluid and may have a contact that controls operation of the heater <b>130</b> directly or through a relay such as the evaporator relay <b>218</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In an embodiment where the temperature switch <b>214</b> includes an electrical contact rated for the voltage and current powering the heater <b>130</b>, the contact may be actuated by the temperature sensitive element dependent on the temperature of the element and wired in series with the heater <b>130</b>. In an embodiment, the temperature switch <b>214</b> includes a set point adjustment to adjust the temperature at which the contact opens and closes. In another embodiment, the temperature controller type temperature switch <b>214</b> has a fixed set point at which the contact opens and closes.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The temperature switch <b>214</b> may operate using hysteresis such that the temperature switch <b>214</b> contact opens at one temperature and closes at a lower temperature. For example, in an embodiment, the temperature switch <b>214</b> contact opens when the temperature exceeds 980 Celsius and closes when the temperature drops back below 950 Celsius.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The element of the temperature switch <b>214</b> may be placed in direct contact with the fluid, for example in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>. Alternately, the element of the temperature switch <b>214</b> may be placed proximate to the fluid, such as by use of a well (not shown), or by gluing or otherwise securing the temperature switch <b>214</b> adjacent the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> in a position that is indicative of the temperature of the fluid. The element may furthermore be incorporated into the temperature switch <b>214</b> or may be attached thereto rigidly or flexibly.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It may be desirable, in some embodiments, to have fluid flowing through a fluid purification system, such as the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when an evaporator heater, such as the heater <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is energized. An indication that fluid is flowing through the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> may be sensed in various ways, including use of a flow sensor or switch in fluid communication with the fluid flowing through the fluid purification system. alternately, a pressure sensor or switch in fluid communication with the fluid flowing through the fluid purification system may be used to indicate fluid is flowing through the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a pressure sensor <b>212</b>, which may be a pressure switch or another device, is used to sense fluid flow through the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>. The pressure sensor <b>212</b> may be located at the inlet <b>106</b> of the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>, at the outlet <b>108</b> of the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>, inside the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>, or otherwise in fluid communication with fluid flowing through the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>. The pressure sensor <b>212</b> may be set such that a contact in the pressure sensor <b>212</b> is open when fluid pressure is below a set point, which may be a desired level, and the contact is closed when fluid pressure is above the set point. In that way, the heater <b>130</b> is de-energized when the pressure sensor <b>212</b> contact is open, and the heater <b>130</b> is energized when the pressure sensor <b>212</b> contact is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Either pressure sensor <b>212</b> or <b>213</b> may operate using hysteresis such that the pressure sensor <b>212</b> or <b>213</b> contact opens at one pressure and closes at a slightly different pressure. For example, in an embodiment, the contact of one of the pressure sensors <b>212</b> or <b>213</b> closes when the pressure exceeds 5 psi and opens when the pressure drops back below 4.5 psi.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the pressure sensor <b>212</b> or other pressure sensor controller arrangement is disposed in fluid communication with fluid flowing through the filter chamber <b>102</b> and the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>. The pressure sensor <b>212</b> is in that fluid communication such that the pressure sensor senses the pressure of the fluid at some location within or adjacent to the filter chamber <b>102</b> or evaporator chamber <b>104</b>, such as in the inlet <b>106</b> of the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>. For example, in an embodiment as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the pressure sensor <b>212</b> senses pressure in the inlet <b>106</b> of the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>, where the fluid flows from the inlet <b>106</b>, through the filter chamber <b>102</b>, through the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>, and out of the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> at the outlet <b>108</b>. That pressure sensor <b>212</b> is wired to the heater <b>130</b> through the filter heater relay <b>220</b> to energize the heater <b>130</b> when the fluid pressure at the inlet <b>106</b> is above a desired level and de-energize the heater <b>130</b> when the fluid pressure at the inlet is below the desired level. It may be noted that other devices, which may be referred to as safety devices, such as the temperature switch <b>214</b>, may be wired with the pressure sensor <b>212</b> to prevent operation of the heater <b>130</b> when operating conditions are not appropriate for operation of the heater <b>130</b>. Such operating conditions may include low flow or high temperature conditions, and/or other undesirable operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one embodiment, the pressure sensor is further wired to de-energize all electrical components of the fluid purification apparatus. The pressure sensor may de-energize all the electrical components when fluid is not fluid is not flowing through the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As may be seen in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pressure sensor <b>212</b> and temperature switch <b>214</b> may be wired in series to energize the evaporator relay <b>218</b> when unit operational power is applied, the pressure is above the set point of the pressure sensor <b>212</b>, and the temperature is lower than the set point of the temperature switch <b>214</b>. When the evaporator relay <b>218</b> is energized, a contact on the evaporator relay <b>218</b> is closed and the heater <b>130</b> is energized. Thus, the heater <b>130</b> in this embodiment is energized when the unit is powered on, the temperature in or near the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> is below a temperature whereby the fluid may be damaged or degraded, and fluid is flowing through the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The level sensor <b>210</b>, such as a float switch or other level sensor/controller, may be situated in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The level sensor <b>210</b> may be actuated to permit fluid flow into the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> when fluid level in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> is appropriate for operation. For example, in an embodiment, when the fluid level is at or below a high level limit, the level sensor <b>210</b> may be actuated to permit fluid flow through the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>. Alternately, the level sensor may actuate the bypass valve <b>208</b> when the fluid level in the evaporator chamber is not appropriate for operation of the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>. For example, in an embodiment, it may not be appropriate to operate the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> when the fluid level in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> rises above the high level limit of the level sensor <b>210</b> and, thus, the level sensor <b>210</b> may actuate the bypass valve <b>208</b> to bypass fluid flow around the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an embodiment of a large scale hydraulic fluid application, the level sensor <b>210</b> may permit flow into the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> when the fluid level in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> is not more than half full and stop fluid flow into the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> when the fluid level in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> is more than half full.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">It has been discovered that when the fluid temperature is particularly low, for example, when hydraulic fluid is less than 25&#xb0; Celsius, the fluid tends not to flow out of the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> well and, therefore, to accumulate in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, actuation of the level sensor <b>210</b> when the fluid level is below the high limit level closes an electrical contact associated with the level sensor <b>210</b>, thereby energizing the filter heater relay <b>220</b> using power supplied only when the system using the fluid is in operation. The filter heater relay <b>220</b>, in turn, controls operation of the pre-heater <b>204</b> and the bypass valve <b>208</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The pre-heater <b>204</b> may be used to warm fluid being purified before the fluid enters the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>.

Such a flexible heat tape type heater may be wrapped around the filter canister <b>112</b>, the inlet line leading to the filter chamber <b>102</b>, or elsewhere as desired. Alternately, another type of heater may be provided to warm the fluid before it enters the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When the fluid level in the evaporator chamber rises above the level that actuates the level sensor <b>210</b>, the pre-heater <b>204</b> is energized to warm fluid in the filter chamber <b>102</b>. It should be noted that the pre-heater <b>204</b> may alternately be placed on the evaporation chamber <b>104</b>, the fluid inlet line <b>146</b>, or elsewhere to heat the fluid at any desired location.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An embodiment of the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> includes a filter chamber <b>102</b> and an evaporator chamber <b>104</b> positioned adjacent the filter chamber <b>102</b>.

The pre-heater <b>204</b> is disposed on the filter chamber <b>102</b>, the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>, or the fluid inlet line <b>146</b> conducting fluid to the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>. The level sensor <b>210</b> is disposed in the evaporator chamber cavity <b>103</b> and coupled to energize the pre-heater <b>204</b> when the level of fluid in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> is not appropriate for operation of the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> and de-energize the pre-heater <b>204</b> when the level of fluid in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> is appropriate for operation of the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>. In one embodiment, the fluid level in the evaporator chamber <b>104</b> is appropriate for operation of the evaporator chamber <b>104</b>, and the level sensor <b>210</b> will therefore energize the pre-heater <b>204</b>, when the fluid level is above a predetermined level.</p>

The bypass valve <b>208</b> may furthermore be normally open to the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b> in its de-energized state or normally open to the fluid inlet line <b>146</b> in its de-energized state, as desired for failsafe operation or another reason.</p>

In another embodiment, the first port <b>243</b> of the bypass valve <b>208</b> is the common port and is coupled to the fluid outlet line <b>148</b> of the fluid purification apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>

Hydraulic systems frequently incorporate a hydraulic tank <b>402</b> to hold excess hydraulic fluid not currently in use in the hydraulic system <b>404</b>. Typically, hydraulic fluid is drawn from the hydraulic tank <b>402</b> by a hydraulic system <b>404</b> when the hydraulic system <b>404</b> requires additional fluid and excess hydraulic fluid is returned to the hydraulic tank <b>402</b> when not in use in the hydraulic system <b>404</b>. The hydraulic tank <b>402</b> includes a breather <b>406</b> to permit air to enter the hydraulic tank <b>402</b> to fill space left empty when hydraulic fluid is removed from the hydraulic tank <b>402</b> and to permit air to escape from the hydraulic tank <b>402</b> when it is displaced by hydraulic fluid returning to the hydraulic tank <b>402</b>. It is believed, however, that air carries undesirable particles and materials into the hydraulic tank <b>402</b> each time air enters the hydraulic tank <b>402</b>. Accordingly, a filter is provided at the breather <b>406</b> of the hydraulic tank <b>402</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the filter is a desiccant type filter <b>420</b> that dries air entering the hydraulic tank <b>402</b> by removing water from that air. Any of the various types of desiccant filters known may be used in this application, including multiple cartridge desiccant dryers and self-drying desiccant filters. It has been discovered that hydraulic fluid damages certain types of commercially available desiccant material and it is recognized that only the air entering the hydraulic tank <b>402</b> need be dried to protect the hydraulic fluid in the hydraulic tank <b>402</b>. Therefore, a system of check valves has been devised to direct air leaving the hydraulic tank <b>402</b> directly to the atmosphere and to direct air entering the hydraulic tank through the desiccant filter <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The check valve system includes a tee <b>410</b> with a first branch <b>412</b> coupled to the breather <b>406</b> of the hydraulic tank <b>402</b>, a second branch <b>414</b> coupled to a desiccant filter <b>420</b>, and a third branch <b>416</b> venting to the atmosphere. A first check valve <b>422</b> is coupled between the second branch <b>414</b> of the tee <b>410</b> and the desiccant filter <b>420</b> such that the first check valve <b>422</b> permits air flow from the desiccant filter <b>420</b> to the hydraulic tank <b>402</b>.
