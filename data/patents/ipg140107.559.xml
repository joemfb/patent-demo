<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In recent years, attention has been focused on plasma display panels and liquid crystal display panels, as display devices suitable for reduction in thickness and upsizing. These display panels (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;panels&#x201d;) are constituted by two flat-plate shaped glass substrates attached to each other through a bonding material with a desired spacing provided therebetween, wherein these glass substrates have display element components such as electrodes, dielectric materials, ribs, light emission components and color filters which are held thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, conventionally, defective components created during panel fabrication processing and sold panels which have been used have been subjected to disposal processing such as landfills. However, regeneration and reuse of panels have been social challenges, due to an increase of public opinions for global environmental protection, such as effective utilization, regeneration, reuse and saving of resources, as well as a lack of landfill grounds.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In view of the aforementioned circumstances, there have been increasingly stepped up developments for reuse of glass plates, which are main components of panels. In order to reuse glass plates, it is necessary to cut the attached portions of the glass plates attached to each other for separating the two glass plates from each other, in order to remove the display element components on the glass plates. At present, such disassembling operations have been manually performed using tools such as glass cutting cutters or vibration cutters. Further, there are techniques for cutting glass plates, as disclosed in the following Patent Documents.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0091">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the present glass-substrate disassembling system includes a first glass-substrate disassembling apparatus <b>100</b><i>a </i>(referred to as a &#x201c;first disassembling apparatus&#x201d;), a second glass-substrate disassembling apparatus <b>100</b><i>b </i>(referred to as a &#x201c;second disassembling apparatus&#x201d;), and a rotation unit <b>10</b><i>a </i>positioned therebetween. The first and second disassembling apparatuses <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b </i>include diamond wheel cutters <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>(hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;cutters&#x201d;) as a cutting unit <b>5</b> for cutting the panel <b>1</b> at predetermined portions. The cutter <b>5</b><i>a </i>(namely, a first cutting unit) in the first disassembling apparatus <b>100</b><i>a </i>and the cutter <b>5</b><i>b </i>(namely, a second cutting unit) in the second disassembling apparatus <b>100</b><i>b </i>can be cutters having the same functions, but they are desirably structured to cut different lengths in the panel <b>1</b>. This is because the lengths of the sides of the panel <b>1</b> cut by the cutter <b>5</b><i>a </i>are different from the lengths of the sides of the panel <b>1</b> cut by the cutter <b>5</b><i>b</i>. In the present specification, in cases where there is no need for particularly distinguishing the cutter <b>5</b><i>a </i>and the cutter <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the cutters <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b </i>are comprehensively referred to as cutters <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0092">Further, the first and second disassembling apparatuses <b>100</b><i>a </i>and <b>100</b><i>b </i>include a transfer unit <b>6</b> for transferring the panel <b>1</b> in two directions, which are a forward direction <b>30</b><i>a </i>and a rearward direction <b>30</b><i>b</i>, along a transfer path, thereby transferring the panel <b>1</b> in horizontal directions over the upper surface of the present disassembling apparatus. The panel <b>1</b> being transferred by the transfer unit <b>6</b> is temporarily stopped and fixed at predetermined positions, namely stop positions, when it is cut at predetermined portions by the cutters <b>5</b><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>. In order to fix the panel <b>1</b>, the present apparatus includes a forward stopper <b>8</b> (namely, a first stopping unit) and a rearward stopper <b>9</b> (namely, a second stopping unit) as a unit for stopping the panel, and a base table as a glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> (namely, a fixing unit) for fixing the panel. The operations of both the stoppers <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> and the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> will be later described in detail. The forward and rearward stoppers <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> are moved upwardly through holes provided in the transfer unit <b>6</b>, so that their upper end portions are protruded upwardly beyond the transfer unit <b>6</b> and come into contact with the panel <b>1</b> being transferred. The forward and rearward stoppers <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> are rod-shaped members having rigidity enough not to deform on receiving impulses from the panel <b>1</b> at the time of the contact. Although there are illustrated only the upper end portions of the forward and rearward stoppers <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> in the figure, the forward and rearward stoppers <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> extend downwardly and are held at their lower portions which are not illustrated such that they are movable upwardly and downwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0093">The glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> is constituted by a plurality of members placed in interstices in the transfer unit <b>6</b> and elongated in the direction of transfer of the panel <b>1</b>, and members coupling these plurality of members. The glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> is held, such that it is movable upwardly and downwardly through the interstices in the transfer unit <b>6</b>. The glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> can be moved upward to a height where an upper end portion thereof protrudes beyond the transfer unit <b>6</b>. The glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> can be made of any material having rigidity capable of holding the panel <b>1</b> without deforming.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0094">In the figure, the rotation unit <b>10</b><i>a </i>is placed at a center portion of the transfer path for the panel <b>1</b>, namely downstream of the first disassembling apparatus <b>100</b><i>a </i>in the forward direction and upstream of the second disassembling apparatus <b>100</b><i>b </i>in the forward direction. The rotation unit <b>10</b><i>a </i>is for rotating, by 90 degrees, the orientation of the panel <b>1</b> transferred thereto by the transfer unit <b>6</b> in the horizontal direction. The rotation unit <b>10</b><i>a </i>includes, for example, a plurality of spherical-shaped free rollers and rotates the orientation of the panel <b>1</b> by 90 degrees about an axis perpendicular to the panel <b>1</b> while holding the panel <b>1</b> with the upper surface of the rotation unit <b>10</b><i>a</i>. This enables cutting the uncut two sides of the panel <b>1</b> with the cutter <b>5</b><i>b </i>in the second disassembling apparatus <b>100</b><i>b </i>placed on the subsequent transfer path.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0095">Hereinafter, with reference to schematic views in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref> and flow charts illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, there will be described operations of the glass-substrate disassembling system according to the present embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0096">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, if the panel <b>1</b> is brought in and placed on the transfer unit <b>6</b> in the present apparatus, the transfer unit <b>6</b> transfers the panel <b>1</b> in the forward direction (step S<b>101</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In this case, the term &#x201c;forward direction&#x201d; refers to the rightward direction in the figure, while the term &#x201c;rearward direction&#x201d; refers to the leftward direction in the figure.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0097">Next, the forward stopper <b>8</b> in the present apparatus is lifted to take an attitude capable of coming into contact with the panel <b>1</b> being transferred in the forward direction, namely a contact attitude. Namely, if the panel <b>1</b> is transferred, before the frontmost portion of the panel <b>1</b> passes above the forward stopper <b>8</b>, the forward stopper <b>8</b> is lifted to take the contact attitude (step S<b>102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In this state, the panel <b>1</b> is further transferred in the forward direction (step S<b>103</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), then comes into contact with the forward stopper <b>8</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> and stops at this position, namely a first stop position (step S<b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0098">After the panel <b>1</b> is stopped by the forward stopper <b>8</b>, the base table as the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> starts ascending (step S<b>105</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, since the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> ascends, the panel <b>1</b> separates from the transfer unit <b>6</b> and is secured to the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> due to its own weight, at a state where its frontmost portion is kept in contact with the forward stopper <b>8</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0099">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a frontmost single side of the panel <b>1</b> is cut by the cutters <b>5</b> as the cutting unit <b>5</b> (step S<b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The portion of the panel <b>1</b> to be cut is determined by the interval between the cutters <b>5</b> and the forward stopper <b>8</b>. In this case, the interval is set, such that the panel is cut at an inner portion with respect to the bonding member <b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>) coupling the first glass flat plate <b>2</b> and the second glass flat plate <b>3</b> to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0100">After the completion of the cutting of the single side of the panel <b>1</b>, the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> holding the cut single side of the panel <b>1</b> is moved horizontally in the forward direction (step S<b>107</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, since the movement of the panel <b>1</b> is restricted by the forward stopper <b>8</b> in the forward direction, even when the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> is moved in the forward direction, the panel <b>1</b> is prevented from moving together therewith, so that a cut piece <b>11</b> loses the foothold and falls downward (step S<b>108</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0101">Thereafter, the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> and the forward stopper <b>8</b> descend below the transfer unit <b>6</b> to take a state capable of further transferring the panel <b>1</b>, namely an open attitude (step S<b>109</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), and the panel <b>1</b> is further transferred in the forward direction (step S<b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0102">Since the panel <b>1</b> is transferred in the forward direction, the rearmost portion of the panel <b>1</b> passes above the rearward stopper <b>9</b> and, thereafter, the rearward stopper <b>9</b> is lifted to take an attitude in which its upper end portion is protruded upwardly beyond the transfer unit <b>6</b>, namely a contact attitude (step S<b>111</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Next, the direction of transfer by the transfer unit <b>6</b> is reversed for transferring the panel <b>1</b> in the rearward direction (step S<b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The panel <b>1</b> transferred in the rearward direction comes into contact with the rearward stopper <b>9</b> which has been lifted as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> and stops at this position, namely a second stop position (step S<b>113</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0103">After the panel <b>1</b> is stopped by the rearward stopper <b>9</b>, similarly to the aforementioned step S<b>105</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> starts ascending (step S<b>114</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), which separates the panel <b>1</b> from the transfer unit <b>6</b> and secures the panel <b>1</b> to the base table <b>7</b> at a state where the rearmost portion of the panel <b>1</b> is kept in contact with the rearward stopper <b>9</b>. Similarly to the aforementioned step S<b>106</b>, the rearmost single side of the panel <b>1</b> is cut by the cutters <b>5</b> as the cutting unit (step S<b>115</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In this step, similarly, the panel <b>1</b> is cut at an inner portion with respect to the bonding member <b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>) applied to the rearmost single side of the panel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0104">Similarly to the aforementioned steps S<b>107</b> to S<b>110</b>, the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> holding the cut single side of the panel <b>1</b> is moved horizontally in the rearward direction (step S<b>116</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) so that the cut piece falls downwardly (step S<b>117</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), and, then, the base table <b>7</b> and the rearward stopper <b>9</b> descend below the transfer unit <b>6</b>, thereby taking an open attitude (step S<b>118</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Then, the panel <b>1</b> is transferred in the forward direction (step S<b>119</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0105">Next, the panel <b>1</b> is transferred to the rotation unit <b>10</b><i>a</i>. The panel <b>1</b> transferred thereto is rotated in the horizontal direction by 90 degrees through the plurality of free rollers placed on the upper surface of the rotation unit <b>10</b><i>a </i>(step S<b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Due to this rotation, the cut sides of the panel <b>1</b> become parallel to the direction of transfer, while the uncut two sides of the panel <b>1</b> appear at the front and rear sides in the direction of transfer. After the completion of the rotation, the rotation unit <b>10</b><i>a </i>transfers the panel <b>1</b> in the forward direction and, subsequently, the transfer unit <b>6</b> starts transferring the panel <b>1</b> in the forward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0106">Thereafter, similarly to steps S<b>102</b> to S<b>119</b>, the uncut two sides of the panel <b>1</b> are cut at inner portions with respect to the bonding member <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), at a state where the panel <b>1</b> is fixed at stop positions, namely a third stop position and a fourth stop position (steps S<b>121</b> to S<b>138</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). However, the length of the sides of the panel <b>1</b> which should be cut in steps S<b>125</b> and S<b>134</b>, in general, is different from the length of the sides of the panel <b>1</b> which have been cut in steps S<b>106</b> and S<b>115</b>. Therefore, the glass cutting apparatus <b>100</b><i>b </i>used in steps S<b>125</b> and S<b>134</b> is structured to be suitable for cutting the panel <b>1</b> by a length different from the length by which the panel <b>1</b> is cut by the glass cutting apparatus <b>100</b><i>a </i>used in steps S<b>106</b> and S<b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0107">The first glass flat plate <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the second glass flat plate <b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the panel <b>1</b> which has been cut at portions coated with the bonding member <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the aforementioned steps are brought into a state where there is no member bonding them to each other. An operator disassembles the panel <b>1</b> at this state into the glass flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> (step S<b>139</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), then removes the pixel electrodes and the fluorescent material applied thereto (step S<b>140</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and then transfers both the flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> into glass recycling processing to recycle the glass (step S<b>141</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0108">In the present embodiment, the cutting unit <b>5</b> is constituted by the diamond wheel cutters <b>5</b>. Alternately, the cutting unit <b>5</b> can be constituted by, for example, vibration blades, energized wires, a water jet and sandblasting which are types of jet processing, laser cutting, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0109">In the present embodiment, the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> is constituted by the base table <b>7</b> which holds the panel <b>1</b> thereon. Alternately, the glass-plate holding unit can be a panel pressing unit <b>12</b> for pressing the panel <b>1</b> from thereabove, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. By employing such panel pressing unit <b>12</b> as the glass-plate holding unit, it is possible to eliminate the necessity of steps S<b>107</b>, S<b>116</b>, S<b>126</b> and S<b>135</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>. The steps where the base table ascends (steps S<b>105</b>, S<b>114</b>, S<b>124</b> and S<b>133</b>) should be replaced with steps where the panel pressing unit <b>12</b> descends. Further, the steps where the base table and the stoppers descend (the steps S<b>109</b>, S<b>118</b>, S<b>128</b> and S<b>137</b>) should be replaced with steps where the panel pressing unit ascends and the stoppers descend.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0110">In the present embodiment, a plurality of spherical-shaped free rollers as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref> are employed, as the unit for rotating the panel <b>1</b>. Alternately, the unit for rotating the panel <b>1</b> can be constituted by a substantially-L-shaped component <b>10</b><i>b </i>which supports the panel <b>1</b> and is adapted to rotate the panel <b>1</b> when being rotated by 90 degrees, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Also, for example, the unit for rotating the panel <b>1</b> can be constituted by a rotation unit <b>10</b><i>c </i>which is adapted to rotate the panel <b>1</b> by 90 degrees while sucking the surface of the panel <b>1</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Also, it is possible to rotate, by 90 degrees, the panel <b>1</b> at a state where it is slightly floated, by providing a unit that ejects air to the lower surface of the panel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0111">Alternately, instead of providing the rotation unit, the transfer path in the present apparatus can be formed to have a substantially L shape for inclining, by 90 degrees, the direction of transfer for the panel <b>1</b>, thereby offering similar effects to those offered by rotating the panel <b>1</b> by 90 degrees with respect to the direction of transfer. In this case, there is no need for providing the unit for rotating the panel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0112">In the present embodiment, the base table <b>7</b> holding the cut piece <b>11</b> is moved in the lateral direction for dropping the cut piece <b>11</b> (refer to steps S<b>107</b> and S<b>116</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and steps S<b>126</b> and S<b>135</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). However, as the method for dropping the cut piece, instead of laterally moving the base table, it is possible to fold the portion of the base table <b>7</b> on which the cut piece <b>11</b> is placed, with respect to the base table <b>7</b>, for dropping the cut piece <b>11</b>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0113">In the present embodiment, the plasma display panel <b>1</b> is employed as a laminated glass. However, the laminated glass is not limited to a plasma display panel and can be a liquid crystal display panel or a field emission display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0114">In the present embodiment, there have been described the structures and operations relating to glass flat-plate disassembling processing which is a part of processing to recycle a display panel including two glass flat plates opposing to each other. In the present embodiment, it is possible to stop the panel at predetermined positions by bringing it into contact with the stoppers. Further, at this state, it is possible to cut the panel, remove the cut piece, then rotate the panel and cut the other sides thereof similarly, thereby mechanically disassembling the panel into two glass flat plates. This can offer advantages of excellent safety for operators and a possibility of disassembling the panel into the first glass flat plate and the second glass flat plate with higher efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0076" num="0115">In the present embodiment, there will be described a glass cutting apparatus capable of splitting a laminated glass or a hollow glass with a larger plate thickness, in a short period of time, without inducing glass particles, flaws caused by horizontal cracks, and chips in the cut surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view illustrating main parts of an exemplary structure of the glass cutting apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 to 17</figref> are views illustrating a glass cutting method according to the present invention, by exemplifying a case of employing the glass cutting apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0117">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a laminated glass <b>1</b> is constituted by two glass flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> opposing to each other, and a bonding member <b>4</b> bonding these glass flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> to each other. The bonding member <b>4</b> is made of a flit glass, or an epoxy resin adhesive agent. The glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> (namely, the fixing unit) is a flat table for fixing the laminated glass <b>1</b>. A pair of wheel cutters <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>are cut-line forming units for writing cut lines on the surface and the back surface of the laminated glass <b>1</b> at the same time and are installed oppositely to each other. Pressing units <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b </i>press the respective the cut-line forming units <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>against the laminated glass <b>1</b>. A vibration unit <b>15</b> vibrates the laminated glass <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0118">The glass material can be any generally well-known glass material such as soda-lime glass, clear glass, silica glass, non-alkali heat resistance glass or high-strain-point glass. The laminated glass <b>1</b> according to the present embodiment is a hollow glass constituted by the glass flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> bonded to each other through the bonding member <b>4</b> with a spacing interposed therebetween, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, but it can be a laminated glass bonded over its entire surface through a bonding material with no gap provided therein. Among them, a hollow glass having a spacing with a size in the range of several micrometers to several hundreds micrometers, such as a display panel, is preferable, since sizes of glass particles or glass chips induced at the time of cutting it are several micrometers or less, which prevents the glass surfaces from being damaged by glass particles or glass chips.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0119">The wheel cutters <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>can be any generally well-known wheel cutters, such as super hard alloy wheels or diamond wheels which are generally well known. Among them, super hard alloy wheels are preferable, since they are capable of creating uniform vertical cracks in glasses when they form cut lines therein.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0120">The glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> is for fixing the laminated glass <b>1</b> when it is being cut. When the laminated glass <b>1</b> can be fixed only through its own weight, the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> can be a flat table as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, for example. However, when the laminated glass <b>1</b> cannot be fixed only through its own weight, the laminated glass <b>1</b> is fixed by being sandwiched by pressing plates or a vise. Further, as a matter of cause, when the laminated glass <b>1</b> is fixed by being sandwiched, the laminated glass <b>1</b> can be fixed such that flat surfaces thereof are vertically placed.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0121">The vibration unit <b>15</b> can be constituted by an electric vibrator, a pneumatic vibrator or a piezoelectric vibrator. The vibration conditions under which the laminated glass <b>1</b> is vibrated, such as the amplitude, the vibration frequency, the vibration intensity and the vibration time of the vibration unit <b>15</b>, are varied according to the aspect of the laminated glass <b>1</b>, the aspect of the cut lines and the like. Accordingly, the vibration unit <b>15</b> is provided with a vibration control unit, in order to change the vibration conditions. Next, there will be described an exemplary cutting method in a case where a laminated glass is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0122">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 to 17</figref>, there will be described operations for cutting down the laminated glass <b>1</b> to which the bonding member <b>4</b> is bonded. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the laminated glass <b>1</b> is placed on the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b>, and the pair of wheel cutters <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>are brought into press-contact with the laminated glass <b>1</b> while being loaded by the pressing units <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0123">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, the wheel cutters <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>being loaded are moved while being kept in press-contact with the laminated glass <b>1</b>, so that desired cut lines <b>16</b> are written thereon. At this time, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> which is a top view of the glass cutting apparatus, the cut lines <b>16</b> are written in the upward and downward directions in the paper plane, at a position spaced apart by a distance l from the end portion E closer to the bonding member <b>4</b>. This induces cracks (referred to as vertical cracks) <b>17</b> just beneath the cut lines <b>16</b>, in the vertical direction, namely in the glass-thickwise direction. The depth of the vertical cracks <b>17</b> is increased proportionally with the loads on the wheel cutters <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, as the depth of the vertical cracks <b>17</b> increases, the splitting stress for splitting the laminated glass <b>1</b>, namely the vibration force of the vibration unit <b>15</b> for vibrating the laminated glass <b>1</b>, can be decreased. However, if the loads are excessive, cracks are also induced in the horizontal direction (referred to as horizontal cracks). Accordingly, it is desirable to set the load conditions in such a way as to induce deeper vertical cracks <b>17</b> while preventing the occurrence of horizontal cracks. The present inventors have found, from experiments, that when the depth of the vertical cracks <b>17</b> is about 10 to 15% of the thickness of the glass plate, no horizontal cracks occurs and preferable cut edges are created by cutting, although the optimum conditions are varied depending on the aspect of the laminated glass <b>1</b>, the aspect of the wheel cutters <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0124">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the wheel cutters <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>are lifted, the vibration transmission section (not illustrated) of the vibration unit <b>15</b> is brought into contact with the surface of the laminated glass <b>1</b> in the opposite side from the end portion E with respect to the cut lines <b>16</b>, and the laminated glass <b>1</b> is vibrated in the direction perpendicular to surfaces of the glass plate (in the direction designated by an arrow A in the figure), namely in the thickwise direction of the laminated glass <b>1</b>. Thus, the vibration force is transmitted toward the laminated glass in the end portion E side, which causes the laminated glass in the end portion E side to vibrate in the vertical direction (the direction designated by an arrow B in the figure), similarly. The vibration stresses caused thereby elongate the vertical cracks <b>17</b> to the back surfaces of the glass flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, thereby splitting the laminated glass <b>1</b>. In this case, before the vertical cracks <b>17</b> elongate to the back surfaces of the glass flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, the vibration unit <b>15</b> can be stopped, and the laminated glass in the end portion E side can be pressed by a pressing member <b>18</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> to split the laminated glass <b>1</b>. It is preferable to set the depth of the vertical cracks <b>17</b> to 80% or more of the thickness of the glass flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>, since this can reduce the load applied to the pressing member <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0125">Although, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the vibration unit <b>15</b> is brought into contact with the laminated glass <b>1</b> to vibrate the laminated glass <b>1</b> directly by the vibration unit <b>15</b>, it is also possible to bring the vibration unit <b>15</b> into contact with the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> for indirectly vibrating the laminated glass <b>1</b> through the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b>, which can also offer the same effects. This method is effective, particularly in cases where the glass flat plates have a smaller thickness, more specifically a thickness equal to or less than 1 mm. For example, if the vibration unit <b>15</b> suitable for laminated glasses with larger plate thicknesses is directly brought into contact with a laminated glass with a smaller plate thickness, this will induce the inconvenience of the occurrence of horizontal cracks due to the excessive vibration force of the vibration unit <b>15</b>. In this case, if the thin laminated glass is indirectly vibrated through the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b>, it is possible to weaken the vibration force for preventing the occurrence of horizontal cracks, without replacement of the vibration unit <b>15</b>. Accordingly, by making the position of the vibration unit <b>15</b> to be movable to the positions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 18</figref>, it is possible to offer the advantage of the possibility of cutting various types of laminated glasses differing in thicknesses with the same apparatus, without replacing the vibration unit <b>15</b>.</p>

</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0134">As a result, vertical cracks with a depth in the range of 0.3 to 0.4 mm were formed just beneath the cut lines <b>16</b>. Further, no horizontal cracks were formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0135">Next, the vibration transmission section of an electric vibrator is brought into contact with an intersection of a lateral center line on the panel and a longitudinal straight line extended on the panel at a position spaced apart by 10 to 20 mm from the cut lines <b>16</b> in the opposite side from the end portion E and, then, the panel was vibrated for 1 to 5 seconds by setting the vibration frequency of the electric vibrator at 10 to 1000 Hz. As a result, the vertical cracks <b>17</b> elongated to the back surfaces of the respective glass substrates, thereby splitting the panel. The sizes of glass particles or glass chips induced at this time were determined using a microscope and, as a result, their sizes were several micrometers or less.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0136">The remaining three sides of the panel were split off with the same method to create two glass substrates separated from each other. The separated glass flat plates were polished with a polishing agent to remove the display element members on the flat plates and, as a result, preferable glass plates with no flaws induced by glass particles or glass chips generated during the glass cutting were created. Further, the glass plates were molten and, thereafter, the molten glass was reused in a panel. As a result, no defects caused by the glass plates were found.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0137">In the present embodiment, cut lines are written on the opposite surfaces of the panel <b>1</b>, vertical cracks are created therein and, then, vibrations are applied thereto to elongate the vertical cracks for splitting (fracturing) the panel. This can suppress the occurrence of glass particles during cutting, thereby eliminating an influence of glass particles on the subsequent polishing processing. Further, it is possible to split laminated glasses and hollow glasses having larger plate thicknesses, in shorter periods of time, without inducing flaws caused by horizontal cracks and chips in the cut surfaces, since they are fractured. Further, in the present embodiment, the glass flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> at the panel opposite surfaces are cut at the same time, which can eliminate the necessity of reversing the panel <b>1</b> in such a way as to shift the front side thereof to the rear side for cutting the respective glass flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. In the present embodiment, it is possible to offer the advantage of the possibility of cutting laminated glasses with larger areas with a simple method and an inexpensive apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Third Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0093" num="0138">It is desirable that, in the glass cutting apparatus according to the second embodiment, the depths of the vertical cracks formed in the glass flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> at the time of cutting them are equal to each other. In order to attain this, it is necessary that the wheel cutters <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>are pressed against the glass flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> with the same pressure. However, even when the pressing forces of the first pressing unit <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the second pressing unit <b>14</b><i>b </i>are controlled such that they are equal to each other, the upper first wheel cutter <b>13</b><i>a </i>is subjected to its own weight, which prevents the actual pressing forces applied to the first and second wheel cutters <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>from being equal to each other. Therefore, in order to actually apply the same pressing force to the wheel cutters <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b</i>, it is necessary to control the pressing forces of the first pressing unit <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the second pressing unit <b>14</b><i>b</i>, taking in account the weight of the first wheel cutter <b>13</b><i>a</i>, thereby requiring complicated control.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0139">In the present embodiment, in view of the aforementioned problem, there will be described a glass cutting apparatus which facilitates control of the first pressing unit <b>14</b><i>a </i>and the second pressing unit <b>14</b><i>b</i>. The glass cutting apparatus according to the present embodiment is capable of cutting a glass with a pair of cutters installed oppositely to each other in the horizontal direction with the glass plate sandwiched therebetween, at a state where the glass plate is held in the vertical direction.</p>

In cutting the laminated glass <b>1</b>, a first wheel cutter <b>13</b><i>a </i>and a second wheel cutter <b>13</b><i>b </i>installed oppositely to each other in the horizontal direction with the laminated glass <b>1</b> sandwiched therebetween are pressed against the laminated glass <b>1</b> with pressing forces equal to each other.

Thus, a pair of cut lines is formed in the laminated glass <b>1</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the pressing unit, the pressing control device and the like are not illustrated. The glass-substrate disassembling apparatus according to the present embodiment uses a single post as a ball screw <b>25</b>, a slide guide <b>26</b> and a frame <b>29</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0126" num="0177">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24A</figref>, if the panel <b>1</b> is brought in and placed on the transfer unit <b>6</b> in the present apparatus, at a state where the panel flat surfaces are vertically held, the transfer unit <b>6</b> transfers the panel <b>1</b> in the forward direction (step S<b>101</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). In this case, the term &#x201c;forward direction&#x201d; refers to the rightward direction in the figure, while the term &#x201c;rearward direction&#x201d; refers to the leftward direction in the figure.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0178">Next, the forward stopper <b>8</b> in the present apparatus is lifted to take an attitude capable of coming into contact with the panel <b>1</b> being transferred in the forward direction, namely a contact attitude.

In this state, the panel <b>1</b> is further transferred in the forward direction (step S<b>103</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>), then comes into contact with the forward stopper <b>8</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24B</figref> and stops at this position, namely a first stop position (step S<b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0179">After the panel <b>1</b> is stopped by the forward stopper <b>8</b>, the base table as the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> starts ascending (step S<b>105</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>).

<p id="p-0129" num="0180">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>, the wheel cutters <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>in the glass cutting apparatus <b>101</b> are moved from the upper side to the lower side in the direction designated by an arrow in the figure. Thus, the frontmost single side of the panel <b>1</b> is cut (step S<b>106</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). The portion of the panel <b>1</b> to be cut is determined by the interval between the wheel cutters <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>and the forward stopper <b>8</b>.

Next, the direction of transfer by the transfer unit <b>6</b> is reversed for transferring the panel <b>1</b> in the rearward direction (step S<b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>).

Similarly to the aforementioned step S<b>106</b>, the wheel cutters <b>13</b><i>a </i>and <b>13</b><i>b </i>in the glass cutting apparatus <b>101</b> are moved from the upper side to the lower side in the direction designated by an arrow in the figure, thereby cutting the rearmost single side of the panel <b>1</b> (step S<b>115</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). In this step, similarly, the panel <b>1</b> is cut at an inner portion with respect to the bonding member <b>4</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>) applied to the rearmost single side of the panel <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0184">Similarly to the aforementioned steps S<b>108</b> to S<b>110</b>, the cut piece falls downwardly (step S<b>117</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>), and, then, the base table <b>7</b> and the rearward stopper <b>9</b> descend below the transfer unit <b>6</b>, thereby taking an open attitude (step S<b>118</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>). Then, the panel <b>1</b> is transferred in the forward direction (step S<b>119</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0185">Next, the panel <b>1</b> is transferred to the rotation unit. The panel <b>1</b> transferred thereto is temporarily laid thereon such that the surfaces of the glass plate of the panel <b>1</b> are along the horizontal direction, then is rotated in the horizontal direction by 90 degrees through a plurality of free rollers, and, then, is caused to be upright such that the surfaces of the glass plate of the panel <b>1</b> are along the vertical direction. Due to this rotation, the cut sides of the panel <b>1</b> become the upper and lower sides thereof, while the uncut two sides of the panel <b>1</b> appear at the front and rear sides in the direction of transfer. After the completion of the rotation, the rotation unit transfers the panel <b>1</b> in the forward direction and, subsequently, the transfer unit <b>6</b> starts transferring the panel <b>1</b> in the forward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0186">Thereafter, similarly to steps S<b>102</b> to S<b>119</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the uncut two sides of the panel <b>1</b> are cut at inner portions with respect to the bonding member <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), at a state where the panel <b>1</b> is fixed at stop positions, namely a third stop position and a fourth stop position (steps S<b>121</b> and S<b>138</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>). However, the length of the sides of the panel <b>1</b> which should be cut in steps S<b>125</b> and S<b>134</b>, in general, is different from the length of the sides of the panel <b>1</b> which have been cut in steps S<b>106</b> and S<b>115</b>. Therefore, the glass cutting apparatus used in steps S<b>125</b> and S<b>134</b> is structured to be suitable for cutting the panel <b>1</b> by a length different from the length by which the panel <b>1</b> is cut by the glass cutting apparatus used in steps S<b>106</b> and S<b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0187">The first glass flat plate <b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) and the second glass flat plate <b>3</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the panel <b>1</b> which has been cut at portions coated with the bonding member <b>4</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in the aforementioned steps are brought into a state where there is no member bonding them to each other. An operator disassembles the panel <b>1</b> at this state into the glass flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> (step S<b>139</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>), then removes the pixel electrodes and the fluorescent material applied thereto (step S<b>140</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>) and then transfers both the flat plates <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> into glass recycling processing to recycle the glass (step S<b>141</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0188">In the present embodiment, similarly, it is possible to facilitate the control of the pressing unit and, also, it is possible to simplify the apparatus structure. Further, it is possible to split laminated glasses and hollow glasses having larger plate thicknesses, in shorter periods of time, in such a way as to suppress the occurrence of glass particles and prevent the occurrence of flaws due to horizontal cracks and chips in the cut surfaces. Furthermore, it is possible to offer the advantages of excellent safety for operators and the possibility of disassembling a panel into a first glass flat plate and a second glass flat plate with higher efficiency. Further, since the glass-substrate disassembling apparatus according to the present embodiment cuts a panel at a state where the panel is upright (at a state where its surfaces of the glass plate are held in the vertical direction), it is possible to reduce the installation area.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28 and 29</figref> illustrate another exemplary structure of the glass-substrate disassembling apparatus. This structure is different from that of the glass-substrate disassembling apparatus in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 25</figref>, in that it does not include the stopper <b>9</b>, the right-half portion of the transfer unit <b>6</b>, and the right half portion of the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0190">A panel <b>1</b> is transferred in the forward direction (FIG. <b>28</b>A) and comes into contact with a stopper <b>8</b> to stop at this position, namely a stop position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28B</figref>), then the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> is lifted, and the panel <b>1</b> is secured to the glass-plate holding unit <b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28C</figref>). Next, the frontmost single side of the panel <b>1</b> is cut (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29A</figref>), the cut piece <b>11</b><i>b </i>falls downwardly (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref>), and, then, the panel <b>1</b> is sucked by a suction device (not illustrated) and is rotated by 90 degrees in the direction designated by an arrow G in the figure (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29C</figref>). Similarly, the panel <b>1</b> is rotated by 90 degrees twice, so that all sides of the panel can be cut. This structure requires only a single stopper and eliminates the necessity of operating the stopper upwardly and downwardly. Further, this structure requires only a single set of the transfer unit and the glass-plate holding unit, while the glass-substrate disassembling apparatus according to the present embodiment requires two sets of the transfer unit and the glass-plate holding unit. This can reduce the installation area for the apparatus.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0140" num="0191">The glass cutting method and the apparatus therefor are particularly useful, in fields where hollow glasses and laminated glasses having larger plate thicknesses, such as PDPs and liquid crystal display panels, are reused.</p>
