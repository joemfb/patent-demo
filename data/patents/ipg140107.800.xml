<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Embodiments disclosed herein relate to lubrication of a reciprocating apparatus such as a positive displacement pump, and more specifically to devices and methods to improve the efficiency, durability, performance, and operating characteristics of a reciprocating apparatus such as a positive displacement pump (for example, of the sort that might be used in pumping a wellbore servicing fluid).</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Positive displacement pumps, a type of reciprocating apparatus, are used in various phases of oilfield operations, for example, to pump water, cement, fracturing fluids, and other stimulation or servicing fluids. Pumps in oilfield operations often endure harsh conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Lubrication of the components of a reciprocating apparatus, such as a positive displacement pump, is generally provided to reduce friction, reduce friction-related heat, remove particulate matter, and, thereby, improve the life and/or minimize failure of such apparatus or one or more of its components. Conventional flowpaths employed to provide lubricant to the components of a reciprocating apparatus can present one or more weak points in the system. For example, conventional flowpaths through the crankshaft can be a failure point under stress, as the holes themselves are located at points of high stress in the crankshaft. Likewise, flowpaths through the connecting rod can also be a source for stress-related failures. Further, conventional lubrication flowpaths may fail to provide a sufficient flow of lubricant to one of more components of a pump or similar apparatus. For example, where a flowpath or a portion thereof becomes obstructed, the flow of lubricant may be insufficient to adequately lubricate the reciprocating apparatus and, thus, potentially leading to premature failure of the apparatus or some component thereof. Therefore, an improved lubrication system that provides sufficient lubricant flow while avoiding or minimizing stress-related mechanical failures is needed, allowing for more effective oil field pumping operations in the face of such harsh operating conditions.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Disclosed herein is a reciprocating apparatus lubrication system. In an embodiment, such a lubrication system may provide continuous lubrication of one or more of the components of a reciprocating apparatus. Lubrication via such a lubrication system may decrease friction between the components of the reciprocating apparatus, decrease component wear, cool components, decrease equipment failures, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an embodiment of a reciprocating apparatus comprising a lubrication system, as will be disclosed herein, is illustrated. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the reciprocating apparatus comprises a pump <b>10</b> (e.g., a positive displacement pump, as will be discussed herein). Though various embodiments of a reciprocating apparatus may be described with regard to a pump such as the pump <b>10</b>, in alternative embodiments, as will be disclosed herein, the reciprocating apparatus may comprise any suitable reciprocating apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment, the pump <b>10</b> generally comprises a housing <b>11</b>, one or more crosshead slides <b>18</b> arranged and/or affixed within the housing <b>11</b>, and a crosshead <b>13</b> configured and/or situated to slidably reciprocate within one or more crosshead slides <b>18</b>. The pump <b>10</b> further comprises a crankshaft <b>14</b>, the rotation of which drives the crosshead <b>13</b> reciprocally within the crosshead slides <b>18</b>, the reciprocal motion being transferred to the crosshead <b>13</b> by a connecting rod <b>16</b> extending between the crankshaft <b>14</b>, and to a plunger <b>12</b> by a pushrod <b>25</b> extending between the crosshead <b>13</b> and the plunger <b>12</b>. The pump <b>10</b> may further comprise a manifold <b>15</b> arranged on or about the housing <b>11</b> and connected thereto via a fastener <b>23</b> which may comprise a part of the lubrication system.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, the pump <b>10</b> comprises only one crosshead <b>13</b> with associated crosshead slides, connecting rod <b>16</b>, pushrod <b>25</b>, and plunger <b>12</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, in an alternative embodiment, a pump like pump <b>10</b> may comprise a plurality of crossheads like crosshead <b>13</b>, each having associated crosshead slides, an associated connecting rod, an associated pushrod, and an associated plunger. In such a multi-crosshead reciprocating apparatus, all crossheads and associated componentry (e.g., connecting rod, push-rod, plunger, and the like, as will be discussed herein) may be similarly connected to a common crankshaft. Also, in such a multi-crosshead reciprocating apparatus, each crosshead and associated componentry may comprise a lubrication system (e.g., the series of flowpaths, flow-bores, conduits, and connections as will be discussed herein); alternatively, in a multi-crosshead embodiment, two or more crossheads may share at least a portion of such a lubrication system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In an embodiment, the crankshaft <b>14</b> of the pump <b>10</b> may be coupled to an engine, motor, or other source of rotational power, in a known manner, to drive the crankshaft <b>14</b> and power the pump <b>10</b>. Hereinafter, the term &#x201c;motor&#x201d; will be used to refer to any source of rotational power, such as an engine, a motor, or similar. It should be understood that any reference to a motor should not be considered as limiting, but may include any source of rotational power and their equivalents. In an embodiment, the rotation of the crankshaft <b>14</b> causes connecting rod <b>16</b> to push and pull the crosshead <b>13</b> back and forth within the crosshead slides <b>18</b>, thereby causing the plunger <b>12</b>, which is operably coupled and/or connected to the crosshead <b>13</b> via the pushrod <b>25</b>, to reciprocate within a generally cylindrical bore (e.g., a cylinder <b>54</b>) in a fluid end section <b>51</b> of the pump <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">With each reciprocation of the plunger <b>12</b>, a given volume of the fluid is pumped. For example, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the fluid end section <b>51</b> may comprise a suction valve <b>50</b> through which fluid may be drawn into a chamber <b>53</b> in the fluid end section <b>51</b> and a discharge valve <b>52</b> through which fluid may be expelled from the chamber <b>53</b>. The suction valve <b>50</b> may be connected to a source, such as a suction header or similar, containing the fluid to be pumped (the &#x201c;pumped fluid&#x201d;). As will be described herein, the pumped fluid may comprise a liquid or a gas (e.g., a wellbore servicing fluid), as may be appropriate for a given application.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In an embodiment, the retraction of the plunger <b>12</b> (e.g., as the plunger <b>12</b> is pulled by the pushrod <b>25</b>, the pushrod being operably coupled to the crosshead <b>13</b>, the crosshead <b>13</b> being operably coupled to the connecting rod <b>16</b> via a wrist-pin <b>20</b> and/or a wrist-pin bearing <b>21</b>, the connecting rod <b>16</b> being operably coupled to the crankshaft <b>14</b>) draws a volume of the pumped fluid into the chamber <b>53</b> via the suction valve <b>50</b> (e.g., the suction valve open to allow fluid to enter the chamber <b>53</b>, then closes). The extension of the plunger <b>12</b> (e.g., as the plunger <b>12</b> is pushed by the pushrod <b>25</b>, the crosshead <b>13</b>, the connecting rod <b>16</b>, and the crankshaft <b>14</b>) forces the volume of pumped fluid out of the chamber <b>53</b> via discharge valve <b>52</b> (e.g., the discharge valve may open to allow fluid to be expelled from the chamber <b>53</b>, then closes). As such, the pump <b>10</b> may be employed to convey fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment the lubrication system of the disclosure comprises one or more flowpaths configured to circulate a fluid (e.g. a lubricant) to one or more of the components of the reciprocating apparatus (e.g. pump <b>10</b>). In an embodiment, the lubricant may comprise any suitable type lubricant. For example, the lubricant may comprise a petroleum oil (commonly referred to as mineral oil), a synthetic oil, a natural (e.g., vegetable or plant-derived oil), or combinations thereof. Nonlimiting examples of suitable type of lubricant include hydrogenated polyalpha-olefins (PAO), synthetic esters, polyalkylene glycols (PAG), phosphate esters, alkylated naphthalenes (AN), silicate esters, ionic fluids, silicones, fluorocarbons, paraffinic fluids, mineral oils, or combinations thereof. In an embodiment, the lubricant may comprise any suitable additive. Nonlimiting examples of a suitable additives include antioxidants, detergents, antiwear additives, metal deactivators, corrosion inhibitors, rust inhibitors, friction modifiers, anti-foaming agents, viscosity modifiers, demulsifying agents, emulsifying agents, or combinations thereof. In an embodiment, a suitable lubricant may be characterized as having a suitable weight and/viscosity, as will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art viewing this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, in an embodiment the lubrication system may comprise a series of flowpaths, flowbores, fluid pathways, and the like and may be characterized as a circulatory (or recirculatory) system. The description of some portion of the lubrication system as comprising galleys, ducts, ports, bores, channels, pathways, flowpaths, and/or fluid pathways should not be construed as limiting such pathways to any particular form or function. In various embodiment, such terms may be used interchangeably. In the embodiments that follow, one or more of these galleys, ducts, ports, bores, channels, pathways, flowpaths, and/or fluid pathways may be characterized as having a suitable size (e.g., diameter) and allowing for a given desired flowrate, as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art. In an embodiment as will be discussed herein, a flowpath of the type and/or configuration disclosed herein may be divided into multiple, similar paths. For example, a given flowpath may be divided into two or more smaller flowpaths cumulatively having about the same cross-sectional area, allowing for about the same flowrate, or combinations thereof. Additionally or alternatively, the routing of a particular flowpath may be varied (e.g., in size, shape, orientation, etc.), for example to make advantageous use of available material suitable for forming said flowpath and/or for optimizing the overall strength of the component or components comprising that flowpath.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Below, the flowpath is described as arbitrarily beginning at an external lubrication supply. Generally, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> a lubricant is provided (e.g., circulated) from the external lubrication supply to a fluid pathway within the lubricant manifold <b>15</b>; from the manifold fluid pathway to one or more channels at the interface between a first of the crosshead slides <b>18</b> and the crosshead <b>13</b> via a flowpath of the fastener <b>23</b>; from the one or more channels at the interface between the crosshead slide <b>18</b> and the crosshead <b>13</b> through one or more flowbores or fluid pathways in the crosshead <b>13</b>, the wrist-pin <b>20</b>, and the wrist-pin bearing <b>21</b> to a fluid galley at the interface between the wrist-pin bearing <b>21</b> and the inner surface of the connecting rod <b>16</b>; from the fluid galley through a flowbore extending through the connecting rod <b>16</b>, through flowbores <b>170</b> and <b>28</b><i>b </i>to a fluid galley at the interface of the connecting rod <b>16</b> and the crankshaft <b>14</b>; and then returning to the sump <b>24</b>. A detailed description of the components, the flowpaths, and/or portions thereof will be described herein with regard to pump <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In an embodiment, the housing <b>11</b> contains and supports the components of pump <b>10</b>. Housing <b>11</b> may be formed, for example, of cast iron or other suitable material to provide a rigid structure for the components of pump <b>10</b>. The housing may be formed, for example by machining, to provide various fitments and configurations to form the appropriate structures and details of the housing <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In an embodiment, the housing <b>11</b> may be provided with additional ports or ducts, for example, to allow for the circulation of a medium for heat transfer to/from the housing <b>11</b> and components therein (e.g., such as a coolant circulated through chambers of an engine). Further, the housing <b>11</b> may be provided with various combinations of inlets, outlets, connections, or the like, for example, for receiving and/or directing the pumped fluid. Further still, housing <b>11</b> may be provided with connections to various other components and/or systems such as piping, tanks, drive mechanisms, or other equipment via, for example, piping, flanges, connectors, or other appurtenances. In addition, cover plates or access ways may be provided on and/or within the housing <b>11</b>, for example, to permit access for repair or inspection of the components of pump <b>10</b> and/or the housing <b>11</b>, itself. The housing <b>11</b> may be detachably affixed to a platform or stage.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an embodiment, the housing <b>11</b> comprises a collection point, hereinafter referred to as sump <b>24</b>, in which fluid (e.g. a lubricant) circulated throughout the components of the pump <b>10</b> may collect. The sump <b>24</b> may be positioned such that lubricant may flow into or otherwise fill via gravitational flow of the lubricant (e.g., the sump <b>24</b> may be located at a &#x201c;low point&#x201d; within the housing&#x201d;). For example, lubricant provided to one or more of the other components of the pump <b>10</b>, as will be described herein, may flow and/or otherwise be returned to the sump <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment, the lubricant manifold <b>15</b> may be provided with and/or attached to the housing <b>11</b>. In an embodiment, the lubricant manifold <b>15</b> may be characterized as tubular. For example, the lubricant manifold <b>15</b> may have a rectangular cross-section (e.g. channel iron), and may be of a suitable length, as may be dependent upon the configuration and size of the pump <b>10</b>. For example, the length of lubricant manifold <b>15</b> may depend on of the length of the housing <b>11</b>, the number of crossheads <b>13</b> in the pump <b>10</b>, and the distance between all of the crossheads <b>13</b>. The lubricant manifold <b>15</b> may be configured to span the length of the housing, from one end to the other, and arranged to provide fluid communication to each of the crossheads in pump <b>10</b>, as will be described in more detail, herein. The lubricant manifold <b>15</b> may be positioned at the top of and/or above the pump <b>10</b> or one or more components thereof (e.g., such that lubricant may flow by gravity, for example, and be returned to the sump <b>24</b>). The lubricant manifold <b>15</b> may be arranged such that it is detachably affixed to, and in fluid communication with the housing as described in greater detail, below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment, the lubricant manifold <b>15</b> may be in fluid communication with the sump <b>24</b>. For example, a fluid pathway (e.g., as demonstrated by flow arrow <b>105</b>) extending through the lubricant manifold <b>15</b> (e.g., the channel of the aforementioned channel iron) may be arranged to receive lubricant from the sump <b>24</b>, via a suitable means of transfer. For example, lubricant may be conveyed from the sump <b>24</b> to the lubricant manifold <b>15</b> via an internal or external lubricant pump. In an embodiment, the lubricant may be routed from the sump <b>24</b> to the lubricant manifold <b>15</b> via a suitable filtration device, for example, to remove sediment and/particulate material.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Alternatively, lubricant may be conveyed to the manifold <b>15</b> via a pressure differential or any suitable means of conveyance. In an alternative embodiment, fluid (e.g. lubricant) may be conveyed directly to one the channels at the interface between the crosshead <b>13</b> and the at least one of the one or more crosshead slides <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an embodiment, the one or more fasteners <b>23</b> may detachably affix the lubricant manifold <b>15</b> to the housing <b>11</b>. Generally, the fastener <b>23</b> may comprise a bolt, screw, rivet, or other suitable fastener. In an embodiment, the fastener <b>23</b> may comprise a fluid path in fluid communication with the manifold fluid pathway, as demonstrated by flow arrows <b>110</b> and <b>105</b>, for example, such that fluid flowing via manifold fluid path (e.g., flow arrow <b>105</b>) may flow via flowpath of the fastener (e.g., flow arrow <b>110</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an embodiment of a fastener <b>23</b> is illustrated. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the fastener <b>23</b> may be in fluid communication with the manifold fluid pathway <b>105</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the fluid path <b>110</b> may comprise one or more bores through at least a portion of the fastener <b>23</b>. For example, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the fastener <b>23</b> comprises a first bore <b>60</b> and a second bore <b>62</b> intersecting and in fluid communication with the first bore <b>60</b> and thereby providing a route of fluid communication through the fastener <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In an additional or alternative embodiment, the fastener may be provided with various combinations of bores, slots, grooves, as may suitably allow fluid to flow within, in, on, through, or around the fastener <b>23</b> and provide a route of fluid communication from the lubricant manifold <b>15</b> into the housing <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In an embodiment, each of one or more crosshead slides <b>18</b> may generally comprise a guide or rail. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>1</b>A and <b>3</b>, two crosshead slides <b>18</b> are present. In alternative embodiments, a single crosshead slide <b>18</b> is present, alternatively, three, four, five, etc, crosshead slides like crosshead slides <b>18</b>. The crosshead slides <b>18</b> may be disposed within at least a portion of the housing <b>11</b> to reciprocally receive the crosshead <b>13</b>. For example, in an embodiment the crosshead slides <b>18</b> may comprise a first crosshead slide <b>18</b>A and a second crosshead slide <b>18</b>B (referred to in combination as crosshead slides <b>18</b>) of sufficient length to contain the stroke or reciprocation of the crosshead <b>13</b>. The crosshead slides <b>18</b> may comprise any suitable material. For example, crosshead slides <b>18</b> may be cast or otherwise formed from brass, steel, metal alloys, or the like. The crosshead slides <b>18</b> may be disposed within an opening that has been machined or cast into housing <b>11</b>. Such an opening may be configured to accept and rigidly hold the crosshead slides <b>18</b> in place in an appropriate manner so as to facilitate interaction of the crosshead <b>13</b> with the other components of pump <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment, the crosshead <b>13</b> may generally be characterized as cylindrical in shape. The crosshead <b>13</b> may generally comprise a head or crown, generally referring to the face of the crosshead being perpendicular to the direction of the crosshead's reciprocation, and a skirt, generally referring to the cylindrical walls of the crosshead <b>13</b>. In an embodiment, the crosshead <b>13</b> may further comprise one or more crosshead shoes configured to interact with (e.g., reciprocally receive and/or slide against) the one or more crosshead slides <b>18</b>. For example, each of the crosshead slides <b>18</b> may slide within and/or against a crosshead shoe. The crosshead <b>13</b> may be sized to slidably fit between and/or within the one or more crosshead slides <b>18</b>. Additionally, the one or more crosshead slides <b>18</b> may be sized and/or spaced to slidably contain the crosshead.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In an embodiment, the crosshead <b>13</b> may be operably coupled via the pushrod <b>25</b> to the plunger <b>12</b>, for example, such that reciprocation of the crosshead <b>13</b> may cause the pushrod <b>25</b> and plunger <b>12</b> to reciprocate within the cylinder <b>54</b> in the fluid end section <b>51</b> of the pump <b>10</b>. In such an embodiment, the plunger <b>12</b> may be provided with suitable appurtenances to form a seal between plunger <b>12</b> and the cylinder <b>54</b>. For example, seals (for example, &#x201c;o-rings&#x201d; or the like) may be arranged to fit within grooves or channels circumferentially provided around plunger <b>12</b> (e.g., within the skirt of the plunger). These seals may be sized such that they press against the inner walls of cylinder <b>54</b> and thereby provide a seal between the plunger <b>12</b> and the cylinder <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an embodiment, one or more flow channels are provided at the interface between the crosshead <b>13</b> and the crosshead slides <b>18</b>.

In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 4</figref>, the connecting rod <b>16</b> comprises multiple big-end fluid galleys, <b>32</b>, each big-end fluid galley, <b>32</b>, being associated with one of the longitudinal flowbores <b>28</b>. In an embodiment, the big-end fluid galley <b>32</b> may be in fluid communication with the associated longitudinal flowbore <b>28</b>. For example, fluid flowing via the longitudinal flowbore <b>28</b> may flow into and via the big-end fluid galley <b>32</b>, as demonstrated by flow arrow <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In an embodiment, the lubricant present in the big-end fluid galley <b>32</b> may serve to lubricate the crankpin bearing <b>19</b> and the connecting rod <b>16</b> as the connecting rod <b>16</b> rotates about the crankpin <b>17</b>. For example, a portion of the lubricant may escape from the big-end fluid galley <b>32</b> (e.g., by seepage) and into the interface between the crankpin bearing <b>19</b> and the connecting rod <b>16</b> (e.g., the big-end of the connecting rod <b>16</b>), thereby forming a lubricating layer between the crankpin bearing <b>19</b> and the connecting rod <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 4</figref>, in an embodiment the crankpin bearing <b>19</b> may further comprise a bore <b>35</b>. The bore <b>35</b> may extend through crankpin bearing <b>19</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 4</figref>, the bore <b>35</b> may extend radially (with respect to the longitudinal axis <b>74</b> of the crankpin <b>17</b> and/or crankpin bearing <b>19</b>) through the crankpin bearing <b>19</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 4</figref>, the crankpin bearing <b>19</b> comprises multiple bores, <b>35</b>. For example, the crankpin bearing <b>19</b> may comprise a first bore <b>35</b><i>a </i>and a second bore <b>35</b><i>b </i>(referred to generically alone or in combination as bores(s) <b>35</b>). In an embodiment where the crankpin bearing <b>19</b> comprises multiple parts (e.g., two halves) which may be joined together, the bore <b>35</b> may be configured and/or arranged such that a portion of a given bore <b>35</b> is present in each part of the crankpin bearing (e.g., in each half of the two halves of crankpin bearing <b>19</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 4</figref>, at least one of the bores, <b>35</b>, may be intermitantly aligned with one of the big-end fluid galleys, <b>32</b>. For example, as the connecting rod <b>16</b> pivots about the crankpin <b>17</b> via the rotation of the crankshaft <b>14</b>, the connecting rod <b>16</b> may rotate or pivot (e.g., in a circular motion) about the axis of rotation of the crankpin <b>17</b> and/or the crankpin bearing <b>19</b>, causing a first of the big-end fluid galleys <b>32</b> to move into and out of alignment with a first of the bores <b>36</b>. In such an embodiment, the big-end fluid galleys <b>32</b> and bores <b>35</b> may be configured such that fluid may be communicated therebetween when at least one of the multiple fluid galleys is aligned with a at least one of the bores <b>35</b>. Thus, in such an embodiment at least one of the big-end fluid galleys <b>32</b> may be in intermittent fluid communication with fluid at least one of the bores <b>35</b>. For example, fluid flowing via the bore <b>35</b> may flow into and via at least one of the big-end fluid galleys, <b>32</b>, as demonstrated by flow arrow <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an embodiment, the lubricant flowing via the bores <b>35</b> may serve to lubricate the crankpin <b>17</b> and crankpin bearing <b>19</b> as the connecting rod <b>16</b> rotates with respect to the crankpin <b>17</b>, for example, via the crankpin <b>17</b> and/or crankpin bearing <b>19</b>. For example, a portion of the lubricant may escape from the bores <b>35</b> (e.g., by seepage) and into the interface between the crankpin <b>17</b> and the crankpin bearing <b>19</b>, thereby forming a lubricating layer between the crankpin <b>17</b> and the crankpin bearing <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In an embodiment, the lubricant may be returned to the sump <b>24</b>. For example, as described herein, lubricant may seep into one or more of the clearances between two of more of the components (as described herein) of the pump <b>10</b>. In such an embodiment, these clearances (e.g., at the interface between two or more components) may sufficient clearance to allow movement (e.g., seepage) of the lubricant. Lubricant may seep into, out of, and/or through such clearances and be returned (e.g., via the flow of gravity) to the sump <b>24</b>; for example, via channels within the housing to the sump <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As such, in an embodiment, the pump <b>10</b> may be provided with a lubrication system in which lubricant may be delivered from the sump <b>24</b> to the manifold <b>15</b> by, for example, an external delivery mechanism such as a lubricant pump and associated conveyances (e.g. pipe or tubing). Lubricant may through the fluid pathway of the manifold <b>15</b> to fastener <b>23</b> (e.g., as shown by flow arrow <b>105</b>) and through the fluid pathway of the fastener <b>23</b> (e.g., flow arrow <b>110</b>) to flow channels <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> at the interface between the crosshead <b>13</b> and the first crosshead slide <b>18</b>A. Lubricant may flow from flow channels <b>38</b> and <b>40</b> into bore <b>42</b> (e.g., flow arrow <b>120</b>) and the fluid pathway <b>22</b><i>a </i>in the crosshead <b>13</b>. Lubricant may flow from flowpath <b>22</b><i>a </i>to flowpaths <b>22</b><i>b</i>, <b>22</b><i>c</i>, and <b>22</b><i>d </i>in the wrist-pin <b>20</b> (e.g., flow arrow <b>130</b>). Lubricant may also flow from flowpath <b>22</b><i>c </i>to flowpath <b>22</b><i>e </i>in crosshead <b>13</b> (e.g., flow arrow <b>160</b>) via outlet port <b>27</b> to the interface between the crosshead <b>13</b> and the second crosshead slide <b>18</b>B. In addition, lubricant may flow from flowpath <b>22</b><i>d </i>and into duct <b>30</b> in wrist-pin bearing <b>21</b>, and through bore <b>36</b> into small-end fluid galley <b>31</b> in wrist-pin bearing <b>21</b> (e.g., flow arrow <b>140</b>). From the small-end fluid galley, lubricant may flow into longitudinal flowbore <b>28</b> in the connecting rod <b>16</b> (e.g., flow arrow <b>145</b>). Lubricant may flow the length of connecting rod <b>16</b> (e.g., flow arrow <b>180</b>) and into big-end fluid galley <b>32</b> and from the big-end fluid galley <b>32</b> (e.g., flow arrow <b>180</b>) through crankpin bearing bore <b>35</b> to the internal surfaces of crankpin bearing <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In an embodiment, the lubrication system disclosed herein may comprise a plurality of similar or identical flowpaths, flowbores, and fluid pathways, for example, to provide redundant lubricant flow to components of the pump <b>10</b>. As discussed above with reference to bores <b>42</b><i>a </i>and <b>42</b><i>c</i>, a flowpath or series of flowpaths may provide lubricant in a plane substantially parallel to the entire flowpath described herein above.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an embodiment of a top view of connecting rod <b>16</b> and crosshead <b>13</b>, is shown. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an additional lubricant flowpath, as described above, essentially alongside and parallel the flowpaths, fluid pathways, and flowbores may extend through the crosshead <b>13</b>, wrist-pin <b>20</b>, wrist-pin bearing <b>21</b>, connecting rod <b>16</b>, and to the crankpin <b>17</b>. In an embodiment, each portion of the flowpath described in detail herein above may be replicated alongside the first flowpath, substantially parallel to the first flowpath.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In an additional embodiment, a third, a forth, or more complete lubricant flowpaths may be configured through crosshead <b>13</b>, wrist-pin <b>20</b>, wrist-pin bearing <b>21</b>, connecting rod <b>16</b>, and to the crankpin <b>17</b>. In an embodiment, the portion of the overall flowpath extending from bore <b>42</b> to the crankpin <b>17</b> may be replicated in any appropriate manner or location through any/all of the components therebetween. In an embodiment, one or more additional lubricant pathways may be provided in some or all of the components of pump <b>10</b>, as one of skill in the art viewing this disclosure will appreciate. For example, a flowpath is illustrated extending from bore <b>42</b><i>c</i>, through the crosshead <b>13</b> via various flowpaths (e.g., as may be similar to fluid pathway <b>22</b><i>a </i>in the crosshead <b>13</b> and flowpaths <b>22</b><i>b</i>, <b>22</b><i>c</i>, and <b>22</b><i>d </i>in the wrist-pin <b>20</b> to small-end fluid galley <b>31</b><i>c </i>(e.g., via various bores in wrist-pin bearing <b>21</b>). From the small-end fluid galley <b>31</b><i>c</i>, lubricant may flow into and through longitudinal flowbore <b>28</b><i>c </i>in the connecting rod <b>16</b> into big-end fluid galley <b>32</b><i>c </i>and from the big-end fluid galley <b>32</b> through crankpin bearing bore <b>35</b><i>c </i>to the internal surfaces of crankpin bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In an embodiment, the multiplicity of flowpaths provided may increase the total lubricant flow volume. Further, multiple flowpaths may provide a &#x201c;backup&#x201d; pathway for lubricant to flow, for example, should portions of one or more of the pathway become clogged, or otherwise unable to provide flow. As such, in an embodiment, the disclosed pump may provide increased lubricant delivery and/or redundant lubricant pathways.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In an embodiment, displacing the longitudinal flowbores <b>28</b> of the connecting rod <b>16</b> from the centerline <b>75</b> of the connecting rod <b>16</b>, as disclosed herein with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>4</b>, and <b>5</b> may reduce mechanical failure of the connecting rod <b>16</b>. For example, not intending to be bound by theory, displacing the flowbores from the centerline of the connecting rod <b>16</b> may avoid relatively high-stress points along the connecting rod <b>16</b>, thereby minimizing and/or avoiding such mechanical failures (e.g., breaks, fractures, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In an additional embodiment, a lubrication flowpath may be absent through the crankshaft <b>14</b>. In such an embodiment, the absence of a flowpath through the crankshaft may avoid stress-induced failures of the crankshaft. For example, a pump lubricated via a system as disclosed herein may not require such a flowpath through the crankshaft. As such, in such an embodiment, the disclosed pump may minimize or eliminate multiple points of mechanical stress, thereby providing improved pump life.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In an embodiment, the pump <b>10</b>, as disclosed herein, may comprise any suitable type or configuration of pump. A nonlimiting example of a suitable type and configuration of pump includes a positive displacement pump, for example, as may be employed in the performance of an oilfield or well servicing operation. For example, a positive displacement pump, such as pump <b>10</b>, may be employed in the performance of a drilling operation, a fracturing operation, a perforating operation, a fluid loss operation, a primary cementing operation, a secondary or remedial cementing operation, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an embodiment of a wellbore servicing system <b>1100</b> (e.g., a fracturing spread) is shown comprising a positive displacement pump such as the pump <b>10</b> disclosed herein. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the wellbore servicing system <b>1100</b> is a system for fracturing wells in a hydrocarbon-containing reservoir. Although a wellbore servicing system is illustrated with regard to a fracturing operation, the pump disclosed herein may be employed in any suitable operation. In fracturing operations, wellbore servicing fluids, such as particle laden fluids, are pumped at high-pressure into a wellbore. The particle laden fluids may then be introduced into a portion of a subterranean formation at a sufficient pressure and velocity to cut a casing and/or create perforation tunnels and fractures within the subterranean formation. Proppants, such as grains of sand, are mixed with the wellbore servicing fluid to keep the fractures open so that hydrocarbons may be produced from the subterranean formation and flow into the wellbore. Hydraulic fracturing may desirably create high-conductivity fluid communication between the wellbore and the subterranean formation.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The wellbore servicing system <b>1100</b> comprises a blender <b>1114</b> that is coupled to a wellbore services manifold trailer <b>1118</b> via flowline <b>1116</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;wellbore services manifold trailer&#x201d; includes a truck and/or trailer comprising one or more manifolds for receiving, organizing, and/or distributing wellbore servicing fluids during wellbore servicing operations. In this embodiment, the wellbore services manifold trailer <b>1118</b> is coupled to eight positive displacement pumps (e.g., such as pump <b>10</b>) via outlet flowlines <b>1122</b> and inlet flowlines <b>1124</b>. In alternative embodiments, however, there may be more or fewer pumps used in a wellbore servicing operation. Outlet flowlines <b>1122</b> are outlet lines from the wellbore services manifold trailer <b>1118</b> that supply fluid to the pumps <b>10</b>. Inlet flowlines <b>1124</b> are inlet lines from the pumps <b>10</b> that supply fluid to the wellbore services manifold trailer <b>1118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The blender <b>1114</b> mixes solid and fluid components to achieve a well-blended wellbore servicing fluid. As depicted, sand or proppant <b>1102</b>, water <b>1106</b>, and additives <b>1110</b> are fed into the blender <b>1114</b> via feedlines <b>1104</b>, <b>1108</b>, and <b>1112</b>, respectively. The water <b>1106</b> may be potable, non-potable, untreated, partially treated, or treated water. In an embodiment, the water <b>1106</b> may be produced water that has been extracted from the wellbore while producing hydrocarbons form the wellbore. The produced water may comprise dissolved and/or entrained organic materials, salts, minerals, paraffins, aromatics, resins, asphaltenes, and/or other natural or synthetic constituents that are displaced from a hydrocarbon formation during the production of the hydrocarbons. In an embodiment, the water <b>1106</b> may be flowback water that has previously been introduced into the wellbore during wellbore servicing operation. The flowback water may comprise some hydrocarbons, gelling agents, friction reducers, surfactants and/or remnants of wellbore servicing fluids previously introduced into the wellbore during wellbore servicing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The water <b>1106</b> may further comprise local surface water contained in natural and/or manmade water features (such as ditches, ponds, rivers, lakes, oceans, etc.). Still further, the water <b>1106</b> may comprise water stored in local or remote containers. The water <b>1106</b> may be water that originated from near the wellbore and/or may be water that has been transported to an area near the wellbore from any distance. In some embodiments, the water <b>1106</b> may comprise any combination of produced water, flowback water, local surface water, and/or container stored water.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In this embodiment, the blender <b>1114</b> is an Advanced Dry Polymer (ADP) blender and the additives <b>1110</b> are dry blended and dry fed into the blender <b>1114</b>. In alternative embodiments, however, additives may be pre-blended with water using a GEL PRO blender, which is a commercially available preblender trailer from Halliburton Energy Services, Inc., to form a liquid gel concentrate that may be fed into the blender <b>1114</b>. The mixing conditions of the blender <b>1114</b>, including time period, agitation method, pressure, and temperature of the blender <b>1114</b>, may be chosen by one of ordinary skill in the art with the aid of this disclosure to produce a homogeneous blend having a desirable composition, density, and viscosity. In alternative embodiments, however, sand or proppant, water, and additives may be premixed and/or stored in a storage tank before entering a wellbore services manifold trailer <b>1118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the pumps <b>10</b> pressurize the wellbore servicing fluid to a pressure suitable for delivery into the wellhead <b>1128</b>. For example, the pumps <b>10</b> may increase the pressure of the wellbore servicing fluid to a pressure of up to about 20,000 psi or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">From the pumps <b>10</b>, the wellbore servicing fluid may reenter the wellbore services manifold trailer <b>1118</b> via inlet flowlines <b>1124</b> and be combined so that the wellbore servicing fluid may have a total fluid flow rate that exits from the wellbore services manifold trailer <b>1118</b> through flowline <b>1126</b> to the flow connector wellbore <b>1128</b> of between about 1 BPM to about 200 BPM, alternatively from between about 50 BPM to about 150 BPM, alternatively about 100 BPM. Persons of ordinary skill in the art with the aid of this disclosure will appreciate that the flowlines described herein are piping that are connected together for example via flanges, collars, welds, etc. These flowlines may include various configurations of pipe tees, elbows, and the like. These flowlines connect together the various wellbore servicing fluid process equipment described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Also disclosed herein are methods of performing a wellbore servicing operation with a positive displacement pump such as the pump disclosed herein. In an embodiment, a wellbore servicing method may comprise transporting a positive displacement pump, for example the pump <b>10</b> disclosed herein, to site for the servicing operation (e.g., to a wellbore). In an embodiment, one or more pumps may be situated on a suitable structural support. Nonlimiting examples of a suitable structural support or supports include a trailer, truck, skid, barge or combinations thereof. In an embodiment a motor or other power source for the pump <b>10</b> and the pump <b>10</b> may be situated on a common structural support.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In an embodiment, a wellbore servicing method may further comprise providing a source for a wellbore servicing fluid. As described above, the wellbore servicing fluid may comprise any suitable fluid or combinations of fluid as may be appropriate based upon the servicing operation being performed. Nonlimiting examples of suitable wellbore servicing fluid include a fracturing fluid (e.g., a particle laden fluid, as described herein), a perforating fluid, a cementitious fluid, a sealant, a remedial fluid, a drilling fluid (e.g., mud), a spacer fluid, a gelation fluid, a polymeric fluid, an aqueous fluid, an oleaginous fluid, an emulsion, various other wellbore servicing fluid as will be appreciated by one of skill in the art with the aid of this disclosure, and combinations thereof. The wellbore servicing fluid may be prepared on-site (e.g., via the operation of one or more blenders) or, alternatively, transported to the site of the servicing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In an embodiment, a wellbore servicing method may further comprise fluidly coupling the positive displacement pump to the wellbore servicing fluid source, for example, such that the wellbore servicing fluid may be drawn into and emitted from the positive displacement pump.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In an embodiment, a wellbore servicing method may further comprise conveying the wellbore servicing fluid from its source to the wellbore via the operation of the positive displacement, that is, pump <b>10</b> as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In an alternative embodiment, the reciprocating apparatus may comprise a compressor. In an embodiment, similar to pump <b>10</b>, such a compressor may comprise at least one each of a plunger, cylinder, connecting rod, crankshaft, and housing, and may be coupled to a motor. Like the crosshead and crosshead slides disclosed herein, a plunger may be likewise arranged to move in reciprocating fashion within a cylinder, similar to pump <b>10</b>. In an embodiment, such a compressor may be similar in form to a pump and may be configured to compress a compressible fluid (e.g., a gas) and thereby increase the pressure of the compressible fluid. For example, a compressor may be configured to direct the discharge therefrom to a chamber or vessel that collects the compressible fluid from the discharge of the compressor until a predetermined pressure is built up in the chamber. Generally, a pressure sensing device may be arranged and configured to monitor the pressure as it builds up in the chamber and to interact with the compressor when a predetermined pressure is reached. At that point, the compressor may either be shut off, or alternatively the discharge may be directed to another chamber for continued operation.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In another alternative embodiment, a reciprocating apparatus comprises an internal combustion engine, hereinafter referred to as an engine. Such engines are also well known, and typically include at least one each of a piston, cylinder, connecting rod, and crankshaft. The arrangement of these components is substantially the same in an engine and a pump (e.g. pump <b>10</b>). Like the crosshead and crosshead slides disclosed herein, a piston may be likewise arranged to move in reciprocating fashion within a cylinder, similar to pump <b>10</b>. However, the operation of an engine may differ from that of a pump in that, in a pump, rotational power is applied to the crankshaft which acts on the plunger via the pushrod, the crosshead, and the connecting rod while, in an engine, a force (i.e., internal combustion) exerted on or against the piston acts on the crankshaft via the connecting rod and results in rotational power.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">For example, in a typical 4-stroke engine, arbitrarily beginning with the exhaust stroke, the piston is fully extended during the exhaust stroke, (e.g., minimizing the internal volume of the cylinder). The piston may then be retracted by inertia or other forces of the engine componentry during the intake stroke. As the piston retracts within the cylinder, the internal volume of cylinder increases, creating a low pressure within the cylinder into which an air/fuel mixture is drawn. When the piston is fully retracted within the cylinder, the intake stroke is complete, and the cylinder is substantially filled with the air/fuel mixture. As the crankshaft continues to rotate, the piston may then be extended, during the compression stroke, into the cylinder compressing the air-fuel mixture within the cylinder to a higher pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">A spark plug may be provided to ignite the fuel at a predetermined point in the compression stroke. This ignition increases the temperature and pressure within the cylinder substantially and rapidly. Alternatively, in a diesel engine, the spark plug may be omitted, as the heat of compression derived from the high compression ratios associated with diesel engines suffices to provide spontaneous combustion of the air-fuel mixture. In either case, the heat and pressure act forcibly against the piston and cause it to retract back into the cylinder during the power cycle at a substantial force, which may then be exerted on the connecting rod, and thereby on to the crankshaft.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">As such, given the similarity in form and structure between various reciprocating apparatuses (e.g., a pump, an engine, and/or a compressor) the lubrication system disclosed herein may be employed to any one or more of these or similar apparatuses. As such, although the lubrication system may be disclosed with regard to pump <b>10</b>, the lubrication system may be applicable to many types of reciprocating devices, including but not limited to pumps, compressors, and engines.</p>
