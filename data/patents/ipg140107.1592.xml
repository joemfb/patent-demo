<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a connection structural body, an aluminum electric wire tip part and a crimp terminal are connected to each other. The aluminum electric wire tip part is an exposed tip part of an insulated wire including an aluminum core wire and an insulating cover for covering the aluminum core wire. The crimp terminal includes a wire barrel section for pressure-bonding and thus connecting the aluminum electric wire tip part and is formed of a metal material having a higher potential than that of the aluminum core wire. The aluminum electric wire tip part is covered with a cover solder and/or a cover resin, pressure-bonded, and connected to the wire barrel section such that the aluminum electric wire tip part is covered with the cover and/or the cover resins, with no gap, from an insulating cover tip part to a rear end portion of the wire barrel section.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a connection structural body using a crimp terminal attachable to, for example, a connector or the like for connection of a wire harness for an automobile; and in more detail, a connection structural body in which a wire harness formed of an aluminum electric wire or an aluminum alloy electric wire is connected to a crimp terminal.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Conventionally, for gasoline automobiles, a wire harness (or a battery cable) or the like for pressure-bonding and thus connecting a tin-plated copper terminal and a copper electric wire to each other is used. Since carbon dioxide emissions from automobiles are required to be reduced today, electric automobiles or hybrid automobiles using more wire harnesses than the gasoline automobiles are in a wider use.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For all the types of automobiles including gasoline automobiles, weight reduction of a vehicle significantly influences the fuel efficiency. In an attempt to reduce the weight, aluminum (or aluminum alloy) electric wires are used for the wire harnesses, battery cables and the like, as well as copper (or copper alloy) electric wires.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, in the case where an aluminum electric wire formed of aluminum or an aluminum alloy is pressure-bonded and thus connected to a crimp terminal formed of copper or a copper alloy, when there is moisture such as condensed dew, seawater or the like between the electric wire and the crimp terminal, an electrochemical reaction occurs. Specifically, a phenomenon called &#x201c;galvanic corrosion&#x201d; that aluminum or the aluminum alloy having a low potential is corroded by contact with a metal material having a high potential used to form the crimp terminal such as tin plating, gold plating, a copper alloy or the like occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Due to the galvanic corrosion, the aluminum electric wire pressure-bonded by a pressure-bonding section of the terminal is corroded, dissolved or extinguished. This raises the electric resistance, and may prevent the electric wire from having a sufficient conducting function.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For a connection structural body in which such an aluminum electric wire formed of aluminum or an aluminum alloy is connected to a crimp terminal formed of copper, a copper alloy or the like, the following connection structure has been proposed in order to prevent galvanic corrosion of the aluminum electric wire. A part of the aluminum electric wire which is exposed as a result of being stripped of an insulating cover is inserted into a terminal having a bottom with holes into which molten solder has been injected. The exposed part of the aluminum electric wire is caulked via the solder and thus pressure-bonded to the terminal (see Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Galvanic corrosion does not occur due to an aluminum electric wire and a crimp terminal formed of the same type of material. However, in the connection structure described in Patent Document 1, a part of the aluminum electric wire from a tip of the insulating cover to a position at which the electric wire is inserted into the terminal is exposed and is not water-proof. Therefore, in the case where the crimp terminal is formed of brass, copper or the like, which is used conventionally, or in the case where there is solder, galvanic corrosion is likely to occur in the contact part of the aluminum electric wire and the crimp terminal or the soldered part of the aluminum electric wire due to difference in the ionization tendency of the materials.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As another measure against galvanic corrosion of the aluminum electric wire, more specifically as a measure to prevent galvanic corrosion when the electric wire and the metal fittings of the crimp terminal are formed of different metal materials, the following connection structure has been proposed. A part of the aluminum electric wire which is exposed as a result of being stripped of an insulating cover is covered with an intermediate cap formed of the same type of copper alloy as that of the crimp terminal, and a caulking piece is caulked to enclose the intermediate cap, thus to pressure-bond and thus fix the aluminum electric wire to the crimp terminal (see Patent Document 2).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the connection structure described in Patent Document 2 is for use in thick electric wires such as, for example, electric wires for electric power used for electric automobiles, and is difficult to be applied to thin electric wires. This connection structure also requires many components such as special members, an intermediate cap of a specific shape, elastic members and the like, and the work of inserting the components is complicated. For these reasons, the connection structure described in Patent Document 2 is disadvantageous in terms of cost.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0012">The present invention has an object of providing a connection structural body in which an electric wire and a crimp terminal formed of different metal material are connected to each other, and which is produced at low cost and with a small number of production steps, prevents galvanic corrosion, and has a conducting function with certainty.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Solution to Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0013">The present invention is directed to a connection structural body, comprising an aluminum electric wire tip part and a crimp terminal which are connected to each other. The aluminum electric wire tip part is an exposed tip part of an insulated wire including an aluminum electric wire and an insulating cover for covering the aluminum electric wire, and is exposed as a result of being stripped of a tip part of the insulating cover. The crimp terminal includes a wire barrel section for pressure-bonding and thus connecting the aluminum electric wire tip part, and is formed of a metal material having a higher potential than that of a metal material used to form the aluminum electric wire. The aluminum electric wire tip part is covered with a cover member formed of a metal material or formed of the metal material and a resin. The aluminum electric wire tip part is pressure-bonded and thus connected to the wire barrel section, such that the aluminum electric wire tip part is, in a pressure-bonded state, covered with the cover member, with no gap, from the tip part of the insulating cover to a rear end portion of the wire barrel section.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0014">In the case of, for example, a crimp terminal including a wire barrel section and an insulation barrel section, a part thereof from the insulating cover tip part to the rear end portion of the wire barrel may be a transition section between the wire barrel section and the insulation barrel section.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0015">The aluminum electric wire may be formed by twisting aluminum core wires, aluminum alloy core wires, or copper-covered aluminum core wires.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0016">The metal material having a high potential which is used for forming the crimp material may be, for example, a metal material, such as copper, tin or the like, which has a lower degree of ionization tendency than that of the aluminum electric wire, or a metal material plated with a metal material having a high potential.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0017">The metal material used for forming the cover member may be solder, or copper or the like usable to cover the aluminum electric wire.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">The resin may be a hot-melt-type resin such as a polyamide-based resin, an ester-based resin or the like; a thermosetting resin such as a silicone-based resin, a fluorine-based resin or the like; or a UV-curable resin such as an epoxy-based phenol novolac-type resin, an epoxy-based bisphenol A-type resin.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">According to the present invention, a connection structural body which is produced at low cost and with a small number of production steps, prevents galvanic corrosion, and has a conducting function with certainty can be provided even when the aluminum electric wire is pressure-bonded and thus connected to a crimp terminal formed of a metal material having a higher potential than that of the metal material used to form the aluminum electric wire.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">In more detail, the aluminum electric wire tip part stripped of the insulating cover of the insulated wire is covered with the cover member. Therefore, the aluminum electric wire tip part which is exposed from the insulated wire is prevented from being exposed to moisture such as waterdrops or the like, at low cost and with a small number of steps.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">When the cover member enters the inside of the wire barrel section, contact of the moisture and the aluminum electric wire can be prevented more certainly, and thus galvanic corrosion can be prevented or suppressed. When the resin permeates to a position around the center of the wire barrel section, a sufficient mechanical strength and a sufficient electrical strength are provided even when the resin is used as the cover member.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0022">It is more preferable that the crimp terminal is formed of, for example, solder, which is a metal material similar to the above-mentioned metal material having a high potential, such as tin or the like used to plate a metal plate for forming the crimp terminal. In this case, the effect of preventing galvanic corrosion is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">The aluminum electric wire is pressure-bonded by the wire barrel section and the cover member is present between the wire barrel section and the aluminum electric wire. Therefore, a mechanically strong connection can be provided. The wire barrel section included in the crimp terminal is usable for electric wires of a wide range of diameter, including thick electric wires such as battery cables or the like through which a large amount of current can flow and thin electric wires through which a small amount of current can flow.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">In an embodiment of the present invention, the aluminum electric wire may be formed of a copper-covered aluminum electric wire. The cover member may be formed of solder or formed of the solder and the resin, and the aluminum electric wire tip part may be covered with copper and with the solder and/or the resin, with no gap, in a pressure-bonding state.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0025">According to the present invention, even when the aluminum electric wire is pressure-bonded and thus connected to a crimp terminal formed of a metal material having a higher potential than that of the metal material used to form the aluminum electric wire, generation of galvanic corrosion can be prevented more certainly and a conducting function can be provided with certainly.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">In an embodiment of the present invention, the metal material may be formed of solder.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027">According to the present invention, the cover member is formed of solder or formed of the solder and a resin. Therefore, the aluminum electric wire can be easily covered with the cover member. Thus, a connection structural body preventing galvanic corrosion and having a conducting function with certainly can be provided at low cost and with a small number of production steps.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">In an embodiment of the present invention, the cover member may permeate into the aluminum electric wire inside the insulating cover.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">The inside of the insulating cover is in a part which is rearward with respect to the aluminum electric wire tip part exposed as a result of being stripped of the insulating cover, and is inner with respect to the tip of the remaining insulating cover. More specifically, the inside of the insulating cover refers to an area between the aluminum electric wire and the insulating cover and also an area among wire components of the aluminum electric wire inside the insulating cover, in the above-mentioned part.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">According to the present invention, the water-proof effect provided by the cover member can be improved. In more detail, the aluminum electric wire is covered with a cover member formed of solder or a resin, and the solder or the resin permeates into the inside of the insulating cover. Therefore, a highly water-proof structure can be provided at low cost. Thus, galvanic corrosion of the aluminum electric wire can be prevented more certainly.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">It is desirable that the cover member permeating into the inside of the insulating cover is a resin. In this case, when the resin also covers the outer surface of the insulating cover, the water-proof effect is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">In an embodiment of the present invention, the resin may be formed of a hot-melt-type resin having a kinematic viscosity of 5000 to 20000 mPa&#xb7;s at or in the vicinity of melting point of the solder.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">According to the present invention, the resin can be used as a cover member easily and securely. In more detail, when a hot-melt-type resin which is melted at the melting point of solder is used, the heat generated for soldering the aluminum electric wire tip part is used so that the aluminum electric wire tip part can be covered with the solder and the resin in one step. The hot-melt-type resin has a kinetic viscosity of 5000 to 20000 mPa&#xb7;s at or in the vicinity of the melting point of solder. Therefore, the resin melted by the heat of soldering is closely bonded to the solder and the aluminum electric wire tip part before being solidified. Thus, the aluminum electric wire can be fixed with certainty without the resin being dropped.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">In an embodiment of the present invention, a barrel piece included in the wire barrel section may be a curve-edged barrel piece having a convexed curve along an edge thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">The curve-edged barrel piece having a convexed curve along an edge thereof may be, for example, a semicircular barrel piece having a semicircular curve along an edge thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">In the case where the barrel piece of the wire barrel of the crimp terminal is rectangular, when the aluminum electric wire tip part covered with a cover member formed of solder or a resin is pressure-bonded to the wire barrel section, the cover member may possibly be cracked by the barrel piece of the wire barrel section. When this occurs, moisture may permeate into the aluminum electric wire tip part inside the cover member, which may cause galvanic corrosion of the aluminum electric wire.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0037">Since the present invention prevents the cover member from being cracked, the galvanic corrosion of the aluminum electric wire due to the cracking of the cover member can be prevented.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantageous Effects of Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0038">The present invention provides a connection structural body in which an electric wire and a crimp terminal formed of different metal material are connected to each other, and which is produced at low cost and with a small number of production steps, prevents galvanic corrosion, and has a conducting function with certainty.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> respectively show cross-sectional views of crimp terminals <b>10</b> of various patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0051">First, the crimp terminal <b>10</b> in the first pattern will be described. The crimp terminal <b>10</b> is of a female type, and includes, from a forward end to a rearward end in a longitudinal direction X thereof, a box section <b>11</b> for allowing insertion of a male tab of a male terminal (not shown), a wire barrel section <b>12</b> located rearward to the box section <b>11</b> with a first transition <b>16</b> of a prescribed length interposed therebetween, and an insulation barrel section <b>14</b> located rearward to the wire barrel section <b>12</b> with a second transition <b>17</b> of a prescribed length interposed therebetween. These elements are integrally formed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0052">The wire barrel section <b>12</b> caulks and thus pressure-bonds an aluminum core wire <b>202</b> of an insulated wire <b>200</b>, and the insulation barrel section <b>14</b> caulks and thus fixes the insulating cover <b>201</b> of the insulated wire <b>200</b>. Thus, the connection structural body <b>1</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0053">The crimp terminal <b>10</b> is an open barrel-type terminal which is formed as follows. A copper alloy strip formed of brass or the like having a tin-plated surface is formed into a desired shape and bent to be three-dimensional. The box section <b>11</b> is formed of an inverted hollow quadrangular prism. The box section <b>11</b> accommodates a contact piece <b>11</b><i>a </i>which is bent rearward in the longitudinal direction X and has a contact convex section <b>11</b><i>b</i>, which is to be in contact with the male tab of the male terminal to be inserted.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>a</i>), the wire barrel section <b>12</b> in a pre-pressure-bonding state includes wire barrel pieces <b>13</b> extending in oblique outer upper directions from both sides of a barrel bottom section in a width direction Y. The wire barrel section <b>12</b> is U-shaped when seen in a rear view, and is generally rectangular when seen in a side view.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">Similarly, the insulation barrel section <b>14</b> in a pre-pressure-bonding state includes insulation barrel pieces <b>15</b> extending in oblique outer upper directions from both sides of a barrel bottom section in the width direction Y. The insulation barrel section <b>14</b> is U-shaped when seen in a rear view.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">The insulated wire <b>200</b> is formed as follows. Along with the recent trend for reduced size and weight, the aluminum core wire <b>202</b> is formed by twisting extra fine aluminum wires, which are thinner than the conventional twisted wires. The aluminum core wire <b>202</b> is covered with the insulating cover <b>201</b> formed of an insulating resin.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">In more detail, the aluminum core wire <b>202</b> is formed by twisting aluminum alloy wires such that the aluminum core wire <b>202</b> has a cross-sectional area size of 0.75 mm<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0058">Apart of the insulating cover <b>201</b> covering a tip part of the aluminum core wire <b>202</b> is stripped off to expose the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a</i>. The aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>is covered with the cover solder <b>203</b>. For the cover solder <b>203</b>, Sn&#x2014;Zn solder or the like, which is easily agreeable with aluminum, is used. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>is immersed in the solder bath <b>300</b> containing the molten solder <b>203</b><i>a </i>of a temperature of about 300&#xb0; C. Thus, the cover solder <b>203</b> is attached to the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">In this case, it is desirable that the cover solder <b>203</b> has a thickness with which the cover solder <b>203</b> is not cracked by being pressure-bonded by the wire barrel pieces <b>13</b>. For soldering, the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>may be immersed in the molten solder <b>203</b><i>a </i>which is vibrated by ultrasonic waves.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">As described above, the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>is immersed in the molten solder <b>203</b><i>a </i>to be soldered. Therefore, because of a capillary phenomenon caused between wire components of the aluminum core wire <b>202</b>, the molten solder <b>203</b><i>a </i>permeates into the inside of the insulating cover <b>201</b> from an insulating cover tip part <b>201</b><i>a </i>of the insulating cover <b>201</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>b</i>)).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">The aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>covered with the cover solder <b>203</b> in this manner is caulked by the wire barrel section <b>12</b>, and the insulating cover <b>201</b> is caulked by the insulation barrel section <b>14</b>. Thus, the connection structural body <b>1</b> including the crimp terminal <b>10</b> and the insulated wire <b>200</b> which are pressure-bonded and thus connected to each other with an electric connection strength and a mechanical connection strength is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">The aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>may be pressure-bonded and thus connected to the wire barrel section <b>12</b> by caulking before the cover solder <b>203</b> is completely solidified.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">Now, a connection structural body <b>1</b><i>a </i>in which the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>is covered with a combination of the cover solder <b>203</b> and the cover resin <b>204</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">The crimp terminal <b>10</b>, the insulated wire <b>200</b> and the cover solder <b>203</b> used in the connection structural body <b>1</b><i>a </i>are the same as those of the connection structural body <b>1</b> and will not be described in detail. As the cover resin <b>204</b>, a hot-melt-type resin having a kinematic viscosity of 5000 to 20000 mPa&#xb7;s at or in the vicinity of the melting point of the cover solder <b>203</b> is used.</p>

The length of the electric wire was 100 cm, and an end of the electric wire opposite to the box section of the terminal was fixed to the excitation table. The vibration test was performed on the terminal itself with no other elements. For performing the corrosion test, the electric wire was cut short such that the length from the box section to the opposite end would be about 10 cm.

<p id="p-0099" num="0099">As shown in Table 1, based on the measurement of the initial low-voltage electric resistance, the following has been confirmed. When the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>or the copper-covered aluminum electric wire tip part <b>205</b><i>a </i>is covered with the cover solder <b>203</b>, a conducting function is provided with certainty. However, when the cover resin <b>204</b> permeates into the entire area of the wire barrel section <b>12</b>, the conductivity between the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>or the copper-covered aluminum electric wire tip part <b>205</b><i>a </i>and the wire barrel section <b>12</b> is lowered. As a result, a sufficient conducting function is not guaranteed.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0100">Based on the measurement of the resistance increasing value after the corrosion test, it has been confirmed that when the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>or the copper-covered aluminum electric wire tip part <b>205</b><i>a </i>is covered with the cover solder <b>203</b> and/or the cover resin <b>204</b>, generation of galvanic corrosion is prevented or suppressed and a sufficient conducting function is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0101">It has been confirmed that when the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a</i>, or the copper-covered aluminum electric wire tip part <b>205</b><i>a</i>, in the vicinity of the insulating cover tip part <b>201</b><i>a </i>is covered with the cover resin <b>204</b>, a sufficient effect of preventing galvanic corrosion and a sufficient conducting function are provided even after the vibration test.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0102">A conceivable reason for this is the following. In the case where a small gap such as a crack or the like is made by vibration in a part of the cover solder <b>203</b> which is pressure-bonded by the wire barrel section <b>12</b>, the effect of preventing galvanic corrosion is reduced. Nonetheless, when a part of the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>or the copper-covered aluminum electric wire tip part <b>205</b><i>a </i>which is in the vicinity of the insulating cover tip part <b>201</b><i>a </i>is covered with the cover resin <b>204</b>, the durability against vibration is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0103">By contrast, in test bodies A and C in which a part of the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>which is in the vicinity of the insulating cover tip part <b>201</b><i>a </i>is not covered with the cover resin <b>204</b>, the insulating cover tip part <b>201</b><i>a </i>contacts the cover solder <b>203</b>. As a result, the insulating cover <b>201</b> is deteriorated due to the heat of the cover solder <b>203</b>. Therefore, the effect of preventing the galvanic corrosion is reduced in the vicinity of the insulating cover tip part <b>201</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0104">The results of the corrosion test after the vibration test of test body C are better than those of test body A. A conceivable reason for this is the following. In test body C, the cover solder <b>203</b> permeates into the inside of the insulating cover <b>201</b>. Therefore, even when the insulating cover tip part <b>201</b><i>a </i>is deteriorated, the effect of preventing galvanic corrosion by the cover solder <b>203</b> can be maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0105">The results of the corrosion test and also the results of the corrosion test after the vibration test of test body D are inferior to those of the other test bodies. A conceivable reason for this is the following. The border position between the cover solder <b>203</b> and the cover resin <b>204</b> matches the rear end position of the wire barrel section <b>12</b>, which is significantly deformed. Due to the significant deformation of the wire barrel section <b>12</b>, the border face between the cover solder <b>203</b> and the cover resin <b>204</b> is damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0106">Based on the results of the corrosion test after the vibration test, the following has been confirmed. When the copper-covered aluminum electric wire tip part <b>205</b><i>a </i>is covered with the cover solder <b>203</b> and/or the cover resin <b>204</b>, generation of galvanic corrosion is prevented and a sufficient conducting function is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0107">However, in comparative test body B, after the corrosion test, aluminum of the copper-covered aluminum electric wire tip part <b>205</b><i>a </i>was exposed at the edge of the barrel section due to cracks, and the aluminum conductor was eluted. The effect of preventing galvanic corrosion is considered to be reduced for this reason.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0108">In the crimp terminal <b>10</b> described above, the wire barrel pieces <b>13</b> of the wire barrel section <b>12</b> are generally rectangular when seen in a side view. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>a</i>), semicircular barrel pieces <b>13</b><i>a </i>having a convexed curved-edge (e.g., generally semicircular shape) when seen in a side view may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0109">In a connection structural body <b>1</b><i>b </i>having such a structure, when the crimp terminal <b>10</b> is pressure-bonded to the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>or the copper-covered aluminum electric wire tip part <b>205</b><i>a </i>covered with the cover solder <b>203</b> and/or the cover resin <b>204</b>, the cover solder <b>203</b> and/or the cover resin <b>204</b> is prevented from being cracked even when the semicircular barrel pieces <b>13</b><i>a </i>having a generally semicircular shape bite into the cover solder <b>203</b> and/or the cover resin <b>204</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Such a connection structural body <b>1</b><i>b </i>prevents or suppresses generation of galvanic corrosion, has a sufficient conducting function, and thus is highly durable.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0110">An effect confirming test 2 was performed on the connection structural body <b>1</b><i>b </i>including the crimp terminal <b>10</b> which has the semicircular barrel pieces <b>13</b><i>a</i>. The results are shown in Table 2. For the corrosion test, the test body was suspended in a sealed tank, and a saline solution of a temperature of 35&#xb1;5&#xb0; C., a salt concentration of 5&#xb1;1 mass %, a specific gravity of 1.0268 to 1.0423, and pH 6.5 to 7.2 was sprayed for 182 hours and 500 hours at a pressure of 68.6 to 176.5 kPa. The other test conditions and evaluation method are the same as those of the effect confirming test 1 described above.</p>

<p id="p-0112" num="0112">As shown in Table 2, the following has been confirmed. When the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>or the copper-covered aluminum electric wire tip part <b>205</b><i>a </i>is covered with the cover solder <b>203</b> and the cover resin <b>204</b>, generation of galvanic corrosion is prevented or suppressed and a sufficient conducting function is provided in the case where the spraying time is 182 hours, regardless of whether the rectangular wire barrel pieces <b>13</b> is used or the semicircular wire barrel pieces <b>13</b><i>a </i>are used.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0113">However, it has also been confirmed that in the case where the spraying time is 500 hours, when the rectangular wire barrel pieces <b>13</b> are used, the effect of preventing galvanic corrosion provided by the cover solder <b>203</b> and the cover resin <b>204</b> is reduced, and a sufficient conducting function is not guaranteed.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0114">Based on the results of the effect confirming test 2 described above, it has been confirmed that the connection structural body <b>1</b><i>b</i>, including the semicircular barrel pieces <b>13</b><i>a </i>and having the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>or the copper-covered aluminum electric wire tip part <b>205</b><i>a </i>covered with the cover solder <b>203</b> and/or the cover resin <b>204</b>, prevents or suppresses generation of galvanic corrosion and has a sufficient conducting function with a high level of durability.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0115">Next, in order to increase the load on the insulating cover tip part <b>201</b><i>a</i>, which is the edge at which the electric wire is stripped of the insulating cover, a state where the crimp terminal <b>10</b> was not completely inserted into the cavity was assumed. Specifically, the crimp terminal <b>10</b> was set such that the entrance of the cavity would generally match the border face between the insulating cover tip part <b>201</b><i>a </i>and the cover solder <b>203</b>. On test bodies A through E and G through K and comparative test body C, the vibration test was performed, and then the corrosion test was performed. The low-voltage electric resistance and the strength of the pressure-bonding section were measured (effect confirming test 3). The vibration test and the corrosion test were performed in substantially the same manner as in the effect confirming test 1, except that the terminal in the state of being inserted into the connector was used as each sample, not merely the terminal itself.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0116">The effect confirming test 3 was performed on 20 samples for each standard. The resistance value and the galvanic corrosion state were measured and observed on all of the samples.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0117">The low-voltage electric resistance was measured by use of a resistance meter (ACm&#x3a9;HiTESTER3560; produced by Hioki E.E. Corporation) by a 4-terminal method. The wire barrel section <b>12</b> side of the box section <b>11</b> was set as a positive electrode, and the aluminum electric wire tip part <b>202</b><i>a </i>at the end of the aluminum core wire <b>202</b> opposite to the terminal and the copper-covered aluminum electric wire tip part <b>205</b><i>a </i>at the end of the copper-covered aluminum core wire <b>205</b> opposite to the terminal were each set as a negative electrode. The low-voltage electric resistance was measured at room temperature after drying.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0118">The measured resistance value is considered to be a total of the resistances at the pressure-bonding points of the aluminum core wire <b>202</b> or the copper-covered aluminum core wire <b>205</b>, of the crimp terminal <b>10</b>, and of the wire barrel section <b>12</b>. The resistance of the aluminum core wire <b>202</b> and the copper-covered aluminum core wire <b>205</b> is not ignorable. Therefore, the resistance of the aluminum core wire <b>202</b> or the copper-covered aluminum core wire <b>205</b> was subtracted from the measured resistance value, and the resultant value was set as the low-voltage electric resistance of the wire barrel section <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0119">When all the 20 samples had a resistance increasing value of less than 1 m&#x3a9;, the test body was evaluated as &#x201c;&#x229a;&#x201d;.

When more than three of the 20 samples had a resistance increasing value of 1 m&#x3a9; or more and less than 3 m&#x3a9; and the remaining sample (s) had a resistance increasing value of less than 1 m&#x3a9;, the test body was evaluated as &#x201c;&#x394;&#x201d;. When at least one of the 20 samples had a resistance increasing value of 3 m&#x3a9; or more, the test body was evaluated as &#x201c;x&#x201d;. The results of the test are shown in Table 3.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0122">On test bodies A through E and G through K and comparative test body C with a 10 cm-long electric wire, a thermal shock test (effect confirming test 4) was performed as follows.

A pressure-bonding state which occurs when, for example, the developed length of the wire barrel piece <b>13</b> is short with respect to the cross-sectional area size of the conductor including the solder, the resin and the cover copper was assumed. Specifically, on test bodies A through E and G through K and comparative test body C, the thermal shock test (effect confirming test 5) was performed by use of the aluminum core wire <b>202</b> or the copper-covered aluminum core wire <b>205</b> having a cross-sectional area size of the conductor of 2 mm<sup>2</sup>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) shows an example of sufficient pressure-bonding state, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>b</i>) shows an example of pressure-bonding state which is insufficient as compared with that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8(</figref><i>a</i>) but is practically usable. The thermal shock test was performed in substantially the same manner as in the first effect confirming test 4. The results are shown in Table</p>
