<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY CLAIM</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application is a U.S. National Phase of International Patent Application No. PCT/NL2009/050673, filed Nov. 6, 2009, which claims priority to Dutch Patent Application No. 1036169, filed Nov. 7 2008, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a device for sorting products, comprising a frame, an endless drivable flexible conveying element, successive elongated carriers, which are each coupled to the conveying element via coupling means for being conveyed in a conveying direction along an endless conveying path, which carriers extend transversely to the conveying direction, and pusher elements which are each movable along a carrier.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Such a device is known from Dutch laid-open application NL 9000393. In said known sorting device, the coupling means are at least substantially made up of a vertically oriented plate, which is provided on opposite sides of each carrier. Said plates are connected to an associated conveyor chain on the one hand and to the associated carrier on the other hand. A drawback of the known sorting device is the time required for the maintenance thereof, for example for replacing one carrier or a number of carriers and/or a (number) of pusher shoe(s), or for carrying out maintenance work on stationary guides intended to mate with the pusher shoes that are movable along the carriers, which guides are disposed under the carriers. Such operations involve dismantling the device to a significant extent.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The object of the present invention is to provide a device as described in the opening paragraph, in which maintenance operations as described above can be carried out more quickly and in a simpler manner, whilst in addition also the installation of the sorting device can take place more quickly and in a simpler manner.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to accomplish that object, the coupling means comprise a supporting part and a supported part supported by said supporting part, as well as connecting means for detachably connecting the supporting part and the supported part together, wherein the supporting part is coupled to the conveying element and the supported part is connected to a carrier, and wherein the connecting means can be accessed from the upper side of the supported part for effecting the connection between the supporting part and the supported part. Because of the use of a supporting part and a supported part, which are detachably connected together, with access to the connecting means being possible from the upper side of the supported part, maintenance/installation can take place in a relatively simple manner by detaching the supported part from the supporting part from the upper side. Thus, a carrier can be removed from the conveying element in a simple and quick manner, for example for replacing the carrier or the associated pusher element or for gaining access to the area thereunder.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,279 further discloses a device for sorting products, in which, similarly to the aforesaid known device according to NL 9000393, the coupling means are made up of a vertically oriented plate, which is provided with carriers at opposite ends. In the known device according to U.S. Pat. No. 5,595,279, however, respective pairs of adjacent carriers are attached to one plate at their short ends. One pusher shoe is provided for each combination of two carriers thus formed, which pusher shoe is movable along said combination. At their short ends, the carriers are provided with an end plate, which holds the combination of two carriers together. Upon assembly, the combination is secured to the vertical plate by means of two screws, which are screwed through the end plate in lateral, horizontal direction, i.e. in the longitudinal direction of the carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In an advantageous preferred embodiment, the connecting means are elongate in shape and extend in a vertical plane oriented parallel to the conveying direction, which intersects the supported part.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a constructionally simple yet robust preferred embodiment, the supported part is provided with a through hole which extends in said vertical plane, into which hole the connecting means extend.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is furthermore advantageous in this regard if a threaded hole is provided in an upper edge of the supporting part, whilst the through hole in the supported part is arranged in line with the threaded hole, with the connecting means comprising a screw which extends through the through hole into the threaded hole. Thus, a robust connection between the supporting part and the supported part is provided in a simple manner, which connection can be accessed from the upper side of the supported part.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In principle it is possible within the framework of the present invention for the carrier and the supported part to be made up of a single, integral part. For constructional reasons it is preferable, however, if the supported part is coupled to a carrier. This implies that the carrier and the supported part are separate parts, which are either detachably or non-detachably, i.e. permanently, coupled together.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Quite preferably, the supported part can be moved away from the supporting part in the non-operative condition of the connecting means, in a direction of movement which is oriented parallel to a vertical plane extending parallel to the conveying direction, for decoupling a carrier and the conveying element from each other. Thus, no use is made upon decoupling the supporting part and the supported part from each other of the space that is present beyond the ends of the carrier in question, including the associated supporting parts and supporting parts, seen in the longitudinal direction of the carriers. As a result, said space remains available for guards that are usually present at the ends in question, and which thus need not be removed (temporarily) for decoupling the supporting part and the supported part from each other. Moving the supported part in the direction of movement can take place by means of translating movement but also by means of pivoting movement, or by means of a combination of the two.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The direction of movement preferably includes an angle with the plane that is oriented perpendicular to the conveying direction, which angle ranges between 0 degrees and 45 degrees. The most optimum angle will depend on the geometry, more specifically the cross-section, of the successive carriers.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In particular if adjacent carriers do not overlap, seen in the conveying direction, it is preferable if the direction of movement is oriented perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the carrier and to the conveying direction.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Quite preferably, the connecting means can be accessed from a direction of access which includes an angle with the plane defined by the longitudinal direction of the carrier and the conveying direction for the purpose of placing the connecting means in the non-operative position. Preferably, said angle is at least 30 degrees, even more preferably 90 degrees. This provides the technician with a maximum amount of space for carrying out the operations required for placing the connecting means in the non-operative position or, in other words, for decoupling the supporting part and the supported part from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Preferably, a running wheel is coupled to the supporting part for rotation about a preferably horizontal axis of rotation extending transversely to the conveying direction. The running wheel and the carrier are thus connected to different parts (the supporting part and the supported part, respectively), which makes removal easier.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Such an advantage also applies if a guide wheel is coupled to the supporting part for rotation about a vertical axis of rotation, so, that the guide wheel and the carrier are connected to different parts.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an important preferred embodiment, the circumference of the supported part is at least substantially the same as the circumference of the associated carrier, or the circumference of the supported part falls at least within the circumference of the associated carrier. It is further advantageous if the circumference of the supported part is at least substantially the same as the inner circumference of the pusher shoe that is movable along the associated carrier, or falls within the latter inner circumference. After the supporting part and the supported part have been decoupled from each other, a pusher element can thus be moved over the supported part onto the carrier or, on the contrary, off said carrier, for example if a pusher element needs to be replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For coupling the supported part to the associated carrier, it is preferable if an insertion portion of the supported part is inserted, preferably clampingly, into a cavity of a carrier from one end of said carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Quite preferably, the connecting means comprise snap means for locking the connecting means in the operative condition. A snap connection is easy to release, possibly by means of a suitable tool.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Preferably, the connecting means form an integral part of one of the supported part and the supporting part. This advantage applies in particular when the aforesaid snap means are used, which snap means preferably form an integral part of the supporting part.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The supporting part and the supported part are made of plastic material, furthermore preferably injection-moulded, making it possible to incorporate as much functionality as possible in one integral part.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> show a part of a sorting device <b>1</b> of the type as disclosed in Dutch laid open application NL 9000393. The sorting device <b>1</b> comprises an elongated carrier <b>2</b>, which is made up of an extruded aluminium section. The carrier <b>2</b> is intended on the one hand for supporting thereon, together with other carriers <b>2</b>, products to be sorted, and on the other hand for guiding a pusher shoe (not shown) therealong for sorting out a product supported by the carrier <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sorting device <b>1</b> further comprises, at either end of the carrier <b>2</b>, an endless conveyor chain <b>3</b> extending in the conveying direction of the sorting device <b>1</b>. Each carrier <b>2</b> is coupled at both ends thereof, by means of a coupling element <b>4</b>, to the conveyor chain <b>3</b> that is present at said ends. Because of the presence of the coupling element <b>4</b>, the carriers <b>2</b> and the products to be sorted that are present thereon are moved in the conveying direction when the conveyor chain <b>3</b> is driven by drive means {not shown). The coupling element <b>4</b> is made up of a supporting part <b>5</b> and a supported part <b>6</b>, which is supported on the supporting part <b>5</b>. The opposite coupling element <b>4</b>, which is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> and which is also associated with the carrier <b>2</b> shown in the figures, is mirror-symmetrical to the coupling element <b>4</b> as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The supported part <b>6</b> is connected to the carrier <b>2</b>. The supported part <b>6</b> is to that end provided with a number of clamping elements <b>11</b><i>a</i>, <b>11</b><i>b</i>, which can be clampingly inserted into correspondingly shaped chambers <b>12</b><i>a</i>, <b>12</b><i>a </i>in the carrier <b>2</b>. On the outer side, the supported part <b>6</b> comprises a lateral member <b>60</b> having a lateral surface <b>13</b>, whose circumference at least substantially corresponds to the cross-section of the carrier <b>2</b>, so that a pusher shoe can be moved over the supported part <b>6</b> onto the carrier <b>2</b> or off the carrier <b>2</b>. The inner side <b>14</b> of the lateral member <b>60</b> forms a stop surface, via which the supported part <b>6</b> abuts against the circumferential edge <b>15</b> of the carrier <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The supporting part <b>5</b> is connected to the conveyor chain <b>3</b>. The conveyor chain <b>3</b> to that end comprises regularly spaced-apart, outwardly extending pivot pins <b>21</b>, which each clampingly extend into a passage <b>22</b> provided in an associated supporting part <b>5</b>. On the outer side of the supporting part <b>5</b>, the passage <b>22</b> is defined by a number of clamping segment members <b>23</b>, onto which the running wheel <b>7</b> can be clamped. Locking the running wheel <b>7</b>, and thus also the supporting part <b>5</b>, to the conveyor chain <b>5</b> is done by means of a stop ring <b>24</b> and a locking ring <b>25</b>, which latter ring slips into a groove <b>26</b> at the free end of the projecting pivot pin <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The supporting part <b>5</b> is substantially plate-shaped and comprises an elongated opening <b>31</b>, which can accommodate part of a guide wheel <b>8</b>. A horizontal supporting surface <b>32</b> extends from the bottom side (at least in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>} of the opening <b>31</b>, which supporting surface <b>32</b> is provided with a passage <b>33</b>. The guide wheel <b>8</b> is coupled for rotation about a vertical axis of rotation to the supporting part by means of a rotation pin <b>34</b>, a free end <b>35</b> of which extends through the passage <b>33</b>. At the bottom side of the supporting surface <b>32</b>, the guide wheel <b>8</b> is locked by means of a locking ring <b>36</b>, which slips into a groove <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Successive supporting parts <b>5</b> partially overlap, seen in the conveying direction. The supporting part <b>5</b> is to that end narrowed at the front side (numeral <b>41</b>), on the side that faces the conveyor chain <b>3</b>. A recess <b>43</b> is provided in the narrowed part <b>41</b> for accommodating a pivot pin <b>21</b> associated with an adjacent supporting part <b>5</b>. The diameter of the pin <b>21</b> is substantially the same as the height of the recess <b>43</b>, so that the supporting part <b>5</b> remains oriented parallel to the conveyor chain <b>3</b>. At the rear side of each supporting part <b>5</b>, where the passage <b>22</b> is provided, the supporting part is narrowed (numeral <b>42</b>) on the side remote from the conveyor chain. The narrowed parts <b>41</b> and <b>42</b> of successive supporting members <b>5</b> overlap.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the assembled condition, the supporting part <b>5</b> and the supported part <b>6</b> are coupled by means of a snap connection. Said snap connection comprises vertically oriented spring lips <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, at the upper free ends of which snap hooks <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> are provided. The spring lips <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> extend from the upper side of the supporting part <b>5</b> and form an integral part of the supporting part <b>5</b>. Passages <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) for the spring lips <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> are provided in the lateral member <b>60</b>. By lowering the supported part <b>6</b>, or at least the lateral member <b>60</b> thereof, over the spring lips <b>51</b>, <b>52</b>, with the snap hooks <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> scraping along a wall of the passages <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> with a certain bias, the snap hooks <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> will spring back at a certain point at the ends of the walls in question and hook into the supported part <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Starting from the assembled condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a carrier <b>2</b> can be removed in a simple manner by pressing the snap hooks <b>53</b>, <b>54</b> together, whether or not by means of suitable tools to be passed through the mouths <b>62</b>, <b>63</b> of the passages <b>71</b>, <b>72</b>, and subsequently moving the carrier <b>2</b> and the associated supported parts <b>6</b> upwards, thereby releasing the snap connection between the supporting part <b>5</b> and the supported part <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When products are being sorted, translating movement of pusher shoes causes products to move along the carriers <b>2</b>, away from the conveying device, seen in the longitudinal direction of the carrier, or external (pusher) means move products onto the carriers of the conveying device. It is important in this regard that the products cannot get near the conveyor chain <b>3</b>, the running wheels <b>7</b>, the guide wheels <b>8</b> and parts at least associated therewith. In the assembled condition of the sorting device, the sorting device therefore comprises guards fixedly mounted to a frame of the sorting device, which guards extend in the conveying direction <b>9</b>, and which are disposed at the sides of the carriers, extending over the whole of the conveyor chain <b>3</b> etc. When a product is thus forced sideways off the conveying device, the product in question will slide over the upper surface of a carrier (or carriers), via the upper surface of the supported part, onto or over the guard, and is then further discharged. It is important, therefore, that the guards abut lateral surfaces of the supported parts, such as the lateral surface <b>13</b> of the supported part <b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, as closely as possible, thus forming one continuous surface, as it were, with the upper side of the supported part <b>6</b> and the carrier <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A major advantage of the device according to the present invention is that the connecting means between a supporting part and the associated supported part, such as the snap hooks <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> of the supporting part <b>5</b>, can be accessed from the upper side of the associated supported part <b>6</b>. Within this context, the phrase &#x201c;from the upper side&#x201d; is understood to mean that the snap hooks can be accessed from above, within the vertical range defined by the lateral surface <b>13</b> (i.e. on the side of the carrier) of the supported part <b>6</b>. The aforesaid guards thus need not be removed when a carrier is to be removed, so that said removal will take less time. This also applies, for that matter, to the further preferred embodiments of devices according to the present invention yet to be described hereinafter. This in contrast to the known, prior art devices as described above, in which the connecting means can be accessed from the side of a coupling element, and in which guards need to be removed first when a carrier is to be removed in order to make the connecting means accessible at all to tools.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref><i>b </i>relate to a sorting device <b>101</b>, being a second preferred embodiment of a sorting device according to the present invention. The sorting device <b>101</b> is to a certain extent comparable to the sorting device <b>1</b> as regards its construction. Below, in particular those aspects of the sorting device <b>101</b> that are different from the sorting device <b>1</b> will be discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The sorting device <b>101</b> comprises a supporting part <b>102</b> and a supported part <b>103</b>, which is supported on the supporting part <b>102</b> in use. Both parts <b>102</b>, <b>103</b> are injection-moulded plastic products. The supporting part <b>102</b> comprises a running wheel <b>104</b> and a guide wheel <b>105</b>, it is coupled to a conveyor chain <b>130</b> associated with the sorting device <b>101</b>, in a manner comparable to the manner in which the supporting part <b>5</b> is coupled to the conveyor chain <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The supported part <b>103</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>) corresponds as regards its shape to the carrier <b>106</b> to which the supported part <b>103</b> is connected, which carrier is shown along part of its length in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. The supported part <b>103</b> has the aforesaid corresponding shape, in particular as far as the upper side of the carrier <b>106</b> is concerned. For the rest it is in any case relevant to note that the circumference of the supported part <b>103</b> falls within the inner circumference (vertical cross-section) of the pusher shoe that is movable along the associated carrier, so that pusher shoes associated with the carrier <b>106</b> can slide over the supported part <b>103</b>. Preferably, the circumference of the supported part <b>103</b> also falls within the circumference (vertical cross-section) of the carrier <b>106</b>. The supported part <b>103</b> is coupled to the associated carrier <b>106</b> by means of dowel pins <b>107</b>, which are inserted into through holes, which (as shown for the carrier <b>2</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) extend through the carrier <b>106</b>. In principle this connection between the supported part <b>103</b> and the carrier <b>106</b> is a permanent connection.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The geometry of the bottom edge <b>110</b> of the supported part <b>103</b> and the upper edge <b>111</b> of the supporting part <b>102</b> are to a significant extent complementary. Thus the upper edge <b>11</b> comprises two semicircular recesses <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, in which semicircular ears <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> at the bottom edge <b>110</b> of the supported part <b>103</b> fit, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> for the situation in which the supporting part <b>102</b> fully supports the supported part <b>103</b> in the coupled condition. The bottom edge <b>110</b> and the upper edge <b>111</b> further comprise raised edge portions <b>116</b>, <b>117</b> over practically their entire length, which edge portions are positioned beside each other in the coupled condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The effect that is thus achieved is that the supporting part <b>102</b> and the supported part <b>103</b> will be correctly positioned relative to each other, also in the longitudinal direction of the carrier <b>102</b>, in the coupled condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The supported part <b>103</b> to that end further comprises two stop plate portions <b>118</b>, <b>119</b> which, in the coupled condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, abut against the side of the supporting part <b>102</b> that faces the carrier <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The supporting part <b>102</b> and the supported part <b>103</b> further comprise two mating curved hook members <b>120</b>, <b>121</b>, which enable the supported part <b>103</b> to pivot relative to the supporting part <b>102</b> about a virtual pivot axis which extends horizontally, parallel to the longitudinal direction of the carrier <b>106</b> through the centre of the hook member <b>120</b>. This is in particular advantageous because of the parallelogram-like cross-section of the carrier <b>106</b>, which makes it more advantageous upon coupling the supported part <b>103</b> to the supporting part <b>102</b> or, in other words, the carrier <b>106</b> to the conveyor chain <b>130</b>, to insert the carrier <b>106</b> at a slight angle between the two adjacent carriers instead of exactly vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To couple the supported part <b>103</b> to the supporting part <b>102</b> in the situation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a threaded hole <b>122</b> is provided in the upper edge <b>111</b> of the supporting part <b>102</b>, whilst a through hole <b>123</b> having an enlarged diameter at the upper side is formed in the supported part <b>103</b>, in line with said threaded hole <b>122</b>. The coupling in question between the supported part <b>103</b> and the supporting part <b>102</b> is effected by tightening a socket screw <b>124</b> which extends through the through hole <b>123</b> and which engages in the threaded hole <b>122</b> with its screw thread. Said coupling can be released again just as easily, of course, by turning the socket screw in the opposite direction. The threaded hole <b>122</b>, the through hole <b>123</b> as well as the socket screw <b>124</b> thus extend in a vertical plane which is oriented parallel to the conveying direction <b>9</b> and which intersects the supported part <b>103</b>. The same applies, for that matter, to the spring lips <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> as described in the foregoing.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">To tighten the socket screw <b>124</b>, access to said socket screw can be gained in a very simple manner from the upper side of the supported part <b>103</b>. Thus it is not necessary in the preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref><i>b</i>, no more so than in the above-described preferred embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>, to remove guards of the sorting device first when a carrier is to be removed, since the connecting means, more specifically the socket screw <b>124</b>, can be accessed from the upper side of the supported part <b>103</b> for effecting or releasing, as the case may be, the connection between the supported part <b>102</b> and the supported part <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">An alternative embodiment of the sorting device <b>101</b> does not comprise the supported part <b>103</b> as a separate part, whilst the geometry of the upper edge <b>111</b> of the supporting part <b>102</b> is adapted to the geometry of the underside of the carrier <b>106</b>. The through hole <b>123</b> is formed in the ends of the carrier <b>106</b>, which is slightly extended, so that the holes <b>123</b> will be aligned with the threaded holes <b>122</b>. It is also conceivable to provide two through holes for each end of the carrier <b>106</b>, which holes are located one behind another, seen in the conveying direction. It stands to reason that also the position of the threaded holes <b>122</b> and the number of threaded holes will have to be adapted in that case. The supported part is integrated in (the ends of) the carrier <b>106</b> in this alternative embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref> relate to a sorting device <b>201</b>, being a third preferred embodiment of a sorting device according to the invention. The sorting device <b>201</b> is quite similar to the previously discussed sorting devices <b>101</b> and <b>1</b>. Hereinafter in particular those aspects that set the sorting device <b>201</b> apart from the sorting devices <b>1</b> and <b>101</b> will be discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The sorting device <b>201</b> comprises a supporting part <b>202</b> of plastic material and a supported part <b>203</b> of plastic material. The supporting part <b>202</b> is connected to a conveyor chain (not shown), whilst the supported part <b>203</b> is connected to a carrier <b>204</b>, being supported on the supporting part <b>202</b> in use (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). The supported part <b>203</b> is substantially plate-shaped and comprises two projections <b>205</b>, <b>206</b> on the side remote from the carrier <b>204</b>, which projections extend from the main plate <b>207</b> of the supported part <b>203</b>. In addition to that, the supported part <b>203</b> comprises an at least substantially triangular retaining plate <b>208</b> on the side of the projections <b>205</b>, <b>206</b>, at some distance from the main plate <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The supporting part <b>202</b> comprises an inclined slot <b>211</b> and a straight slot <b>212</b>, which slots have open ends at the upper side of the supporting part <b>202</b>. The supporting part <b>202</b> further comprises a retaining handle <b>213</b>, which is pivotally accommodated in the slot <b>212</b>, which handle projects from the upper side of the supporting part <b>202</b> with a control portion <b>214</b> in the situation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, in which the supporting part <b>202</b> and the supported part <b>203</b> are not coupled. At the opposite end of the control portion <b>214</b>, the retaining handle <b>213</b> comprises a disc-shaped end part <b>215</b> provided with a central opening <b>216</b>, which is in line with the end of the slot <b>212</b>. The end part <b>215</b> is provided with retaining projections <b>217</b><i>a</i>, <b>217</b><i>b </i>and <b>217</b><i>c </i>at three quarter positions, which projections are located just outside the diameter of the central opening <b>216</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The retaining handle <b>213</b> can be pivoted between the open position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 9</figref> and the closed position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> by suitably controlling the retaining handle <b>213</b> via the control portion <b>214</b>, in which latter position the retaining projection <b>217</b><i>a </i>closes the end of the slot <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The coupling of the supported part <b>203</b> to the supporting part <b>202</b> or, in other words, of the carrier <b>204</b> to the associated conveyor chain, takes place in the manner shown in the successive <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>. Initially, the projection <b>205</b> is moved into the inclined slot <b>211</b>, as far as the end thereof (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). As a result, the alignment plate portion <b>220</b> of the supporting part <b>202</b> is positioned, at least partially so, between the main plate <b>207</b> and the stop plate <b>208</b> of the supported part <b>203</b>. The supported part <b>203</b> then pivots downwards about a horizontal pivot axis which extends through the centre of the projection <b>205</b>, with the projection <b>206</b> also being stopped at the bottom of the groove <b>212</b>. The projection <b>205</b> thus comes to be positioned between the retaining projections <b>217</b><i>a </i>and <b>217</b><i>c</i>. Substantially, the retaining handle <b>213</b> is manually moved to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in which the retaining projection <b>217</b><i>a </i>is positioned above the projection <b>206</b>, which is thus retained in position. The position of the retaining handle <b>213</b> is secured by means of a snap connection <b>230</b>, which acts between the control portion <b>214</b> and the stop plate <b>208</b>. Thus there is no need in the preferred embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>, no more so than in the above-described preferred embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref><i>b</i>, to remove guards from the sorting device first when a carrier is to be removed, since the connecting means, more specifically the retaining handle <b>213</b>, can be accessed from the upper side of the supported part <b>203</b> for effecting or releasing, as the case may be, the connection between the supporting part <b>202</b> and the supported part <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In a simplified alternative embodiment of the sorting device <b>201</b>, the supported part <b>203</b> could be made up merely of two pins, functioning as projections <b>205</b>, <b>206</b>, which project outside the section forming the carrier <b>204</b> and which are supported on supporting surfaces present in the supporting part <b>202</b>. Said pins could be permanently or detachably inserted into holes of the section, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> for the section <b>2</b>.</p>
