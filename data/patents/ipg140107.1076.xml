<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus for dispensing granulated powder, such as a fine sugar or sweetener, which uses an auger driven by a gear motor. The gear motor is controlled by a control unit on the front of the dispenser, allowing a user to select the quantity of powder to be dispensed. The apparatus comprises at least one, preferably two dispensing assemblies within the chassis, each comprising a storage bin for the powder, an inclined base, an auger member abutting the base of the storage bin and a dispensing chute. The base of the storage bin is inclined positively toward to the orifice of the dispensing chute, thereby ensuring that the powder is dispensed at a constant rate with minimized dribbling.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to dispensing machines for dispensing fine granular substances such as powders. More particularly, the present invention relates to a dispenser apparatus having precise control over small quantities of powder.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Automated beverage dispensers have become a commonality in recent years. Food courts, cafeterias, office buildings and community centres name only a few locations where users want freshly brewed drinks but have neither the staffing resources nor the tools and ingredients required to make them. As such, self-contained, automated brewing devices such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,927,553 to Ford and U.S. Pat. No. 6,182,555 to Scheer, et al. are placed in these locations to provide the service that would otherwise be unavailable.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many of these machines contain dispensers for beverage additives such as sugar or flavouring, allowing users to adapt the dispensed drinks to their individual tastes. Brewing machines often have a plurality of additive dispensers, each of which discharges a pre-determined quantity of additive to be mixed into the beverage before the drink is cupped and released to the customer. It is known from the prior art that the mechanics behind the dispensing of beverage additives often involve a rotating auger member driven by a motor, whereby the auger's action causes a volume of powder to be moved laterally to a discharge port.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the hopper-and-auger combinations taught by the prior art lead to some difficulties. The first difficulty results from the fact that the hoppers have flat bases. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the dispensing port region of a typical auger dispenser taught by the prior art. This often leads the powder to be dispensed at a variable rate. Powder <b>10</b>, especially that of very fine granules, is prone to settling when left undisturbed for a period of time and consequently forms clumps <b>14</b>. When one such clump forms in between two blades of an auger <b>11</b>, it tends to move as a unit once the auger is set in motion. If only part of a clump <b>13</b> reaches the dispensing port <b>12</b> once the auger stops, it may be partially suspended over the port as there is no substantial force in place to break the clump apart. This can lead to a discrepancy in the expected quantity of powder released, since the clump will either remain suspended by virtue of its integrity causing an insufficient release of additive, or will fall through the port entirely causing an excessive release of additive. This can also cause significant &#x201c;dribbling&#x201d; of powder, since any suspended clump may break apart and fall through the port if the machine is jostled while not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An issue contributing to this problem is the orientation of the flight of the auger after the dispense is completed. Those skilled in the art will understand that such augers can be of a conveyor type of auger, such as the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Most such augers have a helical shaped flight along a length of a shaft with a predetermined pitch. One full revolution of the auger can be calibrated to dispense the powder in a single pitch of the flight. When a full pitch is dispensed, the bottom edge of the flight is substantially positioned adjacent to the opening edge of the port, hence there is little to no non-dispensed powder remaining. However fractions of a revolution, such as a 0.5 revolution will cause dispensing inaccuracy. This is because the non-dispensed powder is positioned between a rear flight edge and the port. Therefore this powder is prone to cascading in an &#x201c;avalanche&#x201d; effect if the machine is jostled, which is likely in most service industry environments where such a dispensing machine would be used. This is referred to as a &#x201c;high-low&#x201d; effect, because the first dispense operation will provide more than the desired amount of powder, while the next dispense operation will provide less than the desired amount of powder since some of it has been inadvertently dispensed in the first dispense operation.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Furthermore, the augers taught by the prior art often leave a noticeable space between the tips of the blades themselves and the bottom of the hopper. This leads to wasted powder <b>15</b>, as quantities of the substance may settle to the bottom of the space and remain unused, as it is unreachable by the auger blades. This is both wasteful and unhygienic, as microorganisms can culture in the stagnant substance over time.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An additional difficulty with the hoppers of the prior art is that they are difficult to clean. Because of the nature of the powders dispensed, it is essential that all moisture be removed from the hopper once the cleaning process is complete. A flat-bottomed hopper, however, will not drain fluid unless it is tilted to an awkward angle or allowed to stand upside-down throughout the drying process.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is, therefore, desirable to provide a dispenser system for fine powders which is easy to clean, efficiently uses all of the powder contained in the hopper and releases powder at a constant rate.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a second aspect, the present invention provides an apparatus for dispensing a powder. The apparatus includes a control unit and a dispensing unit. The control unit receives an electrical selection signal corresponding to a dispense volume and generates a corresponding driving signal. The dispensing unit has a hopper for storing the powder, and an auger positioned along an inclined bottom section for dispensing the powder through a dispensing outlet in response to the driving signal. According to an embodiment, the dispensing unit further includes a motor coupled to the auger for rotating the auger in a first direction and moving the powder in an upward direction along the inclined bottom section towards the dispensing outlet in response to the driving signal. The auger is rotated in a second direction opposite to the first direction for withdrawing non-dispensed powder away from the dispensing outlet after the auger is rotated in the first direction.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The embodiments of present invention are directed to an apparatus for dispensing granulated powder, such as a fine sugar or sweetener, which uses an auger driven by a gear motor. The gear motor is controlled by a control unit on the front of the dispenser, allowing a user to select the quantity of powder to be dispensed. The apparatus comprises at least one, preferably two dispensing assemblies within the chassis, each comprising a storage bin for the powder, an inclined base, an auger member abutting the base of the storage bin and a dispensing chute. The base of the storage bin is inclined positively toward to the orifice of the dispensing chute, thereby ensuring that the powder is dispensed at a constant rate with minimal dribbling due to gravity. Dribbling of powder is further minimized by backdriving, or reversing the auger member such that any non-dispensed powder is withdrawn from the orifice. The arrangement of the auger member abutting the inclined base of the storage bin prevents the powder from accumulating at the bottom of the bin and forming clumps.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The powder dispensing apparatus according to one embodiment includes a chassis made of stainless steel or any other durable material. The chassis comprises a control unit on the front of the chassis, allowing a user to select the type and quantity of powder to be dispensed. The chassis further comprises a receptacle in which a customer can place a cup or other container for receiving powder dispensed from the system. In one embodiment of the invention, the chassis surrounds the entire system to prevent a customer from accessing the interior of the system and also for preventing contamination.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The interior of the chassis comprises at least one removable dispensing unit, each of which contains a single powdered substance. In one embodiment, one of the dispensing units is recessed so as to be in proximity with a chute for guiding powder dispensed from the unit into the receptacle. The interior of the chassis is easily accessible for maintenance, cleaning or replacing the dispensing units. Contained within the chassis are a number of driving motors, for example stepper motors or DC Gear motors with accompanying encoder, each of which engages an auger.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The dispensing unit is removable from the chassis for cleaning, maintenance or refilling. When inserted into the chassis, the driving motor interface engages one gear motor such that the torque provided by the motor turns the auger member and moves the powder toward the dispensing port. The base of the storage bin is inclined upwards toward the orifice of the dispensing port, thereby ensuring that the powder is dispensed at a constant rate with no dribbling. With the addition of an optional drainage hole and removable plug at the bottom of the incline, the inclined base allows for easy cleaning through flushing the unit with an appropriate cleaning solvent. The auger assembly is easily removable without tools to further facilitate the cleaning process. Further, the arrangement of the auger member abutting the inclined base of the storage bin prevents the powder from accumulating at the bottom of the bin and remaining unused. Once the unit is inserted into the chassis and the cover is closed, the port is directly above the chute of the chassis. As a result, any powder dispensed is guided through the chute and falls to the receptacle without any loss of powder.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The control unit may be placed into a maintenance mode whereby a technician or employee of the retailer may program the control unit to interpret the user's input differently. For example, one &#x201c;serving&#x201d; of sweetener may correspond to 1 gram of sucrose, but only 50 mg of saccharine. If a dispensing unit contains sucrose, the user's request for one serving of sweetener must be interpreted by the control unit in such a way that it instructs the sucrose dispensing unit to dispense the requisite 1 gram. Later, if the sucrose in the hopper in replaced with saccharine, the control unit would have to be reprogrammed to instruct the dispensing unit to dispense only 50 mg.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an isometric view of the chassis <b>21</b> of the powder dispensing system according to an embodiment of the present invention. A control panel <b>24</b> allows a user to select the kind and quantity of powder to be dispensed. Once a selection is made, the machine dispenses the user's selection into a recess <b>22</b>, into which the user can place a cup, bowl, or other vessel to receive the dispensed powder. The amount dispensed need not be limited to a quantity appropriate for a single serving of a drink. A person skilled in the art will appreciate that this invention may be used in cases where larger quantities of powder are required to fill a vessel such as, for example, a sugar bowl to be placed on a table in a restaurant.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this embodiment, the front panel <b>23</b> is a hinged door whereby a user can access the interior of the chassis assembly for maintenance, cleaning, or refilling purposes. Alternatively, the door may clip on through tab members, may slide into place along a track or may be attached through any other nonpermanent fastening means. In addition, alternate embodiments allow access to the interior of the chassis through removable side, top or back panels of the chassis <b>21</b>. A power cord <b>20</b> for a standard 110V AC outlet supplies electric power for the machine's operation. Of course, as will be understood by the skilled worker, any other suitable sources of electrical power can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the inside of the chassis assembly with the front panel <b>23</b> in the open position and a sidewall of the chassis removed. The powder dispensing system includes two dispensing units <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>, each of which can contain a separate powder. When the front panel <b>23</b> is in the open position, the dispensing units are removable from the chassis for cleaning, maintenance or refilling. For example, the upper unit <b>30</b> can contain granular sucrose while the lower unit <b>31</b> can contain a powdered non-dairy creamer. When the front panel <b>23</b> is in the closed position, a chute member <b>33</b> is positioned under the dispensing port <b>36</b> of the upper unit <b>30</b>. This ensures that any powder dispensed from the upper unit <b>30</b> is guided to the opening <b>35</b> and is not spilled into the interior of the chassis. Note that in this exemplary embodiment, the lower unit <b>31</b> is slightly further to the back of the chassis interior that the upper unit <b>30</b> is. This prevents the lower unit <b>31</b> from interfering with the chute member <b>33</b>. Because of the placement of lower unit <b>31</b> immediately above the opening <b>35</b>, which opens on the recess <b>22</b> (shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), powder dispensed from its dispensing port <b>34</b> does not require an additional chute member for guidance to the recess <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">However, to further prevent cross contamination, overspray, wastage or mess, the front panel can optionally include a second chute member (not shown) positioned under the dispensing port <b>34</b>. Therefore, the two chute members will precisely channel the powder to a very finite location. The inside of the chassis assembly further comprises driving motors <b>32</b>, which interface with the dispensing units. According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, both units <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> are in their operable positions and are releasably connectable to the driving motors <b>32</b>. While one skilled in the art will appreciate that the driving motors can be any motors capable of providing a torque, this embodiment of the invention comprises gear motors equipped with encoders due to the high precision control they provide. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that stepper motors can be used with equal effectiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an angled cross-sectional view of the embodiment of the invention of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this image, the front panel <b>23</b> is in the closed position, and both dispensing units engage their respective gear motors <b>32</b>. In one embodiment of the invention, the driving motor interface can comprise a rectangular prism-shaped member (not shown) and the gear motor can have a correspondingly shaped recess (not shown) sized to receive the prism-shaped member. The prism-shaped member itself can be beveled so that it will slide into position in the recess. In other words, if the prism member and stepper motor are out of rotational phase, the edge of the recess coming into contact with the smooth bevel will force the prism-shaped member and attached auger member to rotate in phase with the recess as the unit is slid into position. Those skilled in the art will understand that any other suitable mating scheme can be used. Note that the chute member <b>33</b> is in registry with the upper and lower unit's dispensing ports <b>36</b> and <b>34</b>. The base <b>41</b> of each unit is tapered in such a way as to form a U-shaped trough for cradling the auger member <b>40</b>. This serves to channel any powder in the unit to the auger member, thereby preventing powder from settling on the base itself and remaining unused. The rear wall <b>42</b> is angled to channel powder toward the auger member <b>40</b>. The gear motor <b>32</b> provides a torque, which turns the auger member <b>40</b>, thereby pushing some of the contents of the dispensing unit along the base <b>41</b> toward the dispensing port <b>36</b> of the unit.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a profile cross-sectional view of one dispensing unit according to an embodiment of the invention. The unit comprises an auger member <b>40</b>, which is driven by a gear motor <b>32</b> (not shown) through a driving motor interface <b>52</b> at the rear of the unit, and a pivot-point socket <b>50</b> at the front of the unit to hold it in place. Note that the blades of the auger member abut the base <b>41</b>, which prevents powder from settling at the bottom of the unit.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The base <b>41</b> of each unit is inclined positively toward the dispensing port <b>36</b>. Experimentation has found that an 18 degree incline is sufficient for preventing most powder materials from cascading through the dispensing port <b>36</b> after the auger member <b>40</b> has stopped rotating. It is noted that the inclined angle can be varied depending on the powder characteristic (granularity for example) and the physical characteristics of the auger member <b>40</b> (flight size and pitch for example). The angled incline allows gravity to retain powder to the back end of the auger member, more specifically the flight. Because the powder will naturally tend to settle toward the back of the unit due to this incline, it will not spill out of the dispensing port if the machine is jostled. As such, the vertex <b>51</b> formed between the inclined base <b>41</b> and the rear wall of the dispensing port <b>36</b> acts as a baffle to prevent spillage of powder. Furthermore, the vertex <b>51</b> can include resilient tines (not shown) extending from the vertex <b>51</b> for engaging the blades of the auger member <b>40</b>. Any clumps of powder can be broken up as they are pressed against the resilient tines. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an enlarged view of the dispensing port <b>36</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to illustrate the position of the tines <b>54</b>. The auger <b>40</b> is not shown in order to clearly show tines <b>54</b>. Any number of tines <b>54</b> can be used, where the spacing, length and resilience can be selected to optimize breaking ability and longevity. Tines <b>54</b> are considered one implementation of breaking means for breaking clumps of powder, and any other type of mechanism effective for breaking clumps of powder can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In an alternate embodiment of the invention, each unit can comprise a drain hole sealed with a removable plug member <b>53</b> at the lowermost point of the base <b>41</b> to allow for channeled drainage along the inclined base. The removable plug member <b>53</b> can be constructed of a rubber material, and sized to seal the drain hole. The presence of the tapered walls described above, along with the inclined base <b>41</b> and the declined rear base <b>42</b> serves to channel any solvent added to the unit toward the plug member <b>53</b>. As such, cleaning any residual powder from the unit can be easily done by flushing the unit with water.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">While the incline of the base <b>41</b> will mitigate unnecessary spillage of the powder material, it has been discovered that when the flight continues past the dispensing port <b>36</b>, it allows the product through static or inertial adhesion to travel beyond the vertex <b>51</b> of of the dispensing port <b>36</b> without a clean break off point. Some or all of the non-dispensed powder may fall through dispensing port <b>36</b>. Therefore, according to another alternate embodiment of the invention, the flight of auger member <b>40</b> can be modified to minimize the potential for non-dispensed powder to cascade into the dispensing port <b>36</b> when the auger member is rotated by fractions of a flight. More specifically the flight of the auger member <b>40</b> is modified such that the flight terminates at or just before reaching the dispensing port <b>36</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is an isometric view of a flight reduced auger member <b>55</b>, having a shaft <b>56</b> and a flight <b>57</b>. The flight <b>57</b> is omitted from region <b>58</b>, which corresponds to the area occupied by dispensing port <b>36</b> when flight reduced auger member <b>55</b> is installed in the dispensing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a profile cross-sectional view of one dispensing unit having the flight reduced auger member <b>55</b> installed therein. Apart from flight reduced auger member <b>55</b>, all the elements of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> have been previously shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. When installed in the dispensing unit, region <b>58</b>, which is flight-free, will be positioned over the dispensing port <b>36</b>. More importantly, the end of the flight terminates at approximately the left-most edge of dispensing port <b>36</b>. Accordingly, there will be less dispersion of powder after a dispense.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the electronics involved in the operation of this system may take a variety of embodiments. The following is but one example of such an embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram representing the functional components of an embodiment of the invention. A control unit <b>25</b> includes a user interface <b>60</b>, a microprocessor <b>61</b>, an auger driver <b>63</b>, a relay system <b>64</b>, a gear motor <b>32</b>, a 5 volt power supply <b>62</b> and a 12 volt power supply <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">User interface <b>60</b> includes button actuators of the capacitive or piezoelectric sensor type, for sending electrical selection signals to microprocessor <b>61</b>, and a liquid crystal display (LCD) driver circuitry for receiving predetermined display data from microprocessor <b>61</b>. The button actuators can be disposed on the control panel <b>24</b> shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The LCD driver circuitry drives an LCD display with alphanumeric characters for providing user feedback. Of course, any other suitable type of display can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Microprocessor <b>61</b> can be programmable to permit the manufacturer to install pre-set control algorithms and auger control data for all valid selection combinations. An example of a suitable microprocessor is the Motorola MC68HC908AB32 with non-volatile Flash memory. Microprocessor <b>61</b> receives the electrical selection signals from the user interface <b>60</b> for accessing the programmed auger calibration data and calculating the necessary volume to dispense. Once calculated, microprocessor <b>61</b> can issue corresponding auger control data also referred to as a driving signal, which can include the specific driving motor <b>32</b> to be actuated and the quantity of powder to be dispensed from its corresponding dispensing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The programmability of microprocessor <b>61</b> also permits tracking of remaining powder in the dispensing units coupled to each stepper motor <b>32</b>. Since the volume of each dispense is known, and the full level volume of the dispensing unit hopper is known, the microprocessor can store a current remaining volume of powder so that a visual and/or audio alert is emitted once a predetermined empty level threshold is reached. Of course, a low level indication can be provided when the remaining volume of powder has reached a predetermined level. This alert can signal the user to refill the dispensing unit, and optionally locks out the specific powder from being dispensed.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Auger driver <b>63</b> is the circuit responsible for actuating one stepper motor <b>32</b>. More specifically, auger driver <b>63</b> provides motor drive signals, such as direction of rotation and step signals to turn gear motor <b>32</b>. Accordingly, the number of pre-calibrated steps corresponds to the desired quantity of powder to be dispensed. The auger driver <b>63</b> can control gear motor <b>32</b> to rotate in the opposite direction to withdraw any residual or non-dispensed powder from the vertex <b>51</b>, thereby further preventing powder from accidental dispensing after the gear motor <b>32</b> has stopped rotating. This is referred to as a backdrive function, which can be executed after each dispense operation. The rotational degrees to backdrive can depend on the powder, incline angle of the base <b>41</b> and physical characteristics of the auger member <b>40</b>. The next dispense operation will compensate for the previous backdrive to ensure that the correct amount of powder is dispensed. To ensure that there is minimum spillage, or dispersion of powder after a dispense, the auger member <b>40</b> can be backdriven such that the bottom edge of the flight is substantially adjacent the vertex <b>51</b> of dispensing port <b>36</b>. This is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> by example, where the orientation of the flight after backdriving effectively seals the non-dispensed powder in the previous pitch from dispensing port <b>36</b>. Therefore, in combination with the inclined base <b>41</b>, repeatable accurate dispenses can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Relay system <b>64</b> multiplexes the direction of rotation and step data from the auger driver <b>63</b> to one of the gear motors <b>32</b>. Practically, the relay system <b>64</b> includes a set of individual relay devices, each individually selectable by microprocessor <b>61</b> for coupling the data to the corresponding gear motor <b>32</b>. The present control unit <b>25</b> shows a single auger driver <b>63</b> shared among two or more different gear motors <b>32</b>. This configuration reduces costs since each driver <b>63</b> is relatively expensive. Hence, in a combination dispenser where multiple powders are to be dispensed, each selected gear motor <b>32</b> is actuated sequentially. Alternatively, control unit <b>24</b> can include one auger driver <b>63</b> dedicated to a corresponding gear motor <b>32</b> for simultaneous actuation of multiple gear motors.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment of the invention, the control unit <b>25</b> may be placed into a &#x201c;maintenance mode&#x201d; by a member of the retail outlet staff or technician. This maintenance mode will allow the technician to program the volume of powder that should correspond to a user's request. For example, the lower unit contains granular sucrose and the upper unit contains a powdered non-dairy creamer. A typical single serving of sucrose for a cup of coffee is 5 ml. As such, a user's request for one serving of sugar should result in the system's dispensing of that same amount. If the embodiment of the invention in question dispenses powder at a rate of 2 ml per second, it will take 2.5 seconds to dispense one serving of sucrose. By placing the control unit in maintenance mode, a technician can program/calibrate the unit to dispense for the predetermined period of time or for the predetermined number of steps.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Using a gear motor with encoder in this manner has the added advantage of precision programming, since it allows for programming in discreet numbers of steps. Other motors use time-based calibration, requiring a user to calculate fractions of a second to finely-tune the amount of powder to be dispensed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In summary, several previously described features can be used to minimize the amount of dispersion of powder after a dispense operation has terminated, for maximizing repeatability of accurate dispenses. First is the incline of base <b>41</b>, second is the use of a flight reduced auger member <b>55</b>, and third is a control system to backdrive an auger member after a dispense operation. Each of these features can be used independently of each other to obtain improved dispersion control over prior art powder dispensing units. Of course, two or more of these features can be used in combination with each other to realize further improved powder dispersion control. For example, maximum powder dispersion prevention is attained when all three features are used together.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The impact of combining these specific features is illustrated in the graphs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a </i>and <b>10</b><i>b</i>, which show experimental data from repeated dispense operations using a full flighted auger member <b>40</b> as used in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and a flight reduced auger member <b>55</b> as used in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a </i>is a plot of the measured amount of a dispensed powder on the y-axis for a plurality of dispense operations on the x-axis, for the dispensing unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> with no backdrive operation. Therefore, the inclined base is the only powder dispersion control feature being implemented. In the present example, a desired three gram dispense is repeated 50 times, and the actual measured amount is measured each time. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>, there is a maximum variance of about 10% between the smallest dispense versus the highest dispense for any given three gram dispense operation, and the averaged dispense over the 50 dispense operations is about 2.9 grams. The horizontal lines are the +/&#x2212;10% variance markers. The largest dispense is about 3.3 grams while the smallest dispense is about 2.7 grams, which is an improvement over prior dispense units that do not have an inclined base. The &#x201c;oscillation&#x201d; of dispense amounts is the previously described &#x201c;high-low&#x201d; effect due to the orientation of the flight after a dispense operation, since the extra dispensed powder due to dispersion in one operation will not be available for a subsequent dispense operation. Hence the next three gram dispense will be less than the desired amount.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>b </i>is a plot of the measured amount of a dispensed powder on the y-axis for a plurality of dispense operations on the x-axis, for the dispensing unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The dispensing unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> uses the flight reduced auger member <b>55</b>, which is controlled to include the previously described backdrive operation. Hence, all three powder dispersion control features are implemented. In the present example, a desired three gram dispense is repeated 50 times, and the actual measured amount is measured each time. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>b</i>, there is a maximum variance of about 3% between the smallest dispense versus the highest dispense for any given three gram dispense operation, and the averaged dispense over the 50 dispense operations is about 3.04 grams. The horizontal lines are the +/&#x2212;10% variance markers. The largest dispense is about 3.14 grams while the smallest dispense is about 2.93 grams, which is an improvement over both prior dispense units and the dispense unit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. While the previously described &#x201c;high-low&#x201d; effect is still present, it is significantly reduced relative to the dispense operations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>. As evidenced by the data shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>b</i>, all dispenses are substantially constant, and very close to the desired three-gram dispense.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Another problem that can be addressed by the present invention is that related to dispensing a small amount of powder immediately after having dispensed a large amount of powder or, conversely, dispensing a large amount of powder after having dispensed a small amount of powder. In such cases, the amount of powder dispensed can depend on the previously dispensed amount. This is known as the carryover effect. For example, a 1 g dispense following a 5 g dispense could result in a 1.3 g dispense, and a 5 g dispense following a 1 g dispense could result in a 4.6 g dispense. The carryover effect occurring upon dispensing a powder amount &#x201c;B&#x201d; after having dispensed a powder amount &#x201c;A&#x201d; can be mitigated by, in a calibration procedure, measuring the dispensed amount of powder and comparing it to the nominal, or desired, dispense amount &#x201c;B&#x201d;. Adjustments to the amount of rotation of the auger <b>40</b> can then be made to ensure that the measured dispensed amount of powder is within a pre-determined acceptable range from the nominal dispense amount &#x201c;B&#x201d;. By characterizing the powder dispensing apparatus (the auger rotation) in this manner for all possible combination of successive dispense amounts of different nominal values, it is possible to create a lookup table indicating the required amount of auger rotation required to dispense an amount &#x201c;B&#x201d; after having dispensed an amount &#x201c;A&#x201d;. The lookup table can be programmed into the memory of the microprocessor <b>61</b> and called-upon by the microprocessor when required.</p>
