<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Agencies oftentimes desire to monitor personnel in the field during the course of their duties. To provide flexible monitoring capabilities to agencies, a common mobile device such as a mobile phone is converted for use as a radio-based listening system to collect and transmit audio data. Phone features and accessories are leveraged to collect additional data for transmission. Collected data is streamed or otherwise transmitted to monitoring devices at the agency or in the field for operational oversight and recordation.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/491,823, filed May 31, 2011, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/549,657, filed Oct. 20, 2011, which are incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of Art</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure generally relates to the field of undercover operations and more specifically to using a mobile phone as an undercover device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Police officers and other agents &#x201c;operators&#x201d; oftentimes conduct investigations in the field during the course of their duties. In many cases, these investigations require direct support and oversight at an administrative level. For example, an operator conducting an undercover sting in a high-risk situation may have a support team monitoring the operator directly in the field and interfacing with administration at an agency. Traditionally, the operator would use a radio-based covert listening system that can be hidden (e.g., under a shirt) or otherwise embedded (e.g., in or on an electronic device or object) to conceal its nature and protect operators' cover. The listening device would then transmit audio data back to the support team, which would relay data back to the agency.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, with widespread publicity of listening devices in movies and the like, the physical nature of a given device can lead to its discovery or detection, which poses additional risks for the operators themselves. Additionally, traditional bugs have other inherent deficiencies when used in the field, such as requiring line-of-sight or physical proximity to a base station and the support team. Although some newer bug systems seek to provide sufficient concealability among other desirable features, they are oftentimes prohibitively expensive and yet, still fail to mitigate the above deficiencies. Furthermore, such systems are not rapidly deployable as they typically require support personnel other than immediate backup.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The above and other issues are addressed by a method and computer system for configuring a telephonic device as a one-way recorded transmitter (mobile bug). An embodiment of the method comprises receiving information in response to a connection request from a telephonic device to a virtual number. The information received includes a transmitting number corresponding to the telephonic device and the virtual number. The telephonic device is identified as the mobile bug in response to matching the transmitting number of the telephonic device with a transmitting number stored in association with the virtual number in a mapping table. With the mobile bug identified, the method further includes transmitting instructions for connecting the mobile bug to the virtual number to permit monitoring of the mobile bug. Outgoing audio to the mobile bug is disabled.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An embodiment of the system comprises a server having a one or more processors and a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing computer program code. When executed, the computer program code causes the server to receive information in response to a connection request from a telephonic device to a virtual number. The information received includes a transmitting number corresponding to the telephonic device and the virtual number. The server identifies the telephonic device as the mobile bug in response to matching the transmitting number of the telephonic device with a transmitting number stored in association with the virtual number in a mapping table. With the mobile bug identified, the server transmits instructions for connecting the mobile bug to the virtual number with outgoing audio to the mobile bug disabled to permit monitoring of the mobile bug.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The Figures (FIG.) and the following description relate to preferred embodiments by way of illustration only. It should be noted that from the following discussion, alternative embodiments of the structures and methods disclosed herein will be readily recognized as viable alternatives that may be employed without departing from the principles of the embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Reference will now be made in detail to several embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying figures. It is noted that wherever practicable, similar or like reference numbers may be used in the figures and may indicate similar or like functionality. The figures depict embodiments for purposes of illustration only.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Many operators in the field posses a personal mobile phone or are issued a mobile phone by their agency or department. Oftentimes a traditional bug and accompanying support team are unavailable to support an operator in the field or are not appropriate for a given scenario. However, the agency may still desire to monitor and/or record the operator's activities. Accordingly, the agency may coordinate with an agency support service for configuring the operator's mobile phone to fulfill the role of a traditional bug. The configuration can take place over-the-air such that a given mobile phone is conveniently converted as needed. In some instances, the mobile phone requires nothing more than a radio connection and dialer. Additionally, if the agency desires to monitor additional operators, the agency can specify additional mobile phones for operation as bugs.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Example embodiments described herein relate to configuring a wireless radio network (e.g., Cellular Network and/or WiFi) capable device, such as a mobile phone, as a one-way recorded transmitter or &#x201c;mobile bug&#x201d; for use in the field. As mobile phones and similar devices are commonly carried by operators during the course of undercover investigations, mobile phones offer an existing platform for transmitting data wirelessly. Use of such devices as a mobile bug often allows the mobile bug to be concealed &#x201c;in plain sight&#x201d; as a direct result of the devices' popularity and utility. Additionally, with the popularity of smart phones and feature phones, additional monitoring and safety features are integrated into the mobile bug for enhancing operational viability in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Furthermore, because a mobile phone configured as a mobile bug communicates information over existing channels created for the phone's intended purpose, the mobile bug, if examined, at worst appears to operate as expected (e.g., receives and/or transmits wireless data). Accordingly, the worst case scenario for an operator is having to &#x201c;turn-off&#x201d; the mobile bug rather than having their cover blown. Additionally, by turning a mobile phone into a covert transmitting device and using a cellular network as the means of transmission, the mobile bug system offers a virtually unlimited range of transmission and the ability to collect a wide range of valuable real-time data. Real-time data collected by the mobile bug may include audio, video or still images, Global Positioning System (&#x201c;GPS&#x201d;) coordinates, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The mobile bug subsequently transmits all or a portion of the collected real-time data wirelessly over the existing channels (e.g., a network) back to the agency, agency service or another entity. Embodiments of the agency, agency service and/or other entities within the mobile bug system receive the collected data for storage and/or live streaming to monitoring devices. Depending on the embodiment, the monitoring devices are further configured to access and present (e.g., play and/or display) a variety of the real-time and historical data stored on or streamed by the entities on the network. For example, the monitoring devices may access a web interface, API or execute a standalone application for viewing mobile bug details and the collected information. In some embodiments, the monitoring devices may access portions of the real-time data via a provided monitoring line configured for maintaining the operator's cover. Furthermore, other agencies with appropriate credentials and monitoring devices may similarly access portions of the collected information during inter-agency investigations.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Figure (FIG.) <b>1</b>A is a block diagram illustrating an environment <b>100</b> for implementing a mobile bug <b>105</b> system according to one example embodiment. As shown the environment <b>100</b> includes a network <b>120</b> connecting agency <b>100</b>A and <b>100</b>B, an agency support service provider &#x201c;agency service&#x201d; <b>115</b> and mobile bugs <b>105</b>A through <b>105</b>D. While only one agency service <b>115</b> and two agencies <b>110</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> for clarity, embodiments can have many agencies <b>110</b> and multiple agency service providers <b>115</b>. Additionally, in some embodiments, the agency service <b>115</b> may be consolidated at an agency <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Agency service <b>115</b> represents a collection of compute devices (e.g., servers) and related storage mediums that are used to execute module for performing various activities such as configuring mobile bugs <b>105</b>, exchanging data over the network <b>120</b> and storing data in support of one or more agencies <b>110</b>A, <b>100</b>B and operated mobile bugs <b>105</b>. For example, the agency service <b>115</b> may include one or more modules providing ascribed functionality to an agency <b>110</b> via an application programming interface (&#x201c;API&#x201d;) or web interface, collectively &#x201c;the monitoring interface&#x201d;, as described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The agency service <b>115</b> may also include infrastructure for providing audio and video communicability (e.g., internally and/or over the network <b>120</b>) within the monitoring interface using the public switched telephone network (&#x201c;PSTN&#x201d;), voice over internet protocol (&#x201c;VoIP&#x201d;) and video conferencing services.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Agency <b>110</b>A and <b>110</b>B represent collections of servers, desktop, notebook or tablet computers, mobile telephones and related storage mediums used by respective agency personnel for executing applications or modules to communicate with and receive data from the agency service <b>115</b> (e.g., via the monitoring interface) and other entities on the network <b>120</b>. For example, agency <b>110</b> devices may execute a web browser to access a web interface or execute a mobile or desktop application for communicating with an API provided by the agency service <b>115</b>. An agency <b>110</b>A may also include telephonic and video infrastructure enabling audio and video communicability (e.g., internally and/or over the network <b>120</b>) using the public switched telephone network (&#x201c;PTSN&#x201d;), voice over internet protocol (&#x201c;VoIP&#x201d;) and video conferencing services for monitoring or specifying configurations for mobile bugs <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The mobile bugs <b>105</b> are oftentimes mobile telephonic devices capable of collecting data and transmitting data (e.g., wirelessly) over the network <b>120</b>. Some examples of a mobile bug <b>105</b> include a mobile phone, tablet or notebook computer. Example embodiments of the mobile bug as a mobile phone include feature phones, smart phones or standard mobile phones. Accordingly, a given mobile phone or other device operated as a mobile bug <b>105</b> may not necessarily include or support all of the functionality ascribed herein to the mobile bug or mobile bug system due to inherent differences in device capabilities. In some embodiments, other telephonic devices such as land-line phones oare used.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the mobile bug <b>105</b> executes a bug module for collecting data, transmitting data and maintaining a persistent connection with entities on the network <b>120</b>. An example embodiment of a bug module is described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition to the mobile bugs <b>105</b>, a number of monitoring devices (not shown) may connect to entities on the network <b>120</b> to obtain or present data collected from one or more of the mobile bugs. Depending on the embodiment, a monitoring device is a telephonic device that can be operated within the agency <b>110</b> or externally in the field. As referred to herein, a monitoring device is a mobile or stationary telephonic device capable of connectivity (e.g., wireless or wired) to a network <b>120</b> such as an agency <b>110</b> network, the internet, PSTN and/or cellular network. Some examples of a monitoring device include a mobile phone, land-line phone, tablet and notebook or desktop computer.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Example embodiments of the monitoring device as a mobile phone can include feature phones, smart phones or standard mobile phones. Accordingly, a given mobile phone or other device operated as a monitoring device does not necessarily include or support all of the functionality ascribed herein to the monitoring device or the mobile bug system due to inherent differences in device capabilities. In one example embodiment, the monitoring device executes a monitoring module for interfacing with entities on the network <b>120</b> to manage mobile bugs <b>105</b> and view collected data.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The network <b>120</b> represents the communication pathway between agencies <b>110</b>, agencies service <b>115</b>, the mobile bugs <b>105</b>, monitoring devices and other entities (not shown). In one embodiment, the network <b>120</b> includes standard communications technologies and/or protocols and can include the Internet and PSTN. Oftentimes, these communications technologies and/or protocols carry both PTSN and Internet related data. Thus, the network <b>120</b> can include links using technologies such as Ethernet, 802.11, worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), 2G/3G/4G mobile communications protocols, worldwide interoperability for PSTN communications, digital subscriber line (DSL), asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), InfiniBand, PCI Express Advanced Switching, etc. Similarly, the networking protocols used on the network <b>120</b> can include multiprotocol label switching (MPLS), the transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the hypertext transport protocol (HTTP), the simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP), the file transfer protocol (FTP), etc. The data exchanged over the network <b>120</b> can be represented using technologies and/or formats including analog audio (e.g., for last mile PSTN communications), digital audio and video (e.g., as a file or streaming with Real Time Streaming Protocol), the hypertext markup language (HTML), the extensible markup language (XML), JavaScript, VBScript, FLASH, the portable document format (PDF), etc. In addition, all or some of the data exchanged over the network <b>120</b> can be encrypted using conventional encryption technologies such as secure sockets layer (SSL), transport layer security (TLS), virtual private networks (VPNs), Internet Protocol security (IPsec), etc. In another embodiment, the entities on the network <b>120</b> can use custom and/or dedicated data communications technologies instead of, or in addition to, the ones described above. For example, some government agencies and the military may operate networks auxiliary to the internet and PSTN.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As used herein, the term &#x201c;module&#x201d; refers to computer program instructions and/or other logic used to provide the specified functionality. Thus, a module can be implemented in hardware, firmware, and/or software. In one embodiment, program modules formed of executable computer program instructions are stored on a non-transitory storage device, loaded into memory, and executed by a computer processor as one or more processes.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an operating environment <b>101</b> of a mobile bug <b>105</b> according to one example embodiment. As shown, the operating environment <b>101</b> includes a network <b>120</b> with components such as the internet <b>123</b>, telephony <b>125</b> and provider <b>127</b>. The network <b>120</b> may also include GPS satellites (not shown) that relay position data to mobile bugs <b>105</b> and other devices.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The telephony network <b>125</b> may include servers, switches and other hardware and software for implementing, among other protocols and technologies, worldwide interoperability for PSTN communications including land-lines and 2G/3G/4G wireless protocols. The telephony network <b>125</b> also provides mobile devices with the capability to transmit and receive data over the internet <b>123</b>. The telephony network <b>125</b> is managed by one or more communication service providers &#x201c;CSPs&#x201d; (not shown) that own telephone numbers for use on the PSTN and the CSPs own network (e.g., a wireless network that communicates with the PSTN).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The provider <b>127</b> may include servers, switches and other hardware and software for communicating over the network <b>120</b> with CSPs and other entities. The provider <b>127</b> buys or leases numbers for use on the telephony network <b>125</b> from multiple CSPs. The provider <b>127</b>, in turn, manages numbers provisioned for use by the agency service <b>115</b> and the telephony traffic associated with the numbers. In one embodiment, the provider <b>127</b> allows the agency service <b>115</b> to provision one or more of the numbers as virtual numbers over the network <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Typically, a number used on the telephony <b>125</b> network directs to a given mobile device, VoIP device or land-line device having an associated number identity characterized by automatic number identification &#x201c;ANI&#x201d; information, or caller identification. Virtual numbers, while still operable with the PSTN and CSP networks, are associated with the provider <b>127</b> who handles telephony traffic for the number. Because a virtual number does not direct to an end user device, the provider <b>127</b> may establish connections with devices dialing the virtual number, record call information such as call audio and caller history (e.g., on a computer readable medium) and stream/provide call information for download (e.g., over the network <b>120</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The provider <b>127</b> may also pass/bridge audio (bidirectional or unidirectional) in real-time between two or more telephonic devices establishing connections with the same or different virtual numbers (or connected with the provider <b>127</b> via a virtual number). Additionally, as the virtual numbers are handled by the provider <b>127</b>, the agency service <b>115</b> may modify ANI information and caller identification associated with the virtual number.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In addition to provisioning virtual numbers for the agency service <b>115</b>, the provider <b>127</b> communicates notifications and data associated with the virtual numbers to the agency service <b>115</b> or other entity such as the agency <b>110</b>A. For example, the provider <b>127</b> may notify the agency service <b>115</b> of an incoming caller to the virtual number and receive instructions from the agency service <b>115</b> to connect the caller to the virtual number. The provider <b>127</b> may also receive instructions to stop/start recordings of calls placed to the virtual number and interface with a transcription service to transcribe call audio. In turn, the provider <b>127</b> can transmit the recordings and transcripts to the agency service <b>115</b> or other entity on the network <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally, the provider <b>127</b> may enable or disable inbound and/or outbound audio for different parties connected to the virtual number and recordings thereof responsive to instructions received (e.g., via an API) from the agency service <b>115</b>. The provider <b>127</b> can receive instructions for managing a virtual number as part of the provisioning process, prior to an incoming call or in real-time from the agency service <b>115</b> when connecting an incoming caller to the virtual number. In some embodiments, the provider <b>127</b> communicates directly with the agency <b>110</b>A to provision virtual numbers, transmit notifications and data or receive instructions. Additionally, the provider <b>127</b> itself may function as a CSP and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The agency service <b>115</b> receives requests for provisioning and mapping virtual number from the agency <b>110</b>A, mobile bug <b>105</b> or other monitoring device <b>107</b>. The requests can include number information for provisioning virtual numbers such as an area code (e.g., 555), country code (e.g., +44) and/or associated CSP. In turn, the agency service <b>115</b> queries the provider <b>127</b> for available virtual numbers matching the request and returns the matching virtual numbers to the requesting entity. The agency service <b>115</b> subsequently receives a selection of virtual numbers from the requesting entity and claims the virtual numbers from the provider <b>127</b>. The agency service <b>115</b> may optionally allow the entity to specify ANI and/or caller identification associated with the virtual number to spoof the number's identity on the network <b>120</b>. The agency service <b>115</b>, in turn, transmits instructions to the provider <b>127</b> for modifying the number identity. The agency service <b>115</b> may optionally verify the spoofed number identity. When a virtual number is no longer needed by the agency <b>110</b>A, the agency service <b>115</b> obtains any audio recordings or call logs associated with the virtual number and releases the number back to the provider <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The requests can also include mapping information for configuring claimed virtual number function in a mapping table. Depending on the desired configuration, the mapping information may include the transmitting number of a mobile bug <b>105</b> and/or and monitoring device <b>107</b>, virtual number for association with the device and/or desired function of the virtual number (e.g., monitoring number or receiving number). One example mapping request may specify a claimed virtual number for use as a virtual receiving number (receiving number) that mobile bugs <b>105</b> connect to in order to transmit collected data (e.g., audio) over the telephony <b>125</b> network. In one embodiment, the request includes the transmitting number of the mobile bug <b>105</b> and a given claimed virtual number for configuration as the receiving number. In response to the request, the agency service <b>115</b> associates the transmitting number of the mobile bug <b>105</b> with the receiving number and stores the association in a mapping table.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Another example mapping request may specify a claimed virtual number for use as a virtual monitoring number (monitoring number) that monitoring devices <b>107</b> connect to in order to monitor a receiving number (e.g., listen to audio a mobile bug <b>105</b> transmits to the receiving number). In one embodiment, the request includes a given claimed virtual number (e.g., the monitoring number) and the receiving number. In response to the request, the agency service <b>115</b> associates the receiving number with the monitoring number and stores the association in a mapping table.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, a mapping request may optionally include the transmitting number of a monitoring device <b>107</b> which the agency service <b>115</b> associates with a receiving number or monitoring number to identify the monitoring device. As multiple monitoring devices <b>107</b>A, <b>107</b>B, <b>107</b>C may monitor a mobile bug <b>105</b>, the agency service <b>115</b> may store multiple transmitting numbers of monitoring devices in association with a receiving number or monitoring number in a mapping table.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In practice, agency service <b>115</b> consults the mapping table to automatically identify a device connecting to a virtual number (e.g., the receiving number) as either the mobile bug <b>105</b> or a monitoring device <b>107</b> based on the device's transmitting number. Thus, for example, an operator of a mobile bug <b>105</b> may simply dial the receiving number mapped to the transmitting number of his phone to activate the mobile bug.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Personnel with a monitoring device <b>107</b> that desire to monitor the mobile bug <b>105</b> with a mobile or land-line phone at the agency <b>110</b>A or in the field can also dial the receiving number. However, as the agency <b>115</b> does not identify the transmitting number of the device that of the mobile bug <b>105</b>, personnel devices are appropriately identified as monitoring devices <b>107</b>. In some embodiments, the agency service <b>115</b> identifies connecting monitoring device <b>107</b> based on a mapping of monitoring devices' <b>107</b> transmitting numbers to the receiving number.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Additionally, embodiments of the agency service <b>115</b> can use the mapping of monitoring devices <b>107</b> to the receiving number for instructing the provider <b>127</b> to automatically dial (e.g., from a specified monitoring number) or otherwise notify (e.g., a text message or email) monitoring devices when the mobile bug <b>105</b> connects to the receiving number. The agency service <b>115</b> may also notify monitoring devices <b>107</b> through the monitoring interface <b>145</b> or via text massage or email.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">To prohibit unauthorized access to receiving numbers (and monitoring numbers), the agency service <b>115</b> may allow personnel and operators to specify key-ins when provisioning and/or mapping virtual numbers. The agency service <b>115</b> stores the key-ins in the mapping table or other suitable database structure and authenticates callers attempting connections to the virtual numbers responsive to correct key-ins. In instances where the agency service <b>115</b> instructs the provider <b>127</b> to automatically dial a monitoring device <b>107</b> from a virtual number, the provider <b>127</b> may initially connect the call without outbound audio (if the device answers) and then wait (or prompt) for a key-in. In response to authentication of the key-in, the provider <b>127</b> enables outbound audio to the dialed monitoring device <b>107</b>. Depending on the embodiment, the agency <b>110</b>A, agency service <b>115</b> or provider <b>127</b> may store the mapping table and/or key-ins for device identification and authentication.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some embodiments, the agency service <b>115</b> provides a bug module <b>135</b> to the mobile bug <b>105</b>. The bug module <b>135</b> interfaces with the native dialer of the mobile bug <b>105</b> to maintain a persistent connection with a selected virtual number such as the receiving number. Additionally, the bug module <b>135</b> may interface with mobile bug <b>105</b> software and/or hardware to utilize features such as an image capture device and GPS to collect real-time image or video and position data. The bug module <b>135</b> transmits the collected data over the network <b>120</b> back to the agency service <b>115</b> or other entity. The agency service <b>115</b>, in turn, may store the collected data for transmission to one or more monitoring devices <b>107</b> and the agency <b>110</b>A. Furthermore, the bug module <b>135</b> may be configured with a password or otherwise disguised when executed to prevent users other than the operator from accessing the module altogether and/or particular features that would give away its true nature. The bug module <b>135</b> is described in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, the agency service <b>115</b> includes a monitoring interface <b>145</b> for providing data received from mobile bugs <b>105</b> to various monitoring devices <b>107</b> and/or appliances <b>150</b> over the network <b>120</b>. For example, the monitoring interface <b>145</b> may provide monitoring devices <b>107</b> with data corresponding to the status (e.g., transmitting or disconnected) of one or more mobile bugs <b>105</b>. If the mobile bug <b>105</b> is transmitting real-time data, the monitoring interface <b>145</b> can stream data such as audio from the active transmission, GPS coordinates with heading, speed and coordinates of last-reported locations for placement on a map, collected image or video data, and the internet protocol address and/or telephone numbers of other personnel monitoring or having access to the mobile bug. In some embodiments, the monitoring interface <b>145</b> syncs collected data prior to transmission or includes tags in the transmitted data for synchronization of playback at the monitoring device <b>107</b>. The monitoring interface <b>145</b> can also stream, or provide for download, previously recorded monitoring sessions.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments, the agency service <b>115</b> provides a monitoring module <b>140</b> to monitoring devices <b>107</b> for accessing the monitoring interface <b>145</b>. The monitoring module <b>140</b> transmits requests associated with configuring a mobile bug <b>105</b> and receiving real-time data collected by monitored bugs. For example, the monitoring module <b>140</b> may provide a user interface or status dashboard with options for provisioning virtual numbers, mapping a transmitting number of a mobile bug <b>105</b> or monitoring device <b>107</b> to a given virtual number and assigning key-ins for connecting to the virtual number. In one embodiment, the dashboard provides an option to toggle a recording session on or off with the agency service <b>115</b>. When the recording session is disabled, the monitoring device <b>105</b> still receives real-time data, but the agency service <b>115</b>, appliance <b>150</b> and provider <b>127</b> do not store copied of the collected data.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The monitoring module <b>140</b> may also display real-time status information for the mobile bug <b>105</b> including current GPS location, tracked GPS location, live audio and image data, mapping table information and other information collected from the mobile bug and streamed by the monitoring interface <b>145</b>. Similarly, the monitoring module <b>140</b> may be used to access and playback historic activity associated with a given virtual number or mobile bug <b>105</b>. For example, the monitoring module <b>140</b> may download files for playback or steam them. In addition to interfacing with the agency service <b>115</b>, the monitoring module <b>140</b> may interface with an appliance <b>150</b> that stores (or backs up) collected data within the agency <b>110</b>A. Additionally, the monitoring module <b>140</b> may include functionality of the bug module <b>135</b> and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, the agency <b>110</b>A includes an appliance <b>150</b> for storing data collected by mobile bugs <b>105</b>. The appliance <b>150</b> may utilize the monitoring interface <b>145</b> provided by the agency service <b>115</b> for updating stored data or receive data directly from mobile bugs <b>105</b>. Additionally, the appliance <b>150</b> may receive audio recorded on a virtual number and associated transcripts from the provider <b>127</b> or agency service <b>115</b>. One example embodiment of the appliance <b>150</b> also includes its own monitoring interface (not shown) that enables monitoring devices <b>107</b> to access real-time and historic data stored on the appliance for the mobile bug <b>105</b>. Monitoring interfaces provided by the agency service <b>115</b> or appliance <b>150</b> may also be accessible via a web browser for streaming or downloading data and include the same or similar options.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Additionally, the appliance <b>150</b> and agency service <b>115</b> may communicate to intermittently update collected data and records at defined intervals or in response to notifications to download data. During the intervals or notification periods, the agency service <b>115</b> may process the data and perform any necessary actions as desired by mobile bugs <b>105</b> or monitoring device <b>107</b> until the data is transferred to the appliance <b>150</b>. In some embodiments, the agency service <b>115</b> maintains a persistent connection with the appliance <b>150</b> to facilitate transfer of real-time data collected by mobile bugs <b>105</b> operated in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one embodiment, the agency service <b>115</b> insures that it, and the provider <b>127</b>, do not possess data collected by mobile bugs <b>105</b> beyond the time needed to facilitate transfer. However, in mission critical situations, operators and other agency <b>110</b>A personnel cannot rely only on the availability of the appliance <b>150</b> for storing and maintaining collected data. Consequently, if the appliance <b>150</b> is unable to take possession of the collected data or go offline during transfer, the agency service <b>115</b> and/or the provider <b>127</b> may maintain possession of the collected data until the appliance <b>150</b> is functioning. Furthermore, the agency service <b>115</b> and/or provider <b>127</b> may determine whether checksums, hashes or sizes of transferred data match the appliance's <b>150</b> version prior to deleting stored data.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some embodiments, the agency service <b>115</b> maintains an appliance instead of, or in addition to, the agency <b>110</b>A. In such cases, the appliance may exist as a dedicated piece of hardware or remote storage. Alternatively, embodiments of the appliance <b>150</b> may be implemented in a cloud computing and storage stack available on the network <b>120</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a bug module <b>135</b> according to one example embodiment. As mentioned above, the bug module <b>135</b> may be downloaded from the agency service <b>115</b> to the mobile bug <b>105</b> and executed to collect and transmit data to entities on the network <b>120</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bug module <b>135</b> itself includes multiple modules. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bug module <b>135</b> includes a connection module <b>205</b>, GPS module <b>210</b>, imaging module <b>215</b>, protection module <b>220</b> and provisioning module <b>225</b>. In some embodiments, the functions are distributed among the modules in a different manner than described herein. Other embodiments have additional and/or other modules.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The connection module <b>205</b> maintains a persistent connection between the mobile bug <b>105</b> and a virtual number such as the receiving number mapped to the transmitting number of the mobile bug <b>105</b>. For example, the operator may move into an area without network <b>120</b> service and unknowingly disconnect the mobile bug <b>105</b> from the receiving number or otherwise prevent successful transfer of data to an entity on the network. The connection module <b>205</b> receives input from the operator including the receiving number associated with the mobile bug <b>105</b>. Once a connection with the receiving number is established, the connection module <b>205</b> detects network <b>120</b> disruptions such as dropped calls, timeouts or packet loss and automatically reestablishes connection with the receiving number or retries transmission of collected data over the network.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In one embodiment, the connection module <b>205</b> communicates with a native dialer of the mobile bug <b>106</b> to redial the receiving number and reestablish the connection without intervention from the operator. When the operator desires to terminate transmission, the connection module <b>205</b> may receive input from a designated disconnect button to terminate the call and stop the auto-redialing process.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Depending on the mobile bug's <b>105</b> capabilities, the communication module <b>205</b> may enable placement/receipt of outgoing and incoming calls (e.g., other than those placed within the module to the receiving number) during monitoring (e.g., via call waiting features) within the native dialer application or similar. Embodiments of the communication module <b>205</b> and/or protection module <b>220</b> may suppress visual notifications or queues that the communication module <b>205</b> is maintaining a connection with the receiving number. In some instances, the communication module <b>205</b> can pass audio from the inbound or outbound call to the call-waiting connection with the receiving number to prevent gaps in audio monitoring.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The GPS module <b>210</b> communicates with a native GPS receiver on the mobile bug <b>105</b> to receive GPS location data. The GPS module <b>210</b> may also communicate with other radio receivers and directional mechanisms (e.g., compass or accelerometers) on the mobile bug <b>105</b> to receive additional location data. The GPS module <b>210</b> processes the GPS and radio location data to determine and refine an estimated location measurement for the mobile bug <b>105</b>. The location measurement may include, but is not limited to, a latitude, longitude, altitude, heading, speed, associated accuracy measurement and the time and date of recording. The GPS module <b>210</b> transmits the determined location measurement over the network <b>120</b> the agency service <b>115</b> or other entity. In one embodiment, the GPS module <b>210</b> streams the location measurement in real-time.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The imaging module <b>215</b> communicates with a native image sensor on the mobile bug <b>105</b> for capturing still images or videos. The imaging module <b>215</b> may downsample (e.g., compress) collected image data for transmission over the network <b>120</b> based on available bandwidth. Thus, for example, the imaging module <b>215</b> may stream the collected image data in real-time. High-resolution image data may be stored directly on the device for subsequent transmission as bandwidth becomes available.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some embodiments, a protection module <b>220</b> interfaces with the operating system of the mobile bug <b>105</b> to provide options or functionality for concealing operations of the bug module <b>135</b> on the mobile bug <b>105</b>. For example, the protection module <b>220</b> provides operators with option to run the bug module <b>135</b> in the background and only reveal or access the bug module in response to a specified key-in (e.g., button-press combination, password or other personal identification). In another example, the protection module <b>220</b> mimics the look and feel of the native operating system or calling application on the phone to conceal use of bug module <b>135</b> functionality. However, unlike the native operating system or calling application, the protection module <b>220</b> provides password protection, locking (e.g., with a key-in) or otherwise visually concealed or protected configuration options and viewing of current call activity for connections established using the communications module <b>205</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The provisioning module <b>225</b> interfaces with the provider <b>127</b> or agency services <b>115</b> to provision virtual numbers and modify virtual number assignments and function in the field. Alternatively, a web browser on the mobile bug <b>105</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some embodiments, the bug module <b>135</b> and the modules therein interface and communicate with non-native devices attached to the mobile bug <b>105</b>. For example, audio, images and locations data can be determined from accessories coupled (e.g., wired microphone or imaging device) or wirelessly connected (e.g., Bluetooth headset) to the mobile bug <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Virtual Number Provisioning</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is an interaction diagram illustrating a method for provisioning <b>300</b> and mapping virtual numbers for operating and monitoring a mobile bug <b>105</b> according to one example embodiment. Initially, the agency service <b>115</b> receives <b>310</b> a request including a calling code for provisioning <b>300</b> a virtual number from a monitoring device <b>107</b>, mobile bug <b>105</b>, provided web interface or other entity. The calling code can include an area code and country code where the provisioned virtual number will be operated.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The agency service <b>115</b> queries <b>320</b> the provider for virtual numbers matching the specified calling code. The provider <b>127</b> returns <b>330</b> a list of available virtual numbers to the agency service <b>115</b> which, in turn, transmits the virtual numbers for display to the requestor. The agency service <b>115</b> receives <b>335</b> one or more virtual number selections and claims <b>340</b> each selected virtual number from the provider <b>127</b>. The agency service <b>115</b> may optionally include corresponding ANI and caller identification information for a virtual number that may be edited on the requesting device <b>105</b>, <b>107</b> or in the web interface. The agency service <b>115</b> subsequently stores the modified virtual number information and instructs the provider <b>127</b> to update the associated virtual number information.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">With one or more virtual numbers claimed, the agency service <b>115</b> can receive mapping requests for the virtual numbers and, in turn, map <b>350</b> the virtual numbers responsive to information in the mapping request. For example, the requestor may be prompted to enter the transmitting number of a mobile bug <b>105</b> for association with a virtual number to be used as a receiving number. The agency service <b>115</b> stores the transmitting number of the mobile bug <b>105</b> and the receiving number in a mapping table (e.g., at the agency service <b>115</b> or on the appliance <b>150</b>). The requestor may modify the mapping at any time, without any interruption of service at the receiving number.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Oftentimes, receiving numbers have a different country code (or area code) than monitoring devices <b>107</b> connecting to the receiving number to monitor the mobile bug <b>105</b>. In some cases, the requestor knows the country code or area code where the monitoring devices <b>107</b> are located. Accordingly, to avoid costly charges for the agency <b>110</b>A, the agency service <b>115</b> allows the requestor to provision additional virtual numbers with the known country codes and area codes for use as monitoring numbers. The agency service <b>115</b> may then receive mapping requests for the monitoring numbers and, in turn map monitoring numbers to specified receiving numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When a monitoring device <b>107</b> subsequently dials a monitoring number, the agency service <b>115</b> identifies the associated receiving number from the mapping table and instructs the provider <b>127</b> to connect the monitoring device <b>107</b> to the receiving number or pass audio from the receiving number to the monitoring number and connect the monitoring device to the monitoring number.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In some embodiments, monitoring numbers can be tied to the transmitting number of a mobile bug <b>105</b> for automatic mapping to receiving numbers. For example, an operator using the same mobile bug <b>105</b> for multiple investigations may utilize a different receiving number for each investigation (e.g., to keep distinct records). Rather than requiring the operator or personnel monitoring the operator to assign monitoring numbers (or frequently modify mapping) to each receiving number on an individual basis, a monitoring number can be tied to the mobile bug <b>105</b>. When the mobile bug <b>105</b> is mapped or used with a receiving number, the agency service <b>115</b> maps the tied monitoring number to the receiving number. In such a way, a given monitoring number may be dedicated to monitoring a particular mobile bug <b>105</b>. A requestor may re-specify the mapping configuration as needed to change or swap claimed virtual numbers and transmitting numbers between receiving numbers and monitoring numbers.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Example embodiments of monitoring device <b>107</b> mapping to receiving numbers and/or monitoring numbers can be performed in the same or similar fashion as mobile bug <b>105</b> mappings.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is a table illustrating an example embodiment of virtual number mapping <b>350</b> for operating and monitoring a mobile bug <b>105</b>. As shown, mapping table <b>360</b>A includes a number of receiving numbers <b>363</b>A mapped to corresponding transmitting numbers <b>361</b>A (e.g., of mobile bugs <b>105</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">When the agency service <b>115</b> receives connection requests to receiving numbers <b>363</b>A from the network <b>120</b>, the agency service identifies the connecting device as the mobile bug <b>105</b> based on the transmitting number <b>361</b>A stored in the mapping table <b>360</b>A. If the connecting device's number does not match the transmitting number <b>361</b>A, the agency service <b>115</b> identifies the device as a monitoring device <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Prior to connecting the monitoring device <b>107</b> to the receiving number, the agency service <b>115</b> may wait or instruct the provider <b>127</b> to wait for key-in of a specified password. If an improper password or no password is received, the monitoring device <b>107</b> is disconnected. In one embodiment, the monitoring device <b>107</b> must enter the password within a given time period (e.g., <b>10</b>-<b>30</b> seconds) without being prompted to mitigate suspicion if the line is dialed by another party. In some embodiments, the mapping table <b>360</b>A further includes mappings of monitoring device <b>107</b> transmitting numbers to explicitly identify monitoring devices in addition to mobile bugs <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> is a table illustrating an example embodiment of virtual number mapping <b>350</b> for operating and monitoring a mobile bug <b>105</b>. As shown, mapping table <b>360</b>B includes a number of receiving numbers <b>363</b>B mapped to corresponding transmitting numbers <b>361</b>B (e.g., of mobile bugs <b>105</b>). Additionally shown are a number of monitoring numbers <b>365</b> mapped to the receiving numbers <b>363</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When the agency service <b>115</b> receives connection requests to monitoring numbers <b>365</b> from the network <b>120</b>, the agency service automatically identifies the connecting device as a monitoring device <b>107</b> and identifies the associated receiving number <b>363</b>B from the mapping table <b>360</b>B. The agency service <b>115</b>, in turn, instructs the provider <b>127</b> to connect the monitoring device <b>107</b> with the receiving number <b>363</b>B (e.g., directly, or through the monitoring number <b>365</b>). Prior to connecting the monitoring device <b>107</b>, key-in of a specified password may be required. In some embodiments, the mapping table <b>360</b>A further includes mappings of monitoring device <b>107</b> transmitting numbers to explicitly identify monitoring devices in addition to mobile bugs <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an interaction diagram illustrating a method for connecting <b>400</b> a monitoring device <b>107</b> or mobile bug <b>105</b> to a virtual number according to one example embodiment. Once the agency service <b>115</b> provisions <b>300</b> a virtual number with the provider <b>127</b>, a mobile bug <b>105</b> or monitoring device <b>107</b> may connect <b>400</b> to the virtual number. To activate a mobile bug <b>105</b> the operator may simply dial <b>410</b> the receiving number mapped to his mobile phone. Similarly, personnel using a monitoring device <b>107</b> may dial <b>410</b> the receiving number mapped to the mobile bug <b>105</b> to monitor the bug. Alternatively, personnel using a monitoring device <b>107</b> may dial <b>410</b> the monitoring number mapped to the receiving number.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The provider <b>127</b> receives the connection request via the telephony network <b>125</b> and identifies <b>420</b> the dialed number as a virtual number provisioned <b>300</b> by agency service <b>115</b>. Accordingly, in embodiments where the agency service <b>115</b> stores the mapping table, the provider <b>127</b> passes the transmitting number of the device attempting to connect to the virtual number to the agency service <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The agency service <b>115</b>, in turn, identifies <b>430</b> the device attempting to connect to the virtual number as either the mobile bug <b>105</b> or a monitoring device <b>107</b> from the mapping table. In the case of the mobile bug <b>105</b>, the agency service <b>115</b> determines that the transmitting number stored in the mapping table for the dialed receiving number matches the number of device attempting to connect to the receiving number. The agency service <b>115</b> then instructs the provider <b>127</b> to connect <b>440</b> the device to the receiving number as the mobile bug <b>105</b> and disable (e.g., mute) outgoing audio to the mobile bug.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In one embodiment, the agency service <b>115</b> identifies <b>430</b> devices with numbers that do not match the transmitting number stored in the mapping table for a receiving number as monitoring devices <b>107</b>. The agency service <b>115</b> then instructs the provider <b>127</b> to connect <b>440</b> the device to the receiving number as a monitoring device <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">If the agency service <b>115</b> determines that the device is attempting to connect to a monitoring number, the agency service <b>115</b> identifies <b>430</b> the device as a monitoring device <b>107</b>. The agency service <b>115</b> then determines which receiving number the monitoring number is mapped to and instructs the provider <b>127</b> to connect <b>440</b> the device to the receiving number (e.g., directly or via the monitoring number) as a monitoring device <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The monitoring devices <b>107</b> may communicate with other devices monitoring the mobile bug <b>105</b> (e.g., like a conference call between the receiving number and/or monitoring numbers) although no audio is transmitted to the mobile bug. Additionally, the provider <b>127</b> or agency service <b>115</b> may provide the monitoring devices <b>107</b>A with key combinations (e.g., *1, 2, etc.) to mute other monitoring devices <b>107</b>, the mobile bug <b>105</b> or their own device.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some embodiments, the PSTN or provider <b>127</b> fails to pass the transmitting number associated with a mobile bug <b>105</b> (or monitoring device <b>107</b>) to the provider or agency service <b>115</b>. For example, the provider <b>127</b> or agency service <b>115</b> may receive a number other than the mobile bug's <b>105</b> and incorrectly identify the mobile bug. Some example PSTN and provider <b>127</b> failures are all zeroes numbers (+00 000-000-0000), restricted numbers (737-874-2833) or simply an incorrect number for the mobile bug <b>105</b>. In any instance, the agency service <b>115</b> may be unable to identify the mobile bug <b>105</b> by the received transmitting number.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The agency service <b>115</b> can recognize that some numbers are passed incorrectly (e.g., a restricted number or zeroes number). In response, the agency service <b>115</b> may play a prompt or instruct the provider <b>127</b> to play a prompt such as &#x201c;press <b>1</b> for a mobile bug or press <b>2</b> for a monitoring device.&#x201d; In practice, the prompt can be ambiguous (e.g., please enter the extension of the party you are trying to reach or similar) for the safety of the operator if another party dials the virtual number. Operators or personnel may then key-in as using a mobile bug <b>105</b> or monitoring device <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Alternatively, as the key-ins of the mobile bug <b>105</b> and monitoring device <b>107</b> typically differ, the agency service <b>115</b> may instruct the provider <b>127</b> to simply play a generic tone or number not available recording to notify users that they need to key-in. The matching of a key-in with stored authentication information identifies and activates the connecting device as the mobile bug <b>105</b> (or monitoring device <b>107</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, the agency service <b>115</b> may prompt all connecting device to key-in for identification. For example, an agency <b>110</b>A may want to enable the option to use unmapped devices as mobile bugs <b>105</b> on a specified receiving number.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Operating a Mobile Bug</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an interaction diagram illustrating a method for operating <b>500</b> a mobile bug <b>105</b> according to one example embodiment. Once the connection <b>400</b> between the mobile bug <b>105</b> and the receiving number is established, the provider <b>127</b> records audio on the line from the mobile bug.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The mobile bug <b>105</b> collects <b>510</b> audio data using a microphone coupled to the mobile bug. The mobile bug <b>105</b>, in turn, transmits <b>520</b> the collected audio data to the provider <b>127</b> by way of the connection to the receiving number. The provider <b>127</b>, in addition to enabling monitoring devices <b>107</b> to connect to the receiving number, transmits the audio data received from the mobile bug <b>105</b> to the agency service <b>115</b> or appliance <b>150</b> over the network <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The mobile bug <b>105</b> may also collect <b>510</b> image data using an image sensor coupled to the mobile bug. The mobile bug <b>105</b>, in turn, transmits <b>520</b> the collected image data to the agency service <b>115</b>. In some embodiments, the mobile bug <b>105</b> downsamples collected image data (e.g., based on available network <b>120</b> bandwidth) such that mobile bug <b>105</b> can stream image or video in real-time.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Furthermore, the mobile bug <b>105</b> may also collect <b>510</b> location data from GPS receivers and other direction mechanism coupled to the mobile bug. The mobile bug <b>105</b> determines a location measurement including the position of the mobile bug, direction and speed of the mobile bug and associated accuracy of the measurement. The mobile bug <b>105</b> transmits <b>520</b> the location measurement to the agency service <b>115</b>. In some embodiments, the mobile bug <b>105</b> determines and transmits <b>520</b> the location measurements in real-time to the agency service <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some instances, the connection <b>400</b> between the mobile bug <b>105</b> and the receiving number (e.g., via the provider <b>127</b>) or the agency service <b>115</b> may be terminated or timeout. In the case of a disconnection from the receiving number, the mobile bug <b>105</b> attempts to reestablish <b>540</b> the terminated connection in the background by redialing the receiving number and automatically providing any necessary key-in information. To reestablish <b>540</b> a connection with the agency service <b>115</b>, the mobile bug <b>105</b> may intermittently test network <b>120</b> availability and subsequently connect to the agency service <b>115</b> when able.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In one embodiment, the mobile bug transmits <b>520</b> data collected during disconnect periods in the background of real-time data. For example, while the provider <b>127</b> typically handles audio data via the receiving number, the agency service <b>115</b> may receive any audio data collected during disconnect periods. Accordingly, the agency service <b>115</b> may update <b>530</b> the appliance <b>150</b> with the received audio data. The agency service <b>115</b> or provider <b>127</b> can also update <b>530</b> the appliance with any other data received from the provider <b>127</b> and/or mobile bug <b>105</b>.</p>
