<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Example embodiments of the present invention relate to an etchant for a metal layer including copper or a copper alloy, a method of manufacturing a display substrate using the etchant and a display substrate. More particularly, example embodiments of the present invention relate to an etchant for a metal layer including copper or copper alloy, which may be used in a manufacturing process for a display substrate, a method of manufacturing a display substrate using the etchant and a display substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a display panel includes a display substrate including a thin-film transistor as a switching element for driving a pixel. The display substrate may include a plurality of metal patterns, which are generally formed through a photolithography process. According to the photolithography process, a photoresist layer is formed on a film, which is an object of etching, and the photoresist layer is exposed to light and developed to form a photoresist pattern, and the film is etched by an etchant through the photoresist pattern as an etch-stopping layer.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the film, which is an object of etching, includes copper, an etchant for the film may include a peroxide etchant and a non-peroxide etchant. The peroxide etchant may cause an explosion due to a chemical reaction caused when the peroxide etchant etches the film including copper. When the conventional non-peroxide etchant is used, a cumulative amount of etched films may be small. Furthermore, the conventional non-peroxide etchant may have a low storage stability at a room temperature, and the composition of the non-peroxide etchant may need to be changed depending on the thickness of the film.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Hereinafter, an etchant according to an example embodiment of the present invention will be explained with reference to experimental results. Thereafter, a method of manufacturing a display substrate using the etchant will be explained.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">An etchant according to an example embodiment of the present invention includes, for example, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid, a corrosion inhibition agent and water.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The phosphoric acid, the nitric acid and the acetic acid in the etchant mainly etch a metal film including, for example, copper or a copper alloy. It is noted that the metal film in the present example embodiment includes copper or a copper alloy but example embodiments of the present invention are not limited thereto but rather the etchant of example embodiments of the present invention may also be used on other metal films used in the manufacture of a display substrate. The phosphoric acid serves as a main oxidizer oxidizing copper or a copper alloy to etch the copper or the copper alloy. The nitric acid serves as an auxiliary oxidizer which oxidizes copper or a copper alloy to thereby etch the copper or the copper alloy, and cooperates with the phosphoric acid thereby adjusting an etching rate, a side etching and a taper angle. The acetic acid serves as a buffer adjusting an etching rate. The phosphoric acid, the nitric acid and the acetic acid may be prepared according to a conventional method known in the art. The contents of the phosphoric acid, the nitric acid and the acetic acid may be determined such that stability of the etchant is not deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When the content of the phosphoric acid is less than about 50% by weight based on a total weight of the etchant, the etching rate is reduced so that the metal film including copper or a copper alloy is not sufficiently etched. When the content of the phosphoric acid is greater than about 70% by weight based on the total weight of the etchant, the metal film including copper or a copper alloy is excessively etched. Thus, it may be difficult to obtain a desired profile of a pattern. Therefore, the content of the phosphoric acid should be about 50% to about 70% based on the total weight of the etchant.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">When the content of the nitric acid is less than, for example, about 1% by weight based on the total weight of the etchant, the etching rate is reduced so that the metal film including copper or a copper alloy is not sufficiently etched. When the content of the nitric acid is greater than, for example, about 5% by weight based on the total weight of the etchant, a photoresist may be peeled off. Thus, a metal pattern formed from the metal film may be disconnected in a following process, or the size of the metal pattern may be excessively reduced such that the metal pattern may not sufficiently serve as an electrode. Therefore, the content of the nitric acid should be about 1% to about 5% based on the total weight of the etchant.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">When the content of the acetic acid is less than about 10% by weight based on the total weight of the etchant, the uniformity of a metal pattern formed from the metal film is reduced. When the content of the acetic acid is greater than about 20% by weight based on the total weight of the etchant, a bubble is generated in the course of etching the metal film. When the bubble is disposed between adjacent fine patterns, a gap between the adjacent fine patterns may not be etched. Therefore, the content of the acetic acid should be about 10% to about 20% based on the total weight of the etchant.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The corrosion inhibition agent may prevent the metal from being rapidly etched by the phosphoric acid, the nitric acid and the acetic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The corrosion inhibition agent may include, for example, an azole-based compound. Examples of the corrosion inhibition agent may include but are not limited to aminotetrazole, benzotriazole (BTA), tolytriazole, pyrazole, pyrrole, imidazole, 2-methyl imidazole, 2-ethyl imidazole, 2-propyl imidazole, 2-amino imidazole, 4-metyl imidazole, 4-ethyl imidazole, 4-propyl imidazole and the like. These can be used each alone or in a combination thereof. For example, the corrosion inhibition agent may include BTA.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the content of the corrosion inhibition agent is less than 0.1% by weight based on the total weight of the etchant, the corrosion inhibition agent cannot substantially prevent corrosion of the metal pattern so that a critical dimension loss is increased. When the content of the corrosion inhibition agent is greater than 2% by weight based on the total weight of the etchant, the metal pattern may not be etched, or an etching rate may be excessively reduced. Therefore, the content of the corrosion inhibition agent should be about 0.1% to about 2% based on the total weight of the etchant.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The etchant also includes water together with the phosphoric acid, the nitric acid, the acetic acid and the corrosion inhibition agent. Water in the etchant is not limited to a specific type of water. For example, deionized water may be used in the etchant. In addition, deionized water having a specific resistance of, for example, more than 18 M&#x3a9;/cm may be used in the etchant. The content of the water is determined according to the contents of the phosphoric acid, the nitric acid, the acetic acid and the corrosion inhibition agent. For example, the content of the water may be a reminder obtained by subtracting the contents of the phosphoric acid, the nitric acid, the acetic acid and the corrosion inhibition agent from the total weight of the etchant.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an embodiment, the etchant may further include a fluorine-containing compound together with the phosphoric acid, the nitric acid, the acetic acid, the corrosion inhibition agent and water. The fluorine-containing compound may serve to etch a metal film including, for example, a titanium layer, a molybdenum layer, a titanium alloy layer or a molybdenum alloy layer. For example, the metal film may include a titanium layer and a copper layer or a copper alloy layer.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Any compound that can generate a fluorine ion or a multiatom-fluorine ion through dissociation in a solution may be used for the fluorine-containing compound. Examples of the fluorine-containing compound may include but are not limited to hydrogen fluoride (HF), ammonium fluoride (NH<sub>4</sub>F), sodium fluoride (NaF), potassium fluoride (KF), ammonium hydrogen fluoride (NH<sub>4</sub>FHF), sodium hydrogen fluoride (NaFHF), potassium hydrogen fluoride (KFHF) and the like. These can be used each alone or in a combination thereof. For example, the fluorine-containing compound may include NH<sub>4</sub>F, KF or NH<sub>4</sub>FHF.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When the content of the fluorine-containing compound is less than about 0.2% by weight based on the total weight of the etchant, an etching residue may be generated. When the content of the fluorine-containing compound is greater than about 2% by weight based on the total weight of the etchant, a base substrate including glass may be etched. Therefore, the content of the corrosion inhibition agent should be about 0.2% to about 2% based on the total weight of the etchant.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Alternatively, in an embodiment, the etchant may further include an additive together with the phosphoric acid, the nitric acid, the acetic acid, the corrosion inhibition agent and water. For example, the additive may include a surfactant, a sequestering agent, etc. Suitable surfactants which may be included in the etchant of example embodiments of the present invention may be selected from, for example, nonionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, amphoteric surfactants and anionic surfactants. The surfactant reduces a surface tension thereby increasing etching uniformity. In addition, suitable sequestering agents which may be included in the etchant of example embodiments of the present invention may be, for example, derivatives of polycarboxylic acid, amino acetic acid, or nitrilo-triacetic acid. When the content of the additive is less than, for example, about 0.0001% by weight based on the total weight of the etchant, a desired effect is hardly achieved. When the content of the additive is greater than about 0.01% by weight based on the total weight of the etchant, the chemical stability of the etchant may be reduced. Thus, the content of the additive should be about 0.0001% to about 0.01% based on the total weight of the etchant. When the etchant further includes the additive, the content of the water may be a reminder obtained by subtracting the contents of the phosphoric acid, the nitric acid, the acetic acid, the corrosion inhibition agent and the additive from the total weight of the etchant.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, a gate metal layer <b>111</b> is formed on a base substrate <b>110</b>, and a first photoresist pattern <b>112</b> is formed on the gate metal layer <b>111</b>. The gate metal layer <b>111</b> is, for example, a single-layered metal layer including copper or a copper alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The gate metal layer <b>111</b> is etched by using the first photoresist pattern <b>112</b> as an etching mask and using an etchant to form a gate line GL, a gate electrode GE and a gate pad electrode GPE. The etchant used for etching the gate metal layer <b>111</b> includes, for example, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, acetic acid, a corrosion inhibition agent and water. The etchant is substantially the same as the previously explained etchant according to an example embodiment of the present invention. Thus, any repeated explanation will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the etchant is used for etching the gate metal layer <b>111</b>, a skew of a metal pattern formed from the gate metal layer <b>111</b> may not be increased even if the thickness of the gate metal layer <b>111</b> is increased or even if an etching time is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Particularly, when the etchant is sprayed to the gate metal layer <b>111</b>, the corrosion inhibition agent, for example, benzotriazole, in the etchant is adhered to an exposed side surface of the gate metal layer <b>111</b>. A portion of the gate metal layer <b>111</b>, which is not covered by the first photoresist pattern <b>112</b>, is physically etched by a spraying pressure greater than about 0.1 Mpa. A side surface of a portion of the gate metal layer <b>111</b>, which is covered by the first photoresist pattern <b>112</b>, is exposed to the etchant as the portion of the gate metal layer <b>111</b>, which is not covered by the first photoresist pattern <b>112</b>, is etched. However, a pressure of the etchant applied to the side surface of the gate metal layer <b>111</b> is smaller than the pressure of the etchant applied to the portion of the gate metal layer <b>111</b>, which is not covered by the photoresist pattern <b>112</b>. Thus, benzotriazole of the etchant is combined with the copper or the copper alloy of the gate metal layer <b>111</b> according to the following Reaction Formula 1 so that benzotriazole of the etchant is adhered to the side surface of the gate metal layer <b>111</b>.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The gate metal layer <b>111</b> may be partially etched under an end of the first photoresist pattern <b>112</b> because a pressure of the etchant applied to the gate metal layer <b>111</b> under the end of the first photoresist pattern <b>112</b> is not sufficiently small so that the protective layer PV is not formed.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">According to the method of manufacturing a display substrate, a side surface of the gate metal layer <b>111</b>, which is exposed to an etchant in an etching process, is protected by the protective layer PV.

Thus, even if an etching time for the gate metal layer <b>111</b> is increased, or even if a thickness of the gate metal layer <b>111</b> is increased, a length of a skew caused by over-etching of the gate metal layer <b>111</b> is not increased. According to the present example embodiment of the present invention, over-etching of the gate metal layer <b>111</b> may be prevented. Thus, a margin of a pitch between first photoresist patterns <b>112</b> may be sufficiently obtained, and the gate line GL, the gate electrode GE and the gate pad electrode GPE may have a relatively large thickness and a relatively small width.

<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Furthermore, the first metal layer <b>141</b> formed from the first metal film <b>211</b> is temporarily oxidized in an etching process so that the first metal layer <b>141</b> is prevented from being over-etched. When the first and second metal layers <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> are etched by the etchant, a voltage difference between the first and second metal layers <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> is generated because the first and second metal layers <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> have different materials. Thus, electrons may move from the second metal layer <b>142</b> to the first metal layer <b>141</b> to increase the etching rate of the second metal layer <b>142</b>.

<p id="p-0106" num="0105">A substrate including a metal layer containing copper with a thickness of about 2.0 um according to sample 3 was prepared. A photoresist pattern was formed on the metal layer and patterned by the etchant prepared according to Table 1 by using the photoresist pattern as an etching mask. Thereafter, a skew length between an end of the photoresist pattern and an etched surface of the metal layer was measured, and thus obtained results are shown by line C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a graph showing skew lengths of samples 1 to 3 with respect to an etching time, which were measured after the metal layers of samples 1 to 3 were etched by the etchant prepared according to Table 1.

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Referring to the line A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, when the skew lengths of the metal layer of sample 1 were measured after a lapse of time for over-etching of about 10%, about 30%, about 50%, about 70% and about 100% from an end time of etching the metal layer of sample 1, the measured skew lengths were respectively about 0.42 um, about 0.4 um, about 0.58 um, about 0.41 um and about 0.43 um. The end times of etching the metal layer of sample 1 were measured by an end point detector (EPD) in connection with line A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Thus, it can be noted that the skew length of the metal layer of sample 1 was almost maintained even as the etching time was increased. Furthermore, the skew length of the metal layer of sample 1 was short with compared to a skew length formed by a conventional non-peroxide etchant. Thus, it can be noted that the metal layer of sample 1 was not over-etched even as the etching time was increased.</p>

The end times of etching the metal layer of sample 3 were measured by the EPD in connection with line C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Thus, it can be noted that the skew length of the metal layer of sample 3 was short compared to the skew length of the metal layers of samples 1 and 2 and was almost maintained even as the etching time was increased.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">According to the above, the skew lengths of the metal layers of samples 1 to 3 were almost maintained even as the etching time was increased. The skew lengths of the metal layers of samples 1 to 3 were not same as each other. However, the skew lengths of the metal layers of samples 1 to 3 may be within a functionally equivalent range in view of a process environment. Thus, it can be noted that the etchant according to an example of the present invention may etch metal layers including copper and having different thicknesses without increasing a skew length.</p>
