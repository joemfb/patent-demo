<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A feedback system for identifying an external force, includes an operation plate and a pressure-sensing unit. The pressure-sensing unit includes an elastic member supporting the operation plate and a pressure sensor inside the elastic member. The pressure sensor includes a pressure sensitive film. An inner side of the elastic member is filled with fluid material which acts on the pressure sensitive film. The operation plate is driven by the external force to be slant which extrudes the elastic member to deform so as to change fluid pressure of the fluid material limited in the elastic member, and such change of the fluid pressure can be sensed by the pressure sensitive film of the pressure sensor so as to identify the movement and the intensity of the external force.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a feedback system applied in Human-Machine Interface (HMI) for identifying movement and intensity of an external force.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Human-Machine Interface (HMI) plays a very important role in the development of the multimedia applications and directly influences the operating feelings of end users. Early, the only HMI is a keyboard which is constrainedly suitable for the applications based on command line interface and text interface, while is insufficient for processing graphics. In 1980s, mouse widely used in Mac computer accelerated the development of the graphics user interface. Till now, mouse and Windows operation system maintain major market of the multimedia applications. One of the disadvantages of mouse is its big profile so that it is not suitable for being used in small mobile equipments, such as handset, PDA and Notebook etc. Besides, a reasonable large space is needed for the movement of the mouse, which restricts the usage thereof. In 1990s, Ted Selker invented a TranckPoint (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,867,808) which was widely used in Thinkpad series notebook computers of IBM. After year 1994, George E. Gerpheide invented a touchpad (see U.S. Pat. No. 6,222,528) which was firstly used in PowerBook series notebook computers of Apple Inc. The above-mentioned two invention creations accelerate the development of the HMI which is applied in notebook computers.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Handheld terminals raise higher requests about the profile of input systems of the HMI, after entering into the mobile multimedia era. Japanese Sunarrow Ltd. had invented a kind of 3D sensor based on the capacitance-based touch theory (see U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/0257886). Such products have been widely used in Nokia handsets. Besides, Veganov invented a handle operation system based on MEMS sensor (see U.S. Patent Publication No. 2009/0237275).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the development of technologies, developing trends of the HMI are low profile, low cost, good interaction and friendly user experience, in order to be suitable for the rapid growth of consumer electronics and mobile handheld terminals. Hence, an improved feedback system for identifying movement and intensity of an external force is desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A feedback system for identifying movement and intensity of an external force, comprises an operation plate and a pressure-sensing unit. The pressure-sensing unit includes an elastic member supporting the operation plate and a pressure sensor inside the elastic member. The pressure sensor comprises a pressure sensitive film. An inner side of the elastic member is filled with fluid material which acts on the pressure sensitive film. The operation plate is driven by the external force to be slant which extrudes the elastic member to deform so as to change fluid pressure of the fluid material limited in the elastic member, and such change of the fluid pressure can be sensed by the pressure sensitive film of the pressure sensor so as to identify the movement and the intensity of the external force.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The foregoing has outlined rather broadly the features and technical advantages of the present invention in order that the detailed description of the invention that follows may be better understood. Additional features and advantages of the invention will be described hereinafter which form the subject of the claims of the invention.</p>

Besides, each elastic member includes an arced surface <b>211</b> for supporting the operation plate <b>3</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the receiving block <b>4</b> includes a vertical portion <b>41</b> fixed to the support plate <b>1</b> and a limiting stopper <b>42</b> horizontally extending from a top end of the vertical portion <b>41</b>. An opening <b>43</b> is formed by the limiting stopper <b>42</b>, and a first side of the operation plate <b>3</b> is exposed to the exterior through the opening <b>43</b> to be contacted by a finger. The limiting stopper <b>42</b> is located over the operation plate <b>3</b> for restricting upward movement of the operation plate <b>3</b>. The receiving block <b>4</b> is unitarily formed with the support plate <b>1</b> according to the illustrated embodiment of the present invention. However, alternatively, the receiving block <b>4</b> and the support plate <b>1</b> can be separately formed, and then the receiving block <b>4</b> is fastened to the support plate <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The fluid material is limited in the inner side of the elastic member <b>21</b> and restricted by the support plate <b>1</b>. The elastic member <b>21</b> is made of gas-impermeability materials, such as metal or organic materials. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, according to the first embodiment of the present invention, the number of the pressure-sensing units <b>2</b> is four and the pressure-sensing units <b>2</b> are arranged in a square shape which has a center O. The four pressure-sensing units <b>2</b> are labeled a, b, c, and d, respectively, and the actual side length of the square is marked L. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the finger puts a certain force Fz at a point A which has a relative coordinate (x, y) with respect to the center O of the square, and the finger moves along an arrow on the first side of the operation plate <b>3</b>, the forces applied to the pressure-sensing units <b>2</b> can be calculated by the following formulas: F<sub>a</sub>+F<sub>b</sub>+F<sub>c</sub>+F<sub>d</sub>=F<sub>z</sub>; L(2F&#x2212;F<sub>a</sub>&#x2212;F<sub>d)</sub>/2F<sub>z</sub>=x; L(2F&#x2212;F<sub>a</sub>&#x2212;F<sub>b)</sub>/2F<sub>z</sub>=y; It is easy to be understood that a numerical value of the force Fz and an accurate position of the point A can be ascertained through calculating of the changes of the pressure-sensing units <b>2</b>. As a result, the accurate position of the force Fz in the x-y plane, the moving speed of the force Fz, and the pressing force along a vertical direction z all can be calculated for controlling the machine. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the force Fz can be divided into horizontal forces which slant the operation plate <b>3</b>, and a vertical force which results in movement of the operation plate <b>3</b> along the vertical direction. Under this condition, the slant operation plate <b>3</b> extrudes the elastic members <b>21</b> to compress the volume V thereof According the formula, P=n&#x3b3;T/V, the change of volume V results in a corresponding change of the fluid pressure labeled P of the fluid material which is limited in the elastic members <b>21</b>, wherein the letter n represents the amount of substance of the fluid material, and the letter y represents the constant of the fluid material. Such change of the fluid pressure can be sensed by the pressure sensitive film <b>231</b> of each pressure sensor <b>22</b>.

The certain force can be divided into horizontal forces which slant the plate portion <b>51</b>, and a vertical force which compresses the support lever <b>53</b> so that the plate portion <b>51</b> moves along a vertical direction. Under this condition, the slant plate portion <b>51</b> extrudes the elastic members <b>21</b> so at to change fluid pressure of the fluid material limited in the elastic members <b>21</b>. Such change of the fluid pressure can be sensed by the pressure sensitive film <b>231</b> of the pressure sensor <b>22</b>.</p>

Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, when the finger puts a certain force F against the operation handle <b>52</b> along an arrow, the force F can be divided into a component force Fx along the direction x, a component force Fy along the direction y, and a component force Fz along the direction z. The forces applied to the pressure-sensing units can be calculated by the following formulas: &#x221a;{square root over (F<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup>+F<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup>)}=F<sub>xy</sub>; L(F<sub>a</sub>+F<sub>d</sub>&#x2212;F<sub>b</sub>&#x2212;F<sub>c</sub>)/2h=F<sub>x</sub>; L(F<sub>a</sub>+F<sub>b</sub>&#x2212;F<sub>c</sub>&#x2212;F<sub>d</sub>)/2h=F<sub>y</sub>; F<sub>a</sub>+F<sub>b</sub>+F<sub>c</sub>+F<sub>d</sub>=F<sub>z</sub>. It is easy to be understood that a numerical value of the force F and the moving direction thereof can be ascertained through calculating the changes of the pressure-sensing units <b>2</b>. As a result, the accurate position of the force F in the x-y plane, the moving speed of the force F, and the pressing force along the vertical direction z all can be calculated for controlling the machine. According to the embodiment of the present invention, the certain force F is divided into horizontal forces which slant the plate portion <b>51</b>, and a vertical force which results in movement of the plate portion <b>51</b> along the vertical direction.
