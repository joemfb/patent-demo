<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to an actuating fitting and, in particular, to a brake, clutch and/or door lock actuating fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Such fittings are used, in particular, on single-track or multi-track vehicles as manual actuating elements fixed to the steering wheel or as foot actuating elements fixed in the foot space, for braking or engaging the clutch. Other applications, for example as an actuating element for triggering and actuating braking in model vehicles, are also conceivable.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">DE 196 01 249 C2 describes an actuating fitting having a so-called expansion port which, in the unactuated state, establishes a connection between the pressure chamber and the storage container and through which volumes can be equalized.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">EP 0 607 370 B2 discloses an actuating fitting having a so-called central valve which is positioned in the piston and, in the unactuated state, is opened via a positioned fixed stop. This results in a connection between the pressure chamber and the storage container and through which volumes can be equalized.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A disadvantage of the above constructions is that they have in each case large dimensions owing to the storage container, and these storage containers require additional elements, such as covers, seals, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is, therefore, in particular, the object to provide an actuating fitting of the type mentioned at the outset which is compact and can be produced economically with fewer parts.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to embodiments of the invention, the actuating fitting, which in particular is formed as a brake and/or clutch fitting and/or door lock actuating fitting, has a housing in which is arranged a piston moveable in a cylinder space by an actuating element for displacing fluid. An equalizing space and/or storage container is arranged within the cylinder space and/or within the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to embodiments of the invention, the actuating fitting, which in particular is formed as a brake and/or clutch fitting and/or door lock actuating fitting, has a housing in which is arranged a piston moveable in a cylinder space by an actuating element for displacing fluid. A spring element is provided which subjects a transmission element bounding an equalizing space to prestress. As a result, the system can be arranged in any desired orientation, because the continued flow of the fluid from the equalizing space into the system can not be effected by the air pressure but by the spring force. An equalizing space and/or storage container can preferably also be arranged within the cylinder space and/or within the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to the invention, the piston may have an equalizing space section which substantially comprises a cylindrical wall. The equalizing space can thus preferably be arranged in the equalizing space section. Alternatively or additionally, the equalizing space may be defined substantially by the inner wall of the equalizing space section of the piston and a transmission element.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to the invention, a valve device can be arranged within the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the invention, the piston can be arranged in the cylinder space between a pressure space and the equalizing space and/or the storage container.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to the invention, a passage, which has a valve device and connects the pressure space to the equalizing space and/or storage container in a closable manner, may be formed in the piston. On actuation of the actuating fitting, the valve device can close, and the actuating force can then be applied to the piston. Furthermore, the valve device may have a valve needle and a valve seat formed at the passage.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the invention, the piston may have a cavity functioning as an equalizing space and/or storage container and present on the side facing away from the cylinder space.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the invention, the equalizing space may be separable from the cylinder space functioning as the pressure space.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the invention, the piston may have a bore which can preferably be closed by a valve on actuation of the piston and results in separation of the equalizing space from the cylinder space functioning as the pressure space.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to the invention, a force can be applied to one side of the valve. It is necessary for the valve to cover a small distance before the other side forms a valve seat with the bore of the piston and closes the bore, and the now interlocking connection transmitting the induced force to the piston on further induction of force. Thus, a desired displacement movement in the pressure space can be effected by said piston. The small distance covered by the valve may be in a range between 0.1 mm and 5 mm, preferably between 0.2 mm and 3 mm, more preferably between 0.3 mm and 2 mm, and preferably about 1 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the invention, the actuating element may be in the form of a lever or thrust rod.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the invention, that end of the valve which realizes a valve seat with the bore may be of conical shape, with the other end thereof being formed for force induction with a surface to which the force to be applied to the valve can be transmitted from the actuating element by a transmission element in the form of a roller.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the invention, a sealing element bounding the equalizing space on the outside can be arranged in a moveable manner on the valve. The sealing element is supported on the side facing away from the equalizing space against a spring element, and the equalizing space is variable and/or automatically adaptable to the fluid volume to be held. A transmission element may be arranged between the sealing element and the spring element. This may protect the sealing element from tilting and damage.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to the invention, it is possible to achieve the advantage that, regardless of the position of the sealing element in the equalizing space, the same volume is always displaceable in the pressure space on application of force to the piston, with the pressure point of the hydraulic system thus remaining unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the invention, a movement of the valve out of the valve seat can be realized in the unactuated position by the spring element, with the valve being capable of being opened either by the spring element and/or the fluid pressure prevailing in the system. A volume increase resulting from heating of the hydraulic fluid can flow via the valve into the equalizing space. According to the design of the spring element, the sealing element can be pushed back, and the equalizing space can be filled.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to the invention, the piston may be hindered by a fixed stop from moving out of the housing and/or movement of the valve out of the valve seat may be limited in its distance by components for force induction, in particular, the transmission element and actuating element, and/or this limitation may be realizable by a stop for the actuating element on the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the invention, it may be possible for the valve to execute a small distance further in the restoring direction relative to the piston, with the valve being opened until the valve is also limited in its travel by a stop.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The abovementioned object is achieved according to the invention, in particular, in that the equalizing space and/or storage container is arranged within the cylinder bore or within the cylinder space. In addition, all components for separating the equalizing space or storage space and for holding an equalizing volume are positioned within the cylinder bore. This equalizing volume can be closed on actuation of the piston. What is advantageous about this design according to the invention is that a compact arrangement of the equalizing space and/or of the storage container in a perpendicularly arranged cylinder space can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Another advantage is that, in some embodiments of the invention, independent venting can be effected at the highest point of the system if the storage container is oriented upward. There is then no need to provide a venting point. In other embodiments, air can be removed in a very service-friendly manner even by unpracticed persons if a venting point is provided at the top for venting. Positioning of the storage container upward in order to permit venting can then be dispensed with. The abovementioned service friendliness is also true regarding the fillability. Another advantage is that the hydraulic exit through which the displaced fluid volume can be passed to the actuator or actuators, for example, a clutch or brake slave cylinder (brake caliper), can be positioned in the upper region.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It should be mentioned in particular that the inaccessibility of sensitive components leads to a desired security against manipulation.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A further advantage of the actuating fitting designed according to the invention is that pressure impacts cannot lead to damage to any component.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An advantage of the design according to the invention is the realization of an automatic volume equalization in a hydraulic system as a result of temperature variations, and which does not have the disadvantages of known designs and, on the other hand, realizes the necessary functions and, moreover, has convenience features. Particularly when such a hydraulic system is used on model vehicles, extreme compactness, as permitted by the invention, is required in order to be able to realize scaled components corresponding to the original. However, the system according to the invention is not limited to this application. Any hydraulic actuating system can be equipped according to the invention therewith, whether in the form of a brake system, clutch actuating system, or system with self-adjusting or non-self-adjusting piston.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The abovementioned automatic volume equalization as a result of technical heating of the hydraulic fluid can be effected within specified limits in order to keep the pressure point stable in an advantageous manner. Furthermore, the extremely small and compact design of the construction according to the invention is worthy of mention, and, in particular, with the external shape symmetry achieved being of importance here.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">What is significant is that, for the operation of the master cylinder according to the invention, a force can be applied by a lever or a thrust rod to one side of the valve advantageously designed as a valve needle, with it being necessary for the valve needle to cover an advantageously small distance before the other advantageously conical side forms a valve seat with the central bore of the piston.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The features described above can be provided individually but also in combination on an actuating fitting according to the invention in order to further reduce the total number of components.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The actuating fitting according to the invention can be used in particular on motorcycles but also on all other types of vehicles in which lever-actuated hydraulic systems are present, for example on model vehicles, bicycles or vehicles for the disabled.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Further fields of use for the invention comprise, for example, the actuation of doors. Owing to the small overall size, the actuating fitting according to the invention can be used for transmitting the movement of a door handle to the door lock of a vehicle door.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an actuating fitting <b>1</b> which consists of a housing <b>2</b> having a substantially cylindrical bore <b>3</b> for holding further elements. Advantageously, the bore <b>3</b> serving as a cylinder space is virtually perpendicular in order to permit mounting of a vent bore <b>20</b> at the highest point, via which vent bore venting of undesired air can be effected, for example, by a valve which is not shown. A hydraulic exit <b>4</b> through which the displaced fluid volume is passed to at least one actuator <b>18</b> is positioned in the upper region (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0082">The piston <b>5</b> displacing the fluid on actuation of the actuating fitting <b>1</b> is positioned in the cylinder space <b>3</b>. Preferably, the piston <b>5</b> is prestressed by a spring element <b>6</b> designed as a pressure spring, and can execute a stroke established by the design if a force is applied via further elements described below, for example by an actuating element <b>7</b>. The actuating element <b>7</b> is preferably designed as a lever or as a thrust rod.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0083">A valve <b>8</b> preferably designed as a valve needle is positioned in a space <b>19</b> present in the piston <b>5</b>, with the space <b>19</b> being on the side facing away from the pressure chamber <b>31</b>. A preferably conical end of this valve needle <b>8</b> realizes a valve seat <b>10</b> in correspondence with a central bore <b>9</b> of the piston <b>5</b>, with the other end thereof being designed so that a force can be introduced. Preferably, this end is in the form of a surface to which a transmission element <b>11</b> in the form of a roller transmits the force to be applied to the valve needle <b>8</b> from a lever <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0084">The cylindrical tubular space <b>19</b> formed by the outer casing of the valve needle <b>8</b> and the inner casing of the piston <b>5</b> serves as a holding space for the equalization volume, with said equalization volume being closed off from the outside by a preferably spring-prestressed sealing element <b>12</b>. Preferably, a transmission element <b>13</b> is arranged between the sealing element <b>12</b> and a spring element <b>14</b> in the form of a pressure spring, in order to protect the sealing element <b>12</b> from tilting and damage.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0085">The piston <b>5</b> is prevented from traveling out of the housing <b>2</b> by a fixed stop <b>15</b>. The design is such that, in spite of the attached piston <b>5</b>, the valve needle <b>8</b> can execute a movement out of the valve seat <b>10</b> before being limited in its travel by the components for force induction, i.e. the transmission element <b>11</b> and actuating element <b>7</b>. In addition, this limitation can be realized by the stop <b>16</b> of the lever <b>7</b> on the housing <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0086">A force is applied by the lever <b>7</b> to that side of the valve needle <b>8</b> which is preferably in the form of a surface. As a result, this travels a preferably small distance W before the other conical side forms a valve seat <b>10</b> with the central bore <b>9</b> of the piston <b>5</b> (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). This valve seat <b>10</b> hydraulically seals the space <b>19</b> serving as an equalizing space from that region of the cylinder space <b>3</b> which functions as pressure chamber <b>31</b> and, hence, forms a valve <b>17</b>. The now interlocking connection transmits the induced force to the piston <b>5</b>, and the latter executes the desired displacement movement in the pressure chamber <b>31</b>. After reduction of the induced force, the piston <b>5</b>, supported by the pressure spring <b>6</b> preferably present, moves back to its rest position, which is determined by the fixed stop <b>15</b>. The valve needle <b>8</b> can travel a preferably small distance further in the restoration direction relative to the piston <b>5</b> so that the valve <b>17</b> is opened until the valve needle <b>8</b>, too, is limited in its travel by a stop <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0087">A volume increase resulting from heating the hydraulic fluid can pass through the open valve <b>17</b> and, according to the design of the pressure spring <b>14</b> positioned on the valve needle <b>8</b>, will push back the sealing element <b>12</b> at a preferably low fluid pressure and will fill the equalizing space <b>19</b>. The sealing element <b>12</b> is pushed back into the equalizing space designated by <b>19</b>&#x2032; and, thus, increases the size of the equalizing space <b>19</b> holding the fluid (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0088">When the hydraulic fluid cools, this process is reversed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0089">Regardless of the position of the sealing element <b>12</b> in the equalizing space <b>19</b>, the same volume can always be displaced in the pressure chamber <b>31</b> on application of force. The pressure point of a hydraulic system thus remains unchanged.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a view, corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, of the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, but with more fluid being introduced into the system, and with the result that the size of the equalizing space <b>19</b> increases. For this purpose, the sealing element <b>12</b> in the piston <b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is pushed downward against the force of the spring element <b>14</b>. The volume of the equalizing space <b>19</b>&#x2032; is correspondingly smaller. Owing to the larger equalizing space <b>19</b> filled with fluid, it is possible to equalize the wear of the lining if, for example, a brake caliper, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is connected as a slave to the actuating fitting <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0091">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the piston <b>5</b> has an equalizing space section <b>51</b> which has substantially a cylindrical wall which encloses the equalizing space <b>19</b> and the equalizing space <b>19</b>&#x2032;. The transmission element <b>13</b> is displaceably arranged in the equalizing space section <b>51</b>. If more liquid has to be held in the equalizing space <b>19</b> (e.g. temperature equalization), the transmission element <b>13</b> moves against the force of the spring element <b>14</b> in the direction of the equalizing space <b>19</b>&#x2032;, with the air (or gas) present there being compressed or being displaced outward. If, conversely, fluid is to be introduced from the equalizing space <b>19</b>, the transmission element <b>13</b> moves in the direction of the force of the spring element <b>14</b> toward the equalizing space <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0092">By applying a spring element <b>14</b> to the transmission element <b>13</b>, it is possible to install the actuating fitting according to requirements in any desired orientation. As a result, good adaptation to the installation space available in the respective application can be effected.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0093">If self-venting is desired, it is possible to orient the actuating fitting in such a way that the equalizing space <b>19</b> is arranged at the top so that any air present in the system can collect in the equalizing space. To enable self-venting to take place, a region of the equalizing space should be above the valve opening, based on gravitational force, so that air which does not enter the system again during volume equalization can collect therein.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0094">The piston <b>5</b> is provided with a valve section <b>52</b> in which the valve seat <b>10</b> is arranged so that the bore <b>9</b> (passage) can close as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0095">The piston <b>5</b> furthermore has a sealing groove section <b>53</b> in which a sealing element <b>54</b> for sealing against the inner wall of the cylinder space <b>3</b> is provided. The sealing groove section <b>53</b> is terminated by a projection <b>55</b> which is joined to an extension <b>56</b> on which the spring element <b>6</b> is arranged. The bore <b>9</b> extends from the valve section <b>52</b> through the sealing groove section <b>53</b> and the extension <b>56</b> to the pressure chamber <b>31</b>. Alternatively, the bore <b>9</b> could extend, for example, at the end of the sealing section also or only laterally relative to the pressure chamber <b>31</b>.</p>
