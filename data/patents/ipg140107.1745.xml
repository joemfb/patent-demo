<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to methods and apparatus for use in obtaining samples of body fluids for later analysis. It is particularly but not exclusively concerned with the routine non-intravenous [non-IV] sampling of blood from the animals. Such samples are commonly used for DNA analysis and identification, bacteriological and viral analysis, and blood component analysis in modern animal husbandry for herd management, breeding and disease control. They are also of value in relation to public health where the tracing of stock and the identification of animal products is of increasing importance.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">While, the devices and methods of the invention can be used for sampling body fluids other than blood&#x2014;for example, fluids and exudates from superficial or subcutaneous infections, infestations, ulcerations and abscesses&#x2014;such body fluids will normally include blood cells of the animal. For convenience, therefore, the term &#x2018;blood&#x2019; will be used herein to include any body fluid that can be accessed from the surface of the skin of an animal by making cuts, punctures or other shallow penetrations of the skin. This term is not confined to whole blood.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The growth in the routine use of animal blood analysis has created a need for methods and devices that will allow low-cost reliable collection of blood samples from large numbers of animals of many different species. Intravenous or syringe sampling from such large numbers of animals is impractical. Instead, it is common to pierce the ear or tail and to then collect the exuded blood by using blotting paper or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">US patent application 20050263420 A1 by Oommen discloses a device for storage, shipping and retrieval of hair follicles collected from animals for later DNA analysis. The device consists of flaps of sheet material that are secured together by adhesive so that they can be separated to expose an inner surface with light-tack adhesive adapted to receive the hair sample. After placement of the sample, the flaps can be brought together again and held closed by their adhesive. This method has the advantage that it is independent of any existing ear tag and does not require the attachment of another ear tag. However, extraction of DNA from hair follicles is more expensive and less versatile than the analysis of blood collected on adsorbent and/or absorbent material.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">US patent application 2005/0051109 by Fantin et al relates to devices and methods for animal tracking based upon the collection of blood samples while attaching ear tags to animals. The ear tags have detachable sample collecting portions which have adsorbent material for collected blood from the site where the tag attachment pin is inserted or from a nearby site on the ear which is separately pierced to cause blood flow. Such a method is not suited for use on animals that already have &#x2018;standard&#x2019; identification ear tags from which data has already been entered into management and tracking systems but where DNA samples have not so far been collected. There is also the problem of protecting the collected sample from contamination with other samples or with other blood associated with animal handling.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">US patent application 2005/0273117 A1 by Teychene discloses the use of a detachable label with an animal ear tag, which label has a blood adsorbent material located around the area of the securing pin of the ear tag so that blood exuded after attachment of the ear tag will be adsorbed on the material and then detached from the tag with the label as a sample. This method has the disadvantages of the Fantin system mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">U.S. Pat. No. 6,509,187 to Brem discloses an ear sampler in which a portion of tissue is punched out by a male punch into a female die where it is encased. Again, the punch and die, though separately removable, are part of an ear tag and the disadvantage noted above is present. While the sample thus obtained is securely encased against subsequent contamination, it is moist and non-sterile and will be subjected to bacterial degradation during transit from farm to laboratory.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">From one aspect, the invention includes a device for collecting a blood sample from an animal on sampling media placed next to the skin, the device comprising holding means for holding the sampling media for placement on the skin of an animal and spike means operable to pass through and to penetrate into the skin of the animal to create a puncture site and to then be withdrawn from the site and back through the sampling media to (i) allow blood emerging from the site to be collected by the sampling media during and/or after penetration of the skin and (ii) allow the sampling media with the blood to be removed from the device.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In another form the invention includes a device for collecting a blood sample from an animal on sampling media placed next to the animal's flesh, the device comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0010">holding means for holding the sampling media for placement on the flesh of an animal;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0011">spike means operable to first pass through the sampling media and to then penetrate into the flesh of the animal to create a puncture site to allow blood emerging from the site to be collected by the sampling media during and/or after penetration of the flesh, and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0012">retaining means for temporarily retaining the device on the animal whilst blood is collected on the sampling media and for allowing the device to be removed from the animal substantially intact for subsequent removal of the sampling media with the blood from the device.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0013">Preferably, the device includes guard means for guarding the spike means from contact with the fingers (or other parts) of a user before, during and/or after penetration of the animal skin.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0014">The spike means may include one or more needle-like or lancet-type spikes of any desired cross-section that are adapted for insertion substantially perpendicular to the skin. Spikes with cruciform or star-like cross-section are suitable, as are conical spikes that are of hollow or concave form. Alternatively, the spike means may include one or more knife or scalpel-like blades adapted to form elongate cuts in the skin. The spike means may comprise an array of spikes or blades formed by plastic injection molding, by the insert molding of metal elements into a plastic platen, by metal die-casting or by stamping, folding, or upsetting of sheet metal by techniques known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0015">The sampling media may be any suitable natural or synthetic material or combination of materials known in the art for collecting fluid, blood, cells, proteins or related materials. As such the sampling media may be fibrous, foamed, film-like or of another construction. The sampling media may have hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties (or both), but we have found thin sheet fibrous sheet material, such as paper, to be convenient. The sampling media may be absorbent, adsorbent or both absorbent and adsorbent. The media may be a single layer of material or may be multi-layered. Where the sampling media is multi-layered, each layer may be formed of different materials and/or materials having different properties. However, the specific construction of the sampling media is not critical to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0016">It is desirable to pre-puncture or pre-slot the material of the sampling media to minimize tearing or ripping as the spike means passes there-through. The holding means can take a variety of forms. It may include a carrier, frame, card or other support having a window of sampling media. This is suitable where the sampling media is thin, fragile or delicate, as the carrier or the like can then be used to position the sampling media during use of the device, to remove the sample from the device and to assist packaging and transportation of the sample. The carrier may also include identifying information such as a barcode, an RFID device, and an area for handwriting.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0017">The device may have a body within or on which the spike means is located and the holding means can serve to removably attach the sampling media to the body so that it is juxtaposed with the spike means to allow appropriate insertion and withdrawal of the spike means there-through. Where the sampling media material is sheet material, the holding means may comprise slots, brackets or the like formed within the body and adapted to hold the sheet material in position. Alternatively, the holding means can be an adhesive by which the material is held in place relative to the body. Indeed, such slots or adhesive can also be employed to position a carrier or the like relative to the body, where the carrier is used to mount or hold the sampling media as previously indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0018">The body of the device can have a face against or near which the material is held and through which face the spike means can be extended and withdrawn enroute to and from the site via the sampling media. The face can be used to position the material closely adjacent the site to facilitate blood collection.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0019">Clamp and/or retaining means may be provided by which the face of the body can be pressed against the site with the material (and/or the holding means for the material) located between the face and the site, so that the sampling media is positioned closely adjacent the site to facilitate blood collection. The clamp means can be integrated with the device, form a detachable part of the device, or the device can be separate and independent of the clamp means. For example, the clamp means can be a clamping tool&#x2014;such as a pliers-like clamp&#x2014;and the device may be loaded into the tool and removed from it as a cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0020">The clamp means may be employed to press the spike means into the skin of the animal and to effect the withdrawal of the spike means. Alternatively, the clamp means may be used to position and hold the device in place while the spike means is activated independently. We have found it preferable for the device to include light-weight clamp means by which the device can be left attached to the ear of an animal without support to provide sufficient time for blood to be exuded from the site and collected by the sampling media. This will generally be between a few seconds and nearly a minute, depending upon the animal, the sampling site and the type of spike means used.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0021">When used for collecting blood from a flap of skin, such as an animal's ear, the device may include a pin or the like having a head that is driven through the ear and preferably into a retainer located on the opposite side of the ear. After the device has been attached to the animal's ear for sufficient time the retainer and pin are separated. The pin preferably has an arrow shaped head that is retained by a slot or aperture in the retainer. The pin may be released from the retainer by movement along the slot or aperture. Preferably the slot or aperture has a necked portion that inhibits movement of the pin along the slot or aperture. In another form the pin head may be detached from the shank of the pin, so releasing the device. This may be by rotating the pin head relative to the shank so as to break the pin or by cutting the pin head from the shank.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0022">An auto-retracting ear-tagging type gun/clamp or manual ear tagging type of pliers may be used to drive the pin through the ear into the retainer (located on the opposed jaw) and the spike means into the animal's ear. With auto-retracting ear-tagging guns the user merely squeezes a pair of handles together in a single action and this causes a plunger to extend and then retract. Use of an auto-retracting ear-tagging gun allows the user to attach the device of the invention to the ear and have the plunger released from the body of the device in a single action, in a similar manner to attachment of an ear tag. Because the pin is secured to the retainer the gun can then be easily removed from the retainer by a sliding action.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0023">If desired, the pin and spike means may be located in a housing that may be detached from the sampling media and the remainder of the device. This allows the pin and spike means may be disposed of separately.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0024">In an alternative embodiment the retainer may be omitted and the pin may be driven through the ear and the device retained on the ear by the head of the pin.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0025">The sampling media may be movable between an operative position in which it underlies the spike means and a storage position in which it is remote from the spike means. Preferably, housing is provided into which the sampling media is located when in the storage position. The housing may be detachable from the remainder of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0026">The guard means can take a variety of forms. In one form it may comprise the above-mentioned body of the device from which the spike means is extended and into which it is withdrawn so that, both before and after use of the spike means, the body serves to guard the spike means against contact by the user. In another form, the guard means may comprise a press-pad mounted in opposition to the spike means so that an ear, tail or skin fold of an animal can be clamped or positioned there-between and so that, after a sample has been taken and the site released, the spike means can be driven into or onto the press-pad, or the press-pad and the spike means can be locked together, to guard the spike means from contact. These options are of value where a clamp tool is used and the spike means is mounted on one jaw and the press-pad is mounted on the opposing jaw of the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0027">Thus, from another aspect, the invention comprises a method of collecting blood from sample site on an animal including the steps of holding blood collecting sampling media adjacent the site, driving spike means through the sampling media into the site and withdrawing the spike means from the site and back through the sampling media so that blood exuded from the sample site is collected by the sampling media while the spike means is in the site and/or after the spike means has been withdrawn from the site.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0028">The method may include the step of guarding the spike means against contact with the fingers of the user after withdrawal of the spike means from the site. This may be done by extending the spike means from within the body of a device and/or by withdrawing the spike means into the body. It may also or alternatively be done by pressing the spike means into, or attaching it to a press-pad or the like after withdrawing it from the site. The method may include supplying the press-pad and the spike means as a coupled unit (which thereby guards the spike means against contact before use) or coupling the spike means with the press-pad after use, thereby guarding the used spike means from user contact.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0029">The method preferably includes the step of removing the sampling media after the spike means has been withdrawn there-through, the removed material with the collected blood preferably being packaged or covered against contamination as it is removed from the device or there-after.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0030">The method may include the step of clamping the device to the animal and, in so doing, driving the spike means into the site. It may also include the step of releasing the device from the animal and, in so doing, withdrawing the spike means from the site. On the other hand, the method may include the step of attaching the device to the site, activating the spike means to penetrate and withdraw from the site and then leaving the device attached to the site for sufficient time to permit blood exuded from the site to be collected by adsorption onto and/or absorption into the sampling media. Indeed, aspects of these methods may be combined by using a clamp to hold the device to the site to effect penetration of the spike means, releasing the clamp to effect the withdrawal of the spike means from the site, removing the clamp and then leaving the device attached to the site for sufficient time to permit blood exuded from the site to be collected.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0031">From another aspect, the method may include the step of attaching a sampling device to a sample site, such as an ear, activating the (preferably automatic) penetration and withdrawal of spike means into and from the site through blood collecting sampling media placed on or adjacent to the site, leaving the device attached to the site for sufficient time to permit blood exuded from the site to be collected and then removing the device and the sampling media from the site.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0032">The method may include the step of driving or forcing the spike means into the site substantially orthogonally to the skin and removing the spike means in substantially the same manner. In addition or alternatively, a linear motion may be applied to the spike means so that the skin is cut linearly as well as orthogonally. The spike means may be driven into the site by spring means and/or withdrawn from the site by spring means. Alternatively, the spike means may be driven into the site and/or withdrawn by manual means such as a hand-operated clamp, lever or a draw-string.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0033">In one embodiment, the spike means can be mounted on or include a movable platen within the body of the device so the movement of the platen to effect withdrawal of the spike means causes reduced air pressure on the body side of the sampling media thereby assisting exudation of blood from the site onto the material. In one convenient form, annual rubber-like spring means may be located between the face of the body that is adjacent the material and the spike means may include spikes that can be extended through holes in the face by compressing the spring means. Withdrawal of the spikes thereby permits the rubber-like spring means to expand and, in so doing, to generate the reduced air pressure (exerted through the holes in the face of the body on the material).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0034">From another aspect, the invention may include the steps of mounting the spike means and blood collecting sampling media on one jaw of a clamp, mounting a press-pad on the other (and opposed) jaw of the clamp, bringing the jaws of the clamp together about the ear of an animal to cause the spike means to penetrate the ear and to allow exuded blood to be collected by the sampling media, releasing the clamp to withdraw the spike means and to release the ear, and removing the sampling media with the collected blood sample. Additional steps may also be employed, such as re-closing the clamp (without the ear in place) to couple the press pad with the spike means and to thereby protect the spike means against injurious contact with the user, and removing the coupled spike means and press-pad from the clamp as a unit. Indeed, prior to the use of the clamp, additional steps may be employed of mounting a coupled press-pad and spike means onto the jaws of the clamp and opening the jaws of the clamp to separate the press-pad and spike means ready for use.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0035">The method may include the step of leaving the sampling media with the blood sample within or on the device and forwarding the device or a portion thereof to a laboratory for separation and analysis. In one embodiment where the device includes attachment or clamp means whereby the device can be attached to an ear (or the like) while the sample is being collected and then released, the step of re-closing the attachment or clamp means to cover or enclose the sampling media within the device may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0036">From another aspect the method may comprise the step of creating a partial vacuum or a low-pressure on the device side of the sampling media so as to aid the exudation of blood from the site onto the sampling media.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0037">In one embodiment, the spike means may comprise a platen bearing at least one spike, lancet or knife that is located within a body and is moveable to expose the spike or the like from a face of the body for penetration into the animal. The sample collecting means, which may conveniently be a sheet of sampling media, can be attached to the face of the body so that the spike or the like passes there-through into the animal and so that blood emerging from the wound is collected by the sampling media. Spring means may be provided to effect or aid withdrawal of the spike or the like back into the body, after it has penetrated the animal.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0038">In another embodiment, the spike means may comprise at least one lancet or knife within the cartridge that is adapted to be drawn across the skin of the animal so that the wound consists of one or more linear cuts. In that case, the lancet or knife passes through the sample collecting means and is preferably returned to a guarded position within the cartridge, as in the case of the spikes or the like. The knife or lancet (as with the spikes) may be spring-driven or manually driven to effect insertion and/or withdrawal.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0039">In another broad form the invention also provides a device for sampling media, including:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0040">a hollow housing having a first opening therein;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0041">sampling media assembly slidably received within the housing through the first opening and movable between and operative position and a storage position,</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0042">wherein,
        <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0043">in the storage position a sampling area of the sampling media assembly is located within the housing, and</li>
            <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0044">in the operative position the sampling area is located outside of the housing.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0045">The sampling media assembly may comprise sampling media located on or attached to a carrier that is received within the housing. Alternatively the sampling media assembly may comprise sampling media without a carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0046">Preferably the sampling media assembly includes one or more handles or extensions that extend out of second opening(s) in the housing, whereby the sampling media assembly may be moved between the operative and storage positions. Preferably the handle or extension extends through a second opening opposite the first opening. However, the handle(s) may be located on one or both sides of the sampling media assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0047">Preferably the sampling area is located at one end of the sampling media assembly and the handle is located at an opposite end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0048">The device preferably includes locking means to lock the sampling media assembly in the storage position when the sampling media assembly is moved from the operative position to the storage position. Preferably the locking means comprises one or more barbs on the handle that pass through the second opening and engage the outer surface of the housing adjacent the second opening.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0049">The housing may be formed of cardboard or paper of other suitable sheet-like materials, such as plastics or foil materials. Alternatively the housing may be substantially rigid.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0050">The housing may be attached to a sampling device with which the sampling media is used.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0051">The housing may be formed integrally with at least part of a sampling device with which the sampling media is used. When formed integrally with the sampling device the housing may be defined at least partially by a line of weakness, whereby the housing may be removed from the device after use.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXAMPLES OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0087" num="0094">The first example of a device and method of the invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1E</figref> with a first variant described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1F-1M</figref> and a second variant described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1N-1R</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0095">In this example, the device <b>110</b> of the first example (see particularly <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>) is a replaceable sample-collecting cartridge <b>112</b> (shown in exploded form in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) that is loaded into a pliers-like clamp tool <b>114</b>, cartridge <b>112</b> comprising a platen <b>116</b> having an inner face <b>118</b> from which a plurality of needle-like or lancet-like spikes <b>120</b> project and an outer face <b>122</b> that has grooves <b>124</b> by which platen <b>116</b> (and therefore cartridge <b>112</b>) can be slid onto and detachably retained by the lower jaw <b>126</b> of clamp <b>114</b>, which is grooved longitudinally in a complementary fashion (not shown). Leaf-springs <b>128</b> are attached to the sides of platen <b>114</b> on inner face <b>118</b> thereof so as to support a sample carrier <b>130</b> above spikes <b>120</b>, carrier <b>130</b> preferably being attached to the tops of leaf-springs <b>128</b> so that platen <b>114</b>, spikes <b>120</b>, springs <b>128</b> and carrier <b>130</b> form an assembly that comprises cartridge <b>112</b>. [Note that cartridge <b>112</b> is shown exploded for clarity in FIG. <b>1</b>B.] In this example, sample carrier <b>130</b> includes a card <b>132</b> bearing a barcode <b>136</b> and written identification <b>138</b> and, preferably, providing space on which the user can write. Most importantly, card <b>130</b> includes a window area that is covered with sheet like sampling media <b>140</b> which is arranged opposite spikes <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0096">In this example, an independently replaceable press-pad <b>142</b> can be separately fitted to the upper jaw <b>144</b> of clamp <b>114</b> and is molded from plastic material that is sufficiently soft to allow the points of spikes <b>120</b> to penetrate without being bent over or distorted.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0097">The operation of device <b>110</b> of the first example and the method of sample collection will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref>. Cartridge <b>112</b> and press-pad <b>142</b> are separately loaded onto lower and upper jaws <b>126</b> and <b>144</b> (respectively) in the manner indicated above. The open clamp <b>114</b> is then placed around the animal's ear <b>146</b> [<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>] and forcibly closed thereon [<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>] to compress springs <b>128</b> and force spikes <b>120</b> through sampling media <b>140</b> and into the selected sample site on the ear <b>146</b>. Clamp <b>114</b> is held closed for a few seconds to allow blood from the site to ooze out into contact with sampling media <b>140</b>. After which, clamp <b>114</b> is released and opened to free ear <b>146</b>, allowing sample carrier <b>130</b> to be detached from springs <b>128</b> and slipped into a suitable individual package (not shown). Spike cartridge <b>112</b> (minus carrier <b>130</b>) is then removed from lower jaw <b>126</b> of clamp <b>114</b> and discarded into a sharps-bin.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0098">If spikes <b>120</b> are deemed too short to go right through the ears (<b>146</b>) of the type of animal from which blood is being sampled, press-pad <b>142</b> can be retained on upper jaw <b>144</b> of clamp <b>114</b>, unless it is clearly soiled, in which case it should be replaced. On the other hand, if spikes <b>120</b> are likely to go right through the ears of the animals involved, press-pad <b>142</b> should be replaced after each use. In either case, clamp <b>114</b> is readied for re-use by loading another cartridge-like device onto lower jaw <b>126</b> of clamp <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0099">It will be seen from the above description that the holding means, whereby the sampling media <b>140</b> is positioned and held against the sample site, is carrier <b>130</b> and leaf springs <b>128</b> by which it is attached to platen <b>116</b> that may be said to form the body of the device. Of course, the combination of these components (with the spikes <b>120</b>) together forms the cartridge-like device <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0100">A disadvantage of device <b>110</b> is that it is possible for the user's fingers to be pierced by contaminated spikes <b>120</b> when cartridge <b>112</b> is being removed and transferred for disposal. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1F-1V</figref> illustrate two variants of the device of the first example that eliminate this problem by fixing cartridge <b>112</b> to press pad <b>142</b> before the cartridge is removed. For this purpose it will be convenient to use a parallel-jaw pliers-like clamp. The first variant will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1L and 1M</figref> and the second will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1N to 1V</figref>. The same reference numerals will be used for parts corresponding with those described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref> except that the suffix &#x2018;a&#x2019; will be added for the first variant and the suffix &#x2018;b&#x2019; will be added for the second variant.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0101">The parallel-jaw pliers-like clamp use for the variants is indicated at <b>114</b><i>a</i>. In the first variant, sample collecting cartridge <b>112</b><i>a </i>and press-pad <b>142</b><i>a </i>are separately loaded onto the lower and upper jaws <b>126</b><i>a </i>and <b>144</b><i>a </i>(respectively) of clamp <b>114</b><i>a</i>. In the second variant, sample collecting cartridge <b>112</b><i>b </i>and press-pad <b>144</b><i>b </i>are supplied as a single integrated cartridge <b>112</b><i>c </i>that is fitted to and removed from clamp <b>114</b><i>a </i>as a unitary assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0102">The general mode of operation of device <b>110</b><i>a </i>that forms the first variant of the first example is indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1F-1K</figref>, which are substantially self-explanatory:

    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0108">Optionally, carrier <b>132</b><i>a </i>can be left in place between cartridge <b>112</b><i>a </i>and press pad <b>142</b><i>a </i>and the entire cartridge/press pad unit sent to the analytical laboratory where the unit is separated and carrier <b>132</b><i>a </i>is extracted.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0109">As shown in the detailed cross-sections of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1L and 1M</figref>, the cartridge <b>112</b><i>a </i>of device <b>110</b><i>a </i>has spikes <b>120</b><i>a </i>on platen <b>116</b> formed from a material (plastic or metal) that allows their tips <b>121</b> to be permanently bent over when pressed against a hard object. No other modification of spike cartridge <b>112</b> is needed. However, a modified press-pad <b>142</b><i>a </i>is employed, which differs from pad <b>142</b> in that it is has a relatively thin and penetrable soft face <b>150</b> backed by a relatively hard body <b>152</b>. If desired, the inner face <b>154</b> of body <b>152</b> can be provided with indentations or dished recesses <b>156</b> opposite spikes <b>120</b><i>a </i>shaped so as to assist in turning their tips <b>121</b> upon forcible contact. A further option is to mould a thin layer of fabric <b>158</b> between face <b>154</b> of body <b>152</b> and face pad <b>150</b> so that, while penetration of tips <b>121</b> is not significantly inhibited, their withdrawal after being turned or bent will be difficult. The manner of operation is shown in the section drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1M</figref> that depicts spikes <b>120</b><i>a </i>in forcible contact with body <b>152</b> of modified press-pad <b>142</b> with their tips <b>121</b> turned so as to inhibit separation of platen <b>118</b><i>a </i>from modified press pad <b>142</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0110">It will be appreciated that press-pad <b>142</b><i>a </i>of the above described variant of the first example can be regarded as the aforementioned guard means.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0111">In the second variant of the first example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1N-1V</figref>, device <b>110</b><i>b </i>is an integrated cartridge <b>112</b><i>c </i>which incorporates sample collecting cartridge <b>112</b><i>b </i>and press-pad cartridge <b>142</b><i>b</i>, integrated cartridge <b>112</b><i>c </i>being loaded into and removed from lower and upper jaws (<b>126</b><i>b </i>and <b>144</b><i>b</i>) as a unit. Press pad <b>142</b><i>b </i>is attached to sample collecting cartridge <b>112</b><i>b </i>by hooks <b>164</b> that depend from a rotatable sleeve <b>166</b> which has helical slots <b>168</b> that engage pins (not shown) protruding laterally from press pad <b>142</b><i>b</i>. [See detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1U and 1V</figref>] Thus rotation of sleeve <b>166</b> in one direction will raise it (and its dependent hooks <b>164</b>) relative to press pad <b>142</b><i>b </i>and lower it when rotated in the opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0112">As supplied, integrated cartridge <b>112</b><i>c </i>is formed by engagement of hooks <b>164</b> with shoulders <b>170</b> (see detail of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1V</figref>) formed on platen <b>116</b><i>b </i>of sample collecting cartridge <b>112</b><i>b</i>, and it is loaded into clamp <b>114</b><i>b </i>with the jaws at or near their closed position. (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1N</figref>). After loading, clamp <b>114</b><i>b </i>is opened forcing the release of hooks <b>164</b> (which have lateral flexibility) from shoulders <b>170</b>, the resulting position then being shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1O</figref>. Sleeve <b>166</b> is then rotated in the direction shown by arrow <b>172</b> to raise it and hooks <b>164</b> enough to expose press-pad <b>142</b><i>b </i>so that an ear <b>146</b><i>b </i>can be located between press-pad <b>142</b><i>b </i>and sample collecting cartridge <b>112</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> P); whereupon, clamp <b>114</b><i>b </i>is forcibly closed to drive spikes <b>120</b><i>b </i>through sample carrier <b>130</b><i>b </i>and into the ear <b>146</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1Q</figref>). After sufficient time for blood collection, clamp <b>114</b><i>b </i>is re-opened to release the ear and to allow removal of carrier <b>130</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1R</figref>) and sleeve <b>166</b> is counter-rotated in direction of arrow <b>174</b> to lower it and its hooks <b>164</b> and to bring hooks <b>164</b> into line again with shoulders <b>170</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1S</figref>). The clamp is then re-closed to re-engage hooks <b>164</b> with their respective shoulders <b>170</b> in platen <b>116</b><i>b </i>to allow re-formed integrated cartridge <b>112</b><i>c </i>to be removed as a unit (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1T</figref>). In this way, the possibility of contact between the fingers of the user and spikes <b>120</b><i>b </i>is minimized at all times.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0113"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1U and 1V</figref> are enlarged details of device <b>110</b><i>b </i>fitted to lower and upper jaws <b>126</b><i>b </i>and <b>144</b><i>b </i>of clamp <b>114</b><i>b</i>, sample collecting cartridge <b>112</b><i>b </i>being shown in exploded form to show detail of the modified spikes <b>120</b><i>b </i>employed in this variant of Example 1. In this case, spikes <b>120</b><i>b </i>are struck from thin sheet metal to form a single crown-like ring of spikes. The sheet metal base (not shown) can be insert-molded into platen <b>116</b><i>b</i>, adhered to the platen or otherwise secured in any convenient manner known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0102" num="0114">The second example of a device and method of the invention will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2G</figref>. In this example, the device <b>210</b> (see particularly <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>) is a spring-loaded sample-collecting cartridge <b>212</b> adapted to be used with a pliers-like clamp <b>214</b> in a similar way to cartridge <b>112</b> of the first example. In this case, cartridge <b>212</b> has an upper hollow box-like body <b>213</b> that surrounds platen <b>216</b> with its spikes <b>220</b>, the top face <b>215</b> of body <b>213</b> having holes <b>217</b> through which spikes <b>220</b> can be extended. Conveniently, as shown, platen <b>216</b> is a snap-fit within the open bottom of body <b>213</b> and is able to slide upwards within body <b>213</b> against spring means, which in this case, is a sponge rubber or plastic ring <b>228</b>. In this example, sample carrier <b>230</b> is also a card <b>232</b> with a barcode <b>236</b> and a window area that is covered with sampling media <b>240</b> that is arranged to lie on body top <b>215</b> opposite spikes <b>220</b>. Carrier <b>230</b> is stuck to one side of body <b>213</b> in a detachable manner, the detached carrier being shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0115">Thus, in this example, the aforementioned guard means is formed by the body <b>213</b> and the aforementioned holding means is formed by the adhesive or other means by which carrier <b>230</b> is attached to and located with respect to body <b>213</b></p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0116">As in the first example (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1E</figref>), a removable press-pad <b>242</b> can be fitted to and removed from the upper jaw <b>244</b> of clamp <b>214</b> in separate actions from the fitting and removal of cartridge <b>210</b> to jaw <b>226</b>. It is not necessary to remove press-pad <b>242</b> and cartridge <b>210</b> as a unit as suggested in the variants of the first example described above because body <b>213</b> serves as the guard means, spikes <b>220</b> being withdrawn into body <b>213</b> of device <b>210</b> after use and before removal. There is the additional benefit that the spikes <b>220</b> are also contained within body <b>213</b> when the device <b>210</b> is supplied so that the danger of contact with them before use is also minimized,</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0117">The operation of device <b>210</b> of the second example and the method of sample collection is similar to that of the first example, but will be briefly described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C-2F</figref>. Cartridge <b>212</b> and press-pad <b>242</b> are separately loaded onto lower and upper jaws <b>226</b> and <b>244</b> (respectively) in the manner indicated above. The open clamp <b>214</b> is then placed around the animal's ear <b>246</b> [<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>] and forcibly closed thereon [<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>] to drive platen <b>216</b> upwards in body <b>215</b>, compressing spring means <b>228</b> and forcing spikes <b>220</b> through holes <b>217</b> in body top face <b>215</b>, through sampling media <b>240</b> and into&#x2014;or through&#x2014;ear <b>246</b>. Clamp <b>214</b> is held closed for a few seconds to allow blood from the puncture wounds to ooze out into contact with sampling media <b>240</b>. After which, clamp <b>214</b> is released and opened to free ear <b>246</b>, allowing sample carrier <b>230</b> to be removed and stored and upper pressure pad <b>242</b> to be replaced as before.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0118">In this second example, however, rubber like spring means <b>228</b> acts as a vacuum pump as clamp <b>214</b> is opened that serves to draw blood from the ear wounds as platen <b>216</b> returns to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. It is important to note that, in this position, the points of spikes <b>220</b> are beneath top face <b>215</b> of body <b>213</b> and, thus, guarded against contact with the user. [As noted above, body <b>213</b> and spring means <b>228</b> form the aforementioned guard means.]</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0107" num="0119">The device <b>310</b> of third example is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A-3G</figref> and differs from the first two in the design of the cartridge <b>312</b>. Since this cartridge is used in much the same manner as that of the second example, the clamp and method of use will not be described again. As in the second example, cartridge <b>312</b> has a body <b>313</b> with an upper face <b>315</b> having holes <b>317</b> aligned with spikes <b>320</b> that are mounted on a platen <b>316</b> which is spring-loaded downward away from upper face <b>315</b> by a helical steel spring <b>328</b>. In this case, platen <b>316</b> is again snap-fitted within body <b>313</b> which has axial grooves <b>323</b> in its sides. A carrier card <b>332</b> is again adhered to top face <b>315</b> with a window of sampling media <b>340</b> located over spikes <b>320</b> so that the spikes will pass through sampling media <b>340</b> en-route into the ear and blood will be collected on sheet <b>340</b> from the resulting wounds. [<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref> shows how spikes <b>320</b> would appear when pressed up through material <b>340</b>, the ear <b>346</b> of the animal and clamp <b>314</b> not being shown in this view.]</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0120">As in the second example, opening of the clamp <b>314</b> after a sample is taken allows platen <b>316</b> and its spikes <b>320</b> to retract under the force of spring <b>328</b> to guard the tips of the spikes from contact with other bodies. Thus, cartridge <b>312</b> can be safely removed from lower jaw <b>326</b> of clamp <b>314</b>. As in Example 1 (and 2), a replaceable upper press-pad <b>342</b> can also be removed or left in place depending on whether spikes <b>320</b> are designed to fully penetrate the animal ear <b>346</b> or not.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0121">It will be appreciated that, in this example, the combination of body <b>313</b> with the platen and spring <b>328</b> serve as the aforementioned guard means and that carrier card <b>332</b> forms the aforementioned holding means by which the sampling media is held against the sample site and also located relative to the spike means (formed by spikes <b>320</b>).</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 4</heading>
<p id="p-0110" num="0122">Device <b>410</b> of the fourth example will be described in a little more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4F</figref> because it works a little differently from the preceding examples. The sample collecting cartridge <b>412</b> of this example is similar to cartridge <b>312</b> of the third example except that it has been inverted and the body <b>413</b> is molded integrally with an elongate upper arm <b>423</b> of a spring clip <b>425</b> so that platen <b>416</b> is driven downward by the upper jaw <b>444</b> of clamp <b>414</b> to move spikes <b>420</b> downward against a steel spring <b>428</b> through holes <b>417</b> in arm <b>423</b>. Spring means <b>428</b> located within body <b>413</b> biases platen <b>416</b> upwards. A sample carrier <b>430</b> comprising a card <b>432</b> having a window of sheet like sampling media <b>440</b> is slidably mounted by brackets <b>441</b> (molded integrally with clip arm <b>423</b>) immediately below holes <b>417</b> and body <b>413</b> of cartridge <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0123">Spring clip <b>425</b> has an elongate lower arm <b>427</b> that is opposed to upper arm <b>423</b> and integrally joined to upper arm by a stiff back portion <b>447</b>. A retrieval cord <b>428</b> is attached to back portion <b>447</b> of clip <b>425</b> for reasons that are explained below. As will also be best seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref>, upper jaw <b>444</b> of clamp <b>414</b> has a cylindrical projection <b>429</b> on its bottom face that is adapted to engage with and within cup-like platen <b>417</b> so as to locate clip/cartridge assembly <b>425</b>/<b>412</b> relative to clamp <b>414</b>. Upper face of lower jaw <b>426</b> of clamp <b>414</b> carries a resilient press pad <b>442</b> opposite to projection <b>429</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0124">In operation, clip/cartridge assembly <b>425</b>/<b>412</b> is placed within open jaws <b>444</b> and <b>426</b> of clamp <b>414</b> so that projection <b>429</b> is located within platen <b>416</b>, the fit preferably being such that clip/cartridge assembly <b>424</b>/<b>412</b> is retained by friction against gravity in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref>. Sample carrier <b>430</b> is then slid into brackets <b>441</b> on bottom of clip upper arm <b>423</b>. Clamp <b>414</b> is then held on one hand while the ear if of the animal (not shown) is held by the other and brought into clip <b>425</b> between arms <b>423</b> and <b>427</b> so that portion of the ear is below sample collecting means <b>430</b>. In bringing the ear into this position, arms <b>423</b> and <b>427</b> will have to be forcibly moved apart so that the ear is gripped firmly but not painfully by spring clip <b>425</b>. Clamp <b>414</b> is then forcibly closed onto the ear, driving spikes <b>420</b> in cartridge <b>412</b> through holes <b>417</b> and sampling media <b>440</b> into the sample site on the ear.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0125">Immediately thereafter, clamp <b>414</b> is released while the user also holds clip <b>425</b> closed onto the ear, thus permitting the spikes <b>420</b> to be withdrawn from the ear under the combined effect of spring <b>428</b> and the frictional engagement of projection <b>429</b> with platen <b>416</b>. This combined action then effects the disengagement of projection <b>429</b> from platen <b>416</b> and allows the clamp to be removed clear of the ear while clip <b>525</b> is left in place for a few seconds to permit blood to flow into sampling media <b>440</b>. Meanwhile, the operator lets go of the ear and clip <b>425</b> while retaining hold on retrieval cord <b>428</b> and, when sufficient time is judged to have elapsed for blood flow, cord <b>428</b> is pulled to remove clip <b>425</b> from the ear and allow (i) retrieval and hygienic packing of sample carrier <b>430</b> and (ii) safe disposal of clip/cartridge assembly <b>425</b>/<b>412</b>. It will again be noted that automatic withdrawal of spikes <b>420</b> back into body <b>413</b> ensures that the operator cannot come into contact with the spikes.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0126">It will be again seen that body <b>413</b> (in cooperation with platen <b>416</b> and spring <b>428</b>) forms the aforementioned guard means, that the holding means is formed by the combination of carrier card <b>432</b> and locating brackets <b>441</b>, and, that the aforementioned attachment means (whereby the sampling media can be held in contact with the site after withdrawal of the spikes) is formed by clip <b>425</b>.) It is also worth noting that the entire clip and body assembly can be regarded as the device in this case.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 5</heading>
<p id="p-0115" num="0127">The device <b>510</b> of the fifth example, like that of the fourth example, is one where the sample collecting cartridge <b>512</b> is integrated with a spring clip <b>525</b> but, in this case, the arrangement is such that no clamp is required to press the spikes <b>520</b> into the ear of the animal (not shown). A further distinction is that spikes <b>520</b> are longer than those of Example 4, being intended to pass right through the ear and to form puncture wounds on both sides. Accordingly, the sample collector or carrier <b>530</b> is bifurcated having upper and lower card-like arms <b>532</b><i>a </i>and <b>532</b><i>b </i>joined by a common back portion <b>532</b><i>c</i>, each arm <b>532</b><i>a</i>, <b>532</b><i>b </i>having a window of sheet sampling media <b>540</b>. Upper carrier arm <b>532</b><i>a </i>engages with longitudinal brackets <b>541</b><i>a </i>on underside of upper clip arm <b>523</b> while lower carrier arm <b>532</b><i>b </i>engages with similar brackets <b>541</b><i>b </i>on upper side of lower clip arm <b>527</b>. This ensures that carrier arms <b>532</b><i>a </i>and <b>532</b><i>b </i>are held in place while spring clip <b>525</b> is forced over the animal's ear. Spring clip <b>525</b> has a rear portion <b>547</b> that has an aperture <b>547</b><i>a </i>from which carrier <b>530</b> can be withdrawn, the back portion <b>532</b><i>c </i>of carrier <b>530</b> extending through aperture <b>547</b><i>c </i>to allow it to be gripped for withdrawal.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0128">Preferably, carrier <b>530</b> and combined clip-cartridge assembly <b>525</b>-<b>512</b> are supplied pre-assembled as a single unit. Furthermore, carrier <b>530</b> is supplied with upper and lower rolls <b>550</b><i>a </i>and <b>550</b><i>b </i>self-adhesive sheath strip material <b>551</b><i>a </i>and <b>551</b><i>b </i>for carrier <b>530</b>, the lead portion of sheaths <b>551</b><i>a </i>and <b>551</b><i>b </i>being attached to respective sides of back portion <b>532</b><i>c </i>of carrier <b>530</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows sheaths <b>551</b><i>a </i>and <b>551</b><i>b </i>applied to either side of carrier <b>530</b> as it is being withdrawn from clip <b>525</b> after use. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5G</figref> shows the carrier after removal and pressed together so that sampling media <b>540</b> is completely enclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0129">Again, cartridge <b>512</b> is integral with clip <b>525</b> with at a least portion of body <b>513</b> being molded integrally with upper clip arm <b>523</b> or snapped thereto, which is again perforated with holes <b>517</b> that take spikes <b>420</b> that are mounted on a movable platen <b>516</b>. In this case, however, the inward or penetrating movement of platen <b>516</b> is effected by a driver spring <b>552</b> that is released from its normally compressed condition by manually operable triggers <b>554</b>. When platen <b>516</b> reaches the full extent of its downward travel (ie, when the tips of spikes <b>520</b> have passed right through the ear), the pre-compressed withdrawal spring <b>528</b> is released automatically by contact of platen <b>516</b> with a return trigger <b>556</b>. It should be noted that lower arm <b>527</b> of clip <b>525</b> has a hole (not visible in the drawings) opposite cartridge <b>512</b> so that spikes <b>220</b> do not strike lower arm <b>527</b> as they extend from the ear and pass through lower sampling media <b>540</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0130">In use, device <b>510</b> of the fifth example is held in one hand and pushed onto the ear (not shown) while holding the ear in the other hand. The thumb or a finger of the hand holding the device is then used to operate driving spring trigger <b>554</b> to (i) drive platen <b>516</b> downward in body <b>513</b> and to cause spikes <b>520</b> to penetrate the ear and through both sheets of sampling media <b>540</b>, and then (ii) automatically release return spring <b>528</b> to return platen <b>516</b> and withdraw spikes <b>520</b>. Device <b>510</b> is left on the ear for sufficient time to allow blood to emerge from the wounds and to be adsorbed by sampling media <b>540</b> (on both upper and lower arms <b>532</b><i>a </i>and <b>532</b><i>b</i>) on carrier <b>530</b>. The rear portion <b>547</b> is then held in one hand while the back portion <b>532</b><i>c </i>carrier <b>530</b> is grasped and withdrawn, the upper and lower arms <b>532</b><i>a </i>and <b>532</b><i>b </i>are then immediately pressed together to compete the sheathing action and to generate the sealed sample of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5G</figref>. After which, the remainder of the device can be retrieved from the ear and disposed of (again without danger of injury to the user from spikes <b>520</b>). Alternatively, the entire device <b>510</b> may be removed as a unit by the use of a retrieval cord (not shown) in the manner described in the fourth example, and then, the sample carrier <b>530</b> can be removed and sheathed while off the animal.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0131">Alternative carriers and protection means are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5F-5I</figref>. A first alternative (unsheathed) bifurcated carrier <b>531</b><i>a </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref> from which it will be seen that it differs from carrier <b>530</b> only in that the common back portion <b>532</b><i>c </i>is perforated with holes <b>558</b> and has rectangular recesses <b>560</b>. Holes <b>558</b> are arranged to interlock with protrusions <b>562</b> in a hinged box-like cover <b>564</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5G</figref>) that can be snapped closed over carrier <b>531</b> (when compressed or flattened), as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5H</figref>. Recesses <b>560</b> are designed to accommodate identification information such as a barcode, RFID device and/or hand writing. A second alternative carrier <b>531</b><i>b </i>is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 51</figref>, differing from carrier <b>531</b><i>b </i>only in that it is not bifurcated. This type of carrier can be fitted under the bottom face of the upper arm <b>523</b> of clip <b>525</b> and/or on the top face of lower clip arm <b>527</b>. It can also be accommodated in cover box <b>564</b> in the manner described above.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0132">Again, the guard means of Example 5 is formed by the operation of body <b>513</b>, withdrawal spring <b>528</b> and face <b>517</b>, while the holding means is formed by carrier <b>530</b> and guide brackets <b>541</b><i>a </i>and <b>541</b><i>b</i>, and clip <b>525</b> serves as both the attachment means and the clamp means. The combination of the clip and body can also serve as the device in this case.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example 6</heading>
<p id="p-0121" num="0133">As will be seen from the staged drawings of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6F</figref>, the device <b>610</b> of the sixth example is similar in operation to that of the fifth example in that it is an integrated cartridge (<b>612</b>) and clip or clamp (<b>625</b>) that is pushed onto the ear <b>646</b> of the animal, spring-loaded spikes are driven into the ear and then quickly and automatically retracted, the device remains in place on the ear while blood is collected on sampling media, the device is removed and the sample recovered. If a thin portion of the ear is selected, the spikes may be driven right through the ear or, if a thick portion is selected, the spikes need only partially penetrate the ear. However, the manner in which the device is attached to the ear and the manner in which the sample is retrieved differ from the preceding example.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0134">Referring more specifically to the drawings, the device comprises a hinged tong-like clip <b>625</b> having an upper arm <b>623</b> and a lower arm <b>627</b>. Cartridge <b>612</b> is a separate spring-loaded unit like that [<b>512</b>] of the fifth example that is preferably supplied attached to upper arm <b>623</b> by means of a slider <b>666</b>. As best seen from the sectional drawings of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6G</figref>, the bottom of cartridge body <b>613</b> has an annular flange <b>667</b> so that the cartridge can be entered upwards through a hole <b>668</b> in upper arm <b>623</b> which has a locating recess <b>669</b> for flange <b>667</b>, the cartridge being retained in this position by slider <b>666</b>. The sampling media <b>640</b> for collecting the blood is in the form of a disk that is fitted into flange <b>667</b> so that will be penetrated by the spikes (not shown). A hole <b>670</b> is also formed in lower arm <b>627</b> opposite hole <b>668</b> in upper arm <b>623</b> to accommodate spikes protruding through the ear, it being convenient to make hole <b>670</b> large enough to allow cartridge flange <b>667</b> to pass so that cartridge <b>612</b> can be loaded and unloaded into upper arm <b>623</b> without having to open clip <b>625</b>. Finally, a sliding lock-ring <b>672</b> is fitted over clip <b>625</b> so that the arms of the clip can be forcibly closed (and held closed) by sliding the clip forwards (toward the open end of the clip).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0135">Thus, in use, assembled device <b>610</b> is slipped over the ear <b>646</b> with lock ring <b>672</b> in the rear position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) and lock-ring <b>672</b> is forced forwards along clip <b>625</b> so as to clamp ear <b>646</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>), whereupon, trigger <b>654</b> is activated to cause the spikes of cartridge <b>612</b> to be rapidly extended into and then withdrawn from ear <b>646</b>. After sufficient time to permit blood flow, lock-ring <b>672</b> is withdrawn to release the pressure on the ear (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>) and the ear is released (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>). Slider <b>666</b> is then moved to the rear and cartridge <b>612</b> released (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E and 6H</figref>). The clip <b>625</b> can then be re-closed for storage and re-use with a new cartridge if desired (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6F</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0136">Since clip <b>625</b> again serves as the attachment means by which the adsorbent material can be held onto the site after withdrawal of the spikes, it may be desirable to avoid the need for the clip to be held in place on the ear by hand while blood exuding from the site is collected by the sampling media. In that case, a retrieving strap or string (like strap <b>428</b> of Example 4) may be employed but, in this case, it will be desirable to attach it to clamp ring <b>672</b> so that pulling on the strap will move the ring to its release position and allow the clip to open, thereby avoiding the need to drag the sampling media across the surface of the ear.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Example 7</heading>
<p id="p-0125" num="0137">The device <b>710</b> of this example differs considerably from those of the previous examples in that it is a compact assembly which clamps on the ear and in that the ear is cut rather than spiked. This device will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7H</figref> and a variant will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 71 to 7M</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7E</figref> are longitudinal sections of the device, while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7G</figref> is a transverse section (the sections not being hatched).</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0138">Device <b>710</b> has a hollow molded plastic body <b>712</b> with a concave bottom face <b>714</b> and a clamp arm <b>716</b> is attached to one end <b>718</b> of body <b>712</b> by an integral hinge <b>720</b>. A wire clip <b>722</b> is hinged to end <b>718</b> and shaped so that, when forced over a shoulder <b>724</b> on the outside of arm <b>716</b>, an animal ear (not shown) can be firmly clamped between arm <b>716</b> and bottom face <b>714</b> of body <b>712</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A and 7D</figref> show arm <b>716</b> and clip <b>722</b> in the &#x2018;open&#x2019; or non-clamping position, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B and 7C</figref> show arm <b>716</b> in the clamping position where the ear (not shown) is in place and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref> shows the position of the arm in the closed or clamping position without the ear in place.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0139">Bottom face <b>714</b> of body <b>712</b> is has a number of parallel longitudinal slots <b>730</b> with a corresponding number of short blades <b>732</b> slidably mounted therein, blades <b>732</b> being joined together (in a manner not shown) so that they will slide as a unit, and, being biased to travel away from body end <b>718</b> by a compression spring <b>734</b>. As supplied, blades <b>732</b> are held against such movement by a manually operable catch lever <b>736</b>. Affixed to bottom face <b>714</b> of body <b>712</b> is a sheet of adsorbent material <b>738</b>, which is preferably has narrow pre-formed slots <b>740</b> therein (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7F</figref>) that accommodate respective ones of blades <b>732</b> when sheet material <b>738</b> is in position. Pre-slotting ensures that blades will not catch or tear the material as they move. As indicated, material <b>738</b> is pre-attached to bottom face <b>714</b> of device <b>710</b> as it is supplied for use</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0140">Device <b>710</b> may be used in the following manner. With clamp arm <b>716</b> in the open position as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, body <b>712</b> is placed on the animal's ear with an edge of the ear close to hinge <b>720</b> and with arm <b>716</b> hanging down and below the ear. The arm is then closed on the ear to hold it firmly and clip <b>722</b> snapped into place as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. Catch lever <b>736</b> is then operated to release blades <b>732</b> which cut through the upper portion of the ear near the center of the curved bottom face <b>714</b> by virtue of the curvature and then move to a shielded position to the end of body <b>712</b> opposite end <b>718</b>. Device <b>710</b> is left in place until blood exuding from the resulting wounds is collected by sampling media <b>738</b>. After which, clip <b>722</b> is released and arm <b>716</b> opened to allow removal of the device from the ear. It should be noted that curving the ear so that the convex side is the cut side tends to open the wounds and to encourage blood flow from the wounds. Material <b>738</b> may then be removed, the resultant blood samples being shown at <b>740</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7H</figref>. If desired, an individual sample <b>740</b><i>a </i>can be readily separated from the remainder of the material <b>738</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0141">The variant of device <b>710</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7I to 7N</figref>, with corresponding parts given the same reference numbers but with the suffix &#x2018;a&#x2019; added. As will be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7I-7M</figref> device <b>710</b><i>a </i>is very similar to device <b>710</b> in longitudinal cross-section, the principal differences being the use of a draw-string <b>750</b> to drive a single blade <b>732</b><i>a </i>from right to left and the use of filtered vents <b>752</b> and <b>754</b> on the top of molded plastic body <b>712</b><i>a </i>and on the bottom of clamp arm <b>716</b><i>a</i>. Since only a single blade is employed, body <b>712</b><i>a </i>can be much narrower and the entire device can be much lighter than that of Example 7. This makes it less annoying to the animal when attached to an ear so that it is more easily retained on the ear during the time needed to allow blood collection. A further difference in this example is that sampling media <b>738</b><i>a </i>is supported by a carrier <b>756</b> which is slidingly fitted into grooves in body <b>712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0142">Blade <b>732</b><i>a </i>is mounted on a slider <b>752</b> that is guided for movement along slots or grooves <b>760</b> within body <b>712</b><i>a</i>. When blade <b>732</b><i>a </i>had been pulled fully to end <b>718</b><i>a </i>of body <b>712</b><i>a </i>(to effect the cut in the ear at the sample site), it is locked in that position by a barb-like catch <b>762</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0143">The operation of device <b>710</b><i>a </i>is essentially the same as that of device <b>710</b>, but is indicated as follows: With clamp arm <b>716</b><i>a </i>in the open position [<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7I</figref>], body <b>712</b><i>a </i>is placed on the animal's ear with an edge of the ear close to hinge <b>720</b><i>a </i>and with arm <b>716</b><i>a </i>hanging down and below the ear. The arm is then closed on the ear to hold it firmly and clip <b>722</b><i>a </i>snapped into place [<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7J</figref>]. Draw-string <b>750</b> is then operated to pull blade <b>732</b><i>a </i>to end <b>718</b><i>a </i>of body <b>712</b><i>a </i>where it is retained by catch <b>762</b> [<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7K</figref>]. Device <b>710</b><i>a </i>is left in place until blood exuding from the resulting cut is collected by sampling media <b>738</b><i>a</i>. After which, clip <b>722</b><i>a </i>is released and arm <b>716</b><i>a </i>opened to allow removal of the device from the ear [<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7L</figref>].</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0144">In the case of this variant, however, arm <b>716</b><i>a </i>is re-closed to encase carrier <b>756</b> and sampling media <b>738</b><i>a </i>for transport to the laboratory. With this in mind, a number of desirable modifications can be made to device <b>710</b><i>a</i>. First, integral hinge <b>720</b><i>a </i>can be replaced by a spring hinge that allows the left end of arm <b>716</b><i>a </i>to separate from the rest of body <b>712</b><i>a </i>in order to accommodate the ear but to spring back to securely enclose carrier <b>756</b> and material <b>738</b><i>a</i>. For that purpose, a separate clip can be used on the right hand end of arm <b>716</b><i>a </i>to secure that end to body <b>712</b><i>a </i>after the sample has been collected. The seal around the periphery of carrier <b>756</b> can be enhanced by forming the frame of carrier <b>756</b> from resiliently deformable material and by the use of a thin rubber-like boot <b>760</b> (shown only in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7N</figref> in broken lines]. It is then desirable to ensure that the fresh sample is vented to atmosphere so that it can dry out, which reduces bacterial and mould growth within the sample and meet regulatory restrictions regarding the transport of wet blood. Filtered vents <b>752</b> and <b>754</b> in body <b>712</b><i>a </i>and arm <b>716</b><i>a </i>serve that purpose while inhibiting bacterial and mould contamination from the atmosphere.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Example 8</heading>
<p id="p-0133" num="0145">The device <b>810</b> of this example is similar to those of examples 1 to 6 in having a cartridge and press pad that are clamped together but includes a means to retain the device on the ear of the animal after removal of the clamping device whilst blood is being collected by the sampling media. This device will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref> through to <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0146">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 to 16</figref>, the device <b>810</b> includes a cartridge <b>812</b> and a press pad <b>814</b>, joined together by strap <b>816</b>. Preferably the shell, strap and press pad are formed integrally and more preferably formed by plastics injection molding.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0147">A separate sample carrier <b>818</b> is snap fitted to the base of the cartridge <b>812</b> with tabs <b>820</b> of the sample carrier engaging with annular rim <b>822</b> of cartridge <b>812</b>. If desired the rim <b>822</b> may be discontinuous, allowing the carrier <b>818</b> to be removed by rotation relative to the cartridge <b>812</b>. Other methods of attachment of the carrier <b>818</b> to the cartridge <b>812</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0148">In this example, the carrier <b>818</b> includes a card <b>824</b> providing space <b>826</b> on which the user can write and a circular window area <b>828</b> that is covered with sheet like sampling media <b>830</b>. The sampling media <b>830</b> has a central aperture <b>832</b>. The carrier may include a bar code, written identification and other data as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0149">The cartridge <b>810</b> includes cylindrical shell <b>834</b> and a platen <b>836</b> located within the shell. The platen <b>836</b> is moveable along the length of the shell <b>834</b> and is biased upwards by helical spring <b>838</b> located between the lower surface <b>840</b> of the platen and the base <b>842</b> of the cartridge <b>812</b>. The upper end of the shell has an inward extending rim or shell <b>827</b> that limits upwards movement of the platen and defines a central aperture <b>864</b>. Preferably the central aperture limits access to the platen so that a user cannot easily depress the platen except with the intended tool. The platen has tabs <b>829</b> that slide in slots <b>831</b> in the shell. These tabs <b>831</b> prevent the platen rotating within the shell and control vertical movement of the platen. Other means for controlling rotation and vertical movement may be used. For example, the wall of the shell may have one or more vertically extending ribs that locate the platen. The base <b>842</b> is a separate component and is preferably a snap fit into the lower end of the shell. Alternatively, the base may be formed integral with the side walls of the shell and a cap attached or mounted on the upper end of the wall. Spike means, comprising two diametrically opposed blades <b>844</b><i>a </i>and <b>844</b><i>b</i>, extend from lower surface <b>840</b> of the platen <b>836</b>. In plan view, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>b </i>the blades <b>844</b> are arc shaped. In side view, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref><i>a</i>, the lower edges <b>846</b><i>a </i>and <b>846</b><i>b </i>are also curved. This is to aid cutting of the animal's ear, as described later. Other configurations and more than two blades may be used, as will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0150">The blades <b>844</b> may be formed integrally with the platen. Further, whilst the embodiment uses blades, other spike means, such as the spikes of examples 1 to 6 maybe used instead. As with the other examples, the spike means may comprise an array of spikes or blades formed by plastic injection molding, by the insert molding of metal elements into a plastic platen, by metal die-casting or by stamping, folding, or upsetting of sheet metal by techniques known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0151">The base <b>842</b> of the cartridge has two arcuate slots <b>848</b><i>a</i>, <b>848</b><i>b </i>and a central circular aperture <b>850</b>. The blades <b>844</b><i>a</i>, <b>844</b><i>b </i>extend through the two arcuate slots <b>848</b><i>a</i>, <b>848</b><i>b</i>, respectively, when the platen <b>836</b> is depressed. When the platen is fully raised, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>c</i>, the blades <b>844</b><i>a </i>and <b>844</b><i>b </i>are fully retracted within the cartridge <b>836</b>. The shell and base can thus be considered to be the guard means of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0152">The platen has a central extension <b>852</b> that extends downwards through the center of the helical spring <b>838</b>. The upper end of the extension is hollow and has a central bore <b>854</b>. This bore <b>854</b> is shaped to receive an adaptor <b>856</b>. The lower part of the extension is solid and defines a pin <b>858</b>. The pin <b>858</b> has a shank <b>860</b> and an arrow shaped head <b>862</b> at the lower end of the shank <b>860</b>. The pin <b>858</b> is preferably formed integrally with the platen but may be a separate component.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0153">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>c</i>, when the platen is fully retracted part of the shank <b>860</b> and all of the head <b>862</b> extends through the aperture <b>850</b> in the base and through the aperture <b>832</b> of the sampling media. This is not essential and, if desired, the shell may be made taller so that all or substantially all of the pin is within the cartridge. The central aperture <b>864</b> is sized to allow the adaptor <b>856</b> to pass there-through and press upon the platen <b>836</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0154">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>b </i>and <b>9</b><i>c </i>the adaptor <b>856</b> has an annular flange <b>866</b> that overlies the part of the annular disc of platen around the bore <b>854</b> and a central pin <b>868</b> that extends into the bore <b>854</b>. Preferably the free end of the pin <b>868</b> engages the blind end of the bore. Force applied to the adaptor is thus transferred to the pin and the blades via the annular disc of the platen.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0155">The external shape of the adaptor <b>856</b> preferably closely matches the internal shape of the bore and is a snug fit within the bore. Thus, when the adaptor is inserted into the bore, the cartridge is retained on the adaptor by friction against the effects of gravity and normal movement. Other methods to temporarily retain the cartridge on the adaptor may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0156">The press pad <b>814</b> is generally rectangular and has a keyhole shaped slot <b>870</b> intended to receive the pin head <b>862</b>. The slot has oval end portion <b>872</b>, a necked portion <b>874</b> and a divergent portion <b>876</b>. The size of the head <b>862</b> is larger than the width of the oval end portion <b>870</b> whilst the shank <b>860</b> is smaller. The material of the press pad is resilient. Accordingly, the head <b>862</b> may be pushed through the end portion <b>872</b> under action of the adaptor, with the material returning to its original position and resisting withdrawal of the head vertically through the slot. The necked portion <b>874</b> has an opening that is smaller than the diameter of the shank <b>860</b> and so resists movement of the pin along the slot. Thus, once the head has passed through the end portion <b>864</b>, the pin head is retained until sufficient force is applied (by the user) to move the pin either along the slot or vertically back out of the slot. As will be explained further, in use this will usually only occur as a deliberate action by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0157">The press pad <b>814</b> has two parallel and longitudinally extending openings <b>876</b> by which it may be mounted on prongs <b>878</b> mounted on the lower jaw <b>880</b> of a conventional ear tagging gun <b>882</b>. Other means to mount the press pad on a tagging gun may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0158">In use the adaptor <b>856</b> is mounted on the free end of the plunger <b>884</b> of ear tagging gun <b>882</b>. Alternatively the plunger may be modified to have an end similar to that of the adaptor. The adaptor <b>856</b> is intended to remain on the plunger <b>884</b> for multiple uses and is preferably affixed thereto semi permanently. Most ear tagging guns have an internally threaded bore into which a threaded end of the adaptor is screwed. The adaptor may be attached to the plunger by other means or combination of means. For example, the adaptor may have a blind bore into which the free end of the plunger is received.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0159">For use, the device <b>810</b> is mounted on the tagging gun, with the cartridge <b>812</b> mounted on the adaptor <b>856</b> and the press pad <b>814</b> mounted on the prongs <b>878</b> of the opposed jaw <b>886</b> of the tagging gun, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref><i>a</i>. In this position the pin <b>858</b> is opposed and aligned with the end section <b>872</b> of the slot <b>870</b> on the press pad <b>814</b>. The platen and the blades are fully retracted and so there is no risk of cutting to the user as the cartridge <b>812</b> is placed on the adaptor <b>856</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0160">The tagging gun <b>882</b> is positioned around an animal's ear <b>888</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref><i>b</i>) and the user compresses the handles <b>890</b> to clamp the animal's ear between the cartridge <b>812</b> and press pad <b>814</b>. This causes the plunger <b>884</b>, with the adaptor <b>856</b> and cartridge <b>812</b>, to move towards the opposed jaw <b>880</b>, initially clamping the ear <b>888</b> between the press pad <b>814</b> and the pin <b>858</b>. Continued movement of the plunger towards the jaw <b>886</b> causes the pin <b>858</b> to pass through the animal's ear and into the end portion <b>872</b> of the slot <b>870</b> in the press pad, with the carrier <b>818</b> pressed against the animal's ear, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9</figref><i>a </i>to <b>9</b><i>c </i>and <b>15</b><i>c</i>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0161">Simultaneously, the blades <b>844</b> extend out of the openings and pass through the sampling media <b>830</b> and cut into the surface of the animal's ear, causing bleeding. If desired, the sampling media may be pre-cut or otherwise weakened to allow passage of the blades and prevent or minimize tearing.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0162">The plunger depresses the platen, and with it the blades and pin, downwards until movement of the platen is limited by the blades contacting the press pad or the tabs <b>829</b> contacting the bottom of the slot <b>831</b>. Which of these actions occurs first depends on the thickness of the animal's ear. If it is likely that the blades will contact the press pad, preferably the blades and press pad are configured and/or made of material that will resist deformation of the blades. If it is desired that the blades pass all the way through the ear, the press pad may be provided with slots or recesses to allow the ends of the blades to pass below the general surface of the press pad. If the slots <b>831</b> are omitted a stop, such as an inwardly extending annular flange, may be formed on the inner surface of the shell <b>834</b> to limit downwards movement of the platen <b>836</b>, if this is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0163">Continued squeezing of the handles together results in the retraction of the plunger <b>884</b> and the adaptor <b>856</b>. This results in disengagement of the adaptor <b>856</b> from the platen <b>836</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>and <b>15</b><i>d</i>. The cartridge <b>812</b> remains attached to the ear because the pin <b>856</b> is trapped by the press pad <b>814</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0164">Retraction of the plunger allows the platen to move away from the ear, under the action of the spring <b>838</b>, until the annular flange of the head <b>858</b> bears against the underside of the walls surrounding the slot <b>870</b>. The annular flange on the rear face of the head prevents the spring <b>838</b> from withdrawing the head <b>862</b> through the opening. At this point, for most animals, the blades have retracted back into the cartridge, allowing the cuts in the ear to bleed directly onto the sampling media <b>830</b>. It will be appreciated that a very thick ear may result in the blade still be extended into the flesh at this point, but this is not critical. Further, the length of the pin and hence the space between the press pad and lower surfaces may be varied for different species and/or breeds if this is an issue.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0165">Because the pin <b>858</b> is trapped by the press pad <b>814</b>, the cartridge and the sampling media remain secured and squeezed firmly against the animal's ear. The pin <b>856</b> extends through the animal's ear and so the cartridge cannot move relative to the ear. The spring <b>838</b> acting between the platen <b>836</b> and the base <b>842</b> of the cartridge acts to squeeze the animal's ear <b>888</b> between the base <b>842</b> and sampling media <b>830</b> on one side and the press pad <b>814</b> on the other side.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0166">The device <b>810</b> is then removed from the tagging gun by slipping the press pad from the jaw adaptor and left secured to the animal's ear, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref><i>e</i>. The device <b>810</b> is left for a time, usually about 25 to 30 seconds, which is usually sufficient for an appropriate amount of blood it to be collected by the sampling media. The device <b>810</b> is then removed by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0167">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a </i>to <b>10</b><i>f </i>and <b>15</b><i>f</i>, to remove the device <b>810</b> from the ear the user preferably slips a finger <b>890</b> into the loop formed by the strap and pulls backwards, as indicated by arrow <b>892</b>. This causes the press pad <b>814</b> to slide backwards relative to the cartridge <b>812</b> and the pin <b>858</b>. If necessary the user may hold the cartridge shell <b>834</b> to aid this relative movement.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0168">The pulling action causes the pin <b>858</b> to move relative to the press pad <b>814</b> along the slot <b>870</b> past the necked region <b>874</b>. Once the pin <b>858</b> has passed the necked region to a point where the slot is wider than the size of the head the press pad is free to fall away from the pin and/or the pin <b>858</b> is automatically withdrawn vertically from the slot <b>870</b>, under the upwards force of the spring <b>838</b>, depending on the strength of the spring. Alternatively the pin may be removed from the end of the slot. Once the head is free of the slot, if the spring is strong enough, the spring may cause the platen and pin to move upwards, withdrawing the pin back through the ear of the animal and the sampling media. In the present embodiment the spring is not strong enough, the pin remains in the ear and the user merely grasps the cartridge <b>812</b> and pulls it from the animal's ear. This frees the device from the animal's ear, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref><i>a </i>to <b>11</b><i>c </i>and <b>15</b><i>g</i>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0169">The carrier <b>818</b> may then be removed from the cartridge (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref><i>h</i>) and placed in a suitable container for transport to a laboratory or other location for further processing. The cartridge <b>812</b> and press plate <b>814</b> assembly may then be disposed in a suitable container. If desired the press pad may be pressed against the cartridge so as secure the pin head in the end of the slot, so shielding the user from the pin.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0170">Whilst the head will be bloody, because the pin is a relatively coarse piecing implement that requires a relatively large force to be driven through the animal's ear, the risk of scratching the user by the exposed pin head is relatively low.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0171">If desired the entire device <b>810</b> may be stored and transported for subsequent separation and processing.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0172">Whilst an offset strap <b>826</b> is shown, if desired, two straps, which extend on either side of the tagging gun may be provided. By providing two straps, when the user pulls on the straps to release the device from the ear, the pulling action will be generally aligned with the direction of the slot <b>870</b>. Alternatively, if a single strap is used, the direction of the slot <b>870</b> may be angled to the general direction of the two openings <b>876</b> and more aligned with the general direction of pull out of the single strap. If desired the strap may extend from the center region between the two openings <b>876</b> of the press pad rather than from the side.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0173">Whilst the embodiment of the eighth example is intended to be applied with a conventional ear tagging gun it may be modified for stand alone use. Further, the action of driving the retaining pin through the animal's ear into a press pad may be separated from the action of driving the blades into the flesh of the ear.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0174">Thus, for example, the pin may be formed separate from the platen and provided with separate drive means, such as a preloaded spring, to drive it through the ear of the animal and into a press pad that retains the pin. A spring clip, similar to item <b>412</b> of the fourth embodiment, may be used to position and/or retain the press pad in the correct alignment with the upper cartridge, with the press pad mounted on the underside of the clip. The platen and blades may then be separately driven into and withdrawn from the ear. The mechanism of the fifth example is one that may be used for this purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0175">The device of the eighth example is preferably configured to be a single use device, to prevent the cartridge being used on multiple animals, albeit with a new carrier and sampling media. If desired the internal surface of the shell may be provided with locking means to lock or otherwise retain the platen in a retracted position after use. One such locking means comprises an annular flange near the upper end with an angled lower surface, which allows the spring to drive the platen past the flange during the act of withdrawal.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0176">Other means of retaining and releasing the cartridge from the press pad may be utilized. For example, the pin <b>862</b> may be provided with a non circular head that is received and retained in a corresponding recess in the press pad. By providing the shank of the pin with a line or point of weakness the pin head may be broken off the shank by rotation of the press pad relative to the cartridge, releasing the cartridge. This also prevents the device being reused. The pin head may be removed in other ways, for example providing a blade for cutting the head from the shank.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0177">The preferred spike means of the eight example form elongate cuts in the animal's ear rather than &#x201c;pin&#x201d; holes. Elongate cuts increase the probability of cutting a vein and so producing good blood flow. The arcuate shape of the blades is merely one configuration of many.</p>

<p id="p-0176" num="0188">The device <b>950</b> of the ninth example, depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20</figref><i>a</i>, <b>20</b><i>b </i>and <b>20</b><i>c</i>, is similar to that of the eighth example. The device includes a cartridge <b>952</b> and a press pad <b>954</b> joined together by a strap <b>956</b>. The cartridge <b>952</b> is not, however, formed integrally with the strap <b>956</b>. Instead the strap <b>956</b> includes an annular retaining ring <b>958</b> having retaining tabs <b>960</b>. The cartridge <b>952</b> has tabs <b>962</b> that engage the tabs <b>960</b> on the retaining ring <b>958</b>. These may be a snap fit.

<p id="p-0180" num="0192">The device <b>1010</b> of the tenth example is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21</figref><i>a </i>through to <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0193">The device <b>1010</b> has a cartridge <b>1012</b> with integral handle <b>1014</b> and integral cover <b>1016</b>, the later joined to the cartridge by flexible hinge <b>1018</b>. The cartridge operates similar to that of the eighth example in having a spring loaded platen <b>1020</b> having cutting blades <b>1024</b> and central pin <b>1026</b>. The platen, blades and pin are depressed using an ear tagging gun, as described later.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0194">The cartridge <b>1012</b> has sampling media (not shown) mounted on its bottom edge <b>1028</b>. The sampling media is similar to that of the eight and ninth examples in being a circular disc with a central aperture to allow the pin <b>1026</b> to extend therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0195">The cap <b>1016</b> swings between an open position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 and 22</figref>, and a closed position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. In the closed position the cap engages the lower end of the cartridge and covers the sampling media and the pin <b>1026</b>. A depression <b>1030</b> may be provided to accommodate the pin <b>1026</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0196">Use of the device <b>1010</b> is substantially the same as for the eighth example, and is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref><i>a </i>through to <b>24</b></p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0197">The device is provided closed, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>. After opening the cap <b>1016</b> the cartridge is mounted on the plunger <b>1032</b> of an ear tagging gun <b>1034</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref><i>a</i>). The gun is then placed over the animal's ear (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref><i>b</i>) and the user compresses the handles to clamp the animal's ear between the cartridge and the lower jaw <b>1036</b> of the gun <b>1034</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref><i>c</i>). If desired a separate press pad may be mounted on the lower jaw. As with the eighth example, this causes the pin <b>1026</b> to pass through the animal's ear and the blades <b>1024</b> to cut into the animal's ear. This fully extended position is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22</figref><i>c</i>, <b>22</b><i>d </i>and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref><i>c</i>. Continued squeezing causes the plunger <b>1032</b> to retract.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0198">At this point the pin has passed through the animal's ear and the head <b>1038</b> is on the other side of the ear. The spring in the cartridge urges the platen, blades and pin <b>1026</b> upwards, as described with reference to the eighth example. Whilst there is no press pad, the head <b>1038</b> is not withdrawn through the hole in the ear but engages the underside of the ear. The spring urges the sampling media against the upper side of the ear and blood is collected by the sampling media. After about 25 to 30 seconds the user merely grasps the cartridge <b>1012</b> or the handle <b>1014</b> and pulls the device from the ear. This causes the pin <b>1026</b> to be withdrawn through the hole in the ear. Once the pin head <b>1038</b> has cleared the ear, the spring in the cartridge fully retracts the platen, blades and pin back to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref><i>b</i>. The user then closes the lid <b>1016</b> to enclose the sampling media. The lid may be a press fit, as shown, or may be provided with a catch to more securely close the lid. The device is then dispatched to a laboratory for further processing. At the laboratory the sampling media may be retrieved by opening the lid and withdrawing the sampling media.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">Example 11</heading>
<p id="p-0187" num="0199">The device <b>1110</b> of the eleventh example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 to 27</figref>. The device <b>1110</b> has a cartridge <b>1112</b> with a spring loaded platen <b>1114</b>, blades <b>1116</b> and pin <b>1118</b> and is similar to the eighth to tenth examples in this regard.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0200">A housing <b>1120</b> extends to one side from the lower end of the cartridge. The housing has a generally planar upper wall <b>1122</b> and a lower cover <b>1124</b>. Side walls <b>1126</b> extend between the upper wall <b>1122</b> and cover <b>1124</b> and so define a space therebetween. The upper wall is attached to the cartridge whilst the cover <b>1124</b> is hinged to one of the side walls at <b>1127</b>. The housing may be formed integrally with the cartridge or may be a separate component. The cover <b>1124</b> does not extend under the cartridge.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0201">Located in the space upper wall <b>1122</b> and a lower cover <b>1124</b> is a carrier <b>1130</b> that carries a disc of sampling media <b>1134</b>. The carrier <b>1130</b> may move longitudinally within the housing and has a handle <b>1136</b> that extends out of an opening <b>1138</b> in the end of the housing to allow the user to pull the carrier sideways. The handle <b>1136</b> has an end portion <b>1140</b> to enable the user to grasp the carrier, an elongated tab <b>1142</b> and a locking portion <b>1144</b>. The tab is <b>1142</b> is slightly narrower than the opening <b>1138</b>. The end portion is wider than the opening <b>1138</b>, as is the locking portion <b>1144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0202">As assembled and ready or use the carrier is fully retracted in the housing with the cover closed, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25</figref><i>a </i>to <b>25</b><i>c</i>. In this position the sampling media <b>1134</b> lies under the cartridge. The carrier <b>1130</b> has a tab <b>1146</b> that extends upwards and overlies the wall of the cartridge. This tab <b>1146</b> prevents the carrier <b>1130</b> sliding out of the housing due to normal handling. In this position the end portion <b>1140</b> engages or is close to the end wall and so prevents the carrier sliding further inwards.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0203">The device is similar to the tenth example in not having a lower press pad and relies on the pin <b>1118</b> to be retained on the animal's ear. Attachment of the device <b>1110</b> to the animal's ear, collection of the blood and removal from the ear is thus substantially the same as for the tenth example.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0204">Once the device <b>1110</b> has been removed from the ear the user pulls the carrier sideways relative to the housing <b>1120</b> and cartridge <b>1112</b>. The carrier is preferably a flexible plastics material and the sideways force causes the tab <b>1146</b> to deflect and allow the carrier <b>1130</b> to move sideways. Alternatively, the tab <b>1146</b> may be configured to break off on application of a suitable force. The carrier moves sideways until the locking portion has passed through the opening <b>1138</b>. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref><i>b</i>, the locking portion has angled tabs <b>1148</b> that are wider than the opening and a necked region <b>1150</b> slightly smaller than the opening. Thus the carrier can be pulled out, with the tabs <b>1148</b> deflecting the side walls to pass through the opening <b>1138</b>. Once the tabs <b>1148</b> have passed though the opening the walls return to their normal position and prevent the handle and carrier being pushed back into the housing. In this position the sampling media <b>1134</b> is located under the cover <b>1124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0205">The entire device may then be sent to a laboratory for further processing. At the laboratory the cover is opened and the carrier removed from the rest of the device for further processing.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0206">If desired the housing may be provided with a line of weakness <b>1152</b> in its upper and side walls. After withdrawal of the carrier the housing, with the sampling media <b>1134</b> secured within, may be removed from the cartridge by the user bending the outer part of the housing about the line of weakness <b>1152</b> to break the upper and side walls at that point. The separated housing may then be sent to a laboratory and the cartridge disposed of.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">Example 12</heading>
<p id="p-0195" num="0207">The device <b>1210</b> of the twelfth example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, is substantially the same as the eleventh example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 25 to 27</figref> and operates substantially the same. However, the device <b>1210</b> is provided with an integral press pad <b>1212</b> that is attached to the handle <b>1214</b> of the cartridge <b>1216</b> via strap <b>1218</b>. The press pad is adapted to locate on the lower jaw of an ear tagging gun, in a similar manner to press pad <b>814</b> of the eighth example. The press pad <b>1212</b> has an aperture or recess <b>1220</b> that, in use, is located opposite the center of the cartridge <b>1216</b>. However, the aperture is much larger than the pin in the cartridge and does not serve to retain the pin when the pin is driven through the animal's ear. The press pad <b>1212</b> is provided so as to avoid any possible contamination of the sample from the ear tagging gun and the aperture is provided to allow the pin to pass through the ear without hindrance from the press pad.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0208">After the device has been attached to the animal's ear, using the steps set out in relation to the eleventh example, the press pad <b>1212</b> remains on the lower jaw of the ear tagging gun. The press pad <b>1212</b> is removed and the device left on the animal for about 20 to 30 seconds. The user can then remove the device <b>1210</b> by grasping the press pad <b>1212</b> and pulling the away from the ear.</p>
<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Example 13</heading>
<p id="p-0197" num="0209">The device <b>1310</b> of the thirteenth example, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A</figref> to F has a cartridge <b>1312</b> and integral press pad <b>1316</b> joined together by strap <b>1314</b> and loop <b>1318</b>. The internals of the cartridge <b>1312</b> is substantially the same as those of examples eight to twelve. The press pad <b>1316</b> is similar to that of the twelfth example and has an aperture <b>1324</b> into which the piercing pin of the cartridge extends but does not engage.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0210">Extending across the underside <b>1332</b> of the cartridge <b>1312</b> is sampling media <b>1326</b>. The sampling media <b>1326</b> is part of a sampling media assembly <b>1327</b> that includes a handle <b>1322</b> that extends through a hollow housing <b>1320</b>. Suitable materials for the handle <b>1322</b> and housing <b>1320</b> include paper, thin cardboard and plastics films or sheets. Preferably the handle <b>1322</b> is also a carrier for the sampling media. If desired the handle and sampling media may be formed of the same material</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0211">The sampling media assembly <b>1327</b> extends between two tabs <b>1328</b> and the housing extends generally vertically from the upper surface of the tabs <b>1328</b>. The sampling media assembly <b>1372</b> has a T-shaped end <b>1323</b> that engages tabs <b>1325</b> on the other side of the cartridge (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>) and so the sampling media is held in position underneath the cartridge <b>1312</b>. Preferably the cartridge is configured to maintain the housing generally vertical.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0212">In use the cartridge is mounted on the plunger of an ear tagging gun <b>1349</b> and the press pad mounted on the lower jaw <b>1342</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29</figref> E &#x26; F. In this position the strap <b>1314</b> is located within the opening of the jaws and the housing extends upwards, leaving the opening to the jaws relatively unimpeded. The device is clamped to an animal's ear as previously described, the press pad is removed from the tagging gun <b>1340</b> and the cartridge left on the animal for an appropriate time. As with the twelfth example, the user may remove the device by grasping the press pad <b>1316</b> and pulling away from the ear, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0213">After removal from the ear, preferably the housing and sampling media assembly <b>1327</b> are removed from the cartridge by disengaging from the tabs <b>1328</b> and <b>1325</b>. The user then grasps the handle <b>1322</b> and pulls the sampling media into the housing <b>1320</b>, where it is protected from contamination. The housing is then sent for further processing, such as in a laboratory, whilst the remainder of the device, namely the cartridge <b>1312</b>, press pad <b>1316</b> and connecting strap <b>1314</b> and loop <b>1318</b> are disposed of.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0214">If desired, the housing and sampling media may remain on the cartridge before retraction of the sampling media into the housing. If this occurs, preferably the housing is rotated so as to extend generally sideways from the cartridge, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29B</figref> before the sampling media is retracted into the housing.</p>
<heading id="h-0019" level="1">Example 14</heading>
<p id="p-0203" num="0215">The device <b>1410</b> of the fourteenth example is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 to 34</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0216">The device <b>1410</b> operates similar to that of the eighth to thirteenth examples in having a spring loaded platen <b>1414</b> having cutting blades <b>1418</b> and central pin <b>1426</b>. The platen, blades and pin are depressed using ear tagging pliers or a gun, as described later.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0217">The device <b>1410</b> has a housing <b>1412</b> and platen <b>1414</b> with integral blades <b>1418</b> located within the housing. The housing comprises part circular side wall <b>1420</b> extending upwards from base <b>1424</b> and defines a generally cylindrical space <b>1428</b>. There is no rear wall, so allowing use with both ear tagging pliers and guns, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33 and 34</figref>, respectively. The platen is now round and not rectangular as stated this should be modified.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0218">A spring <b>1430</b>, located around the pin <b>1426</b> and extending between the base <b>1424</b> and the underside of the platen <b>1414</b>, biases the platen away from the base <b>1424</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0219">The platen <b>1414</b> is generally circular and slides vertically within the side wall <b>1420</b>. The side wall <b>1420</b> has inwardly extending vertical ribs <b>1432</b> that locate the platen and limit movement to vertical movement.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0220">At the top of side wall <b>1420</b> are inwardly extending walls or tabs <b>1434</b> that prevent the platen moving out of the housing. These tabs <b>1434</b> provide a snap fit for the platen <b>1414</b> and allow the platen to be introduced into the cylindrical space <b>1428</b> by merely pushing the platen downwards, deflecting the tabs sideways and then allowing the tabs to snap back over the top of the platen. The platen <b>1414</b> may have a recessed periphery so the top of the platen and the top of the tabs align.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0221">Located in the base <b>1424</b> is aperture <b>1436</b> sized to allow pin <b>1426</b> to pass through when the platen <b>1414</b> is depressed. The pin is similar to that of examples 8 to 13 and has an arrow shaped head <b>1427</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0222">The base also has linear slots <b>1438</b> that align with the blades <b>1418</b> and allow the blades to pass through when the platen is depressed.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0223">The upper face of the platen has a recess <b>1440</b> for mounting on a press pin <b>1472</b> of a set of ear tagging pliers or ear tagging gun.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0224">The underside of the base is recessed to receive sample media carrier <b>1450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0225">Side tabs <b>1442</b> and end walls <b>1444</b> retain the sample media carrier <b>1450</b> in the recess. The sample media carrier comprises a carrier <b>1452</b> with a rectangular window <b>1454</b> with the actual sampling media <b>1456</b> mounted on the card over the window <b>1454</b>. This allows the user to manipulate the card without contacting the actual sampling media <b>1456</b>. The sampling media preferably has an aperture <b>1458</b> that aligns with the pin <b>1426</b> and so allows the pin to pass through the media.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0226">The device <b>1410</b> also includes a press pad <b>1460</b> integrally formed with the housing <b>1412</b> and attached thereto by flexible strap <b>1461</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0227">The press pad <b>1460</b> is similar to that of the thirteenth example and has a central aperture <b>1462</b> that is oversized to allow the pin <b>1426</b> to pass into the aperture but not engage the pin.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0228">Elongate bores <b>1463</b> are provided to allow mounting of the press pad <b>1460</b> on the lower jaws of ear tagging pliers or gun, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>. The upper surface of the press pad is also provided with elongate grooves <b>1464</b>, which, in use, align with the blades <b>1418</b>. This allows the blades <b>1418</b> to pass through a thin ear of an animal and into the grooves, rather than bearing against the upper surface of the press pad. This means that when the pliers are squeezed together all force is transmitted through the ear, so compressing the ear and aiding in release of blood.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0229">In use the platen is mounted on the press pin <b>1472</b> of the upper jaw <b>1473</b> a pair of ear tagging pliers <b>1470</b> and the press pad is mounted on the lower jaws <b>1475</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>. Although the platen is free to rotate on or with the pin <b>1470</b> the strap <b>1461</b> tends to align the housing with the upper jaw, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0230">The device is used as previously described with examples 8 to 13. The animal's ear is placed between the jaws and the jaws clamped together, driving the platen downwards. The pin <b>1426</b> passes through the apertures <b>1436</b> &#x26; <b>1458</b> in the base <b>1424</b> and the sampling media <b>1456</b>, respectively and into and through the animal's ear. The pin extends into but does not engage recess <b>1462</b> The blades <b>1418</b> pass through slots <b>1438</b> and cut through the sampling media and into the animal's ear.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0231">The upper jaw of the pliers passes into the rectangular aperture <b>1427</b>, which is why the side wall <b>1420</b> is not continuous.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0232">The press pad <b>1460</b> provides a surface against which the ear is pressed during this action. The pin <b>1426</b> passes through the ear and into the aperture <b>1462</b> in the press pad. As mentioned above, the aperture <b>1462</b> is oversized and the pin is not retained by the press pad.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0233">The jaws are separated. The spring <b>1430</b> withdraws the platen <b>1414</b> relative to the housing <b>1412</b> and the ear until the arrow shaped head <b>1427</b> of the pin <b>1426</b> catches on the underside of the ear. Continued separation of the jaws results in separation of the press pin <b>1472</b> of the pliers from the platen. The press pad <b>1460</b> is not engaged with the pin <b>1426</b> and may then be moved with the pliers from the ear for subsequent removal from the lower jaw <b>1475</b>, leaving the pliers free to receive another device.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0234">As with examples 10 to 13, the spring maintains some pressure on the ear and maintains the sampling media against the skin. After a sufficient period of time the user merely grasps the housing or the press pad and pulls the device from the animal's ear, withdrawing pin <b>1426</b> through the animal's ear and allowing the spring <b>1430</b> to fully retract the platen, blades and pin.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0235">After use the user may grasp the carrier <b>1452</b> via cut outs <b>1480</b> and remove the carrier with the sampling media <b>1456</b> from the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0236">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, after use the press pad <b>1460</b> may be clipped to the top of the housing <b>1412</b> to prevent access to the platen. In the example shown the front of the side wall <b>1420</b> has a pin <b>1482</b> that is received by bore <b>1484</b> on press pad <b>1460</b>. This may be a semi- permanent fixing, so that once attached the press pad cannot be removed, but in the preferred embodiment this is a simple interference fit.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0237">Although the top of the platen <b>1414</b> is accessible, this is not critical as it has been found that the blades <b>1438</b> need not be sharpened metal or the like that are classified as &#x201c;sharps&#x201d; requiring guarding.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0238">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref> the device <b>1410</b> may be used with an ear tagging gun <b>1490</b>, with the press pad mounted on the lower jaw <b>1492</b> and the housing <b>1412</b> on the press pin (not shown) of the plunger <b>1494</b>. Operation is as previously described with reference to the pliers and earlier examples.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0239">While fourteen examples of devices formed in accordance with the invention have been described and illustrated, along with a number of variants, it will be appreciated that many more examples of devices of the invention are possible and that many more modifications of the examples provided can be made without departing from the scope of the present invention as outlined in the above summary of the invention.</p>
