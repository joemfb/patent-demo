<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically show a dual-band antenna <b>100</b>, according to an exemplary embodiment. The dual-band antenna <b>100</b> includes a radiator unit <b>10</b>, a feed unit <b>20</b>, and a ground unit <b>30</b>. The dual-band antenna <b>100</b> can be used in a portable electronic device such as a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant, or a laptop computer. The dual-band antenna <b>100</b> can be one unitary component and made of flexible printed circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The radiator unit <b>10</b> includes a base portion <b>11</b>, an extension portion <b>13</b>, a connecting portion <b>15</b>, a transition portion <b>17</b>, and a u-shaped portion <b>19</b>. Because of the schematic depiction of the drawings and the potential unitary construction, the precise beginnings and ends of various parts of the antenna need not be exactly as depicted in this disclosure. The extension portion <b>13</b> and the connecting portion <b>15</b> are substantially coplanar with the base portion <b>11</b>. The transition portion <b>17</b> and the u-shaped portion <b>19</b> are non-coplanar with the base portion <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The base portion <b>11</b> and the extension portion <b>13</b> have straight perimeter edges. The extension portion <b>13</b> extends away from a perimeter edge of the base portion <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The connecting portion <b>15</b> is a planar sheet. The connecting portion <b>15</b> perpendicularly extends from a portion of the extension portion <b>13</b>, opposite to the base portion <b>11</b>, and in a plane parallel to the plane of the base portion <b>11</b>. One portion of the connecting portion <b>15</b> can define a curved edge <b>151</b> for fitting the antenna around installed components, such as cameras. Perimeter edges of the extension portion <b>13</b>, the base portion <b>11</b> and the connecting portion <b>15</b> define a first slot <b>153</b>. In the exemplary embodiment, the first slot <b>153</b> has straight edges, and by varying the size of the first slot <b>153</b>, the electric length of the dual-band antenna <b>100</b> can be tuned to a first particular desired frequency band performance.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The transition portion <b>17</b> is a longitudinal planar sheet, and substantially perpendicular with the connecting portion <b>15</b>. The transition portion <b>17</b> extends from where the right angle connects to the connecting portion <b>15</b>. The u-shaped portion <b>19</b> is slightly curved and includes a first section <b>191</b>, a second section <b>192</b>, and a third section <b>193</b>. The first section <b>191</b> extends away from the transition portion <b>17</b>. The second section <b>192</b> has one end connected to a distal end of the first section <b>191</b> away from the transition portion <b>17</b> and another end connected to the third section <b>193</b>. The first section <b>191</b> is longer than the third section <b>193</b>. The first section <b>191</b>, the second section <b>192</b>, and the third section <b>193</b> cooperatively form a second slot <b>195</b>. The second slot <b>195</b> has straight edges, and by varying the size of the second slot <b>195</b>, the electric length of the dual-band antenna <b>100</b> can be tuned to a second particular desired frequency band performance.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The feed unit <b>20</b> is substantially hook-shaped and extending from the edge of the base portion <b>11</b>. The feed unit <b>20</b> is angled relative to the base portion <b>11</b>. The feed unit <b>20</b> is electronically connected to a feed point of a circuit board of the portable electronic device (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The ground unit <b>30</b> is substantially hook-shaped and extending from the edge of the base portion <b>11</b>. The ground unit <b>30</b> is parallel to the feed unit <b>20</b>. The ground unit <b>30</b> is angled relative to the base portion <b>11</b>. The ground unit <b>30</b> is electronically connected to a ground point of a circuit board of the portable electronic device (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The dual-band antenna <b>100</b> conserves space because it can be installed on a surface of a housing of the portable electronic device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Resonant frequency of the dual-band antenna <b>100</b> ranges from about 2.4 GHz to 2.5 GHz generally corresponding to Bluetooth&#x2122; and WIFI&#x2122; operating frequency range. Table 1 shows a maximum gain and a radiation efficiency of the dual-band antenna <b>100</b> at different frequencies. Clearly the dual-band antenna <b>100</b> meets design requirements for antennas.</p>
