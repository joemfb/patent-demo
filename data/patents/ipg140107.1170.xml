<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to the field of rail transportation, and more particularly, to determining a condition of train undercarriage components.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The safe and reliable operation of a railroad system is dependent upon the integrity of the rolling mechanisms of the vehicles traveling over the rails. For example, it is important to monitor a condition of train wheel bearings to determine if a degree of wear on the bearing indicates that the bearings need to be inspected and repaired or replaced. Worn or damaged bearings increase the rolling friction of the axle thereby increasing the power required to pull the train. In addition, worn or damaged bearings may cause excessive wear to the train axle and, in the case of failure of the bearing, may even cause the axle to lock up, preventing rotation of the wheel, resulting in a potential fire hazard due to the heat build up and potential sparking caused by friction of the locked wheel scraping along the rail.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Bearing temperatures may be directly monitored using rail car mounted temperature sensors, such as thermocouples, disposed near the bearings. However, such techniques having proven to be unreliable and/or relatively costly to operate and maintain. One way of indirectly monitoring the a condition train wheel bearings is to sense a temperature of the wheel bearing indirectly through a bearing box surrounding the wheel bearing on a rail car of a train. For example, infrared radiation (IR) sensors have been mounted along a rail to detect IR energy emitted by an outer wheel bearing and indicative of a temperature of the wheel bearing, as the rail car passes the IR sensor. However, such a system may be limited to a certain rail car wheel configuration that allows an unimpeded sensing path from the sensor to the bearing box, which may not be achievable for all rail car wheel configurations. Furthermore, inner wheel bearings used on some rail cars and locomotives have proven difficult to monitor due to sensing paths being blocked by suspension components and the differences among inner wheel bearing arrangements. In addition, the presence of IR sources near an inner bearing being monitored, such as gear boxes or suspension springs, and the effects of lateral movement of the axle bringing other IR sources into a sensing path, such as during wheel hunting, may result in erroneous IR readings for the bearing. Other IR sources which may interfere with a temperature measurement of a train wheel bearing may include hot lubricant leakage, sun reflections, differential heating on different sides of a train, sparks from skidding wheels, and brake hardware, such as brake disks. Accordingly, an improved system and method for sensing a temperature of train wheel bearings is desired.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">A train undercarriage component temperature detection system may be used to obtain data, such as IR emission data, indicative of a temperature of a sensed railcar wheel or wheel bearing as the vehicle rolls past a sensing device of the system. The system may include a sensing devices oriented to receive unobstructed IR emissions from rail car undercarriage components. In one aspect, a sensor may include an array of sensing elements sensing adjacent regions of a target area of a component, such as an inner bearing and an outer bearing of an axle, respectively. The data received from the sensing devices is then processed to extract information indicative of a health of the respective sensed component. The data may be processed to recognize a characteristic waveform profile corresponding to a known component type and reduce spurious IR emissions received from IR sources in the vicinity of a sensed component. A suspension for the system mounted within a railroad tie, or sleeper, is also provided to reduce the effects of shock and vibration that may be experienced by the system. Waveform analysis methods may be used on the data to identify a type of component and then, based on the type of component being scanned, identify conditions of the scanned component that may be indicative of an abnormal health condition.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary train undercarriage component temperature detection system <b>10</b> for detecting wheel bearing temperatures. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is schematic representation of such a system <b>10</b>. One or more sensors, such as outer bearing sensor <b>12</b> and inner bearing sensor <b>14</b>, may be placed in a position along a track <b>16</b> to obtain data from wheel bearings, such as an inner bearing <b>20</b> and an outer bearing <b>18</b>, of a train axle <b>22</b> as the axle passes the sensors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. The sensors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may be positioned in a rail bed of the track <b>16</b>, such as within a cross tie or sleeper <b>24</b> adapted to contain the sensors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, and to receive IR emissions from the bearings <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. In an aspect of the invention, each sensor <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may include a mirror <b>26</b> to redirect IR emissions into a receiver <b>28</b> of the sensor <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> to allow the receiver <b>28</b> to be oriented horizontally within the sleeper <b>24</b>. The sensors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may be positioned along an axis <b>34</b> parallel to the train axle <b>22</b> to receive IR emissions emitted from a bottom <b>32</b> of a bearing <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> along a path <b>30</b> perpendicular to the axle <b>22</b>. The emissions may be redirected by the mirror <b>26</b>, for example, at a right angle with respect to the path <b>30</b>, into the receiver <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, wheel IR sensors <b>13</b> may be placed in a position along the track <b>16</b> to obtain IR emission data from the wheels <b>23</b>, such as inner faces <b>25</b> of the wheels <b>23</b>, as the axle passes the sensors <b>13</b>. In another aspect of the invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, a portion of the train axle <b>22</b>, such as an axle portion <b>111</b> near an inner bearing <b>20</b>, may be targeted by a sensor <b>113</b> to obtain IR emission data from the axle portion <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each sensor <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may further include a plurality of infrared sensing elements <b>29</b>, such as IR radiation sensitive diode detectors or an IR sensitive planar array having individually resolvable pixels, arranged, for example, vertically within the receiver <b>28</b> to receive respective portions <b>33</b> of the IR emissions radiated by respective bearings <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>. Accordingly, each infrared sensing element <b>29</b> receives a respective portion of IR energy from a target area, such as the bottom <b>32</b> or end <b>38</b> of the bearing <b>18</b>, <b>20</b>, spaced away from portions of IR emissions received by other IR sensing elements <b>29</b> of the sensor. In an aspect of the invention, the sensors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may include five elements <b>29</b>, such as Mercury/Cadmium/Tellurium (HgCdTe) elements, positioned in an array within the sensor <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Four elements may be used for scanning, and a fifth element <b>47</b> may be used for calibrating the other elements <b>29</b>. The calibrating element <b>47</b> may be positioned to view a reference Peltier effect semiconductor cooler <b>49</b> maintained at a desired temperature, such as &#x2212;40 degrees Celsius, to provide a DC-coupled benchmark for sensed heat signatures. Such a design may allow an absolute temperature measurement accuracy of +/&#x2212;0.1 degree Celsius. The sensors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may transmit through a zinc-selenid lens and view the railcar through an external shutter mounted on the instrumented tie, with a front surface mirror <b>26</b> in the viewing path. The mirror <b>26</b> may include a gold front surface to resist tarnishing or bonding with other materials. The mirror <b>26</b> may be rotated, such as at 10,000 revolutions per minute, to fling off contaminants that may come to rest on the mirror <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">While the perpendicular orientation of the path <b>30</b> may allow the sensors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> to receive IR radiation unblocked by other components, (such as suspension components positioned near the bearings <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>) an unimpeded path from the bearing <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> to the mirror <b>26</b> may not be possible to achieve in some cases. For example, the bottom <b>32</b> of a locomotive outer bearing <b>18</b> may be obscured by a shroud (not shown), thereby rendering it difficult to maintain a clear path to the bottom <b>32</b> of the outer bearing <b>18</b> for receiving IR emissions. In an aspect of the invention, the outer bearing sensor <b>12</b> may be inclined from the axis <b>34</b> by an angle <b>36</b> so that an outer bearing imaging path <b>31</b> may be inclined away from perpendicular with respect to the axle <b>22</b> by corresponding angle <b>36</b>. For example, the bearing imaging path <b>31</b> may be positioned at an acute angle with respect to a face <b>38</b> of the outer wheel bearing <b>18</b>. Consequently, an IR emission radiated from an un-obscured portion of the outer bearing <b>18</b>, such as the face <b>38</b> of the outer bearing <b>18</b>, may be sensed by the sensor <b>12</b> positioned in the railbed below the train without interference from components positioned near the bearing <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The IR emissions received from the respective portions <b>33</b> and converted into respective signals indicative of a strength of the IR energy received may be provided to a processor <b>40</b> for further processing of the received signals, for example, to determine indications of abnormal bearing heating. In an embodiment of the invention, the processor <b>40</b> may be disposed remotely from the sleeper <b>24</b> and may be connected to the sensors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> via respective cables <b>15</b>, <b>45</b>. The processor <b>40</b> may further receive wheel passage information provided by one or more wheel sensors <b>48</b> such as inductive sensors, for example, spaced longitudinally along rail <b>17</b>. The processor <b>40</b> may be in communication with memory <b>42</b>, for example, to receive analytically and/or experimentally derived radiation pattern information from the memory <b>42</b> to perform pattern recognition analysis in accordance with and aspect of the invention. Processed information, such as information identifying a bearing condition of a sensed wheel bearing, may be transmitted via transmitter <b>44</b> to a central monitor <b>46</b> for reporting and/or notification of a degraded bearing condition requiring servicing.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The processor <b>40</b> also be in communication with a train database <b>43</b> having reference information for each passing vehicle to the relative axle count within the train and the relative vehicle position within the train. For example, the reference information may be downloaded from a remote source via transmitter <b>44</b> being configured as a transceiver for receiving and transmitting information. In another aspect, specific registered car number data from an external system, such as an AEI tag reader system, may be input to the database <b>43</b> to tag the vehicle data with a unique vehicle registration number.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In an aspect of the invention, the system may <b>10</b> configured for acquiring 120 samples per element <b>29</b> per bearing detected at speeds from about 1.86 mph to 310 miles per hour. The sampling rate may be scaled to a train velocity, so that regardless of the train speed, 120 samples per element <b>29</b> per bearing measured may be captured and 240 samples per element <b>29</b> per wheel measured. Bearing temperatures up to 356 degrees Fahrenheit may be detected and wheel temperatures up to 1,112 degrees Fahrenheit may be measured with the system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The prior art techniques for sensing IR energy radiated by a train wheel bearing for detecting a wheel bearing having temperature higher than a normal operating temperature generate unreliable indicators under certain circumstances, thereby resulting in false hot bearing indications causing unnecessary stoppage of the train to inspect the bearings, or missed hot bearing that should have been inspected. Applicant has found that processing of the IR energy measurement data under the techniques set forth in this invention can provide hot bearing determinations that are more reliable and accurate. Some problems experienced when attempting to perform remote IR energy measurements of train wheel bearings include spurious IR noise, IR sources close to the bearing, such as springs or gear boxes, different configurations of train wheel bearings and associated suspension and wheel components, and movement of the train axle and associated components, into a detection path of an IR sensor, such as may be experienced during a wheel hunting condition. In particular, the inner bearing <b>20</b> of a train axle <b>22</b> may be positioned close to a gear box <b>39</b> (indicated by dotted line) that may also be a source of IR energy that may interfere with the IR emissions emitted by the bearing <b>20</b>. Consequently, a portion of the gear box <b>39</b> or other component radiating IR energy, such as a suspension spring (not shown), may provide one or more portions <b>33</b> of IR emissions to the sensor <b>14</b>, such as when the axle moves laterally during hunting, resulting in an IR energy level that erroneously includes an IR energy component from both the inner bearing <b>20</b> and one or more other IR sources, such as the gear box <b>39</b>. In another configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an inner bearing may be viewable through a relatively narrow aperture between a traction motor <b>106</b> and a carrier bracket <b>108</b> of a locomotive, making it difficult to obtain an accurate temperature reading of the inner bearing due to interference of the traction motor <b>106</b> and a carrier bracket <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Furthermore, geometric differences among configurations of train axle, wheel, and suspension components may result in erroneous readings. For example, if the measurement system <b>10</b> is configured to sense a certain detection target area for a corresponding geometric configuration of train axle, wheel, and suspension component, but encounters a different configuration (such as a larger gear box entering the field of inspection or an outer bearing having a different height above the rail bed than the system is configured for due, for example, to a different wheel diameter) the measurement system <b>10</b> may sense an erroneous IR reading. It will be appreciated that aspects of the present invention may be used for distinguishing between one or more different components that may enter a relatively hot condition indicative of a component malfunction. For example, it may be desirable to determine whether a bearing or a gear box is a component with a hot condition. Accordingly, the techniques of the present invention are not limited to a detection of bearing conditions because such techniques may also be applied for detecting malfunction conditions in other mechanical components such as the gearbox, brake disks, and/or brake pads etc.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">An improved detection system capable of identifying elevated bearing temperatures for a variety of train wheel bearing, axle, wheel, and suspension component configurations, and conditions of these train components includes performing one or more innovative processes on the received IR energy to determine a temperature of the bearing from which a health condition of the bearing may be inferred. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary graph of temperature versus temperature sampling points over time for received IR emissions from a train wheel bearing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows wheel detection pulses <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> generated, for example, by inductive wheel detectors <b>48</b> as a train wheel <b>23</b> passes the detector <b>48</b> (as shown <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.) IR emission data may be continuously collected by the processor <b>40</b> monitoring the data received from the IR sensors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, relative, for example, to a time when a wheel <b>23</b> is initially detected, as indicated by a rising edge <b>62</b> of a first pulse <b>56</b>. Data collection may be completed at a time relative to a falling edge of wheel detection pulse, such as a falling edge <b>60</b> of the second pulse <b>54</b>. Accordingly, a timing of IR emission capture may be correlated with arrival of a wheel <b>23</b> to ensure that wheel bearing IR emissions corresponding to the passing wheel <b>23</b> is captured. By using two wheel sensors and measuring a time between wheel detection pulses, a speed of the train may be determined and used to dynamically adjust a capture time relative to the wheel detection pulses to ensure that wheel bearing emissions are captured as the wheel passes the sensors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an aspect of the invention, a sampling technique may be used to isolate a windowed portion <b>58</b> of the received IR temperature profile <b>50</b> provided to the processor <b>40</b> by a respective sensing element <b>29</b> of the sensor <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The windowing technique may be employed to eliminate spurious IR signals outside the windowed portion <b>58</b> that may have been captured. A width <b>52</b> of the window <b>51</b> may be predetermined or dynamically adjusted to achieve capture of the desired windowed portion <b>58</b> of the profile <b>50</b> to eliminate undesired portions <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> of the waveform outside the window portion <b>58</b>. Such undesired portions may include IR emission profiles indicative of other components radiating IR energy in the vicinity of the wheel bearing, such as springs, exhaust pipes, or brake components. For example, the portion <b>63</b> exceeding an alarm threshold <b>66</b>, such as a temperature alarm threshold, may be ignored because the portion <b>63</b> is outside the desired potion <b>58</b> and may be indicative of IR energy radiated from another part of the train different from the bearing. In an aspect of the invention, the position of the window <b>51</b> may be adjusted to compensate for variations among railcars and or rail car components to ensure that at least one element <b>29</b> views a temperature peak portion of a component targeted.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows rail wheel components contributing identifiable heat profiles superimposed over an exemplary IR radiation profile <b>50</b> received from a train wheel <b>23</b> by the detection system <b>10</b>. As shown, brake shoes <b>116</b> being applied to the wheel rim <b>112</b> create recognizable shoe temperature peaks <b>118</b> and rim temperature peaks <b>120</b>, while a cooler wheel plate <b>114</b> of the wheel <b>23</b> shows a cooler temperature valley <b>122</b> in the profile <b>50</b>. When analyzing the profile <b>50</b> to determine a hot wheel condition, the shoe temperature peaks <b>118</b> and rim temperature peaks <b>120</b> may be ignored because the wheel plate <b>114</b> temperature <b>122</b> is the temperature of interest. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> shows an exemplary graph of a sensed temperature profile <b>50</b> indicative of a braked wheel exhibiting shoe temperature peaks <b>118</b> and rim temperature peaks <b>120</b> but having a wheel temperature <b>122</b> below an alarm threshold <b>66</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> shows an exemplary graph of a sensed temperature profile <b>50</b> indicative of a braked wheel exhibiting shoe temperature peaks <b>118</b> and rim temperature peaks <b>120</b> and also exhibiting a hot wheel condition because the temperature <b>122</b> of the wheel plate is above the predetermined threshold <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A position of the window <b>51</b> with respect to the IR profile <b>50</b> may be selected corresponding to detection of the wheel <b>23</b>, as indicated by wheel detection pulses <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, so that the window <b>51</b> is relatively centered around the windowed portion <b>58</b>. In another embodiment, the windowed portion <b>58</b> may be selected to isolate a certain portion of the received IR energy of interest to be analyzed. In an aspect of the invention, the window <b>51</b> may be sized corresponding to a largest diameter bearing profile expected to be encountered, and a center position <b>53</b> of the window <b>51</b> may be selected to be at a middle of a profile <b>50</b> indicative of a centerline of the sensed bearing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> is a diagram showing respective areas of coverage <b>35</b> of exemplary IR scanning beams within a detection window <b>51</b> corresponding to a sensed bearing wherein 2 of 4 scanning beams fall within the window <b>51</b>. By utilizing the coverage of the 4 scan beams and dynamically selecting beams with best coverage based on detected heat signatures, a bearing temperature profile may be captured by at least one of the beams regardless of variations in truck positioning. For example, when scanning the inner bearing <b>20</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, at least some of beams intersect the inner bearing <b>20</b>, while others of the beams not intersecting the bearing <b>20</b> may be ignored. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> shows an exemplary graph of a sensed temperature profile corresponding to the areas <b>35</b> scanned in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In another aspect the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, sharp peak profiles <b>68</b> relative to an overall detected temperature profile <b>50</b>, for example, within a window, may be eliminated as being potentially erroneous readings. Such peak profiles <b>68</b> may be indicative of parasitic radiation or a reflection and may need to be filtered to allow an accurate determination of bearing temperature. For example, relatively sharp peaks profiles <b>68</b> may be identified by setting a threshold for variations in values of a series of samples over a predetermined time period and eliminating any data that indicates a peak profile <b>68</b> that is undesirably sharp compared to the overall detected temperature profile <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In yet another aspect of the invention, heat sources near a well bearing being sensed, such as exhaust pipes, generators, and suspension components, may interfere with a temperature measurement of the bearing, possibly resulting in detecting an out of range temperature value for the bearing when in fact the bearing temperature is within a desired range. An improved train wheel bearing sensing system includes an IR radiation profile recognition process to identify a component of interest for a temperature measurement. The IR radiation profile recognition process correlates received IR energy to a known bearing configuration, and to filter out, for example, spurious or other IR energy not generated by the bearing configuration being sensed. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, memory <b>42</b> may be configured for storing a plurality of known radiation profiles or parameters indicative of radiation profiles for respective bearings or axle profiles that are expected to be sensed by the system <b>10</b>. The processor <b>40</b> may be configured for comparing IR data received from the sensors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and accessing the memory <b>42</b> to correlate received IR data to a known profile or parameters indicative of a known profile to determine if a received IR profile matches a known profile. For example, the processor <b>40</b> may use curve matching techniques to compare curved portions of a known profile to portions of received profile to determine if the received profile matches a known profile. In another aspect, digital signal processing techniques, such as a Fast Fourier Transform, may be performed on the received signal to compare transformed parameters to known parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an exemplary IR profile for a &#x201c;W&#x201d; type bearing heat signature. Known bearing profiles stored in memory <b>42</b> may be compared to the received profile <b>50</b> to verify that the received profile <b>50</b> is an accepted profile for making a bearing temperature measurement. Once a valid profile type is identified, the profile <b>50</b> may be checked to determine if it exceeds an alarm threshold <b>66</b>. Portions <b>63</b>, <b>64</b> of the received profile outside the window <b>51</b>, potentially indicative of other IR sources besides the bearing, may be disregard before making a comparison. If a received profile does not match a known profile, the measurement may be disregarded or flagged for further investigation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In another aspect of the invention, emission data received from each of the plurality of sensing elements <b>29</b> for the same bearing may be compared to each other to assess a validity of each of the IR profiles provided by the respective sensing elements <b>29</b>. For example, if one or more IR profiles received from sensing elements <b>29</b> of a sensor includes IR energy components in addition to IR energy from a sensed bearing, (such as IR energy radiated by a gearbox adjacent to the sensed bearing) the IR profiles including non-bearing components may be filtered out by using pattern recognition techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In yet another aspect of the invention, gradients <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> of a profile <b>50</b> may be measured to determine if an IR radiation measurement includes an IR component from another source. For example, brake disks positioned near wheel bearings are known to cause the gradients <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> a known IR profile <b>50</b> at the edges <b>74</b>, <b>76</b> of the evaluation window <b>51</b>, to be different than expected for the known profile. If one or more gradients <b>70</b>, <b>72</b> appear to be different than expected for a certain profile, then the received profile may be normalized to remove the effects of other IR components and matched to a known profile to make a bearing temperature determination.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref> illustrate exemplary conditions of a train wheel and the corresponding IR signal profiles that may be obtained from one embodiment of a train wheel bearing measurement system. For example, blockage of a portion of the wheel bearing and/or heat pipes and lubricant leakage may result in the IR profiles as shown in the IR output signal plot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, where each curve represents the output from a respective sensing element. Sun reflections and/or overheated outer disk brakes may result in the IR profiles as shown in the IR output signal plot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Flying sparks from sliding wheels may result in the IR profiles as shown in the IR output signal plot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. For an inner bearing, the gear box and retaining parts may interfere with the inner bearing measurement producing the IR profiles as shown in the IR output signal plot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Using the techniques described previously, such as windowing, peak detection, gradient detection, and pattern recognition, an actual bearing temperature may be extracted from the IR signal profiles.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In another aspect of the invention depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, specific portions of a bearing may be detected to analyze a heat signature for the bearing. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, specific bearing raceways, such as inner raceway <b>110</b> of an outer bearing <b>18</b>, may be targeted so that portions <b>33</b> of IR emissions corresponding to such components are received by a sensor for analysis. Heat profile information for the sensed portion may be used to pinpoint that portion of a bearing for inspection or repair. In yet another aspect of the invention, the information gathered via IR detection may be analyzed to implement impact and load detection, using for example, pattern recognition techniques of the received profiles <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In another aspect of the invention, information acquired using the system <b>10</b> may be combined with information from other sources to verify and enhance rail undercarriage component health condition analysis. For example, information collected by other sensors, such as a rail deflection sensor <b>41</b>, may be associated with corresponding IR emission information collected by the system <b>10</b> indicative of a hot bearing condition may be used to verify detection of the condition. The association may be performed in the processor <b>41</b> or at a remote location, such as in the monitor <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Based on the foregoing description, the methods described may be implemented using computer programming or engineering techniques including computer software, firmware, hardware or any combination or subset thereof, wherein the technical effect is to determine a condition of a rail vehicle undercarriage component exhibiting a scanned waveform signature corresponding to a type of the component in response to being scanned by a sensor. Any such resulting program, having computer-readable code means, may be embodied or provided within one or more computer-readable media, thereby making a computer program product, i.e., an article of manufacture, according to the invention. For example, computer readable media may contain program instructions for a computer program code for processing received imaging data indicative of images acquired in a vicinity of a locomotive. The computer readable media may also include a computer program code for processing received location data indicative of a geographic location of the locomotive when the images are being acquired. In addition, the computer readable media may include a computer program code for accessing a railroad landmark database comprising a plurality of railroad landmarks associated with respective geographic locations constituting landmark tags to correlate the landmark tags with the imaging data and the location data to generate landmark correlated image data.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The computer readable media may be, for example, a fixed (hard) drive, diskette, optical disk, magnetic tape, semiconductor memory such as read-only memory (ROM), etc., or any transmitting/receiving medium such as the Internet or other communication network or link. The article of manufacture containing the computer code may be made and/or used by executing the code directly from one medium, by copying the code from one medium to another medium, or by transmitting the code over a network.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the deformable element <b>96</b> comprises a tubular element, such as a spring, which is deformable, for example, in cross section from a circular cross section <b>98</b> to an oval cross section <b>100</b> (indicated by the solid line oval) biased against a force <b>102</b> applied via the cover attachment portion <b>92</b>. The suspension <b>88</b> may include a deformation limiting member <b>104</b>, for example, partially enclosing the deformable element <b>96</b> to limit an amount of deformation experienced by the deformable element <b>96</b>. In an embodiment, the deformation limiting member <b>104</b> may comprise a &#x201c;C&#x201d;-shaped cross sectional shaped member having a size selected to limit a deformation of the deformable element <b>96</b> to a desired amount. The deformable element <b>96</b> may be attached to the cover attachment portion <b>92</b>, the carrier portion <b>94</b>, or both portions <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> to allow movement of the portions <b>92</b>, <b>94</b> relative to one another.</p>
