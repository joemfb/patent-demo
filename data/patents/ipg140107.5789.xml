<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As the value and use of information continues to increase, individuals and businesses seek additional ways to process and store information. One option is an information handling system. An information handling system generally processes, compiles, stores, and/or communicates information or data for business, personal, or other purposes. Because technology and information handling needs and requirements can vary between different applications, information handling systems can also vary regarding what information is handled, how the information is handled, how much information is processed, stored, or communicated, and how quickly and efficiently the information can be processed, stored, or communicated. The variations in information handling systems allow for information handling systems to be general or configured for a specific user or specific use such as financial transaction processing, airline reservations, enterprise data storage, or global communications. In addition, information handling systems can include a variety of hardware and software components that can be configured to process, store, and communicate information and can include one or more computer systems, data storage systems, and networking systems.</p>

Additionally, the method can be embodied in various types of encoded logic including software, firmware, hardware, or other forms of digital storage mediums, computer readable mediums, or logic, or any combination thereof, operable to provide all, or portions, of the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The method begins generally at block <b>300</b>. At decision block <b>302</b>, a policy update can be received. In one form, the policy update can include a link policy that can include link rate values to operate one or more links. For example, one or references to data links, such as an EEE enabled links or other variable data rate links, can be included within the policy update to operate the one or more data links at one or more data rates. If at decision block <b>302</b>, a policy update may not be received, the method can proceed to decision block <b>308</b> as described below. If at decision block <b>302</b>, a policy update may be received, the method can proceed to block <b>304</b> and a stored policy can be accessed. In one form, a stored policy can be stored within a memory device or other form of data storage device. According to one aspect, a policy may be updated or provided for the first time and as such may not be currently stored and accessed. The method can then proceed to block <b>306</b> and the link policy can be updated. For example, a communication device can include a policy that includes various types of operating parameters to operate the device. As such, the policy can include a link policy information, parameters, values, or other types of information, to operate one or more data links of the communication device. In another form, the communication or other device can store a link policy separate from other policies as needed or desired.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Upon updating the link policy, the method can proceed to decision block <b>308</b> and determines whether to enable use of a link. If link should not be enabled, or operation modified, the method can proceed to block <b>302</b> as described above. If at decision block <b>308</b> a link should be enabled or operation should be modified, the method can proceed to block <b>310</b> and the current link data rate can be detected. For example, a current link data rate can be set to 10 Gbps or another value. The method can then proceed to block <b>312</b> and detects a current link use. For example, a link monitor can be used to detect the current utilization of a link, such as idle, 500 Kbps, 1 Gbps, 5 Gbps, etc. The method can then proceed to block <b>314</b>, and a link policy can be accessed, and to block <b>316</b> where a link data rate entry of the data link can be detected. For example, the link policy can include multiple entries to be used by multiple links. Upon detecting a link data rate entry to be used by the data link, the method can then proceed to block <b>318</b> and compares the link data rate entry to the current data rate. The method can then proceed to decision block <b>320</b>, determines if the current link rate should be updated. If the current link rate should not be updated, the method can proceed to block <b>330</b> and the current link rate can be maintained. The method can then proceed to block <b>328</b> as described below. If at decision block <b>320</b>, the current link rate should be updated, the method can proceed to block <b>322</b> and the updated link rate can be output to a link controller. In one embodiment, a link controller can include logic to alter a data rate of a link. In other forms, link control logic, located internal or external to a link controller can be used to alter a data rate of a link.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Upon outputting an updated link rate, the method can proceed to bloc <b>324</b> and the updated link rate can be received at the link controller. The method can then proceed to block <b>326</b> and the link rate can be altered using the updated link rate. The method can then proceed to block <b>328</b> and a link operating status can be output to a link monitor. The method can then proceed to block <b>302</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a functional block diagram of link management system illustrated generally at <b>400</b>. The link management system <b>400</b> can include a network communication device <b>402</b> including a link manager <b>404</b>. The network communication device can include various types or communication of network communication devices including a hub, router, switch, network interface controller, load balancer, failover device, a gateway, a firewall, or various other types of network communication devices that can couple multiple network links.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one form, the link manager <b>404</b> can include a link rate control module <b>406</b>, a link monitor <b>408</b>, and a link rate policy <b>410</b>. In one from, the link rate policy <b>410</b> can be updated using a link policy update module (not illustrated) employed by link manager <b>404</b>. The link manager <b>404</b> can be coupled to a first link rate control logic <b>412</b> using a first control interface <b>414</b>. The link manager <b>404</b> can also be coupled to a second link rate control logic <b>416</b> using a second control interface <b>418</b>. Various types of buses, communication links, control lines, etc. can be used by the first control interface <b>414</b> and the second control interface <b>418</b>, including, but not limited to PCI Express, Ethernet, or proprietary inter-device communication links.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to one aspect, the first link rate control logic <b>412</b> and the second link rate control logic <b>416</b> can be coupled to a switching module <b>430</b> operable to route data using a first group of switching links <b>428</b> and a second group of switching links <b>440</b>. Additionally, the first link rate control logic <b>412</b> and the second link rate control logic <b>416</b> can be coupled to multiple data communication lines using an EEE enabled communication ports to establish a communication link at a specific data rate. In one form, the first rate control logic <b>412</b> can be used to control a first network link <b>420</b>, a second network link <b>422</b>, a third network link <b>424</b>, an n<sup>th </sup>network link <b>426</b>, or any combination thereof. Additionally, the second rate control logic <b>416</b> can be used to control a fourth network link <b>432</b>, a fifth network link <b>434</b>, a sixth network link <b>436</b>, a second n<sup>th </sup>network link <b>438</b>, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">During operation, the link manager <b>404</b> can access the link rate policy <b>410</b> to determine a data rates to communication data using one or more of the network links. The link manager <b>404</b> can determine a number of links, and which links, may be coupled to the network communication device <b>402</b>. The link monitor <b>408</b> can further determine a data rate to use each of the network links, and can communicate a control signal to the first link rate control logic <b>412</b> and the second link rate control logic <b>416</b>, to establish a data rate of each of the links. In one form, the link rate policy <b>410</b> can include various data rate values based on a type of network connection, historical use of the network connection, current demands on the network connection or other network links, etc. Upon establishing a data rate to use at each of the links, the link monitor <b>408</b> can alter the link rate based on the network traffic at each network link. For example, the first link <b>420</b> can be set at a first data rate of 1 Gbps. As the link monitor <b>408</b> detects an increase in network traffic of the first link <b>420</b>, the link monitor <b>408</b> can access the link rate policy to determine whether to increase or decrease a data rate. For example, the data rate can be increased to 10 Gbps. As the link monitor <b>406</b> detects a decrease in network traffic of the first link <b>420</b>, the link manager <b>404</b> can access the link rate policy <b>410</b> and determine a reduced data rate to operate the first link <b>420</b>. For example, number of network packets per second can be detected at a first link <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In another form, the link monitor <b>408</b> can access network traffic via the network switch module <b>430</b>. For example, the network switch module <b>430</b> can couple network traffic received from the first link <b>420</b> to the fifth link <b>434</b>. Additionally, the first link <b>420</b> can be operated at a higher speed than the fifth link <b>434</b>. As such, the link monitor <b>404</b> can detect the difference in link speeds and can access the link rate policy <b>410</b> to determine an operating speed of the first link <b>420</b>. The link manager can then alter the operating speed of the fifth link <b>434</b> using the data rate of the first link <b>420</b>. In this manner, the fifth link <b>434</b> can be used in a lower data rate operation and can be altered in response to network traffic detected by the link manager <b>408</b>.</p>
