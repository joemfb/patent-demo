<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, there are shown diagrams illustrating the manufacturing using Laser-Heated Pedestal Growth (LHPG) method and the growing of crystal fiber, respectively, according to one preferred embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in these figures, the Ti-sapphire (Ti: Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) crystal fiber is fabricated mainly by LHPG method. Substantially, in a laser-heated device <b>10</b>, a first fixture <b>181</b> is used to clamp a Ti: sapphire single crystal rod <b>22</b>, and a second fixture <b>183</b> is used to clamp a matted crystal <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">After a laser beam <b>11</b> generated by CO<sub>2 </sub>laser is directed into the laser-heated device <b>10</b>, the collimated light beam may be converted into a ring light beam via a first conic mirror <b>121</b> and a second conic mirror <b>123</b>. Subsequently, the ring light beam may be in turn reflected onto a parabolic mirror <b>16</b> via a reflective mirror <b>14</b>, and then focused on the end face of the Ti: sapphire single crystal rod <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The end face of the Ti: sapphire single crystal rod <b>22</b> may be melted to form a melting regime <b>221</b> because it is heated by laser beam. At this moment, the matted crystal <b>24</b> is allowed to contact with the melting regime <b>221</b> and then pulled up slowly, while the Ti: sapphire single crystal rod <b>22</b> is pushed up more slowly. Thus, a crystal fiber <b>26</b> with the same crystal orientation as that of matted crystal <b>24</b> may be grown. Various ratios of diameter reduction may be achieved by the use of various speed ratios between the growing speed of matted crystal <b>24</b> and the speed of pushing single crystal rod <b>22</b>. For instance, if the speed ratio between the growing speed of matted crystal <b>24</b> and the speed of pushing single crystal rod <b>22</b> is 16:1, the diameter ratio between the grown crystal fiber <b>26</b> and the single crystal rod <b>22</b> is then 1:4.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A general single crystal rod cut from a Ti: sapphire single crystal block is a square bar of approximate 500 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;500 &#x3bc;m. The LHPG method may be performed two, three, or more times for growing, so as to obtain a crystal fiber of better quality and thinner diameter. For instance, the single crystal square bar is previously grown into a crystal fiber having a diameter in the range between 250 &#x3bc;m and 320 &#x3bc;m, followed by a subsequent growth which results in a reduced diameter in the range between 80 &#x3bc;m and 180 &#x3bc;m, and in turn a further growth which results in a reduced diameter of less than 50 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is shown a diagram illustrating annealing according to one embodiment of the present invention. In the Ti: sapphire crystal fiber, fluorescence is generated when Ti<sup>3+</sup> is pumped. During the process of growth with diameter reduction using the LHPG method, however, a part of Ti<sup>3+</sup> may be oxidized into Ti<sup>4+</sup> without fluorescence generated. Moreover, ions of Ti<sup>3+</sup> and Ti<sup>4+</sup> may be matched, leading to the absorption of a wide wave band centered at the wavelength of 800 nm, which is just coincided with fluorescent wave band, thus seriously affecting optical efficiency. Therefore, an annealing process for reducing Ti<sup>4+</sup> into Ti<sup>3+</sup> is necessary after the Ti: sapphire crystal fiber is grown with diameter reduction to be one having a predetermined diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this connection, this annealing process may be performed in a furnace. Namely, the Ti: sapphire crystal fiber is placed into the furnace with vacuum or filled with hydrogen and inert gas, and then annealed at high temperature in the range between 1600&#xb0; C. and 2000&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Also, the annealing process of the present invention may be performed by laser heating. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a capillary <b>34</b> with high softening point may be firstly placed into the Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>26</b>. Either a fused silica capillary with high softening point of 1600&#xb0; C., or a quartz capillary with higher softening point may be used. The capillary <b>34</b> with high softening point containing the Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>26</b> therein may be placed into the laser-heated device, with one end of the capillary <b>34</b> with high softening point being melted by laser heating to form a sealing <b>36</b>, and the other end thereof being either filled with the vacuum as indicated by an arrow <b>38</b>, or refilled with hydrogen and inert gas. The laser beam <b>11</b> is enabled to focus onto the Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>26</b>, so as to heat this Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>26</b> until the maximum temperature that the capillary with high softening point can withstand is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A slow motion of the Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>26</b> together with the capillary <b>34</b> with high softening point is allowed so as to anneal each part of the Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>26</b>. The circumstance for this annealing may be filled with the vacuum or a controlled anaerobic circumstance. Moreover, an annealed Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>32</b> is provided with more Ti<sup>3+</sup> by which strong wide band fluorescence may be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is shown a diagram illustrating the manufacturing of a single cladding of the present invention. The annealed Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>32</b> is placed into a glass capillary. This glass capillary may be selectively a borosilicate capillary <b>42</b> or made from other types of optical glass with softening point lower than 1000&#xb0; C. The borosilicate capillary <b>42</b> containing the annealed Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>32</b> may be placed into the laser-heated device, with one end of the borosilicate capillary <b>42</b> being heated by laser to form a sealing <b>46</b>, and the other end thereof being filled with the vacuum as indicated by an arrow <b>48</b>. The laser beam <b>11</b> is enabled to focus onto the annealed Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>32</b> for heating it until a temperature higher than the softening temperature of the borosilicate capillary <b>42</b> is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The softened borosilicate capillary <b>42</b> may be attached onto the annealed Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>32</b> owing to the pressure difference between its inner vacuum and outer pressure, in such a way a single cladding <b>44</b> may be formed. A slow motion of the annealed Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>32</b> together with the borosilicate capillary <b>42</b> may be enabled, so as to heat each part of the annealed Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>32</b> to be covered by the single cladding.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The refractive index of the core in the Ti: sapphire crystal fiber of the single cladding structure is greater than that of the cladding <b>44</b>. Thus, an optical waveguide structure may be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is shown a flow chart illustrating a manufacturing method of a single cladding crystal fiber of the present invention. As illustrated in this figure, the manufacturing method of the present invention comprises the steps follows. In step <b>501</b>, firstly, a Ti: sapphire single crystal rod is provided. The single crystal rod is grown with diameter reduction several times by means of LHPG method, in such a way that a Ti: sapphire crystal fiber having a predetermined diameter, such as 10 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m, for example, may be grown, as shown in step <b>503</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The annealing process for the Ti: sapphire crystal fiber having a predetermined diameter may be performed selectively by the furnace, and also by laser heating, as shown in step <b>505</b>. Subsequently, in step <b>507</b>, the annealed Ti: sapphire crystal fiber is placed into a glass capillary having an appropriate bore (for instance, 50 to 100 &#x3bc;m for the inner diameter, and 80 to 170 &#x3bc;m for the outer diameter).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Finally, in step <b>509</b>, the Ti: sapphire crystal fiber covered inside the glass capillary is grown into a single cladding Ti: sapphire crystal fiber by means of LHPG method. In this connection, a capillary of optical glass material having a softening temperature lower than 1000&#xb0; C., such as borosilicate capillary, for example, may be selected as this glass capillary.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is shown a diagram illustrating a wide band light source device according to one embodiment of the present invention. As illustrated in this figure, a wide band light source device <b>60</b> of the present invention comprises a single cladding Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>68</b> and a pumping light source <b>62</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this case, the pumping light source <b>62</b> is used for providing a pumping beam <b>621</b>. Preferably, the pumping light source <b>62</b> is a frequency-doubled laser having a wavelength of 532 nm, or a blue laser diode having a wavelength of 446 nm. It is preferable that a diameter of a core in the single cladding Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>68</b> is smaller than 50 &#x3bc;m, as mentioned above.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The wide band light source device <b>60</b> further comprises a focusing unit <b>661</b>, provided between the pumping light source <b>62</b> and the single cladding Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>68</b>, used for focusing the pumping beam <b>621</b> onto the core of the single cladding Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>68</b>. Ti<sup>3+</sup> of the core is capable of absorbing the pumping light and then emitting wide band fluorescence, which may be turned into self-amplified emission generated in the optical waveguide structure of the single cladding Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>68</b>, and finally radiated from the other end of the crystal fiber <b>68</b> as a wide band beam <b>681</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The wide band light source device <b>60</b> further comprises a first filter <b>641</b> provided at the other end of the crystal fiber <b>68</b>. The wide bade beam <b>681</b> may be utilized on condition that the remaining pumping light is filtered by the first filter <b>641</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Moreover, between the pumping light source <b>62</b> and the crystal fiber <b>68</b>, there is further provided with a second filter <b>643</b>, used for filtering unnecessary residual light at 808 nm and 1064 nm of the output of the frequency-doubled laser at 532 nm. Between the single cladding Ti: sapphire crystal fiber <b>68</b> and the first filter <b>641</b>, there is also additionally provided with a collimation unit <b>663</b>, used for collimating the wide band beam <b>681</b>, facilitating the use of the wide band beam <b>681</b> at the backend.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is shown a power diagram of a single cladding Ti: sapphire crystal fiber of the present invention. In the operation of the single cladding Ti: sapphire crystal fiber of the present invention, as illustrated in this figure, the output power of 213 &#x3bc;W may be obtained for the wide band beam when the absorption rate of the pumping light is 136 mW. In this case, the power conversion efficiency is approximately 1.5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, there is shown a frequency spectrum of the output of the single cladding Ti: sapphire crystal fiber of the present invention. For the single cladding Ti: sapphire crystal fiber of the present invention, there is generated fluorescence with a center wavelength of 759 nm, bandwidth (full width at half maximum or 3-dB bandwidth) of 181 nm, optical spectrum coverage over the wave band between 670 and 850 nm, and coherence length in air of 1.45 &#x3bc;m, as illustrated in this figure. The frequency spectrum is substantially distributed near infrared regime, just as the part being least absorbed by body tissues. Thus, it is suitable for the application for optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, in optical tomography, the vertical resolution up to 1.45 &#x3bc;m is achieved, while the strength distribution of measurement <b>82</b> of frequency spectrum shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is extremely close to the distribution of Gaussian fit <b>84</b>. This perfect Gaussian waveform may lead to extremely small side lobes of interference signal and an extremely little cross-talk of longitudinal image when this wide band light source is applied for optical tomography. Thereby, a three-dimensional image with high picture quality may be realized. Indeed, an excellent wide band light source is obtained.</p>
