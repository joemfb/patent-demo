<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates in general to DC-to-DC converter and in particular to a single-inductor-multiple-output switching regulator with low cross-regulation and extended driving capability.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Single-inductor-multiple-output (SIMO) DC-to-DC converter is an important component for portable electronic devices such as cell phone or personal digital assistant (PDA), which requires different supply voltages that are low cost, high efficiency and small in size. However, one major limitation of conventional SIMO converter is cross-regulation. In other words, the outputs of the converter cannot be regulated independently and any load change in one output will affect the others. This is more severe when a large change occurs to the load currents.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Among existing SIMO converter implementations, time-multiplexing control methods suffers from limited power capacity and cross-regulation during large load transient even operating in pseudo-continuous-conduction-mode (PCCM). The operation of this type of SIMO is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1(</figref><i>a</i>)-(<i>c</i>) as described in D. Ma et al., &#x201c;Single-inductor-multiple-output switching converters with time-multiplexing control in discontinuous conduction mode,&#x201d; IEEE J. of Solid-State Circuits, vol. 38, no. 1, pp. 89-100, 2003, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and for everything it describes therein. For small cross-regulation, if the given phase is unable to handle the required charge for the corresponding output and during load transient, the cross-regulation will become serious as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1(</figref><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It has been proposed to use comparator controlled output control to reduce cross-regulation by fast response of the comparator controlled output. The operation of this conventional technique is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>a</i>)-<b>2</b>(<i>c</i>), as further described in H. P. Le et al., &#x201c;A Single-Inductor Switching DC-DC Converter with 5 Outputs and Ordered Power-Distributive Control,&#x201d; IEEE Int. Solid-State Circuits Conf., pp. 534-620, 2007, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety and for everything it describes therein. However, the response time is limited by the last and additional pulse-width-modulated (PWM) controlled output stage, a larger cross-regulation is expected for large load current change as the regulation of the two outputs is not independent to each other, and the output might have a low accuracy due to the nature of the comparator control. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2(</figref><i>c</i>) shows the cross-regulation when there is a load change at the first output. In this situation, the last output stages receive no charge at several cycles. This problem becomes worse when the number of output stages increases and the PWM controlling the output stage cannot response promptly.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A charge-control technique with large power capacity operating in continuous-conduction-mode (CCM) is described in A. Pizzutelli et al., &#x201c;Novel control technique for single inductor multiple output converters operating in CCM with reduced cross-regulation,&#x201d; in IEEE Applied Power Electronics Conference and Exposition, pp. 1502-1507, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by references in its entirety and for everything it describes therein. This system has similar operation principle as the comparator-controlled output control. In there, the cross-regulation is still significant and the technique is only suitable for implementation in buck converter.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a single-inductor DC-to-DC switching regulator with multiple outputs regulated independently. The regulator can deliver large unbalanced currents through the sub-converters with minimized cross-regulation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to some embodiments of the present invention, a SIMO boost DC-to-DC converter with sequential-control is provided. Compared to conventional devices, the switching frequency of SIMO converter described herein can be automatically hopped to multiples fraction of the pre-defined frequency based on its load currents during load transient without using load current sensor. The switching cycle ends when energy transfer of all the outputs has been finished and a new switching cycle is triggered by the next coming fundamental clock signal. This frequency hopping control extends the maximum power capacity for a pre-defined switching frequency. Since the switching frequency is automatically hopped to 1/N of the fundamental switching frequency, the switching noise spectrum of the system can be predictable.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Minimized cross-regulation can be achieved due to the independently regulated outputs and the cross-regulation induced by frequency hopping can also be minimized by Constant-Charge-Auto-Hopping (CCAH) control which ensures to deliver a constant charge to the unchanged outputs during load transient. A frequency detection unit detects the frequency information of the presented converter, which is used to set the inductor current charging time (i.e., peak inductor current) to the required level in one switching cycle to realize constant-charge control.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This control technique can be extended to single-inductor multiple-input-multiple-output converter and can also be applied to buck, buck-boost, boost-buck and other different converter topologies.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a schematic diagram of a SIMO boost switching regulator <b>300</b> with sequential-control according to one embodiment of the invention. Regulator <b>300</b> includes a voltage source V<sub>g</sub>, an inductor L, a freewheel switch S<sub>f</sub>, a main switch S<sub>n</sub>, and a plurality of output switches S<sub>o1</sub>-S<sub>on</sub>. These switches include transistors such as the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). Each output circuit further includes an output capacitor, C<sub>out1</sub>-C<sub>outn</sub>, connected between the respective output terminal V<sub>out1</sub>-V<sub>out2 </sub>and a reference voltage (e.g., electrical ground). Each of the output switches S<sub>o1</sub>-S<sub>on</sub>, and the respective output capacitor C<sub>out1</sub>-C<sub>outn </sub>form a sub-converter.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Regulator <b>300</b> further includes an error amplifier and compensation network <b>308</b> to ensure system stability through a feedback mechanism with high accuracy. According to one embodiment, the compensation network for each sub-converter includes a single capacitor connected between the error-amplifier output and a reference voltage to achieve dominant-pole compensation. Alternatively, the compensation network includes one or more resistors and one or more capacitors for pole-zero cancellation.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Regulator <b>300</b> further includes a logic unit <b>302</b> for controlling the switches according to a clock signal generated by a pulse-width modulation (PWM) generator <b>306</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts one embodiment of logic unit <b>302</b> with a standard level shifter and buffer <b>1002</b>. Logic unit <b>302</b> is further discussed hereinafter in keeping with the operations of regulator <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, a frequency detection unit (FDU) <b>304</b> is used to detect the switching frequency of the system. An embodiment of FDU <b>304</b> with a ramp generator is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, FDU <b>304</b> can be simply implemented by a digital counter <b>1102</b>. The Vclk signal with the switching frequency information generated from the logic unit <b>302</b> and the OSC signal with the fundamental switching frequency information generated from clock generator <b>310</b> are input to digital counter <b>1102</b>. Digital counter <b>1102</b> calculates the frequency relationship of the Vclk and OSC signals and output the calculated value, N[1:m], where m is an integer here. This value N[1:m] is used to control the predefined current paths I<b>1</b>-Im in ramp generator <b>1104</b>. The predefined currents I<b>1</b>-Im carry different current levels with I<b>1</b>&#x3e;I<b>2</b>&#x3e; . . . &#x3e;Im.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a further embodiment, N[1:m] is equal to f<sub>osc</sub>/f<sub>Vclk</sub>, where f<sub>osc </sub>is the frequency of the OSC signal and f<sub>Vclk </sub>is the frequency of the Vclk signal. Specifically, when f<sub>osc </sub>is equal to f<sub>Vclk</sub>, N[1:m]=1; when f<sub>osc </sub>is equal to two times of f<sub>Vclk</sub>, N[1:m]=2; when f<sub>osc </sub>is equal to m times of f<sub>Vclk</sub>, N[1:m]=m. The predefined current in ramp generator <b>1104</b> can be selected by N[1:m] returned from FDU <b>304</b>. By keeping the capacitor C and the ramp reference Vref constant, the slope of the ramp signal Vramp and the time for the Vramp cut the Vref will change correspondingly to the currents I<b>1</b>-Im. When N[1:m] is equal to any of 1&#x2212;m, the ramp charging time is equal to respective t<b>1</b>, t<b>2</b>, or tm, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. This time is used to control the inductor peak current as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Then, the inductor peak current is set to the required level in one switching cycle with fixed reference voltages Vref. Here, Vref can be a predefined voltage or the output voltage of the error amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The peak inductor current is then set to the required level in one switching period and the output voltage of error amplifier <b>308</b> is kept unchanged. The output signal from PWM generator <b>306</b> can be adjusted accordingly based on the information of the switching frequency so as to minimize the cross-regulation of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each output switch (i.e., S<sub>o1</sub>-S<sub>on</sub>) includes a zero current detection (ZCD) which provides a discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operation to block the negative current flow through the PMOSs switches and to isolate the control circuitry of the sub-converters.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A clock generator <b>310</b> is used to generate the fundamental switching frequency (f<sub>D</sub>) for system <b>300</b>. High voltage selector logic <b>302</b> selects the highest voltage from V<sub>g</sub>, V<sub>out1</sub>, V<sub>out2</sub>, to V<sub>outn </sub>to power the substrate of the PMOS (VB). A buffer, which is part of logic circuit <b>302</b>, and a current sensor <b>312</b> are used to detect the peak inductor current for protection. The logic and buffer control circuit <b>302</b> generates proper gate driver voltages for the switches.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The operation principle of switching regulator <b>300</b> is explained as follows. In general, energy transfer from inductor L to an output is started after the energy transfer to a previous output is completed. Switch S<sub>f </sub>is used for suppressing the inductor ringing due to resonance during the free-wheeling period, where conductor L is not connected to any of the outputs. The size of switch S<sub>f </sub>is sufficient to allow a very small amount of current flow through switch S<sub>f </sub>in this period.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to a further embodiment of the present invention, the output signals V<sub>out1</sub>-V<sub>outn </sub>are regulated independently through controlling main switch S<sub>n</sub>, and output switches S<sub>o1</sub>-S<sub>on</sub>. The operation of this control mechanism is further explained with reference to the timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In particular, when main switch S<sub>n </sub>is turned on (i.e., closed) by the control signal from logic unit <b>302</b>, the inductor current I<sub>L </sub>increases with a slope of V<sub>g</sub>/L. When I<sub>L </sub>reaches a current level I<sub>pk1 </sub>determined by error amplifier and compensation network <b>308</b>, main switch S<sub>n </sub>is turned off and output switch S<sub>o1 </sub>corresponding to the first output signal V<sub>out1 </sub>is turned on. Then I<sub>L </sub>starts to decrease with a slope of (V<sub>out1</sub>&#x2212;V<sub>g</sub>)/L, transferring the accumulated energy from inductor L to the output V<sub>out1</sub>. As soon as logic unit <b>302</b> detects the inductor load current I<sub>L </sub>decreases to zero, output switch S<sub>o1 </sub>is turned off and main switch S<sub>n</sub>, is turned on again, causing the inductor load current start to increase again with a slope of V<sub>g</sub>/L. When inductor load current I<sub>L </sub>reaches a current level I<sub>pk2 </sub>determined by error amplifier and compensation network <b>308</b>, main switch S<sub>n</sub>, is turned off and output switch S<sub>o2 </sub>is turned on. Then inductor load current I<sub>L </sub>starts to decrease with a slope of (V<sub>out2</sub>&#x2212;V<sub>g</sub>)/L, as the accumulated energy is transferred from inductor L to output V<sub>out2</sub>. As soon as inductor load current I<sub>L </sub>decreases to zero, output switch S<sub>o2 </sub>is turned off and main switch S<sub>n </sub>is turned on again. This sequential-control process is continued till energy is transferred to the last output stage V<sub>outn</sub>. After that, main switch S<sub>n </sub>and output swishes S<sub>o1</sub>-S<sub>on </sub>are turn off and switch S<sub>f </sub>is turned on until the end of the switching cycle so as to suppress the inductor ringing.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, logic unit <b>302</b> includes proper logic used to control the operation sequence of converter <b>300</b>. A D-flip-flop chain <b>1004</b> with D-flip-flop buffers (<b>1004</b>-<i>sna</i>, <b>1004</b>-<i>snb</i>, <b>1004</b>-<i>so</i><b>1</b>, . . . , <b>1004</b>-<i>son</i>, and <b>1004</b>-<i>sf</i>) used to generate the driver signals for various switches, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The D-flip-flops in D-flip-flop chain <b>1004</b> are used to control the turn-off and turn-on of the switches S<sub>n</sub>, S<sub>o1</sub>-S<sub>on</sub>, and S<sub>f</sub>, respectively. The D-flip-flops, <b>1004</b>-<i>sna </i>and <b>1004</b>-<i>snb</i>, for controlling the S<sub>n </sub>are reset by inductor peak current signal. The D-flip-flops, <b>1004</b>-<i>so</i><b>1</b>, . . . , <b>1004</b>-<i>son</i>, for controlling switches S<sub>o1 </sub>to S<sub>on </sub>are reset by the inductor zero current signal. The start of one switching period is triggered by the internal clock signal, OSC. The inductor peak current signal is generated when inductor current increases to a peak value determined by the error amplifier and compensation network <b>308</b>. Then, S<sub>n </sub>is turned off and S<sub>o1 </sub>is turned on. The inductor current then decreases until it is equal to zero. The inductor zero current signal is generated by the zero current detection (ZCD). Switch S<sub>o1 </sub>is then turned off and switch S<sub>n </sub>is turned on for the next output, V<sub>out2</sub>. The inductor current increases again and reaches another peak level for the second output V<sub>out2 </sub>determined by the error amplifier and compensation network <b>308</b>. This inductor peak current signal resets one D-flip-flop, so that switch S<sub>n</sub>, is turned off and S<sub>o2 </sub>is turned on. The operation repeats and the switches S<sub>n </sub>and S<sub>oi</sub>, i=1, 2, . . . , n, are turned on and off in sequence until S<sub>on </sub>is turned off when the inductor current drops to zero. The next switching cycle is started. The sequential-control is achieved by this simple logic. Based on this sequential control, the switch is turned on only after the previous switch is turned off, dead-time is realized to prevent shoot-through current from appearing in any synchronous switching converters.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Based on previous discussion, one still in the art would appreciate that this sequential-control method is particularly beneficial for multiple outputs converter having large or unbalanced loads as further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Specifically, the load current of inductor L corresponding to each output V<sub>out1</sub>-V<sub>outn </sub>can be set flexibly through logic unit <b>302</b> and error amplifier and compensation network <b>308</b>. At the same time, system <b>300</b> can maintain a total maximum power capacity, which is the sum of the output power at V<sub>out1</sub>-V<sub>outn</sub>, for a particular pre-defined switching frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> further shows the CCAH control to extend the power capacity of system <b>300</b>. When the total time required to complete one cycle of energy transfer from the voltage source V<sub>g </sub>to all of the outputs V<sub>out1</sub>-V<sub>outn </sub>is longer than one fundamental period T, the switching period is automatically extended to 2T, 3T, etc., depending on the total current load. Accordingly, the switching frequency is automatically hopped to 1/N of the fundamental switching frequency, where the switching noise spectrum of the system can be predictable. Here, N is an integer. This CCAH control is very easy to realize in system <b>300</b> because no fixed time slot is assigned to each output V<sub>out1</sub>-V<sub>outn</sub>. The power capacity of system <b>300</b> can be substantially extended. During load transient, system <b>300</b> not only chooses the required switching frequency based on the total load current but also ensure to a regulated voltage delivered to the output terminal, so as to minimize cross-regulation of the converter during frequency hopping.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, when there is a frequency hopping induced by the load transient at one output, for example, V<sub>out1</sub>, in order to maintain the unchanged charge delivered to the other outputs, logic unit <b>302</b> immediately changes the inductor peak current for other outputs V<sub>out2</sub>-V<sub>outn</sub>. Accordingly, in order to achieve a constant charge delivery to the other outputs, the transition current levels of the other outputs are change from I<sub>pk2 </sub>to I<sub>pk2</sub>&#x2032;, I<sub>pk3 </sub>to I<sub>pk3</sub>&#x2032;, etc. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>b</i>) illustrates frequency hopping when the switching period is adjusted to 2T, where the peak value I<sub>pk2</sub>&#x2032; of the load current corresponding to the second output V<sub>out2 </sub>doubles the peak current of I<sub>pk2 </sub>of the load current corresponding the second output when system <b>300</b> operates under fundamental frequency. Similar adjustments can be performed the load current when the switching period is larger than 2T as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7(</figref><i>c</i>). This system <b>300</b> not only minimizes the cross-regulation at the outputs, but also enables a fast transient response as the peak inductor current (I<sub>pk1</sub>) based on the load information.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a schematic diagram of a single-inductor-double-output boost DC-to-DC converter <b>800</b> in accordance to another embodiment. The main switch includes a NMOS M<sub>n</sub>, output switch <b>1</b> includes a PMOS Mpa, and output switch <b>2</b> includes a PMOS Mpb. Each of Zero Current Detector (ZCD) <b>811</b>A and <b>811</b>B includes a topology implemented according to an active diode technique as well known in the art. For the discontinuous-conduction-mode (DCM) operation, ZCD <b>811</b>A and <b>811</b>B can block the negative current flow through bidirectional switches Mpa and Mpb, and isolate the control circuitry of sub-converters A and B. A clock generator is used to generate the fundamental switching frequency (f<sub>D</sub>) for system <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Similar to system <b>300</b>, the change of the switching frequency is detected by frequency detection unit (FDU) <b>806</b>, which then controls the voltage-to-current converter (V-I<sub>a </sub>and V-I<sub>b</sub>) for minimizing the cross-regulation. A high voltage selector <b>802</b> is used to select the highest voltage from Vg, Voa and Vob to power the substrate of the PMOS switches including M<sub>pa</sub>, M<sub>pb </sub>and M<sub>f</sub>. A current sensor <b>810</b> is used to detect the peak inductor current. Logic and buffer control circuit <b>804</b> generates the proper gate driver voltages for the switches.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In system <b>800</b>, one method to adjust the charging time of inductor current includes controlling the output voltage of the error amplifiers (EAs) EA<sub>a </sub>and EA<sub>b</sub>, which are used to generate the ramp signal through V-I converters. Since a compensation network exists at the output of the EAs, it is difficult to directly increase or decrease its value expeditiously (such as in one switching cycle). An alternate method includes adjusting the current in the V-I converters, which is much easier to implement. The switching frequency information generated from FDU <b>806</b> is used to control the charging or discharging of the current in the V-I converters. Therefore, the inductor load current charging time (i.e., peak inductor current) will be set to the required level in one switching cycle with fixed reference voltages Vdca and Vdcb. FDU <b>806</b> can be simply implemented by a counter where the Vclk signal generated from the gate driver voltage of the main switch Mn carriers the information of switching period Ts.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The principle of the present invention can be implemented in various SIMO and single-inductor multiple-input-multiple-output (SI-MIMO) switching regulators as well. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicted an exemplary embodiment of an SI-MIMO boost converter. Rearranging or add adding switches to the power stage can achieve other kinds of regulators such as buck converter, buck-boost converter, boost-buck converter, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, output signals V<sub>out1</sub>-V<sub>outn </sub>are regulated independently through controlling input switches V<sub>g1</sub>-V<sub>gn</sub>, main switch S<sub>n </sub>and output switches S<sub>o1</sub>-S<sub>on</sub>. When input switch S<sub>i1 </sub>is selected and turned on with main switch S<sub>n </sub>by control signals from logic unit <b>902</b>, the inductor L starts to accumulate energy from the selected input, when the inductor L gets proper charges determined by error amplifier and compensation network <b>908</b>, main switch S<sub>n </sub>is turned off and output switch S<sub>o1 </sub>corresponding to the first output signal V<sub>out1 </sub>is turned on. Then inductor L starts to transfer the accumulated energy to the output V<sub>out1</sub>. As soon as logic unit <b>902</b> detects the inductor load current I<sub>L </sub>decreases to zero, output switch S<sub>o1 </sub>is turned off and main switch S<sub>n </sub>is turned on again to accumulate charge, this process proceeds until the last output stage V<sub>outn </sub>gets its energy. After than, main switch S<sub>n </sub>and output swishes S<sub>o1</sub>-S<sub>on </sub>are turn off and switch S<sub>f </sub>is turned on until the end of the switching cycle so as to suppress the inductor ringing.</p>
