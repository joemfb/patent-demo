<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to European Patent Application No. 10251282.9, filed Jul. 16, 2010 and PCT/US2011/003463, filed Jul. 12, 2011.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a safety device, and more particularly a safety device in the form of an inflatable element provided in a motor vehicle such as a passenger car in order to afford protection for an occupant of the vehicle.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It has previously been proposed to provide an inflatable element or air bag in a motor vehicle in a position such that in the event of an accident involving a side impact or a roll-over incident, the inflated element is inflated so as to become disposed between the side of the vehicle and the head of a vehicle occupant in order to protect against the occupant's head coming into contact with or passing through a window in the side of the vehicle. Inflatable elements of this type are generally known as &#x201c;inflatable curtains&#x201d; or &#x201c;side curtain airbags&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been proposed to divide the inflatable element into a plurality of interconnected &#x201c;cells&#x201d; by forming the element from two woven layers of fabric with selected regions of the two fabric layers being woven together by a so-called one-piece weaving technique in order to interconnect the two layers and thereby define the periphery of each of the cells. The interwoven regions which define the periphery of each of the cells may be relatively large, thereby reducing the overall volume of the inflatable cells and the volume of gas which is required to inflate the element such that the element may be inflated more quickly. Dividing these inflatable elements into a plurality of cells prevents the element from &#x201c;ballooning&#x201d; when inflated, thereby enabling the inflated shape of the element to be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, dividing the inflatable element into a plurality of cells by weaving together the two layers of fabric which form the element in selected regions also has certain disadvantages. It is not as easy to control the inflation of a large number of small cells as it is to control the inflation of one or two larger chambers. Thus, whilst the volume of gas required to inflate the element may be reduced, the regions where the two layers of fabric are woven together present obstructions to the natural flow of inflation gas into the inflatable element during inflation and these interwoven regions may therefore impede the inflating flow of gas and result in the element inflating in a manner which is not exactly as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to address these problems it has therefore been proposed to prevent ballooning and to control the inflated shape of such inflatable elements by means other than dividing them into cells by a one-piece weaving technique. One such proposal is to use a so-called &#x201c;tether weave&#x201d; to provide a number of discrete tethers between the two opposed layers of fabric defining the inflatable element. An arrangement of this type is proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,296,276 in which internal tethers are defined within the inflatable element by threads which form an integral part of the weave of the fabric layers. Such a tether is defined by threads which depart from the weave of one of the two layers of fabric and extend towards and into the weave of the other layer of fabric at discrete points. The resulting inflatable element has a more open internal structure than the one-piece-woven multiple-cell type, with the threads serving as tethers between the two layers of fabric to prevent ballooning but without representing significant obstacles to the flow of inflating gas. However, it has been found that conventional &#x201c;tether weave&#x201d; arrangements of the type described above have their own problems. One such problem is that as the two fabric layers move apart from one another during inflation of the inflatable element, the threads defining the tethers are pulled through the weave of the two layers, thereby causing the inflatable element to contract in a longitudinal direction compared to its flat uninflected condition. In the case of a typical inflatable curtain arrangement, this contraction can be of the order of 25% of the uninflated length of the curtain. This is a problem which is more significant for tether weave arrangements than one-piece woven arrangements. For example, a conventional inflatable curtain of a one-piece woven construction for a motor car might contract in length by approximately 96 mm as it inflates, whereas a comparable curtain of conventional tether weave construction can contract by as much as 135 mm. As will be appreciated, this can significantly affect the coverage of the inflated curtain and hence its effectiveness.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the accompanying drawings, a safety device is illustrated which is intended to provide protection for an occupant <b>1</b> of a front seat <b>2</b> in a motor vehicle. In a frontal impact in which the vehicle is caused to decelerate rapidly, the occupant <b>1</b> will tend to move forwardly relative to the vehicle towards the steering wheel <b>3</b>, but will be restrained by a conventional seat-belt and airbag. In the case of a side impact or roll-over incident, however, there is a risk that the head of the occupant <b>1</b> will strike the side of the vehicle and in particular the front side window <b>4</b>, or that the head of the occupant <b>1</b> will strike the B-pillar <b>5</b> of the vehicle. There is also a risk that if the side window <b>4</b> breaks, the head of the occupant <b>1</b> may be thrown out of the window aperture, especially in the case of a roll-over incident.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The safety device is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in an operative, deployed condition in which an inflatable element <b>6</b> is positioned between the head of the occupant and the side of the vehicle. Prior to deployment of the safety device, the inflatable element <b>6</b> is retained in a recess <b>7</b> provided in the roof lining of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The safety device comprises the inflatable element <b>6</b>, a gas generator <b>8</b> which is fluidly connected to the inflatable element <b>6</b> by a hose or duct <b>9</b>, and a sensor (not shown) which is configured to sense the occurrence or likely occurrence of a side impact or roll-over situation and which serves to activate the gas generator <b>8</b> in order to supply a large volume of inflating gas to the inflatable element <b>6</b>. The inflatable element <b>6</b> is formed from two opposed layers of fabric <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> which are interwoven at predetermined regions so as to form the periphery of the bag or enclosure constituting the inflatable element. Thus, the inflatable element <b>6</b> may be regarded has having a front part and rear part, each being formed from a woven layer of fabric. A technique for making an inflatable element <b>6</b> of interwoven fabric is described in more detail in International Patent Publication WO90/09295.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It will be appreciated that the upper edge of the inflatable element <b>6</b> is fixed to part of the roof of the vehicle and that it extends, when in the inflated condition as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, downwardly from the roof line so as to be positioned between the head of the occupant <b>1</b> and the side of the vehicle. The inflatable element <b>6</b> is relatively thin the lateral direction, that is to say in a direction extending into the plane of the drawing of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and may have a thickness of approximately 30 to 40 mm in that direction.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">It will be noted that the inflatable element <b>6</b> of the device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> extends rearwardly from the A-post <b>12</b> of the vehicle to a position slightly to the rear of the B-post <b>5</b> so that, when in the deployed configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the safety device affords protection against the head of the front-seat occupant <b>1</b> striking the front side window <b>4</b> and/or the B-pillar <b>5</b>. However, it is to be appreciated that embodiments of the invention are also envisaged in which the inflatable element extends rearwardly from the A-pillar <b>12</b> past the B-pillar and the rear side window <b>13</b> and all the way to the C-pillar <b>14</b>, in order also to afford protection against the head of a rear seat occupant (not shown) striking the rear side window <b>13</b> and/or the C-pillar <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In order to prevent the inflatable element <b>6</b> from ballooning upon inflation, the two opposed layers of fabric <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> which form in the inflatable element are interconnected at selected positions <b>15</b> by way of tethers formed internally of the inflatable element. The construction of the tethers will be described in more detail below, but it can be seen from the location of the exemplary selected positions <b>15</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, that whilst the tethers interconnect the opposed layers of fabric <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>, they do not serve to partition individual cells within the inflatable element. The locations of the tether positions <b>15</b> allow the inflatable element <b>6</b> to retain an open internal structure whilst still preventing ballooning by defining regions in which the two layers of fabric <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> are tethered to one another. In an accident situation, such as a side impact, the gas generator <b>8</b> is activated and gas from the generator inflates the inflatable element <b>6</b>, which moves from its initial stored position within the recess <b>7</b> to the inflated or operative condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The open internal structure of the inflatable element <b>6</b> provided by the tethers (described in more detail below) at positions <b>15</b> permits gas to flow rapidly and easily into all regions of the inflatable element <b>6</b>, whilst the tethers prevent excessive movement of the two fabric layers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> apart from one another which would result in ballooning.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Turning now to consider <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, it will be noted that the two layers of fabric <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> are each woven from warp yarns <b>16</b> and weft yarns <b>17</b> in a generally conventional manner. However, at selected positions throughout the layers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b>, additional tether yarns <b>18</b> are also woven into the weave of the fabric, as illustrated most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> but also shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The tether yarns <b>18</b> are woven so as to extend substantially parallel with the weft yarns <b>17</b> of the fabric, and pass over and under successive warp yarns <b>16</b>. The tether yarns <b>18</b> have a different construction to the warp and weft yarns <b>16</b> and <b>17</b> of the fabric layers, as will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the region of the predetermined tether positions <b>15</b>, the tether yarns <b>18</b> pass out of the respective fabric layer <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in which they are woven and extend towards the opposing layer <b>11</b> and <b>10</b>. In the particular embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the tether yarns <b>18</b> each actually extend into the opposing fabric layer <b>11</b> and <b>10</b> and are woven integrally with it. As will thus be noted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the tether yarns <b>18</b> are arranged to cross one another at the tether position <b>15</b>, passing out of one fabric layer <b>10</b>, <b>11</b> and extending into the other fabric layer <b>11</b> and <b>10</b>. The tether yarns <b>18</b> thus cooperate to define a tether <b>19</b> which serves to interconnect the two fabric layers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> within the inflatable element <b>6</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each tether <b>19</b> may be defined by a plurality of tether yarns <b>18</b>; in this case two pairs of crossing tether yarns <b>18</b>. It is also to be noted that the tether <b>19</b> represents a somewhat loose collection of tether yarns <b>18</b> rather than a group of tightly bound or woven tether yarns.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the two fabric layers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> located generally adjacent one another, as would be the situation in the uninflated condition of the inflatable element <b>6</b>. As will be noted, the tether yarns <b>18</b> thus cooperate to resist further movement of the two layers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> apart from one another.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The construction of the tether yarns <b>18</b> is an important aspect of the present invention, and will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each tether yarn <b>18</b> takes the form of a composite yarn comprising a relatively weak core thread <b>20</b> over which is provided a relatively strong outer thread <b>21</b>. More particularly, the core thread <b>20</b> is formed as a twisted or textured thread and the outer thread <b>21</b> is twisted around and over the core thread <b>20</b> in an overfeed manner so as to form a plurality of twists or ravels <b>22</b> along the length of the core thread <b>20</b>. Thus, for any given length of the composite tether yarn <b>18</b>, the outer thread <b>21</b> is substantially longer than the core thread <b>20</b>, and is initially bunched up along the core thread in twists or ravels <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The outer thread <b>21</b> is furthermore configured so as to have a higher breaking strength in tension than the core thread <b>20</b>. More particularly, the outer thread <b>21</b> is sufficiently strong not to break during inflation of the inflatable element <b>6</b>, whilst the core thread is actually configured to break upon the application of tension as the inflatable element <b>6</b> is inflated and hence as the two fabric layers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> are driven further apart from the initial condition illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> illustrate the behaviour of the tether yarns <b>18</b> during inflation of the inflatable element. Having particular regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it can be seen that as the inflatable element increases in lateral thickness under inflation, the two layers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> will be driven apart. Initially, movement of the layers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> in this way will be resisted by the core threads <b>20</b> of the tether yarns, but as inflation continues a point is reached at which the strength of the core threads <b>20</b> is overcome by the internal pressure of the inflating gas within the inflatable element. At this point the core threads <b>20</b> will break, as illustrated at <b>23</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, whereupon the tether yarns <b>18</b> rapidly increase in length as the longer outer threads <b>21</b> unravel along the region of the tether yarns extending between the two fabric layers to take up the slack in the tether yarns <b>18</b>. The longer outer threads <b>21</b> will eventually be drawn taut so as to define a limit to the movement of the fabric layers apart from one another, thereby preventing ballooning of the inflatable element <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As will be appreciated, the composite construction of the tether yarns <b>18</b> makes them extendible in length, thereby preventing the regions of the tether yarns which are woven into the weave of the two fabric layers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> from being pulled through the fabric layers, which would result in longitudinal contraction of the fabric layers. The composite tether yarns <b>18</b> of the invention thus offer significant advantages over previously proposed &#x201c;tether weave&#x201d; arrangements because they allow a reduction in the amount of longitudinal contraction of the inflatable element which occurs as it increases in lateral thickness during inflation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As will be appreciated, the relative lengths of the core threads <b>20</b> and the outer threads <b>21</b> are largely dependent upon the actual dimensions and configuration of the inflatable element. However, it is proposed that for inflatable elements provided in the form of so-called &#x201c;inflatable curtains&#x201d; for side-impact or roll-over protection, the outer threads <b>21</b> will be applied to the core threads <b>21</b> with an overfeed (increase in length) of at least 20% (compared with the core threads), and most preferably 25%.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It is also proposed that the difference in strength between the core threads <b>20</b> and the outer threads <b>21</b> of each tether yarn <b>18</b> will be achieved by configuring the outer threads <b>21</b> to have a higher linear mass density than the core threads <b>20</b>. For example, the outer threads <b>21</b> preferably have a linear mass density which is at least 4 times that of the core threads. More particularly, it is proposed that the core thread of each tether yarn will have a linear mass density in the range 80-110 detx, whilst the outer thread will have a linear mass density in the range 450-500 detx, and preferably approximately 470 detx.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is to be appreciated that whilst the invention has been described above with specific reference to an embodiment in which tether yarns <b>18</b> are grouped together to define discrete tethers <b>19</b> at selected positions <b>15</b> within the inflatable element, other arrangements are also possible without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, it is envisaged that a plurality of tether yarns <b>18</b> could be provided, each extending between the two fabric layers <b>10</b> and <b>11</b> at regularly spaced-apart, or random, or quasi-random positions throughout the inflatable element.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Furthermore, whilst the invention has been described above with particular reference to inflatable elements in the form of so-called &#x201c;inflatable curtains&#x201d; arranged for deployment between the head of a vehicle occupant and the side of the vehicle, it is to be noted that the invention could also find application in safety devices comprising other forms of inflatable element. For example, it is envisaged that the present invention could also be provided as part of an inflatable airbag intended for deployment elsewhere in or on a motor vehicle such as a frontal airbag or a knee airbag or the like, or even externally arranged pedestrian protection airbags. The invention is not restricted to so-called inflatable curtain arrangements.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">While the above description constitutes the preferred embodiment of the present invention, it will be appreciated that the invention is susceptible modification, variation and change without departing from the proper scope and fair meaning of the accompanying claims.</p>
