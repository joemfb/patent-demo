<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The disclosure of Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-261257 filed on Nov. 24, 2010, including specification, drawings and claims is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a wire harness including a bent portion formed into a bent shape corresponding to a bent shape of a wire harness arrangement path on a vehicle body panel.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a wire harness according to the related art. A wire harness <b>111</b> is arranged in a wire harness arrangement path set on a vehicle body panel <b>111</b> of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The vehicle body panel <b>111</b> of the illustrated example has an edge portion <b>112</b> having a substantially L shape. The edge portion <b>112</b> includes a burr or the like that may cause damage to wires when it is in contact with the wires in, e.g., a welding portion between the edge portion <b>112</b> and a metal plate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The wire harness arrangement path is set in a substantially L shape on the vehicle body panel <b>111</b> around an outer side of the edge portion <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The wire harness <b>101</b> has a bent portion <b>102</b> formed around an outer side of a corner portion of the L-shaped edge portion <b>112</b>. The wire harness <b>101</b> is held by clamp members <b>121</b> that fix at least both ends of the bent portion <b>102</b> to the vehicle body panel <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the wire harness <b>101</b> according to the related art, insulated wires using a stranded conductor may be employed as a plurality of insulated wires constituting the wire harness. This is because the insulated wires using a stranded conductor have excellent flexibility compared to insulated wires using a single-wire conductor so that the wire harness can be easily bent in the wire shape corresponding to, e.g., a bent shape of the wire harness arrangement path.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in the wire harness <b>101</b> according to the related art, the bent portion <b>102</b> is covered with a protection member <b>131</b> in order to maintain the bent shape.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a specific shape of the protection member <b>131</b>. The protection member <b>131</b> disclosed in Patent Document 1 is a spiral tube wound on an outer periphery of a wire bundle <b>103</b> constituting the wire harness.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Both ends of the protection member <b>131</b> mounted on the bent portion <b>102</b> are fixed to the wire bundle by adhesive tapes <b>123</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, there has been proposed a wire harness using a cylindrical protector as the protection member <b>131</b> (see, e.g., Patent Document 2).
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0012">Patent Document 1: JP-A-2001-239900</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0013">Patent Document 2: JP-A-7-143647</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">However, in the technologies disclosed in Patent Documents 1 and 2, the spiral tube or protector covering the wire bundle <b>103</b> caused a problem such as the large size and heavy weight of the wire harness.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">Further, one having appropriate flexibility is employed as the wire bundle <b>103</b> in order to facilitate an operation of bending the wire harness to correspond to the bent shape of the wire harness arrangement path. Accordingly, if an installation distance between the clamp members <b>121</b> on which the wire harness is suspended is large, the wire bundle may be bent and interfere with the vehicle body panel due to vibration or the like when driving a vehicle, thereby causing a problem such as occurrence of unusual sound or damage.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a wire harness capable of achieving the small size and light weight of the wire harness by reducing the number of components, and preventing occurrence of unusual sound or damage of wires constituting the wire harness due to interference between the wires and a vehicle body panel.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">The object of the present invention can be achieved by the following configurations of (1) to (4).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">(1) A wire harness, comprising: a bent portion which is formed into a bent shape corresponding to a bent shape of a wire harness arrangement path on a vehicle body panel, wherein an insulating coating of a plurality of wires constituting the bent portion or at least one of the wires has such a flexural rigidity that the bent portion has a rigidity for maintaining the bent shape thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">(2) The wire harness according to (1), wherein a conductor of the at least one of the wires constituting the bent portion is a single-wire conductor, and wherein the single-wire conductor has such a flexural rigidity that the bent portion has the rigidity for maintaining the bent shape thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">(3) The wire harness according to (1), wherein the wires constituting the bent portion is a flat circuit, wherein the flat circuit includes: an insulation sheet film integrally formed into a bent shape corresponding to the bent shape of the wire harness arrangement path; and a plurality of conductors formed on the insulation sheet film, and wherein the insulation sheet film has such a flexural rigidity that the bent portion has the rigidity for maintaining the bent shape thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">(4) The wire harness according to claim <b>1</b>, wherein a bending radius of a wire at an inner peripheral side of the bent portion is greater than a bending radius of a wire at an outer peripheral side of the bent portion such that a gap having substantially a crescent shape is formed between the wire at the inner peripheral side and the wire at the outer peripheral side, and wherein the wire at the inner peripheral side and the wire at the outer peripheral side are fixed to each other at both ends of the bent portion.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">By the configuration of (1), the bent portion of the wire harness which is arranged on the vehicle body panel has a rigidity for maintaining the bent shape thereof and the rigidity is ensured by a flexural rigidity of the insulating coating of a plurality of wires constituting the bent portion or a flexural rigidity of the conductor of at least one of the wires. That is, the wire bundle itself retains the rigidity required for maintaining the bent shape of the bent portion.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">Accordingly, the bent portion of the wire harness may prevent the wires from interfering with the surrounding vehicle body panel due to deformation of the bent shape even without using a protection member such as a spiral tube or a protector.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">Thus, as compared to the wire harness according to the related art in which the protection member is mounted to protect the wire bundle of the bent portion, it is possible to achieve the small size and light weight of the wire harness by omitting the protection member.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">Further, it is possible to avoid interference between the bent portion of the wire harness and the surrounding vehicle body panel by the rigidity of the wire bundle itself. As a result, it is also possible to prevent occurrence of unusual sound or damage of the wires constituting the wire harness due to interference between the wires and the vehicle body panel.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0026">The wires using a single-wire conductor as a conductor have a significantly high flexural rigidity compared to the wires using a stranded conductor as a conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0027">Accordingly, by the configuration of (2), by setting the number of the wires using a single-wire conductor, it is possible to adjust the flexural rigidity of the wire bundle itself appropriately for maintaining the bent shape. Accordingly, it is possible to eliminate the need for installation of the protection member such as a spiral tube or a protector in order to maintain the bent shape of the bent portion.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0028">The wires including the high rigidity core wire in the stranded conductor may have a high flexural rigidity compared to normal wires using, e.g., general copper wires as core wires of the stranded conductor by selecting a material or the like of the high rigidity core wire.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0029">By the configuration of (3), since the bent portion of the wire harness is formed into a sheet shape, the arrangement of the wire harness on the wire harness arrangement path can be easily performed even when it is impossible to ensure a sufficient height for the wire harness arrangement path, thereby facilitating the arrangement of the wire harness.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0030">By the configuration of (4), when, e.g., an external force for restoring the curve of the wire bundle is exerted on the wire bundle constituting the bent portion, a tensile load is applied to the inner peripheral side wire and a compressive load is applied to the outer peripheral side wire. Further, when an external force for increasing the curve of the wire bundle is exerted on the wire bundle, a compressive load is applied to the inner peripheral side wire and a tensile load is applied to the outer peripheral side wire. That is, when an external force for changing the curved shape of the wire bundle is exerted on the wire bundle, loads are applied in opposite directions to the inner peripheral side wire and the outer peripheral side wire, thereby providing an effect of suppressing a change in the curved shape to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0031">Further, in the configuration in which the gap having a substantially crescent shape is formed between the inner peripheral side and outer peripheral side wires, the effect of suppressing a change in the curved shape of the wire bundle is strongly applied to each other, thereby preventing a change in the curved shape of the wire bundle.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0032">Accordingly, it is possible to surely prevent the wire bundle of the bent portion from being in contact with the vehicle body panel due to a change in the bent shape.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0033">In the wire harness according to the invention, the bent portion of the wire harness which is arranged on the vehicle body panel has a rigidity for maintaining the bent shape thereof and the rigidity is ensured by a flexural rigidity of the insulating coating of a plurality of wires constituting the bent portion or a flexural rigidity of the conductor of at least one of the wires. That is, the wire bundle itself retains the rigidity required for maintaining the bent shape of the bent portion.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">Hereinafter, a wire harness according to an embodiment of the invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows a configuration of a wire harness according to the embodiment of the invention. A wire harness <b>1</b> of this embodiment is arranged in a wire harness arrangement path set on a vehicle body panel <b>11</b> of a vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">The vehicle body panel <b>11</b> of the illustrated embodiment has an edge portion <b>12</b> having a substantially L shape. The edge portion <b>12</b> includes a burr or the like that may cause damage to wires when it is in contact with the wires in, e.g., a welding portion between the edge portion <b>12</b> and a metal plate.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">The wire harness arrangement path is set on the vehicle body panel <b>11</b> in a substantially L shape around an outer side of the edge portion <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0049">The wire harness <b>1</b> has a bent portion <b>2</b> formed around an outer side of a corner portion of the L-shaped edge portion <b>12</b>. The bent portion <b>2</b> has a bent shape corresponding to the bent shape of the wire harness arrangement path on the vehicle body panel <b>11</b>. Further, the wire harness <b>1</b> is held by clamp members <b>21</b> that fix at least both ends of the bent portion <b>2</b> to the vehicle body panel <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0050">In this embodiment, the bent portion <b>2</b> has a rigidity for maintaining the bent shape in which the bent portion <b>2</b> is bent at a substantially right angle along the outer side of the corner portion of the edge portion <b>12</b> and the rigidity of the bent portion <b>2</b> is ensured by a flexural rigidity of a conductor in a plurality of wires <b>3</b> constituting the bent portion <b>2</b>. In other words, at least one of the wires <b>3</b> has such a flexural rigidity that the bent portion <b>2</b> has the rigidity for maintaining the bent shape thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0051">Generally, insulated wires <b>3</b>A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> are used as the wires <b>3</b> constituting the bent portion <b>2</b>. But in this embodiment, one or more insulated wires <b>3</b>B illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> are used as the wires <b>3</b> constituting the bent portion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0052">The insulated wires <b>3</b>A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> have a structure in which a stranded conductor <b>31</b> formed by twisting a plurality of core wires <b>31</b> a together is covered with an insulating coating <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0053">On the other hand, the insulated wires <b>3</b>B illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> have a structure in which a single-wire conductor <b>33</b> is covered with an insulating coating <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054">The insulated wires <b>3</b>B using the single-wire conductor <b>33</b> as a conductor have a significantly high flexural rigidity compared to the insulated wires <b>3</b>A using the stranded conductor <b>31</b> as a conductor.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">In this embodiment, by setting the number of the wires using the insulated wires <b>3</b>B, it is possible to adjust the flexural rigidity of the wire bundle appropriately for maintaining the bent shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In other words, at least one of the wires <b>3</b> constituting the bent portion <b>2</b> is the insulated wire <b>3</b>B comprised of the single-wire conductor <b>33</b>. The number of the insulated wires <b>3</b>B in the wires <b>3</b> may be changed depending on the required rigidity of the bent portion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">In the wire harness <b>1</b> of the above-described embodiment, the bent portion <b>2</b> of the wire harness <b>1</b> which is arranged on the vehicle body panel <b>11</b> has the rigidity for maintaining the bent shape thereof and the rigidity of the bent portion <b>2</b> is ensured by a flexural rigidity of the conductor of at least one of the wires <b>3</b> constituting the bent portion <b>2</b>. In other words, the at least one single-wire conductor <b>33</b> used in the wires <b>3</b> has such a flexural rigidity that the bent portion <b>2</b> has the rigidity required for maintaining the bent shape thereof. Thus, the wire bundle itself retains the rigidity required for maintaining the bent shape of the bent portion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">Accordingly, the bent portion <b>2</b> of the wire harness <b>1</b> may prevent the wires <b>3</b> from interfering with the surrounding vehicle body panel <b>11</b> due to deformation of the bent shape even without using a protection member such as a spiral tube or a protector.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">Thus, as compared to the wire harness according to the related art, in which the protection member is mounted to protect the wire bundle at the bent portion, it is possible to achieve the small size and light weight of the wire harness <b>1</b> by omitting the protection member.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">Further, it is possible to avoid interference between the bent portion <b>2</b> of the wire harness <b>1</b> and the surrounding vehicle body panel <b>11</b> by the rigidity of the wire bundle itself. As a result, it is also possible to prevent occurrence of unusual sound or damage of the wires <b>3</b> constituting the wire harness <b>1</b> due to interference between the wires <b>3</b> and the vehicle body panel <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">Further, in the wire harness <b>1</b> of the above-described embodiment, the number of the insulated wires <b>3</b>B using the single-wire conductor <b>33</b> can be adjusted such that the wire bundle itself has the flexural rigidity enough to maintain the bent shape. In other words, by adjusting the number of the insulated wires <b>3</b>B installed, it is possible to prevent the flexural rigidity from increasing unnecessarily to facilitate a bending process of the wire harness <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">Moreover, the wire structure effective to increase the rigidity of the bent portion <b>2</b> is not limited to the structure of the insulated wires <b>3</b>B illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">Insulated wires <b>3</b>C having a structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be used. The insulated wires <b>3</b>C have a structure in which a stranded conductor <b>35</b> formed by twisting a plurality of core wires <b>35</b><i>a </i>and a high rigidity core wire <b>35</b><i>b </i>together is covered with an insulating coating <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">The core wires <b>35</b><i>a </i>are general core wires such as copper wires. On the other hand, the high rigidity core wire <b>35</b><i>b </i>may be a steel wire or stainless steel wire, which has a higher flexural rigidity than that of the copper wires. Although only one high rigidity core wire <b>35</b><i>b </i>is included in the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, two or more high rigidity core wires <b>35</b><i>b </i>may be included in the structure.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">The insulated wires <b>3</b>C has a rigidity required for maintaining the bent shape of the bent portion <b>2</b> and the rigidity is ensured by the flexural rigidity of the high rigidity core wire <b>35</b><i>b</i>. In other words, the high rigidity core wire <b>35</b><i>b </i>has such a flexural rigidity that the bent portion <b>2</b> has the rigidity for maintaining the bent shape thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">In the bent portion <b>2</b> using the insulated wires <b>3</b>C illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, by setting the number of the insulated wires <b>3</b>C to be mixed with the insulated wires <b>3</b>A, it is possible to adjust the flexural rigidity of the wire bundle itself appropriately for maintaining the bent shape. Accordingly, it is possible to eliminate the need for installation of the protection member such as a spiral tube or a protector in order to maintain the bent shape of the bent portion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066">Moreover, the rigidity for maintaining the bent shape of the bent portion <b>2</b> may be ensured by the rigidity of the insulating coating of the wires <b>3</b> constituting the bent portion <b>2</b>. In other words, the insulating coating of the wires <b>3</b> constituting the bent portion may have such a flexural rigidity that the bent portion <b>2</b> has the rigidity required for maintaining the bent shape thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">For example, the insulating coating of the wires <b>3</b> constituting the bent portion <b>2</b> may be formed of resin having high flexural rigidity and thermoplasticity such that when it is cooled to a room temperature after deformation in a heated state, the deformation is not restored. Accordingly, the insulating coating of the wires <b>3</b> can surely have a higher rigidity than normal.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">Further, it is effective to employ a flat circuit <b>3</b>D illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as the insulated wires in which the insulating coating has a rigidity for maintaining the bent shape.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">The flat circuit <b>3</b>D illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a so-called &#x201c;flexible printed circuit (FPC)&#x201d; or &#x201c;flexible flat cable (FFC)&#x201d;, in which a plurality of conductors <b>38</b> are printed on an insulation sheet film <b>37</b> which is integrally formed into a bent shape corresponding to the bent shape (L shape) of the wire harness arrangement path.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">The flat circuit <b>3</b>D has a rigidity required for maintaining the bent shape of the bent portion <b>2</b> and the rigidity of the flat circuit <b>3</b>D is ensured by the L-shaped insulation sheet film <b>37</b>. In other words, the insulation sheet film <b>37</b> has such a flexural rigidity that the bent portion <b>2</b> has the rigidity for maintaining the bent shape thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">With this configuration, since the bent portion <b>2</b> is formed into a sheet shape, it is possible to easily arrange the wire harness <b>1</b> using the flat circuit <b>3</b>D illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> on the wire harness arrangement path, even when the wire harness arrangement path does not have a sufficient height, thereby facilitating the arrangement of the wire harness <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0072">The bent portion <b>2</b> may have a configuration illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. That is, in the wires <b>3</b> constituting the bent portion <b>2</b>, a bending radius of a wire <b>3</b> at an inner peripheral side of the bent portion <b>2</b> is greater than a bending radius of a wire <b>3</b> at an outer peripheral side of the bent portion <b>2</b> such that a gap P having a substantially crescent shape is formed between the inner peripheral side wire <b>3</b> and the outer peripheral side wire <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0073">Further, the inner peripheral side wire <b>3</b> and the outer peripheral side wire <b>3</b> are fixed to each other with fixing means <b>39</b> at both ends of the bent portion <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0074">The fixing means <b>39</b> may be configured by tape winding using an adhesive tape, welding between outer insulating covers of the wires, adhesion using an adhesive or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0075">In a case where the bent portion <b>2</b> of the wire harness <b>1</b> has the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, when, e.g., an external force for restoring the curve of the wire bundle is exerted on the wire bundle constituting the bent portion <b>2</b>, a tensile load is applied to the inner peripheral side wire <b>3</b> and a compressive load is applied to the outer peripheral side wire <b>3</b>. Further, when an external force for increasing the curve of the wire bundle is exerted on the wire bundle, a compressive load is applied to the inner peripheral side wire <b>3</b> and a tensile load is applied to the outer peripheral side wire <b>3</b>. That is, when an external force for changing the curved shape of the wire bundle is exerted on the wire bundle, loads are applied in opposite directions to the inner peripheral side wire <b>3</b> and the outer peripheral side wire <b>3</b>, thereby providing an effect of suppressing a change in the curved shape to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">Further, in the configuration in which the gap P having a substantially crescent shape is formed between the inner peripheral side and outer peripheral side wires <b>3</b>, the effect of suppressing a change in the curved shape is strongly applied to each other, thereby preventing a change in the curved shape of the wire bundle.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">Accordingly, it is possible to surely prevent the wire bundle of the bent portion <b>2</b> from being in contact with the vehicle body panel <b>11</b> due to a change in the bent shape.</p>
