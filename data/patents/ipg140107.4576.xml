<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to and is a nonprovisional application of U.S. Provisional Patent Ser. No. 60/890,810 filed Feb. 20, 2007 and U.S. Provisional Patent Ser. No. 60/980,169 filed Oct. 15, 2007. These disclosures are hereby incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the field of digital media distribution. More specifically, the present invention relates to a high quality video encoding termed a &#x201c;Home-Video Digital-Master Package&#x201d; (HVP).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Video and audio content, such as movies and television shows, are beginning to become widely available for viewing on a variety of digital media devices. The HVP allows video content source providers to encode video data into a variety of formats for a variety of devices with reduced artifacts. Digital media devices include computers, set-top video boxes, digital video recorders, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, DVD players, and handheld or portable video players (e.g. iPhone, Zune, ipod).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Digital distribution uses data communications networks, such as the Internet, local area networks, local or wide-area terrestrial or satellite wireless networks, cellular data networks, and other open or proprietary networks to distribute content to digital media devices. Digital media devices can download content via a data communications networks on demand during viewing, referred to as streaming, and/or for storage in advance of later viewings.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, there is a large amount of content already digitally mastered for distribution via DVD, digital broadcasting, or more recently, digital television broadcasting. However, for such data to be prepared for digital media devices, the digitally mastered content must typically be further processed and encoded. The file sizes for digitally-mastered content are often very large compared to the bandwidth available on data communications networks. Further, the file size also typically exceeds the data storage capacities of digital media devices. Accordingly, digitally-mastered content is often compressed for digital distribution purposes. Digital media devices typically use any standard or proprietary data compression known in the art, e.g. MPEG-2, DiVX, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Digital media devices, especially portable and handheld devices, often have relatively low resolution displays compared with the resolution of the digitally mastered content. Furthermore, the pixel aspect ratios of digital media devices can differ from the pixel aspect ratio used to digitally master content. For example, many computers and other digital media devices use square pixels (e.g. 1:1), while DVD format video typically have a non-square pixel aspect ratio of 0.9:1.0. Thus, digitally mastered content must often be resized to account for differences in resolution and pixel aspect ratio between the digital master version of the content and the display formats of digital media devices.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Due to the variety of different standard formats used for generating and distributing digital master versions of content and the plethora of different resolutions, pixel aspect ratios, and compression formats required by digital media devices, the content encoded for digital media devices by current digital distribution techniques is often low quality. In particular, digital distribution systems may compress, decompress, and recompress content multiple times using different data compression schemes. Because typical digital distribution systems and digital media devices typically rely on lossy data compression schemes; quality is reduced and compression artifacts are introduce every time the content is compressed. By compressing content multiple times, digital distribution systems often exacerbate compression artifacts and substantially reduce the quality of content for digital media devices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As merely an example, the inventor of the present invention has studied the quality of the video being displayed on digital media devices. Many artifacts of such video are determined to be caused by one or more of the intermediate conversion steps between film format to hand-held device format. In a specific example, a traditional acetate film media is scanned with a film scanner (e.g. telecine) to form digital video data (e.g. 720&#xd7;480 pixels); next, the digital video data is typically encoded into MPEG2 format (e.g. for DVDs) (e.g. 720&#xd7;480 pixels); the MPEG2 encoded DVD resolution data is then provided to a video content providing service (e.g. iTunes). Subsequently, the video content providing service first decodes the MPEG2 format video; then resizes the 720&#xd7;480 pixel resolution video to the target resolution (e.g. 640&#xd7;480, 320&#xd7;480, etc.); and then recompresses the video in the desired encoding scheme (e.g. H.264 for iTunes).</p>

More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-C</figref> illustrate the problem of multiple resizing of video content upon a source image. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> illustrates source image having a first image resolution <b>800</b> to be resized to a second image resolution <b>810</b>. Because of differences in resolution, a resulting image <b>820</b> will often have a number of &#x201c;beat frequencies&#x201d; shown as dark lines in resulting image <b>820</b>. In one example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the source image may be a be a high resolution image, e.g. 1960&#xd7;1080 resolution, and second resolution <b>810</b> may be 720&#xd7;480 resolution. Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> illustrates resulting image <b>820</b> being resized to a third image resolution <b>830</b>. Because of additional differences in resolution, a resulting image <b>840</b> will often have an additional number of &#x201c;beat frequencies&#x201d; shown as additional dark lines in resulting image <b>840</b>. In one example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the third image resolution <b>810</b> may be 640&#xd7;480. In contrast, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8C</figref>, the inventors of the present invention recognize that direct resizing from the source image having first resolution <b>800</b> to third image resolution <b>830</b> results in resulting image <b>850</b> with reduced &#x201c;beat frequencies.&#x201d; In this example, resulting image <b>850</b> includes fewer dark lines compared to resulting image <b>840</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Additionally, in one specific example, because MPEG2 encoding for the DVD resolution image uses blocks of 8&#xd7;8 pixels, the edges of many of the encoding blocks become visible as vertical and horizontal lines when resizing the video images to 640&#xd7;480. Another problem is that the video images are encoded and decoded multiple times, causing a degradation in the colors. In the example above, the digital video data is encoded using MPEG<b>2</b>, is decoded, and then re-encoded to H.264.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-D</figref> illustrate another prior art drawback. More specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-C</figref> illustrate a problem with typical block-based, or shift-intolerant encoding or compression schemes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates an image <b>700</b> including data to be compressed by a block-based compression scheme, such as MPEG<b>2</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, each group of four pixels is used to determine a pixel value in a compressed image. In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, an image <b>710</b> illustrates the resulting compressed image reproducing the checker board-type pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, image <b>720</b> illustrates image <b>700</b>, however, the grouping of four pixels used to determine a pixel value is shifted vertically and horizontally by one pixel. An example of where this may happen is when scanning film media. It is virtually impossible to guarantee scanning at the same position of each image because of film printing and duplication registration errors, scanning misalignments, or the like. In light of this, scanned film images often are shifted for different images as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> an image <b>730</b> illustrates the compressed image determined from image <b>720</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. As can be seen, the data values in image <b>730</b> are uniformly 0.5, in contrast, the data values in image <b>710</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>) vary from 1 to 0 in a checkerboard-type pattern. Accordingly, if a viewer were to view image <b>710</b> and <b>730</b> in succession, the viewer would see the output images flicker and go to gray on the screen due simply to the compression scheme being shift-intolerant, e.g. block-based.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It is therefore desirable for a system and method to provide the highest-quality content possible for digital media devices regardless of their display requirements. It is further desirable for a system and method to simplify the process of converting content for digital media devices. It is also desirable for a system and method to integrate easily with both legacy content sources, including film-based content sources, and more recent digital sources. Further, the inventors desire a method for providing service providers with video content that will have fewer visual artifacts when resized and/or encoded in a desired format.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention relates to high quality video encoding. More specifically, the present invention relates to high quality video encoding for a variety of destinations with reduced artifacts. In the present disclosure, the term video refers to temporally-coherent or ordered set of images.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Various embodiments of the present invention includes determining a device-independent color-space encoding of video data, encoding the video data using an encoding scheme substantially free of spatial organization, e.g. block-based encoding, and providing the processed video data to a video service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In various embodiments, it is contemplated that a video service provider will change the resolution of the processed video data, and then encode the processed video data in the desired color space for the target hand-held device.</p>

A process may include encoding each color-graded image with a compression encoding substantially independent of integer pixel translation of the plurality of color-graded digital images to form encoded image data package (e.g. HVP), and storing the encoded image data package in a tangible media. Determining the digital video data (e.g. DVD, Blu-ray disc, HD disk, CD, downloadable data, a streaming data format) for a video display device in a remote server in response to the encoded image data package may also be performed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The inventor of the present invention introduces the concept of a &#x201c;Home-Video Digital-Master Package&#x201d; (HVP) for providing digital video data to video service providers. In various embodiments, the HVP includes video data that may be stored in a device independent color-space, and may be encoded in a compression scheme that does not depend upon geometry of the images (e.g. DCT blocks in MPEG2).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Typically, a movie or other content exists in the form of an original camera negative (OCN). This represents the master or original version of the content. Each time a film is run through a film printer or other device, there is a chance that the film may be damaged. To protect the integrity of the content, handling of the OCN is minimized. From the OCN, a positive film print, referred to as an interpositive or intermediate positive, is created. The interpositive may be created using special film stock. The interpositive is the highest quality copy of the content and is typically used to create other prints of the content or to digitally master the content.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">To create prints of the content for distribution to theaters, one or more internegatives are created from the interpositive. The internegatives are negative versions of the interpositives. Internegatives are the second highest quality copy of the content. Each internegative is typically used to create many distribution prints, which are positive copies of the content for distribution to theaters.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a prior system <b>100</b> for encoding content for digital media devices. System <b>100</b> receives content in the form of a film of a movie, television show, or other type of content including video and optionally audio. For the highest quality encoding in prior systems, each frame of an interpositive print <b>105</b> is scanned <b>107</b>. Projection emulation <b>109</b> transforms the scanned film images to account for the effects of film projection. The transformed scanned film images are resized <b>111</b> to a video master resolution, which is typically the resolution used by DVD players, such as 720&#xd7;480 (NTSC) or 720&#xd7;576 (PAL). The resizing stage <b>111</b> can also compensate for differences in frame rates and aspect ratios between the original content and the video master format.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The resized video may be optionally color graded <b>113</b> to correct the color and contrast and then compressed <b>115</b> for home video distribution, such as via DVD disks. The MPEG-2 standard is typically used to compress video for home video distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">For the second highest quality encoding in prior systems, each frame of a film internegative <b>117</b> is scanned. Film print emulation <b>121</b> transforms the scanned images of the negative into corresponding positive images. These corresponding positive images are then resized <b>111</b>, optionally color graded <b>113</b>, and compressed <b>115</b> to create a version of the content encoded for home video distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For the third highest quality encoding in prior systems, a positive film print <b>125</b>, such as a distribution print is scanned <b>107</b> using a film scanner or more typically processed by a telecine <b>123</b>. The telecine <b>123</b> uses a flying spot scanner to create an analog or digital video signal in real-time directly from a film print. The video signal is then digitized and compressed <b>115</b> to create a version of the content encoded for home video distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">This initial processing of film positives or negatives to create a compressed home video version of the content is typically performed by a film scanning facility <b>127</b>. The compressed home video version of the content is then transported electronically or via a physical data storage media, such as magnetic disks or tapes, to a video processing facility <b>129</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The video processing facility <b>129</b> decompresses <b>131</b> the video content, resizes <b>133</b> the video content to the resolution, color, and pixel aspect ratio of a digital media device, referred to as the target device, and then recompresses <b>135</b> the content for electronic or physical transport to a content provider <b>137</b>. Typically, the MPEG-2 standard is used to compress the content resized for the target device.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The content provider <b>137</b> (video content service provider) then decompresses <b>139</b> the content, optionally resizes <b>141</b> the content for one or more different target devices, and then recompresses <b>143</b> the content in a format suitable for distribution to the target device, such as MPEG-4 or h.264 format video, Microsoft Windows Media format video, or any other standard or proprietary video compression format. The result is content encoded for a target digital media device.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Because system <b>100</b> compresses the content multiple times using multiple lossy compression techniques, there is substantial loss in quality as the content is encoded for the target device. Moreover, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 are block-based compression techniques that often add block boundary compression artifacts to the content. When content including block boundary compression artifacts is resized, these compression artifacts are exacerbated and often appear as unwanted halos or &#x201c;mosquito noise,&#x201d; due to limitations of these compression techniques in handling high spatial frequency data.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Embodiments of the invention seek to improve the quality of content encoded for digital media devices by following two general guidelines. First, content is only resized or reformatted to lower resolutions. Resizing content from lower resolutions to higher resolutions should be avoided, as it unnecessarily discards data from the original content. Second, content should only be compressed using lossy compression once, if at all possible.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With these guidelines in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a first system <b>200</b> for encoding content for digital media devices according to an embodiment of the invention. System <b>200</b> leverages the process used to encode and distribute content to digital cinemas. To distribute encode and distribute content to digital cinemas, a digital source master <b>205</b> is provided. A digital source master <b>205</b> is a master digital copy of the content. The digital source master <b>205</b> may be created by scanning each frame of a high quality film (e.g. acetate) version of the content, such as the interpositive print, an original camera negative print, or a positive film print. If the content was digitally recorded, then the digital source master <b>205</b> may be in the same format as it was recorded, created, or edited in.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Digital source masters <b>205</b> can be in a variety of resolutions and color formats, including 1920&#xd7;1080 high definition resolution, Digital Cinema 2K (2048&#xd7;1080) resolution, Digital Cinema 4K (4096&#xd7;2160) resolution, or any other resolution used to create, process, and display digital images. Each pixel will typically be encoded with at least 24 bits of color information (8 bits each of the red, green, and blue color channels). Some digital source masters may use 14 bits, 16 bits, or even single-precision (32 bit) or double-precision (64 bit) floating point numbers for each color channel.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">To distribute the content to digital cinema systems, the digital source master <b>205</b> is converted to a digital intermediate, e.g. Digital Cinema Distribution Master (DCDM) files <b>207</b>. DCDM is one technical standard specified by the Digital Cinema Initiatives industry consortium, although other proprietary formats have been proposed. DCDM files <b>207</b> include uncompressed and unencrypted files that represent moving image content optimized for the electronic playback in theaters. DCDM files <b>207</b> typically use a hierarchical structure to represent content in a variety of different resolutions to meet the requirements of digital cinema projectors with different capabilities. Typical DCDM files are 4 to 6 terabytes (TB) in size.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Digital intermediates are unsuited for being used as an HVP for a variety of reasons. For example, each company in the industry typically has their own definition of how digital data is stored, what color encoding formats are used, what compression schemes are used, and the like for a digital intermediate. Additionally, for standard feature-length films, since these digital intermediates may be on the order or terabytes, it is impractical to send such digital intermediates for each feature to the many different video or media content service providers, e.g. Apple, Verizon, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The DCDM files <b>207</b> are then compressed and encrypted <b>209</b> for distribution. Each frame of content in DCDM files <b>207</b> is typically compressed separately using lossless data compression, such as JPEG2000 lossless image compression. The compression may also reduce the color channel information down to 12 bits or less per channel of color information. Encryption is performed to prevent unauthorized copying of the content. The content is encrypted using an encryption key known to the digital cinema projectors, so that only these devices can read the content. Digital watermarks may also be added for additional security. The result of the compression and encryption <b>209</b> is a digital cinema package <b>211</b>. The digital cinema package <b>211</b> can be distributed to theaters having the proper hardware decrypting projectors. Digital cinema packages <b>211</b> are often hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes in size and are typically distributed using portable hard disk drives. Alternatively, digital cinema packages <b>211</b> can be distributed over a local- and/or wide-area computer network, including the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Various embodiments of the present invention leverage the digital cinema mastering process to create high quality encoded content (HVP) for digital media devices regardless of their display requirements. Various embodiments of the invention also integrate easily with both legacy content sources, including film-based content sources, and more recently created digital sources.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To create high quality encoded content for digital media devices, system <b>200</b> optionally performs color grading <b>213</b> on the content from digital source master <b>205</b> in the target color space. Color grading maps the transfer curve of color expressed in the digital source master <b>205</b> to that of the target digital media device. In various embodiments, the color space is the HDTV color space, e.g. ITU-R BT.709, or the like. In various embodiments, the selected color-space ITU-R BT.709 can specify colors that cannot be produced by typical RGB monitors, displays, or the like (e.g. gamut mismatch). However, because ITU-R BT.709 preserves the color space data, the video service provider can perform gamut matching routines to fit within the desired target gamut. It is contemplated that any number of gamut matching techniques such as smooth gamut remapping, non-linear gamut remapping, or the like may be used. In various embodiments, without preservation of such color space data, gamut remapping operations may result in video data having distorted and/or unpleasing colors.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In various embodiments, the video data provided by the &#x201c;digital intermediate&#x201d; is also compressed in <b>233</b>. In various embodiments, a spatially-independent compression scheme, such as a wavelet compression scheme is used. With conventional MPEG2 compression, used for home video content, e.g. HDTV, DVD, data are compressed at spatially dependent locations, such as blocks of 8&#xd7;8 pixels. In contrast, JPEG2000, and other compression schemes do not break the data up into data blocks that are independently compressed. Because of this, if JPEG2000 compressed video data is re-sized or re-compressed, the artifacts will not be readily visible by users. Such compression schemes are also substantially free from small pixel-based shifts, as was illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-D</figref>. This data is then used to form the HVP <b>235</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In various embodiments, the HVP is provided to the video service providers as a data source for their video processing pipeline via electronic mechanisms, e.g. internet, or via physical mechanisms, e.g. DVD (e.g. BluRay), hard disk.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the video content service providers typically decompress HVP <b>235</b> to form uncompressed image data <b>237</b>. In various embodiments, video content service providers may have any number of encoding pipelines to encode the data for the home video target &#x201c;consumer&#x201d; device, e.g. iTouch.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Encoding pipeline <b>214</b><i>a </i>resizes the HVP content to a home video resolution <b>215</b> and then compresses and optionally encrypts the resized content <b>217</b> to the required home video format. The result of the encoding pipeline <b>214</b><i>a </i>is content compressed for the home video format <b>219</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Similarly, encoding pipeline <b>214</b><i>b </i>encodes HVP <b>235</b> to the format of a first target digital media device. Encoding pipeline <b>214</b><i>b </i>resizes the content to the first target digital media device resolution <b>221</b> and then compresses and optionally encrypts the resized content <b>223</b> to the required first target digital media device format. The compressed content can optionally be encrypted and watermarked according to a first target digital media device digital rights management format to prevent unauthorized copying of the content. The result of the encoding pipeline <b>214</b><i>b </i>is content compressed for the first target digital media video format <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Encoding pipeline <b>214</b><i>c </i>encodes content from HVP <b>235</b> to the format of a second target digital media device. Encoding pipeline <b>214</b><i>c </i>resizes the content to the first target digital media device resolution <b>227</b> and then compresses and optionally encrypts the resized content <b>229</b> to the required second target digital media device format. The compressed content can optionally be encrypted and watermarked according to a second target digital media device digital rights management format to prevent unauthorized copying of the content. The result of the encoding pipeline <b>214</b><i>c </i>is content compressed for the first target digital media video format <b>231</b>. In other embodiments, additional encoding pipelines, such as for providing streaming video, or the like are contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">System <b>200</b> allows content to be encoded into any number of different formats. Each content format is derived directly from HVP <b>235</b>, so there are no artifacts from repeated compression and decompression. Additionally, each different format is only scaled down, so the amount of information lost due to resizing is minimized. Because system <b>200</b> works with HVP <b>235</b>, any film-based content that has been digitally scanned can be used as a source. Moreover, system <b>200</b> can directly use digitally-created content in its native format.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a second system <b>300</b> for encoding content for digital media devices according to an embodiment of the invention. System <b>300</b> is similar to system <b>200</b>, except that content can be provided in digital format as DCDM files <b>305</b> or a digital cinema package <b>310</b>. Additionally, original print <b>315</b>, internegative print <b>320</b>, or interpositive print <b>325</b> film content can be digitally scanned using a film scanner or telecine <b>330</b> to produce a high resolution digital version of the content.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Regardless of the source, the digital version of the content can be optionally color graded <b>335</b>. The color grading may be different depending upon the source of the content similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and is typically graded in a home video color space. As illustrated, the image data is then compressed in a shift-resistant compression scheme <b>340</b>, e.g. JPEG2000, to form the HVP <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In various embodiments, HPV <b>350</b> is then provided to a video or media content service provider. As shown, after decompression <b>360</b>, the uncompressed data may be sent to any number of encoding pipelines <b>340</b>, such as encoding pipelines <b>340</b><i>a</i>, <b>340</b><i>b</i>, and <b>340</b><i>c. </i>The encoding pipelines <b>340</b> are similar to encoding pipelines <b>214</b> discussed above. The output of the encoding pipelines <b>340</b> are versions of the content formatted for different target digital media device formats.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a third system <b>400</b> for encoding content for digital media devices according to an embodiment of the invention. System <b>400</b> receives content via a digital cinema package <b>405</b>. The content is decrypted using a decryption module <b>410</b> from the digital cinema package <b>405</b> to access the unencrypted content. In an embodiment the decryption module <b>410</b> operates in the same way that a digital cinema projector would access encrypted content from a digital cinema package. As illustrated, the data is typically color graded <b>435</b> to home video color space and then compressed using a non-block based compression scheme <b>440</b> to form the HVP <b>445</b>. HVP <b>445</b> is provided to the video content service provider who then decompresses HVP <b>445</b> to obtain uncompressed image data <b>450</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The uncompressed image data is then provided to one or more encoding pipelines <b>410</b>. System <b>400</b> includes encoding pipeline <b>410</b><i>a </i>and optional encoding pipeline <b>410</b><i>b. </i>Encoding pipeline <b>410</b><i>a </i>first resizes the content to a first target digital media device resolution <b>415</b><i>a </i>and then compresses and optionally encrypts the resized content <b>420</b><i>a </i>to the required first target digital media device format. The result of the encoding pipeline <b>410</b><i>a </i>is content compressed in a first target digital media device format <b>422</b><i>a</i>. The compressed content <b>422</b><i>a </i>is stored on a content provider server <b>425</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a flow diagram according to various embodiments of the present invention. As was discussed, initially digital source data from any number of sources is provided, step <b>600</b>. In various embodiments, the color space of the digital source data may be a color space for film media, for digital cinema systems, DCDM encoding, an unambiguous color space such as X&#x2032;Y&#x2032;Z&#x2032;, a device independent color space, or the like. The source data is then color graded into the color space of the contemplated target consumer devices, step <b>610</b>. In various embodiments, the color space is HDTV, ITU-R BT.709, ITU-R BT.601, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, the images are compressed using a shift tolerant compression scheme, e.g. wavelet, JPEG2000, or the like, step <b>620</b>. As discussed above, such compression schemes are typically tolerant of integer pixel shifts of the input image. In contrast, as was illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B and 7D</figref>, typical compression schemes can produce very different compressed images although the images in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7C</figref> were only shifted by one pixel horizontally and vertically.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In various embodiments, the HVP is formed and stored (e.g. archived), step <b>630</b>. In various embodiments, HVP <b>630</b> is not intended to be viewed, but is a digital data package that is stored and is provided to independent third parties (e.g. video content service providers), who are typically located at remote locations. For example, one party that generates the HVP may be located in Burbank, Calif. and the third party may be located in Cupertino, Calif.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In various embodiments, HVP <b>630</b> is then provided to the video or media content service provider, e.g. DVD publishers, Apple (iTunes), Verizon, or the like. As discussed above, this process may be an electronic transfer (e.g. network), a physical transfer (e.g. hard disk), or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the video content service provider typically decompresses HVP <b>630</b>, reversing step <b>620</b>, step <b>650</b>. The uncompressed images are resized to match the desired device resolution, step <b>660</b>, (e.g. from approximately 2048&#xd7;1080 to 640&#xd7;480). Next, the resized images are then compressed, step <b>670</b>. As discussed above, typical consumer compression schemes may include any conventional compression scheme such as MPEG-2, DivX, MPEG-4, H.264, WMV, RealVideo, or any other lossy or lossless compression scheme. The resulting data may be stored and provided to consumers, step <b>680</b>, using conventional methods (e.g. iTunes download, Flash video stream, DVD, Blu-Ray Disc, HD DVD, Streaming video, or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further embodiments can be envisioned to one of ordinary skill in the art after reading the attached documents. In other embodiments, combinations or sub-combinations of the above disclosed invention can be advantageously made. The block diagrams of the architecture and flow charts are grouped for ease of understanding. However it should be understood that combinations of blocks, additions of new blocks, re-arrangement of blocks, and the like are contemplated in alternative embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The specification and drawings are, accordingly, to be regarded in an illustrative rather than a restrictive sense. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereunto without departing from the broader spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In light of the above, it can be seen that the HVP provides many benefits over the current methods of providing video data to video or media content service providers and subsequently to consumers. Specifically, extraneous color encodings and decodings are reduced, and thus spatial artifacts due to compression schemes and resizing are reduced.</p>
