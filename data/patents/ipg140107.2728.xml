<heading id="h-0001" level="1">INTRODUCTION</heading>
<p id="h-0002" num="0000">Multiple Sclerosis</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling neurological condition affecting young adults. Around 85,000 people in the UK have MS.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In multiple sclerosis (MS), inflammation of nervous tissue causes loss of myelin, a fatty material that acts as a protective insulation for nerve fibres in the brain and the spinal cord. This loss of myelin, or demyelination, leaves multiple areas of scar tissue, or sclerosis, along nerve cells. Consequently, the sclerosis results in multiple and varied neurological signs and symptoms, usually with repeated relapse and remission.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Common symptoms of MS include reduced or loss of vision, stumbling and uneven gait, slurred speech, as well as urinary frequency and incontinence. In addition, MS can cause mood changes and depression, muscle spasms and severe paralysis.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is now generally accepted that MS is an autoimmune disease mediated by autoreactive T-cells.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Current treatments for MS generally suppress the immune system. For example, one treatment includes transplantation of bone marrow along with administration of cytostatics and immunosupressive drugs. This treatment is effective for some patients, but it is expensive and relatively high-risk. Additionally, the administration of cytostatics is considered controversial in treating MS because its effects are unclear and potential side-effects are severe.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Treatment with interferon-beta (IFN&#x3b2;) reduces the symptoms of MS in some patients and is therefore widely used. However, the mechanism of action of interferon-beta is unclear and IFN&#x3b2; treatment is ineffective for many patients. Furthermore, treatment with IFN&#x3b2; is compounded by the development of anti-IFN&#x3b2; antibodies in most patients Giovannoni, G., Munschauer, F. E., 3rd, and Deisenhammer, F. (2002). Neutralising antibodies to interferon beta during the treatment of multiple sclerosis. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 73, 465-469.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Currently, an effective treatment for MS does not exist. Treatment is focused on merely reducing its symptoms, usually by general suppression of the immune system. There is thus an acute need for a therapy which specifically targets local immune responses associated with onset and progression of the disease.</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">Synthetic Peptides</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Metzler and Wraith (Int. Immunol. 5:1159-1165 (1993)) were the first researchers to describe the use of synthetic peptides to induce suppression of an autoimmune response in the mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model, a commonly used in vivo model of MS. In this study, peptides derived from MBP were administered by the intranasal route, and it was found that the level of disease suppression correlated with the antigenic strength of the peptide used.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Later, in 1995, Liu and Wraith (Int. Immunol. 7:1255-1263) showed that it was also possible to induce suppression of EAE in mice by the intraperitoneal administration of soluble MBP-derived peptides. In this study, suppression of both Th1 and Th2 responses was achieved, and it was shown that administration of peptides after the start of an immune response could lead to suppression of the on-going immune reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">However, it was found that not all peptides capable of acting as T-cell epitopes are capable of inducing tolerance. The myelin basic protein (MBP) peptide 89-101 is an immunodominant antigen after immunisation and is also a very effective immunogen both in terms of priming for T cell reactivity and induction of EAE. However, this peptide has been shown to be ineffective at inducing tolerance when administered in solution (Anderton and Wraith (1998) Eur. J. Immunol. 28:1251-1261).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present inventors have previously shown that there is a link between the capacity of a peptide to bind to an MHC class I or II molecule and be presented to a T cell without further antigen processing and its capacity to induce tolerance in vivo. Peptides which are antigen processing independent (i.e. do not require further antigen processing to bind MHC) can be predicted to be tolerogenic in vivo. These peptides have been termed &#x201c;apitopes&#x201d;, for Antigen Processing Independent epiTOPES.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">WO 02/16410 describes the following apitopes from myelin basic protein (MBP): 30-44, 80-94, 83-99, 81-95, 82-96, 83-97, 84-98, 110-124, 130-144, 131-145, 132-146 and 133-147.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">WO 03/064464 identifies the following MBP peptides as being apitopes: 134-148; 135-149; 136-150; 137-151; 138-152 and 140-154.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The present inventors have now found that a &#x201c;cocktail&#x201d; of four MBP peptides, all of which are apitopes, is particularly effective in treating MS. It is thought that the four peptides may exert a synergistic effect when in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In a first aspect, therefore, the present invention relates to a composition which comprises the following myelin basic protein peptides:

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0045">The first aspect of the invention relates to a composition which comprises a plurality of peptides from myelin basic protein.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Myelin Basic Protein</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0046">Myelin basic protein (MBP) is an 18.5 kDa protein isolatable from human brain white matter. The mature protein has 170 amino acids and the sequence is widely available in the literature (see for example: Chou et al (1986) J. Neurochem. 46:47-53, FIG. 1; Kamholz et al (1986), PNAS 83:4962-4966, FIG. 2; U.S. Pat. No. 5,817,629, SEQ ID NO: 1; Roth et al (1987), J. Neurosci. Res. 17:321-328, FIG. 4; Medeveczky et al (2006), FEBS Letters 580:545-552, FIG. 3B).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">MBP Peptides</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0047">The term &#x201c;peptide&#x201d; is used in the normal sense to mean a series of residues, typically L-amino acids, connected one to the other typically by peptide bonds between the &#x3b1;-amino and carboxyl groups of adjacent amino acids The term includes modified peptides and synthetic peptide analogues.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0048">The peptides used in the composition and kit of the present invention may be made using chemical methods (Peptide Chemistry, A practical Textbook. Mikos Bodansky, Springer-Verlag, Berlin). For example, peptides can be synthesized by solid phase techniques (Roberge J Y et al (1995) Science 269: 202-204), cleaved from the resin, and purified by preparative high performance liquid chromatography (e.g., Creighton (1983) Proteins Structures And Molecular Principles, WH Freeman and Co, New York N.Y.). Automated synthesis may be achieved, for example, using the ABI 43 1 A Peptide Synthesizer (Perkin Elmer) in accordance with the instructions provided by the manufacturer.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0049">The peptide may alternatively be made by recombinant means or by cleavage from a longer polypeptide. For example, the peptide may be obtained by cleavage from full length MBP. The composition of a peptide may be confirmed by amino acid analysis or sequencing (e.g., the Edman degradation procedure).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0050">The peptides used in the compositions and kits of the present invention are as follows:</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0052">The terms &#x201c;MBP 30-44&#x201d;, &#x201c;MBP 83-99&#x201d;, &#x201c;MBP 131-145&#x201d; and &#x201c;MBP 140-154&#x201d; encompasses modified peptides. For example the peptides may be mutated, by amino acid insertion, deletion or substitution, so long as the MHC binding-specificity of the unmodified peptide is retained, together with its capacity to be presented to a T cell. The peptide may, for example, have 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 or 0 mutations from the unmodified sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0053">Alternatively (or in addition) modifications may be made without changing the amino acid sequence of the peptide. For example, D-amino acids or other unnatural amino acids can be included, the normal amide bond can be replaced by ester or alkyl backbone bonds, N- or C-alkyl substituents, side chain modifications, and constraints such as disulphide bridges and side chain amide or ester linkages can be included. Such changes may result in greater in vivo stability of the peptide, and a longer biological lifetime.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0054">Modification of epitopes may be performed based on predictions for more efficient T-cell induction derived using the program &#x201c;Peptide Binding Predictions&#x201d; devised by K. Parker (NIH) which may be found at http://www-bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/cgi-bin/molbio/ken<sub>&#x2014;</sub>parker_comboform (see also Parker, K. C et al. 1994. J. Immunol. 152:163).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0055">MBP peptides may be formulated into the composition as neutral or salt forms. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts (formed with free amino groups of the peptide) and which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids such as acetic, oxalic, tartaric and maleic. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups may also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, 2-ethylamino ethanol, histidine and procaine.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Composition</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0056">The composition of the present invention may be for prophylactic or therapeutic use.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0057">The composition may by prepared as an injectable, either as liquid solution or suspension; solid form suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid prior to injection may also be prepared. The preparation may also be emulsified, or the peptides encapsulated in liposomes. The active ingredients may be mixed with excipients which are pharmaceutically acceptable and compatible with the active ingredient. Suitable excipients are, for example, water, saline (for example, phosphate-buffered saline), dextrose, glycerol, ethanol, or the like and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0058">In addition, if desired, the composition may contain minor amounts of auxiliary substances such as wetting or emulsifying agents and/or pH buffering agents. Buffering salts include phosphate, citrate, acetate. Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydryoxide may be used for pH adjustment. For stabilisation, disaccharides may be used such as sucrose or trehalose.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0059">In the composition, the relative ratio of the peptides (MBP 30-44:MBP 83-99:MBP 131-145:MBP 140-154) may be approximately 1:1:1:1. Alternatively the relative ratios of each peptide may be altered, for example, to focus the tolerogenic response on a particular sub-set of autoreactive T-cells or if it is found that one peptide works better than the others in particular HLA types.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0060">After formulation, the composition may be incorporated into a sterile container which is then sealed and stored at a low temperature, for example 4&#xb0; C., or it may be freeze-dried.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0061">Conveniently the composition is prepared as a lyophilized (freeze dried) powder. Lyophilisation permits long-term storage in a stabilised form. Lyophilisation procedures are well known in the art, see for example http://www.devicelink.com/ivdt/archive/97/01/006.html. Bulking agents are commonly used prior to freeze-drying, such as mannitol, dextran or glycine.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0062">The composition may be administered in a convenient manner such as by the oral, intravenous (where water soluble), intramuscular, subcutaneous, sublingual, intranasal, intradermal or suppository routes or implanting (e.g. using slow release molecules).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0063">The composition may advantageously be administered via intranasal, subcutaneous or intradermal routes.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0064">The method and pharmaceutical composition of the invention may be used to treat a human subject. Typically, a physician will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for an individual subject and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0065">In a preferred embodiment a &#x201c;dose escalation&#x201d; protocol may be followed, where a plurality of doses is given to the patient in ascending concentrations. Such an approach has been used, for example, for phospholipase A2 peptides in immunotherapeutic applications against bee venom allergy (M&#xfc;ller et al (1998) J. Allergy Clin Immunol. 101:747-754 and Akdis et al (1998) J. Clin. Invest. 102:98-106).</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Kits</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0066">Conveniently, the four MBP peptides may be administered together, in the form of a mixed composition or cocktail. However, there may be circumstances in which it is preferable to provide the peptides separately in the form of a kit, for simultaneous, separate, sequential or combined administration.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0067">For example, the kit may comprise the four peptides in separate containers, or two containers, each comprising two peptides. The contents of the containers may or may not be combined prior to administration.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0068">The kit may also comprise mixing and/or administration means (for example a vapouriser for intranasal administration; or a syringe and needle for subcutaneous/intradermal dosing). The kit may also comprise instructions for use.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0069">The pharmaceutical composition or kit of the invention may be used to treat and/or prevent a disease.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0070">In particular, the composition/kit may be used to treat and/or prevent multiple sclerosis and/or optical neuritis.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Multiple Sclerosis</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0071">Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disorder among young adults (20 to 40 years old) affecting around 385,000 people in Europe and 300,000 in the USA. It is a chronic degenerative disease of the central nervous system in which gradual destruction of myelin occurs in patches throughout the brain and/or spinal cord, interfering with neural connectivity and causing muscular weakness, loss of coordination and speech and visual disturbances.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0072">After 10 years, about half of the individuals who are initially diagnosed with Relapsing-Remitting MS (RRMS) find that the frequency of relapses decreases but disability increases. This is known as Secondary Progressive MS (SPMS). Some estimates are that within 25 years, about 90% of people with RRMS will progress to the secondary-progressive type. As with RRMS, Secondary Progressive MS can vary widely. For some patients, the increase or progression of disability is very gradual, and for others it can occur more quickly. In general, however, recovery from attacks become less and less complete, and symptoms tend to increase and disability grows. Clinical attacks become less pronounced and remissions tend to disappear, but more CNS tissue has now been destroyed and the cumulative damage is more apparent on MRI's.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0073">The composition of the invention may be used to treat a patient with recent-onset MS, RRMS or SPMS.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0074">The composition of the present invention may reduce or ameliorate one or more of the symptoms of MS, which include reduced or loss of vision, stumbling and uneven gait, slurred speech, urinary frequency and incontinence, mood changes and depression. SPMS can be associated with muscle spasms and severe paralysis.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0075">In particular the composition may ameliorate optical neuritis.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Optical Neuritis</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0076">Optic Neuritis (ON) is an inflammation, with accompanying demyelination, of the optic nerve serving the retina of the eye. It is a variable condition and can present with any of the following symptoms: blurring of vision, loss of visual acuity, loss of some or all colour vision, complete or partial blindness and pain behind the eye.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0077">Optic Neuritis is one of the most frequently presenting symptoms of multiple sclerosis and is the most common symptom at onset of MS. ON can, however, be attributable to causes other than MS, such as ischemic optic neuropathy.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0078">ON presents unilaterally (in one eye only) in 70% of cases.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0079">Most typically, Optic Neuritis first affects people aged between 15 and 50 years of age. In this age group, studies indicate that more than 50% of patients will convert to Multiple Sclerosis within 15 years. As with MS, women are about twice as likely as men to present with ON and the prevalence in Caucasian peoples is higher than in other racial groups.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0080">The main symptoms of Optic Neuritis are:

<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Identification of HLA-DQ6 Restricted Myelin Basic Protein T-cell Epitopes</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0091">MHC Class II genes confer susceptibility to multiple sclerosis (Nepom and Ehrlich (1991) Ann. Rev. Immunol. 9: 493-525). Within Caucasians in Northern and Central Europe, Australia and Northern America the association is linked to the MHC molecule HLA-DR2 (DR2a [DRB5*0101] and DR2b [DRB1*1501], Haines et al (1998) Human Mol. Genet. 7: 1229-1234). Although the DR2 and DQ6 alleles of MHC are found at different loci, there is significant linkage disequilibrium between the two alleles. The concordance between the two alleles is 99%, much greater than expected if the alleles were randomly re-associated. Therefore the possibility arises that certain T-cell epitopes associated with MS may be HLA-DQ6 restricted rather than HLA-DR2 restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0092">The aim of this study was to identify whether human MBP T-cell epitopes are presented by the HLA-DQ6 molecule to T-cell clones isolated from HLA-DR2 positive MS patients. T-cell activation was measured by T-cell proliferation using [<sup>3</sup>H]-Thymidine incorporation.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Peptide Antigens</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0093">MBP peptides 30-44, 130-144 and 139-153 were synthesized using L-amino acids and standard F-moc chemistry on an Abimed AMS 422 multiple peptide synthesiser.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Antigen Presenting Cells</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0094">L-cells transfected with either HLA-DQ6, HLA-DR2a or HLA-DR2b, or Mgar cells (EACC, Porton Down, UK) which express HLA-DQ, DP and DR were used as APCs.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">T-cell Clones</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0095">T-cell clones MS 49:D3 and MS17:A2 were generated from MS patients and clone N5:19 was generated from a normal individual. All three clones were isolated from DR2 positive individuals.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Antigen Presentation Assay</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0096">Antigen presenting cells were incubated with the various concentrations of peptide and the appropriate T-cells. Proliferation, and therefore activation, of the T-cells was measured by [<sup>3</sup>H]-Thymidine incorporation, and expressed as the stimulation index (SI=corrected counts per minute (ccpm) culture containing peptide/ccpm culture without peptide).</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Results</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0097">When peptide MBP 30-44 was presented by L cells transfected with HLA-DQ6, T-cell clone MS 49:D3 gave a very strong proliferative response (1.5 fold greater than to Mgar control cells) at the highest peptide concentration (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). When MBP 130-144 was presented by L cells transfected with HLA-DQ6 an even stronger response was induced in MS17:A2 T-cells (3.24 fold increase in proliferation compared to Mgar control cells &#x2014;<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0098">A third T-cell clone isolated from a DR2 individual N5:19 responded to the major epitope MBP 140-154 and to a series of overlapping 15mer peptides spanning this region (138-156). Peptide 139-153 stimulated proliferation of the N5:19 T-cell clone when presented by HLA-DR2a transfected L-cells, but not HLA-DR2b transfected L-cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0099">T-cell clones isolated from HLA-DR2 positive individuals respond to HLA-DQ6 restricted MBP T-cell epitopes. This implies that the association of HLA-DR2 with multiple sclerosis is not confined to DR2 restriction of MBP T-cell epitopes but may also be DQ6 restricted.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0100">In the MBP composition of the present invention, two of the peptides are HLA-DQ6 binding (MBP 30-44 and 131-145) and two are HLA-DR2 binding (MBP 140-154 and 83-99). Therefore, peptide therapy with these apitopes may be directed to either HLA-DR2 or HLA-DQ6 individuals.</p>

<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Induction of Tolerance with Apitope MS6 in a HLA:DR2 Transgenic Mouse</heading>
<p id="p-0089" num="0101">This study was designed to demonstrate that an apitope (Apitope MS6), when presented by an MHC Class II molecule, can induce immunological tolerance in a humanized mouse model of multiple sclerosis. Apitope MS6 is an apitope selected from within T-cell epitopes of MBP corresponding to MBP 140-154, and is presented by MHC Class II on antigen presenting cells, and can stimulate T-cells without being processed (see WO 03/064464). The mouse model used was transgenic for the human MHC molecule HLA:DR2 (DRB1*1501) (Madsen et al (1999) Nature Genetics 23:343-347).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0102">The induction of anergy or changes in the CD4+ T-cell population in a mouse after administration of an apitope may be monitored by a reduction in T-cell proliferation when challenged with the antigen in vivo.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">Peptide Synthesis</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0103">Apitope MS6 (MBP peptide 140-154) was synthesised using L-amino acids and standard F-moc chemistry on an Abimed AMS 422 multiple peptide synthesiser.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Mice and Tolerance Induction</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0104">HLA:DR2 transgenic mice aged 8-12 weeks were used in the study. The mice were tolerised by pre-treatment with 100 &#x3bc;g of Apitope MS6 in 25 &#x3bc;l of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or 25 &#x3bc;l PBS alone, by intranasal administration on days &#x2212;8, &#x2212;6 and &#x2212;4 prior to immunisation on day 0.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0105">Following tolerisation, mice were immunised subcutaneously with 100 &#x3bc;l of an emulsion containing an equal volume of Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA) and PBS containing 200 &#x3bc;g of Apitope MS6 and 400 &#x3bc;g heat-killed <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>. A control group of mice, previously tolerised with PBS intranasally, were immunised without peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0106">At 10 days post subcutaneous immunisation, draining popliteal and inguinal lymph nodes were removed and T-cell activation was assessed by assaying the proliferation of T-cells in response to various concentrations of Apitope MS6. Proliferation was measured by [<sup>3</sup>H]-Thymidine incorporation, and expressed as the stimulation index (SI=corrected counts per minute (ccpm) culture containing peptide/ccpm culture without peptide).</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">Results</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0107">Group A mice that were tolerised with PBS and then immunised with Apitope MS6 responded to antigenic stimulation when re-challenged with Apitope MS6 in a dose dependent manner (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). With increasing concentration of peptide the SI increased from a median of 2.5 to 10. All the mice in this group demonstrated that PBS administered intranasally could not induce tolerance to Apitope MS6.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0108">In contrast, intranasal pre-treatment with Apitope MS6 had a profound effect on the proliferative response of lymphocytes stimulated with this peptide. Lymphocytes from Group B mice were unable to respond to any significant degree, even at the high peptide concentration of 150 &#x3bc;g/ml (SI median 3, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). These data suggest that Apitope MS6 has induced tolerance in lymphocytes from HLA-DR2 mice.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0109">Lymphocytes extracted from mice which had been pre-treated and immunised with PBS (Group C) failed to show any response to Apitope MS6 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). This lack of response to the peptide within Group C confirms that the proliferative response seen in Group A was indeed a response to immunisation with Apitope MS6.</p>
<p id="h-0027" num="0000">Conclusion</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0110">These data support the hypothesis that an MBP peptide (Apitope MS6) that does not require processing and binds to HLA:DR2 MHC Class II molecules, can induce tolerance when administered intranasally.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0111">This study investigates the ability of Apitope MS7 (MBP peptide 83-99) to induce tolerance in double transgenic mice expressing HLA:DR2 together with the T-cell receptor for the HLA: DR2 bound myelin basic protein (MBP) 82-100 peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0112">Splenocytes from these double transgenic animals proliferate in vitro in response to Apitope MS7. Reduction or abrogation of the in vitro splenocyte response to an apitope following its repeated administration in vivo indicates that a state of tolerance has been achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0113">Tolerance induction has been attempted using both the intranasal and subcutaneous/intradermal routes of apitope administration.</p>
<p id="h-0030" num="0000">Tolerance Induction</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0114">Groups of 6 or 7 age (8-12 weeks) and sex matched double transgenic mice were used. In the first experiment one group was treated ten times intranasally with 100 &#x3bc;g Apitope MS7 in 250 PBS at regular intervals over a period of three weeks. The control group received PBS alone. In the second experiment the same amount of peptide was given by subcutaneous/intradermal administration in 100 &#x3bc;l of PBS. The control group received the same volume of PBS.</p>
<p id="h-0031" num="0000">Proliferation Assay</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0115">Three days after the last administration of peptide or PBS, the spleens were harvested and cell suspensions prepared. The splenocytes were incubation with 0.5 or 5 &#x3bc;g/ml Apitope MS7, and assessed for proliferation by [<sup>3</sup>H]-Thymidine incorporation after 48, 72 and 96 hours of culture. Results are expressed as stimulation indices (SI=counts per minute (cpm) of culture containing antigen/counts per minute without antigen).</p>
<p id="h-0032" num="0000">Cytokine Measurement</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0116">In the second experiment, where tolerance induction was induced via the subcutaneous/intradermal route, cell culture supernatants from the splenocytes were collected at 48 and 72 firs of culture, and assayed for the presence of IFN-&#x3b3; and interleukin-2 (IL-2) using an enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA).</p>
<p id="h-0033" num="0000">Results</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0117">At all three time points investigated, splenocytes from mice treated with PBS via both the intranasal and subcutaneous/intradermal route showed strong proliferation to Apitope MS7, the magnitude of the response increasing with peptide concentration. A striking reduction in proliferation was observed in splenocyte cultures from mice treated with Apitope MS7 by both routes of administration. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, after 72 hrs the mean SI observed with cultures containing 5 &#x3bc;g/ml Apitope MS7 was 17 in mice treated intranasally with Apitope MS7. In the corresponding cultures from control mice treated with PBS a mean SI of 89 was observed. Similarly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> administration of Apitope MS7 by the subcutaneous/intradermal route resulted in a decrease in mean SI from 124 in the PBS treated animals to 49 in animals treated with Apitope MS7.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0118">The levels of IFN&#x3b3; and IL-2 detected in culture supernatants from 48 hr cultures are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The repeated treatment with peptide in vivo is seen to bring about an impressive reduction in secretion of both cytokines, paralleling the reduction in the proliferative response.</p>
<p id="h-0034" num="0000">Conclusion</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0119">These results indicate that tolerance to Apitope MS7 can be successfully induced in a mouse model designed to mimic the human system and supports its potential for use in multiple sclerosis therapy. Furthermore its efficacy is retained when administered by the subcutaneous/intradermal route, the route of choice for humans.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0120">Although the in vivo efficacy of Apitopes MS6 and MS7 has been demonstrated it is not at present possible to demonstrate the efficacy of Apitopes MS1 and MS4. This is because of the lack of transgenic mice expressing the HLA-DQ6 molecule. Mice expressing the molecule have been created, but it has been found that they fail to generate CD4 T-cells in the thymus and do not therefore mount an immune response to antigen in the context of HLA-DQ6.</p>

<heading id="h-0038" level="1">Monitoring Visual Acuity</heading>
<p id="p-0111" num="0123">Optic Neuritis (ON) is an inflammation, with accompanying demyelination, of the Optic Nerve serving the retina of the eye. ON is one of the most frequently presenting symptoms of multiple sclerosis, and is the most common symptom at onset of MS.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0124">Typical symptoms of ON include: blurring of vision, loss of visual acuity, loss of some or all colour vision, complete or partial blindness and pain behind the eye.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0125">The effect of treatment with ATX-MS-1467 on optic neuritis resulting from the neuroinflammatory process involved in MS was investigated. ATX-MS-1467 was given following the dose-escalation protocol outlined above, then one month following treatment the patient's visual acuity was tested using a standard Snellens chart (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0126">The results show a clinically significant improvement in visual acuity one month post treatment. This was demonstrated in analysis of the initial visual acuity examination at screening compared to the one month follow up test. Initial screening sight measurements of 6/24 and 6/9 (in right and left eyes respectively) improved to 6/9 (right eye) and 6/6 (left eye) post treatment.

<p id="p-0117" num="0129">Blood samples were collected at visits 1 and visits 3 to 9 and tested for immune responses to various antigens including purified protein derivative (PPD) of <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>, as a positive control, purified human myelin basic protein (MBP) and ATX-MS-1467. The immune responses to be measured include in vitro T-cell proliferation, secretion of cytokines into tissue culture supernatants and generation of cytokine RNA.</p>
<p id="h-0041" num="0000">Results</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0130">A significant response to MBP was seen, with a peak in proliferation at visit 3 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). This correlated with a peak in secretion of interferon gamma. Importantly, however, the level of interferon gamma secretion fell after the third visit and was at background level by visit 8. IL-10 levels did not change significantly until visit 7 at which point there was a significant increase in secretion of this cytokine. Levels of IL-4, IL-5 and TNF alpha were close to background in response to MBP at all time points.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0131">No proliferative response or increased cytokine response was observed to ATX-MS-1467 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>).</p>
<p id="h-0042" num="0000">Conclusion</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0132">A response to MBP was observed at visit three demonstrating a heightened secretion of IL-2 and interferon gamma, correlating with a peak in proliferation at this time point. This increase in response is thought to be attributable to the administration of peptides.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0133">Importantly, however, the transient increase in cytokine secretion was followed by a return to baseline levels of interferon gamma. There was also a significant increase in IL-10 secretion following the second administration of ATX-MS-1467 at the highest dose. It has previously been reported that, in animal models, specific immunotherapy with synthetic peptides is effective and results in the induction of IL-10 secreting regulatory T cells. The induction of IL-10 secreting regulatory T cells in mice involves a transient response to peptides with secretion of interferon gamma at low levels (Burkhart et al., 1999 Int Immunol 11: 1625-1634; Sundstedt et al., 2003 J Immunol 170:1240-1248). This is followed by a decrease in interferon gamma and a concomitant increase in IL-10. The kinetics of cytokine secretion displayed following treatment with ATX-MS-1467 effectively reproduces the pattern previously observed in experimental mice, suggesting that ATX-MS-1467 may induce IL-10 secreting regulatory T cells.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0136">Treatment of patients with ATX-MS-1467 did not generate anti-peptide antibodies. This indicates that the use of ATX-MS-1467 is safe and correlates with the lack of injection site complications or allergic manifestations associated with the trial.</p>

The three individuals who responded to MBP at V1 all showed a reduction in the response to the protein by V8.

<p id="p-0136" num="0151">96 well plates are coated with 1-10 &#x3bc;g/ml of each apitope MS1, MS4, MS6 or MS7 at pH 9.6 overnight at 4&#xb0; C. Plates are washed four times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, 0.05% Tween (PBS-Tween) and the wells blocked with 5% FCS in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Sera are diluted 1:100 in PBS-Tween and incubated in duplicate wells for one hour at room temperature. After 4 washes, Goat anti-human IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) diluted 1:12 000 in PBS is added to each well and the plates incubated for one hour at room temperature. After 4 washes 0.4 mg/ml of o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride (Sigma) plus 30% hydrogen peroxide is added and incubated at room temperature for 15-20 min. Colour development is stopped with 2.0 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>(50 &#x3bc;l) and optical density values (ODs) measured at 490 nm with an ELISA plate reader. Results are reported as OD for 1:100 diluted sera.</p>
