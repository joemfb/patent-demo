<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/335,256, filed Dec. 31, 2002, which claims priority on U.S. Provisional Patent Application filed Dec. 19, 2002 and entitled &#x201c;Relay Device for Transferring Information Between a Sensor System and a Fluid Delivery System,&#x201d; which is herein specifically incorporated by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Ambulatory pumps and hospital-based fluid delivery systems are used to deliver fluids into the bodies of patients. For some therapies, sensor measurements of a patient's physiological characteristics are used to calculate fluid dosage requirements. Typically, a sensor monitor is used to collect sensor data from a sensor, calibrate the sensor data to generate sensor measurements, and display the sensor measurements. Next, the patient or a caregiver manually calculates the required fluid dosage based on the displayed sensor measurements. Finally, the patient or caregiver programs the pump or fluid delivery system to adjust the fluid dosage.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For example, patients with Type 1 diabetes and some patients with Type 2 diabetes use insulin to control their blood glucose (BG) level. Typically, if a patient's BG level is too high, the patient can inject a &#x201c;bolus&#x201d; (dose) of insulin to lower his/her BG level from its present level to a desired target level. Furthermore, the patient may inject a bolus of insulin in anticipation of ingesting carbohydrates, thus heading off a sharp rise in his/her BG level. Presently, a patient or caregiver must measure the patient's blood glucose using a BG monitoring system, such as a continuous glucose measurement system, a test strip meter, a hospital-based measurement system, or an automated intermittent blood glucose measurement system. When the BG monitoring system has generated a BG measurement, the BG measurement is displayed on the BG monitoring system. Next, the patient or caregiver must visually read and then utilize the BG measurement to manually calculate a required insulin bolus (i.e., the amount of insulin to inject). Finally, once the required insulin bolus is calculated, the patient or caregiver must utilize an insulin delivery device (e.g., infusion pump, injection pen, IV meter, or the like) to deliver the insulin bolus into the patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Unfortunately, this process requires the patient or caregiver to handle several pieces of equipment, including the BG monitoring system and the insulin delivery device, which may discourage the patient or caregiver from using the BG measurements to adjust the insulin dosage, and thus, decrease the efficacy of the insulin delivery device. Additionally, if the BG monitoring system and the insulin delivery device are not developed in conjunction with one another, they typically communicate using different frequencies and/or modes of communication, and as a result, cannot communicate directly with one another. Thus, the patient or caregiver must manually calculate the required insulin bolus and program the insulin delivery device accordingly, which requires effort by the patient or caregiver and is subject to calculation errors. Alternatively, the patient or caregiver must manually enter the BG measurement into an electronic computing device with bolus estimation software for calculating the required insulin bolus (e.g., a computer, the Internet, a personal digital assistant (PDA), or an insulin delivery device, such as an infusion pump, injection pen, IV meter, or the like), which also requires effort by the patient or caregiver and is subject to transcription errors. For example, the patient or caregiver may not accurately enter the BG measurement that is displayed on the BG measurement device into the electronic computing device, and thus, the resulting bolus estimate calculation may not be accurate.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As shown in the drawings for purposes of illustration, the invention is embodied in a relay device for transferring information between a sensor system for measuring a physiological characteristic level of a user's body and a fluid delivery system for delivering fluid into the user's body. The relay device receives information from one system in a first format, converts the information into a second format appropriate for the other system, and then transmits the converted information to the other system. Therefore, the relay device enables communication between the sensor system and the fluid delivery system, even if the systems are not developed in conjunction with one another. For example, sensor data or measurements may be communicated from the sensor system via the relay device to the fluid delivery system, and then utilized to adjust the amount of fluid delivered by the fluid delivery system into the user's body. Thus, the relay device encourages the user or caregiver to utilize the sensor data or measurements in order to adjust the amount of fluid delivered into the user's body by the fluid delivery system. Further, the sensor measurements may be displayed on the fluid delivery system for the user or caregiver to see. Therefore, the relay device allows the user or caregiver to interface with the sensor system (e.g., view the sensor measurements) utilizing a single device, the fluid delivery system. Particular embodiments are directed toward use of ambulatory sensor and fluid delivery systems that are programmed and adjusted primarily by the user or a caregiver, such as the user's parent. Other embodiments are directed toward use of hospital-based sensor and fluid delivery systems that are programmed and adjusted primarily by a caregiver, such as the user's physician or nurse.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In preferred embodiments, the sensor system is a blood glucose (BG) monitoring system, which utilizes a sensor placed in a user to automatically measure the user's BG level, either periodically or continuously. In particular embodiments, the sensor may measure additional physiological characteristic levels of the user, such as blood oxygen, temperature, and the like. The sensor may be implanted in and/or through subcutaneous, dermal, sub-dermal, inter-peritoneal, or peritoneal tissue, and may be a sensor in contact with the user's body fluid, such as the user's blood, interstitial fluid, and the like. In preferred embodiments, the fluid delivery system is an insulin delivery device, such as an external insulin infusion pump, which regulates the amount of insulin delivered into the user's body. The relay device receives information from one system in a first format, converts the information into a second format appropriate for the other system, and then transmits the converted information to the other system. For example, the relay device may receive BG data or measurements from the BG monitoring system in a sensor system format (e.g., at a frequency of 131 kilohertz, utilizing radio frequency (RF) carrier media, in packets of 107 bytes), convert such data or measurements into a delivery system format appropriate for the insulin infusion pump (e.g., to a frequency of 916 megahertz, utilizing infrared (IR) carrier media, in packets of 71 bytes), and then transmit such converted data or measurements to the insulin infusion pump. The amount of insulin delivered into the user's body by the infusion pump may then be adjusted, either manually by the user or a caregiver or automatically, in response to the received BG data or measurements. In some embodiments, the BG measurements may also be displayed on the insulin infusion pump.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">However, in alternative embodiments of the present invention, the sensor system may include other types of sensors, such as optical, enzymatic, fluorescent, or the like. In additional alternative embodiments, the sensor system may measure the user's BG level only when requested by the user, or a BG meter may be utilized to measure the user's BG level based on a sampling of the user's blood. In further alternative embodiments, the sensor system may measure other physiological characteristic levels of the user, such as heart rate, blood oxygen, pH, peroxide, respiratory rate, body temperature, blood pressure, perspiration, brain wave activity, cholesterol level, ketone level, medication concentration, viral load (e.g., HIV), and the like. The sensor system may also include multiple sensors&#x2014;one or more sensors to measure the user's BG level and one or more sensors to measure such other physiological characteristic levels of the user. In other alternative embodiments, the sensor system may measure the physiological characteristic levels of the user from body fluids other than blood, such as interstitial fluid, spinal fluid, saliva, urine, tears, sweat, or the like. In still other alternative embodiments, the fluid delivery system may be an implantable infusion pump, an infusion pump that uses a combination of implantable and external components, a pen injector, a disposable pump, an intra venous drip system, or the like. In yet other alternative embodiments, the fluid delivery system may deliver fluids other than insulin, including peptides, proteins, sugars, vitamins, antigens, hormones, steroids, medicaments, drugs, pain killers, anti-cancer agents, anti-coagulants, stimulants, tranquilizers, sedatives, and the like. Particular embodiments are directed towards use in humans; however, alternative embodiments may be used in animals.</p>
