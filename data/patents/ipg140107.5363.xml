<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A data storage device (DSD) tester is disclosed for testing a DSD. The DSD tester comprises control circuitry operable to receive production line data through an interface, wherein the production line data is related to the DSD. The control circuitry executes a DSD test on the DSD, and transmits failure data generated by the DSD test and the production line data to a failure information database.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Data storage devices (DSDs), such as disk drives and solid state drives are employed in numerous applications such as computer systems (e.g., desktops, laptops, portables, etc.) and consumer devices (e.g., music players, cell phones, cameras, etc.). An original equipment manufacture (OEM) will typically purchase DSDs in bulk from a DSD manufacturer for use in the OEM's product. Before and/or after installing the DSD, the OEM will perform a number of tests to verify the DSD is not defective. If a problem is detected, the OEM will return the defective DSD to the manufacturer and request a replacement DSD. The DSD manufacturer may also perform a number of production line tests to detect problems prior to shipping a DSD to an OEM, as well as test a DSD when it is returned by an OEM or by a consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows components of a prior art DSD in the form of a disk drive including a head <b>2</b> actuated over a disk <b>4</b> comprising a plurality of tracks <b>6</b> defined by embedded servo sectors <b>8</b><sub>0</sub>-<b>8</b><sub>N</sub>. The disk drive further comprises control circuitry <b>10</b> for demodulating a read signal <b>12</b> when reading the servo sectors <b>8</b><sub>0</sub>-<b>8</b><sub>N </sub>and generating a position error signal (PES) of the head <b>2</b> relative to a target track <b>6</b>. The PES is filtered with a suitable compensation filter to generate a control signal <b>14</b> applied to a voice coil motor <b>16</b> which rotates an actuator arm <b>18</b> to move the head <b>2</b> radially over the disk <b>4</b> in a direction that reduces the PES.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The disk drive may comprise a number of logs, such as a manufacture log <b>20</b> storing manufacturing data of the disk drive, and Self-Monitoring, Analysis, and Reporting Technology (S.M.A.R.T.) log <b>22</b> for storing diagnostic information used to for failure prediction. The disk drive may also comprise a drive self test (DST) <b>24</b> executed internally by the control circuitry <b>10</b> to quickly verify whether the disk drive is functioning correctly. However, the DST <b>24</b> performs a limited number of rudimentary tests that may not accurately detect a defect, leading to defective disk drives being installed into OEM products. Ultimately, the defective disk drives will fail while deployed in the field, leading to an expensive repair and/or return of the OEM products. Alternatively, the DST <b>24</b> or other OEM production line test may falsely detect a defective disk drive that is returned unnecessarily to the disk drive manufacturer.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> show a data storage device (DSD) tester <b>26</b> for testing a DSD <b>28</b>B<sub>2</sub>. The DSD tester <b>26</b> comprises control circuitry operable to execute the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, wherein production line data is received through an interface (step <b>30</b>), and the production line data is related to the DSD <b>28</b>B<sub>2</sub>. The control circuitry executes a DSD test on the DSD <b>28</b>B<sub>2 </sub>(step <b>32</b>), and transmits failure data generated by the DSD test and the production line data to a manufacturer of the DSD <b>28</b>B<sub>2 </sub>(step <b>34</b>). Any suitable test may be used to determine appropriate failure data. For example, some embodiments include performing tests that will be described in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a number of production lines process the DSDs in an assembly line fashion, wherein each production line comprises a plurality of test stations for performing a particular operation on the DSDs. For example, an OEM may install a DSD in the form of a disk drive or solid state drive into a suitable consumer device, such as a desktop or laptop computer. Before and/or after installing the DSD into the consumer device, a number of production line tests are performed on the DSD at various test stations. For example, a first test station may copy a test image onto the DSD, a second test station may perform various diagnostics using the test image, a third test station may install an operating system on the DSD, and a fourth test station may configure the operating system, for example, based on the country the consumer device will be sold. While at each production line test station, a problem may be detected with the DSD, such as problems identified internally by the control circuitry of the DSD (e.g., write/read errors, servoing errors, voltage regulation errors, timing errors, etc.) or errors identifying by an operator (e.g., acoustic noise of the DSD being too high, the DSD being completely non-responsive, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A DSD may fail for a number of reasons, such as defects in the components of the DSD or defects in the components of the consumer device, a defect in manufacturing the DSD, or a defect in a production line. For example, the DSD may be manufactured with a defective storage medium (e.g., defective magnetic disk) which prevents proper storage and retrieval of user data. In another example, a consumer device may be manufactured with a defective component (e.g., a fan) that may interfere with the proper operation of the DSD. In yet another example, a production line may comprise a defective assembly tool (e.g., a defective torque driver) that damages the DSD when installed into a chassis of the consumer device. In still another example, a production line may comprise a defective power supply that powers the DSD during testing.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">When a DSD fails at a production line test station, rather than immediately return it to the DSD manufacturer or discard it as defective, the DSD is tested on the DSD tester <b>26</b>. If the DSD passes the DSD test, it may be re-inserted back into the production line (e.g., at the beginning of the production line). If the DSD fails the DSD test, it may be discarded or returned to the manufacturer for repair. In any event, the failure data and associated production line data may be aggregated and then evaluated to identify and correct problems associated with the production line, or the manufacturing process of the DSD. For example, a defective assembly tool or power supply at a test station of a particular production line may need to be replaced to resolve the problem. In another example, the process of manufacturing a component of the DSD (e.g., storage medium, read head, semiconductor memory, etc.) may be modified in order to resolve the problem. In one embodiment, the correlation between the failure data generated by the DSD tester <b>26</b> and the production line data helps pinpoint and resolve errors that may otherwise go undetected for an extended period.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The production line data associated with a failed DSD and entered into the DSD tester <b>26</b> may comprise any suitable data, such as a production line number, and/or a test station within a production line where the DSD failed. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a DSD <b>28</b>B<sub>2 </sub>that fails during a production line test is inserted into a bay of the DSD tester <b>26</b>. A chassis <b>36</b> comprising a plurality of bays receives the DSDs, wherein the chassis <b>36</b> is connected to a GUI computer comprising a desktop box <b>38</b>, a monitor <b>40</b>, and a keyboard <b>42</b>. In one embodiment, after an operator inserts the DSD <b>28</b>B<sub>2 </sub>into one of the bays, the operator enters the production line data using the keyboard <b>42</b> (and/or mouse). For example, the GUI computer may display a window application comprising suitable input fields (text boxes, check boxes, drop-down menus, etc.). In addition to receiving the production line data from an operator of the DSD tester <b>26</b>, the DSD tester <b>26</b> may receive configuration information from the inserted DSD <b>28</b>B<sub>2</sub>, such as a serial number, manufacturing logs, operating logs, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an embodiment of the present invention wherein a chassis <b>36</b> of a DSD tester comprises three bays each for receiving a DSD. In other embodiments, more or less bays may be used. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the chassis <b>36</b> further comprises at least one light per bay for displaying a status of the DSD test. For example, the chassis <b>36</b> may comprise a first light <b>44</b> illuminated when the inserted DSD is being tested, a second light <b>46</b> illuminated when the DSD passes the test, and a third light <b>48</b> illuminated when the DSD fails the test. In other embodiments, two or more of the lights may be combined, for example, using one light to display a pass/fail status (e.g., using green and red illumination).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a GUI according to an embodiment of the present invention corresponding to the three bay chassis <b>36</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this embodiment, a dialog is displayed for each bay, wherein the dialog displays a serial number/model number of the inserted DSD, a status bar showing a progress of the DSD test, a button to view a log associated with the DSD test, and a button to cancel/retry the DSD test. In one embodiment, the GUI is updated automatically when a DSD is inserted into one of the bays, and in one embodiment, the DSD test is automatically started. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows an example wherein a first DSD has been inserted into the first bay, the DSD test automatically started (independent of operator input), and the GUI automatically updated to reflect the status of the DSD test. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows an example wherein a second DSD has been inserted into the second bay, the GUI automatically updated, and the DSD test automatically started on the second DSD concurrent with continuing the DSD test on the first DSD. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> shows an example wherein the GUI indicates 10 minutes remaining to test the first DSD, and 25 minutes reaming to test the second DSD. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> shows an example wherein the DSD test on the first DSD has completed successfully, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> shows an example wherein the DSD test on the second DSD failed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> also illustrates a third DSD inserted into the third bay, the GUI automatically updated, and the DSD test automatically started and running. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref> illustrates an example wherein after the second DSD is removed from the second bay, the GUI is automatically updated to reflect that the second bay is now empty.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention wherein when the DSD tester detects that a DSD has been inserted (or connected) (step <b>50</b>), a light on the chassis of the DSD tester is controlled to indicate the DSD testing is in progress (step <b>52</b>). The GUI is automatically updated independent of operator input (step <b>54</b>), and the DSD test is automatically started (step <b>56</b>). While testing the DSD, the flow diagram may be re-executed if another DSD is inserted (or connected). When the DSD test finishes (step <b>58</b>), if the DSD passes the test (step <b>60</b>) a light is controlled to indicate the test passed (step <b>62</b>), and if the DSD fails the test a light is controlled to indicate the test failed (step <b>64</b>). When the DSD is removed (or disconnected) (step <b>66</b>), the GUI is updated automatically to reflect the change in the DSD tester (step <b>68</b>). In one embodiment, the DSD tester detects that a DSD has been inserted or removed by periodically polling each bay to determine whether a DSD responds with an appropriate response.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows a DSD tester <b>26</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention wherein the interface for receiving the production line data comprises a barcode reader <b>70</b> for reading barcodes <b>72</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the barcodes <b>72</b> may identify a production line number and a corresponding test station. Also in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> the barcode reader <b>70</b> may be used to read a barcode printed on the DSD <b>28</b>B<sub>2</sub>. For example, the barcode on the DSD <b>28</b>B<sub>2 </sub>may comprise a serial number or a model number, particularly in situations where the serial number or model number is not stored on the DSD <b>28</b>B<sub>2 </sub>or cannot be read from the DSD <b>28</b>B<sub>2</sub>. In one embodiment, the barcodes <b>72</b> may be printed on a sheet that remains at each DSD tester. In an alternative embodiment, the barcodes <b>72</b> may be printed on a card that is attached to a DSD immediately after it fails a production line test. For example, when an operator of a production line test station identifies a failed DSD, they may circle the appropriate barcodes corresponding to the production line and test station, and attach the card to the DSD. When the DSD is processed by the operator of the DSD tester, they scan the circled barcodes on the card in order to enter the production line data into the DSD tester.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> also illustrates an embodiment of the present invention wherein after testing a number of DSDs, the corresponding aggregated failure data and associated production line data is transmitted over the Internet <b>74</b> (e.g., using a File Transaction Protocol (TCP)) to an aggregator server <b>76</b>. An analysis server <b>78</b> periodically checks the aggregator server <b>76</b> and downloads the DSD test data when updated. In one embodiment, the DSD test data is first analyzed to verify it is free of viruses before allowing the DSD test data through a firewall <b>80</b> that protects the analysis server <b>78</b>. The analysis server <b>78</b> processes the DSD test data (e.g., correlates the failure data with the production line data) and then generates a report that can be used to modify the manufacturing process <b>82</b> for the DSD and/or to modify the production line <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows an example report that may be generated by the analysis server <b>78</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, or alternatively generated and displayed by the DSD tester <b>26</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, a number of graphs are generated for each production line wherein the y-axis represents a number of DSDs that were processed by the DSD test and the x-axis represents each test station within the production line. The first graph in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows that Line <b>1</b> generates a high number of failures at all of the test stations, which may indicate a problem with the manufacturing of the DSD rather than a problem with any test station of the production line. The second graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows a high number of failures at Test Station <b>2</b> of Line <b>2</b> which may indicate a problem with the test station rather than with the DSDs. In one embodiment, the y-axis of the graphs may represent only the DSDs that failed the DSD test, and in an alternative embodiment, the y-axis may represent the total number of DSDs tested (regardless as to whether the DSD passed or failed the test). In yet another embodiment, different graphs may be generated that break out the correlation of passed and failed DSDs and the associated production line data. In still another embodiment, each vertical bar in the graphs of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> may be divided into segments representing the type of failure detected by the DSD tester (e.g., write/read error, servo error, memory error, voltage supply error, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is a flow diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention wherein after receiving the production line data (step <b>86</b>) and executing the DSD test (step <b>88</b>), the failure data generated by the DSD test is correlated with the production line data (e.g., as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>) (step <b>90</b>) and the correlated data displayed on a screen (step <b>92</b>). In one embodiment, the correlated data may be displayed on a screen attached to the DSD tester <b>26</b>, and in an alternative embodiment the correlated data is displayed on a screen of a remote computer (e.g., a screen of the analysis server <b>78</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow diagram executed by the control circuitry of the DSD tester <b>26</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention. When a DSD is inserted (or connected) (step <b>94</b>), the DSD tester reads a DSD log from the DSD (step <b>96</b>), wherein the DSD log comprises at least one entry identifying at least one error condition. When executing the DSD test (step <b>98</b>) a sequence of commands associated with the error condition is executed which factors into whether the DSD passes or fails the DSD test (step <b>100</b>). If the DSD fails the DSD test (step <b>100</b>), the failure data related to the type of failure is logged by the DSD tester (step <b>102</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention wherein when a DSD is inserted (or connected) (step <b>104</b>), the DSD tester reads a DSD error log from the DSD (step <b>106</b>). If an entry in the DSD error log identifies a marginal data sector detected during a read operation (step <b>108</b>), the DSD tester determines a sequence of commands to execute associated with the read error, such as a sequence of commands executed proximate the read operation when the marginal data sector was detected. The commands for reading the DSD error log from the DSD, as well as the sequence of commands transmitted to the DSD during the DSD test, may be implemented in any suitable manner, such as with a vendor specific command embedded in an Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) command.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Before executing the sequence of commands, the DSD tester reads the data sectors that were written in the sequence of commands (step <b>110</b>) so that when the write commands are re-executed, the same data can be written to the data sectors (thereby preserving the previously written data). The DSD tester then executes the sequence of commands (step <b>112</b>) in an attempt to recreate the read error detected by the DSD. If the read error re-occurs (step <b>114</b>), an error is saved by the DSD tester (step <b>116</b>) otherwise the DSD tester saves a status of no error (step <b>118</b>). After repeating this process (step <b>120</b>) for all of the marginal data sectors in the DSD error log, the results of the test are evaluated to determine whether the DSD passes or fails (step <b>122</b>). For example, if a predetermined percentage of read errors are recreated, or if a predetermined number of recreated errors exceeds a threshold, the DSD may be designated as failing the test.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention which extends on the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, wherein the DSD tester executes a sequence of commands preceding the read error (step <b>124</b>) and then reads the marginal data sector (step <b>126</b>). If the error is recreated (step <b>128</b>), an error is saved (step <b>130</b>). Otherwise, the DSD tester executes a sequence of commands following the read error (step <b>132</b>) and then reads the marginal data sector (step <b>134</b>). If the error is recreated (step <b>136</b>), an error is saved (step <b>138</b>), otherwise a status of no error is saved (step <b>140</b>). Executing a sequence of commands preceding and following the read error may recreate the error, for example, if the sequence of commands includes write commands that cause adjacent track interference (ATI). Alternatively, executing the sequence of commands may identify an error that does not occur in normal operation, such as a firmware bug that only manifests itself when a given sequence of commands is executed while each individual command alone would not cause an error condition.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention which extends on the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, wherein the DSD tester margins channel parameters (step <b>142</b>) prior to executing the sequence of commands (step <b>112</b>) in order to increase the likelihood of recreating the read error. Any suitable channel parameters may be margined, such as increasing a fly-height of a write element and/or read element, decreasing a write current or voltage, decreasing a read current or voltage, adding a tracking error, adding noise or an offset to a read signal, adjusting a supply voltage, adding timing jitter, etc. Margining channel parameters to recreate an error may provide insight into what caused the error before the DSD was coupled with the DSD tester. For example, a problem with an OEM line (e.g., too much vibration) may be identified if a number of DSDs from the OEM line are identified as creating a similar type of error when the same channel parameters are margined in the same way.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a flow diagram according to an embodiment of the present invention which extends on the flow diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, wherein the DSD tester reads a retry log from the DSD (step <b>144</b>) associated with the marginal data sector. That is, when the DSD detected the marginal data sector, it may have executed a retry procedure in an attempt to recover the data sector. In one embodiment, an entry is created in the DSD error log if the marginal data sector could not be recovered using the retry procedure. The DSD tester then re-executes the same retry procedure (step <b>146</b>) as part of the DSD test. If the error does not re-occur (i.e., if the data sector is recoverable) (step <b>148</b>), then a status of no error is saved (step <b>150</b>). If the error re-occurs (step <b>148</b>), the DSD tester may adjust the retry procedure, for example, by lengthening a number of iterations during a particular step of the retry procedure, or by adjusting the order of steps executed during the retry procedure. The retry procedure may be adjusted several times wherein the marginal data sector may eventually be recovered, or deemed unrecoverable (step <b>154</b>) and a corresponding error saved (step <b>156</b>). In one embodiment, the retry procedure adjusted at step <b>152</b> may be used to modify the retry procedure of the DSD under test and/or to adjust the retry procedures of all manufactured DSDs (i.e., the re-optimized retry procedure may be transmitted to the DSD manufacturer where it is used to modify the manufacturing process of the DSDs).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention wherein the DSD maintains a global log identifying a plurality of sequential commands executed by the DSD. For example, the global log may save the last several commands executed by the DSD (hundreds or even thousands of commands). The sequence of commands associated with a read error in the DSD error log comprises at least two subsets of the sequential commands identified by the global log. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, a read error is detected when attempting to read data sector 145657. Accordingly, the DSD tester constructs a sequence of commands from the global log by aggregating several subsets that may have contributed to the read error. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the DSD tester extracts two subsets of previously executed write commands that may have contributed to the read error (e.g., due to ATI). The DSD tester then re-executes the command sequence in an attempt to recreate the read error as described above.</p>
