<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority under 35 USC 119 to Japanese Patent Application No. 2009-198838 filed on Aug. 28, 2009 the entire contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a backrest structure for a motorcycle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A known motorcycle has a backrest that is movable between a raised use position and a lowered non-use position, disposed rearwardly of an occupant's seat. See, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2003-182665. An arrangement is disclosed for a vehicle having such a movable backrest, in which the backrest can be unlocked using a key that permits the starting of an engine and movement of the backrest is disabled at all times except when the occupant intends to move the backrest. See, for example, Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2005-262993 and Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2005-262991.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The arrangement in which the backrest is unlocked with the key, however, requires additional parts such as, for example, a key cylinder. This leads to an increased in the number of parts that are used and a complicated structure for the backrest mechanism. Thus, an increase in the costs results. The arrangement also results in an increased size for the backrest mechanism, which imposes restrictions on the layout.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been made in view of the foregoing situations. It is an object of an embodiment of the present invention to provide a backrest structure for a motorcycle that is structured to be simply movable, yet made inoperative at all times except when an occupant intends to move the backrest.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To solve the above-described problems, according to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a backrest structure for a motorcycle, having a backrest disposed rearwardly of an occupant's seat, the backrest being movable between a raised use position and a lowered non-use position. In this backrest structure, the backrest is disposed on a seat rail and includes an operation lever for raising and lowering the backrest. The operation lever is disposed in the seat rail disposed downwardly of the occupant's seat. In accordance with the foregoing arrangements, the backrest includes the operation lever for raising and lowering the backrest. The operation lever is disposed in the seat rail disposed downwardly of the occupant's seat. Accordingly, the operation lever can be operated only when the occupant's seat is removed. Operation of the backrest can be disabled at all times except when the occupant intends to operate with a simple structure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the above-described arrangements, preferably, the backrest is rotatable inside the seat rail; the backrest includes a rotation fixing member disposed at a rotatable portion of the backrest, the rotation fixing member being fixed at the use position and the non-use position by the operation lever; and the rotation fixing member fixes the backrest and the seat rail at the use position and the non-use position. In the foregoing arrangements, the backrest and the seat rail can be rigidly fixed in place.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the above-described arrangements, preferably, the operation lever is disposed on either side of the backrest structure in a crosswise direction; and the backrest is movable when the two operation levers are operated simultaneously. An arrangement can therefore be made in which left and right fixing portions are operated by each of the operation levers based on a structure for fixing the left and right sides of the backrest. A more rigid fixing structure for the backrest can therefore be achieved as compared with fixing of the backrest only on one side.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the above-described arrangements, preferably, the backrest structure further includes a restriction member disposed at the seat rail, the restriction member for restricting an operation range of the operation lever. This arrangement prevents the operation lever from coming off position.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In addition, in the above-described arrangements, preferably, the backrest structure further includes a cushioning member disposed at least between the seat rail and the operation lever or between the operation lever and the restriction member, the cushioning member for cushioning interference. This prevents vehicle body oscillations from being transmitted to the operation lever or the operation lever from being rubbed against other parts.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the above-described arrangements, preferably, the backrest structure further includes another fixing portion for fixing the backrest and the seat rail when the backrest is not in use, in addition to the rotation fixing member. This fixes the backrest and the seat rail more reliably when the backrest is not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, in the foregoing arrangements, the backrest may be for either a rider or a non-rider, which makes the backrest structure highly versatile.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, the operation lever for raising and lowering the backrest is disposed in the seat rail disposed downwardly of the occupant's seat. Operation of the backrest can therefore be disabled at all times except when the occupant intends to operate with a simple structure.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">If the backrest is rotatable inside the seat rail, the backrest includes the rotation fixing member, which is fixed at the use position and the non-use position by the operation lever, disposed at the rotatable portion of the backrest. If the rotation fixing member fixes the backrest and the seat rail at the use position and the non-use position, then the backrest and the seat rail can be rigidly fixed in place.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">If the operation lever is disposed on either side of the backrest structure in the crosswise direction and the backrest is movable when the two operation levers are operated simultaneously, then a more rigid fixing structure for the backrest can be achieved as compared with fixing of the backrest only on one side.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">If the backrest structure further includes the restriction member for restricting the operation range of the operation lever, disposed at the seat rail, then the operation lever can be prevented from the coming off position.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">If the backrest structure further includes the cushioning member for cushioning interference disposed at least between the seat rail and the operation lever or between the operation lever and the restriction member, then the operation lever can be prevented from being rubbed against other parts.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">If the backrest structure further includes another fixing portion for fixing the backrest and the seat rail when the backrest is not in use, in addition to the rotation fixing member, then the backrest and the seat rail can be fixed more reliably when the backrest is not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In addition, if the backrest is for either the rider or the non-rider, the backrest structure can be highly versatile.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Specific embodiments to which the present invention is applied will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a side elevational view showing a backrest structure for a motorcycle according to a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The motorcycle to which the backrest structure according to the first embodiment of the present invention is applied is a two-seater vehicle in which a rider and a passenger (non-rider) can be on board in tandem. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an occupant's seat <b>11</b> is an integral seat integrally forming a rider's seat disposed on a front side and a passenger's seat (non-rider's seat) disposed on a rear side. In addition, the occupant's seat <b>11</b> is configured removably using a key that permits engine starting by a seat lock mechanism having a key cylinder not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A seat rail <b>21</b> forms part of a vehicle body frame to support the occupant's seat <b>11</b>. A movable passenger's backrest <b>31</b> (also called a seatback) is disposed on the seat rail <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a condition in which the occupant's seat <b>11</b> is removed from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a front view of parts shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the backrest <b>31</b> is disposed rearwardly of the occupant's seat <b>11</b> and stands upright at a position near a rear end of the occupant's seat <b>11</b> to support a back of a passenger sitting in a rear portion of the occupant's seat <b>11</b>. When not in use, the backrest <b>31</b> is lowered rearwardly to be stowed in a recessed portion <b>21</b>H in the seat rail <b>21</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a plan view showing the seat rail <b>21</b> when the backrest <b>31</b> is in a non-use position. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the backrest <b>31</b> as seen from a back side thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the backrest <b>31</b> as seen from a forward direction. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>, when the backrest <b>31</b> is stowed in the recessed portion <b>21</b>H in the seat rail <b>21</b>, an upper surface <b>31</b>U of the backrest <b>31</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>) is substantially flush with an upper surface <b>21</b>U of the seat rail <b>21</b> (excluding the recessed portion <b>21</b>H) so that the upper surfaces offer a flat surface to serve as a backrest-cum-carrier.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The seat rail <b>21</b> includes a pair of left and right seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b>, a base portion <b>23</b>, and a pair of left and right grab rails <b>24</b>, <b>24</b>. More specifically, the seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b> extend longitudinally along the vehicle. The base portion <b>23</b> connects between rear end portions <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>A of the seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b> and extends rearwardly to serve as a carrier portion (=a cargo deck). The grab rails <b>24</b>, <b>24</b> serve as portions onto which the passenger can hold. The seat rail <b>21</b> is integrally molded through casting, such as, for example, diecast molding, using a metal material such as an aluminum alloy or a magnesium alloy. Instead of using the metal material, another stiff material may be used for the one-piece molding, such as a synthetic resin having stiffness.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The seat rail <b>21</b> is formed into an inclined shape extending upwardly toward the rear in a side view (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). More specifically, the left and right seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b> extend substantially in parallel with each other upwardly toward the rear. The rear end portions <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>A of the seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b> curve upwardly and thereby widen a vertical width of the seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 2</figref>). The grab rails <b>24</b>, <b>24</b> have rear end portions connected to outside surfaces of the vertically wide rear end portions <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>A and front end portions connected to outsides of front end portions <b>22</b>B, <b>22</b>B of the seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>, the base portion <b>23</b> connects between the rear end portions <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>A of the pair of left and right seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b> and extends upwardly toward the rear planarly so as to be continuous with upper surfaces of the rear end portions <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>A. In addition, the base portion <b>23</b> has a front end portion <b>23</b>A that is formed to be the widest. More specifically, the front end portion <b>23</b>A is formed to be wide enough to connect between the rear end portions <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>A of the pair of left and right seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b>. The base portion <b>23</b> is gradually narrower toward the rear and has a rear end portion <b>23</b>B that is the narrowest (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The foregoing arrangements allow the seat rail <b>21</b> to be lighter in weight toward the rear, contributing to concentration of mass of the vehicle body.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In this case, the base portion <b>23</b> connects between the rear end portions <b>22</b>A, <b>22</b>A of the seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b>, so that the base portion <b>23</b> serves also as a rear cross member that connects between, and reinforces, the seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b>. In addition, the front end portions <b>22</b>B, <b>22</b>B of the seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b> are connected by a one-piece molded front cross member <b>25</b> having a cross section of a U-shape turned sideways. This achieves sufficient general stiffness for the seat rail <b>21</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 6</figref>, grommets <b>26</b> are provided for mounting vehicle body covers not shown (more specifically, a pair of left and right rear covers) on left and right sides of the seat rail <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The base portion <b>23</b> includes the upwardly open recessed portion <b>21</b>H in which the backrest <b>31</b> fits and is stowed. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the recessed portion <b>21</b>H has a downwardly recessed shape to follow along an outline shape of the backrest <b>31</b>, so that the backrest <b>31</b> when lowered can be fitted therein. More specifically, the backrest <b>31</b> is formed to include integrally a pair of left and right column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b>, a bridge portion <b>33</b>, and a seatback portion <b>34</b>. More specifically, the column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> are formed of a stiff material, such as a resin or a metal. The bridge portion <b>33</b> is formed of a stiff material and connects between longitudinally intermediate portions of the left and right column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b>. The seatback portion <b>34</b> bridges leading end portions of the left and right column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> and is covered with a cushioning material. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the recessed portion <b>21</b>H includes recesses <b>21</b>HA, <b>21</b>HA, <b>21</b>HB, <b>21</b>HC in which or from which each of different parts of the backrest <b>31</b> (the column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b>, the bridge portion <b>33</b>, and the seatback portion <b>34</b>) can be fitted or removed.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The recessed portion <b>21</b>H including the recesses <b>21</b>HA, <b>21</b>HB, <b>21</b>HC further includes a water drain hole <b>21</b>J for draining rainwater that gets in the recessed portion <b>21</b>H. As described earlier, the seat rail <b>21</b> is the inclined shape extending upwardly toward the rear. The recessed portion <b>21</b>H is therefore also an inclined shape extending upwardly toward the rear, so that rainwater that gets in the recessed portion <b>21</b>H flows toward a front side of the vehicle body along a bottom surface of the recessed portion <b>21</b>H through an action of gravity. The recessed portion <b>21</b>H therefore includes a plurality of water drain hole <b>21</b>J. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, a plurality of water drain holes <b>21</b>J (four according to the first embodiment of the present invention) is formed at a front end portion of the recessed portion <b>21</b>H, more specifically, at front end portions of the left and right recesses <b>21</b>HA, <b>21</b>HA, so that rainwater in the recessed portion <b>21</b>H can be properly drained.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The backrest <b>31</b> is supported rotatably in a folding direction by a pair of left and right shaft support members <b>41</b>, <b>41</b> disposed inwardly of the seat rail <b>21</b> and extending in a vehicle width direction, when proximal end portions of the left and right column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> fit into the recesses <b>21</b>HA, <b>21</b>HA.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows the backrest <b>31</b> together with surrounding parts. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(A) and 8(B)</figref> are side elevational views showing one of the column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> of the backrest <b>31</b> as viewed from an outside and an inside in the vehicle width direction, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, each of the shaft support members <b>41</b>, <b>41</b> includes a tube part <b>42</b>, a bolt <b>43</b>, and a nut <b>44</b>. The tube parts <b>42</b>, <b>42</b> penetrate through the left and right recesses <b>21</b>HA, <b>21</b>HA in the base portion <b>23</b> and the column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> of the backrest <b>31</b>. The bolts <b>43</b>, <b>43</b> are inserted from first end sides (outside of the seat rail <b>21</b> in the vehicle width direction) of the tube parts <b>42</b>, <b>42</b>. The nuts <b>44</b>, <b>44</b> are fastened on leading ends of the bolts <b>43</b>, <b>43</b> that are passed into the tube parts <b>42</b>, <b>42</b>. As a result, the backrest <b>31</b> is smoothly rotatably and pivotally supported on the pair of left and right shaft support members <b>41</b>, <b>41</b> that extend in the vehicle width direction.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this case, the proximal end portions of the left and right column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> fit into the front end portions of the recesses <b>21</b>HA, <b>21</b>HA so that the column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> are located at the front end portion <b>23</b>A of the base portion <b>23</b>. The shaft support members <b>41</b>, <b>41</b> are thus supported by the front end portion <b>23</b>A of the base portion <b>23</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The front end portion <b>23</b>A of the base portion <b>23</b> is wide and has a high strength, so that supporting stiffness for the shaft support members <b>41</b>, <b>41</b> can be easily ensured and supporting strength for the backrest <b>31</b> can be easily ensured. The support member <b>41</b> may be configured otherwise; for example, the backrest <b>31</b> may be rotatably supported by only the bolts <b>43</b>, <b>43</b> and the nuts <b>44</b>, <b>44</b> with no tube parts <b>42</b>, <b>42</b> used. Alternatively, another well-known shaft support structure may be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A lock mechanism <b>50</b> that fixes a rotatable position of the backrest <b>31</b> at a raised use position or a lowered non-use position will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The lock mechanism <b>50</b> includes a pair of left and right rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> that are supported so as to be transversely movable through corresponding ones of the pair of left and right recesses <b>21</b>HA, <b>21</b>HA in the base portion <b>23</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7</figref>, <b>8</b>(A), and <b>8</b>(B), the pair of left and right rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> is a rotation fixing member that penetrates through the proximal end portions of the column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> which serve as a rotatable portion of the backrest <b>31</b>, thereby restricting a pivotal motion of the backrest <b>31</b> about the shaft support members <b>41</b>, <b>41</b> and locking the rotatable position of the backrest <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8(A) and 8(B)</figref>, a first through hole <b>36</b> is provided through which the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> penetrate when the backrest <b>31</b> is in the use position. A second through hole <b>37</b> is provided through which the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> penetrate when the backrest <b>31</b> is in the non-use position. The column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> of the backrest <b>31</b> have a pair of each of these positioning through holes <b>36</b>, <b>37</b> formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">More specifically, the pair of left and right rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> penetrates through a pair of left and right shaft support bodies <b>23</b>X, <b>23</b>X that are integrally formed with the base portion <b>23</b> on a back side thereof. Each of the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> is supported movably in a direction in which the rotation fixing shaft <b>51</b> penetrates through the shaft support body <b>23</b>X, specifically, in the vehicle width direction and rotatable thereabout. In addition, a diameter increasing part <b>52</b> that increases a diameter in an outer peripheral direction is fixed on each of the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> between each pair of the shaft support bodies <b>23</b>X, <b>23</b>X and the column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> of the backrest <b>31</b>. The diameter increasing part <b>52</b> may be integrally formed with, or separately formed and fixed on, the rotation fixing shaft <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The diameter increasing part <b>52</b> functions also as a spring retainer. More specifically, a coil spring <b>53</b> as an elastic member is inserted between the diameter increasing part <b>52</b> and the shaft support body <b>23</b>X. Each of the pair of left and right coil springs <b>53</b>, <b>53</b> urges a corresponding one of the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> outwardly in the vehicle width direction.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the rotation fixing shaft <b>51</b> is formed to have a length as detailed in the following. More specifically, when moved outwardly in the vehicle width direction by an urging force of the coil spring <b>53</b>, the rotation fixing shaft <b>51</b> is long enough to penetrate through the first or second through hole <b>36</b> or <b>37</b> in the column portion <b>32</b> of the backrest <b>31</b> rotatably supported by the base portion <b>23</b>; when moved inwardly in the vehicle width direction by opposing the urging force of the coil spring <b>53</b>, the rotation fixing shaft <b>51</b> is short enough not to penetrate through the first or second through hole <b>36</b> or <b>37</b> in the column portion <b>32</b> of the backrest <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">More specifically, the lock mechanism <b>50</b> can unlock the rotatable position of the backrest <b>31</b> by moving the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> inwardly in the vehicle width direction to retract from the first or second through hole <b>36</b> or <b>37</b> in the column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> of the backrest <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention, the lock mechanism <b>50</b> further includes a pair of left and right operation levers (operators) <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> that unlock the lock mechanism <b>50</b> to thereby fold the backrest <b>31</b>. Each of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> is disposed at an inward end portion of the rotation fixing shaft <b>51</b> in the vehicle width direction (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). Each of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> has a lever shape that extends perpendicularly (in the forward direction of the vehicle body according to the first embodiment of the present invention) relative to each of the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> from the inward end portion thereof in the vehicle width direction. The operation lever <b>55</b> may be integrally formed with the rotation fixing shaft <b>51</b> or separately formed and fixed thereto using various types of joining methods.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A wall portion <b>23</b>A<b>1</b> (hereinafter referred to as a front wall <b>23</b>A<b>1</b>) of the front end portion <b>23</b>A of the base portion <b>23</b> includes an opening portion <b>57</b> that extends crosswise with a centerline in the vehicle width direction as a crosswise center. The above-described left and right operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> have leading ends exposed to a downward space of the occupant's seat <b>11</b> through the opening portion <b>57</b>. Therefore, the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> can be operated from the outside only when the occupant's seat <b>11</b> is removed at which time the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> are exposed to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The opening portion <b>57</b> will be described in detail in the following. More specifically, the opening portion <b>57</b> includes a pair of left and right horizontally long openings <b>57</b>A, <b>57</b>A and a pair of left and right vertically long openings <b>57</b>B, <b>57</b>B. The horizontally long opening <b>57</b>A guides the operation lever <b>55</b> movably in the vehicle width direction. The vertically long opening <b>57</b>B extends downwardly from a corresponding outside end portion in the vehicle width direction of the horizontally long opening <b>57</b>A and positions the operation lever <b>55</b> at a corresponding outside position in the vehicle width direction in the opening portion <b>57</b>. In addition, a restriction plate (restriction member) <b>58</b> is fixed by a bolt <b>59</b> to the base portion <b>23</b> between the left and right horizontally long openings <b>57</b>A, <b>57</b>A. The restriction plate <b>58</b> restricts movement of each of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>. The operation lever <b>55</b>, when moved inwardly in the vehicle width direction, abuts against the restriction plate <b>58</b> so that the operation lever <b>55</b> can be prevented from being moved any further.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When an occupant uses a key to remove the occupant's seat <b>11</b>, he or she becomes able to operate the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(A)</figref>, when the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> are moved into the vertically long openings <b>57</b>B, <b>57</b>B by way of the horizontally long openings <b>57</b>A, <b>57</b>A, the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> fixed to the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> are moved outwardly in the vehicle width direction. The rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> are then located so as to penetrate through the first through hole <b>36</b> or the second through hole <b>37</b> in the backrest <b>31</b>, so that the backrest <b>31</b> can be locked in the use position or the non-use position.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this case, the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> are urged outwardly in the vehicle width direction by the coil springs <b>53</b>, <b>53</b>. The operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> can therefore be moved outwardly in the vehicle width direction automatically without an operator's (the rider's or the passenger's) having to operate the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> hard, so that the locking operation can be performed with ease. In addition, once the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> fit into the vertically long openings <b>57</b>B, <b>57</b>B, the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> can no longer be moved in the crosswise direction, thus achieving a positive lock.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention, when the occupant's seat <b>11</b> is mounted as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> with the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> located in the vertically long openings <b>57</b>B, <b>57</b>B, a bottom plate (seat bottom plate) <b>11</b>T of the occupant's seat <b>11</b> abuts on to press downward leading end portions <b>55</b>A of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>. If, therefore, the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> are not in the vertically long openings <b>57</b>B, <b>57</b>B, specifically, if the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> are located in the horizontally long openings <b>57</b>A, <b>57</b>A, the leading end portions <b>55</b>A of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> are located upwardly to defy the mounting of the occupant's seat <b>11</b>. Consequently, the occupant's seat <b>11</b> can be mounted only when the backrest <b>31</b> is appropriately locked and, if the occupant's seat <b>11</b> cannot be mounted, the occupant can be signaled that the backrest <b>31</b> is not locked properly.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The leading end portions <b>55</b>A, <b>55</b>A of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> are formed into bent plate portions that are bent inwardly in the vehicle width direction. These bent plate portions abut on the bottom plate <b>11</b>T of the occupant's seat <b>11</b>. As a result, a wider contact area can be achieved between the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> and the occupant's seat <b>11</b>, so that stress concentration on the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> or the occupant's seat <b>11</b> can be avoided. Further, the operator (occupant) can more easily hook his or her finger on the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>, leading to an improved operability of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9(B)</figref>, when the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> are moved inwardly in the vehicle width direction into the horizontally long openings <b>57</b>A, <b>57</b>A, the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> fixed to the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> are also moved in the same direction. The rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> are then located at retracted positions, at which the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> penetrate through neither the first through hole <b>36</b> nor the second through hole <b>37</b> in the backrest <b>31</b>, so that the backrest <b>31</b> can be unlocked. In this case, in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention, the position at which the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> are close together is an unlock position. The operator can therefore operate the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> to unlock with one hand. Moreover, the restriction plate <b>58</b> restricts an inward operating range of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> in the vehicle width direction. This prevents the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> from coming off the shaft support bodies <b>23</b>X, <b>23</b>X of the seat rail <b>21</b>, thereby positively preventing the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> from coming off the seat rail <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The operator can therefore, while holding the unlocked state with one hand, easily rotate the backrest <b>31</b> with the other hand that is not being used for operating the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>. The backrest <b>31</b> can thus be easily adjusted between the use position and the non-use position.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> are mounted with rubber sheets <b>60</b>. The rubber sheets <b>60</b> are disposed on both sides of each of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>, specifically, insides and outsides in the vehicle width direction of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>. The rubber sheets <b>60</b> serve as cushioning members that cushion interference with the seat rail <b>21</b> and the restriction plate <b>58</b>. The rubber sheets <b>60</b> can prevent vehicle body oscillations from being transmitted to the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> or the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> from being rubbed against other parts (the seat rail <b>21</b> and the restriction plate <b>58</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention, the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> are supported, as with the shaft support members <b>41</b>, <b>41</b>, by the front end portion <b>23</b>A of the base portion <b>23</b> that is wide and has a high strength as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Supporting stiffness for the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> can therefore be easily and sufficiently ensured.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In addition, the base portion <b>23</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention includes a plurality of mounting holes <b>61</b> previously machined therein, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref>. The mounting holes <b>61</b> are for mounting an optional storage box. These mounting holes <b>61</b> are made in an area of the base portion <b>23</b> excluding the recessed portion <b>21</b>H, rearwardly of the backrest <b>31</b> in the raised use position. The storage box can therefore be mounted regardless of whether the backrest <b>31</b> is in the non-use position or the use position.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described heretofore, in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention, the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> for folding the backrest <b>31</b> are disposed between the seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b> (inside a width of the seat rail <b>21</b>) downwardly of the occupant's seat <b>11</b>. The operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> can therefore be operated only when the occupant's seat <b>11</b> is removed. This prevents any third person from operating the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> when the occupant's seat <b>11</b> is mounted in place. In this case, there is no need to provide a key cylinder for unlocking the backrest <b>31</b>. The arrangements can avoid an increased number of parts used in, and a complicated structure involved in, the backrest mechanism, so that operation of the backrest <b>31</b> can be disabled at all times except when the occupant intends to operate with a simple structure.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In addition, the following arrangements are made. More specifically, the backrest <b>31</b> is rotatable inside the seat rail <b>21</b>; the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> fixed at the use position or the non-use position by the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> are disposed at the rotatable portion of the backrest <b>31</b> (the proximal end portions of the column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b>); and the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b> penetrate through the backrest <b>31</b> and the seat rail <b>21</b> and are fixed at the use position or the non-use position. Rigid fixing can be achieved with the shafts that penetrate through the backrest <b>31</b> and the seat rail <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In addition, the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> are disposed on either side of the vehicle and the backrest <b>31</b> is configured to be movable through a simultaneous operation of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>. An arrangement can therefore be made in which left and right fixing portions (rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>) are operated by each of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> based on a structure for fixing the left and right sides of the backrest <b>31</b>. A more rigid fixing structure for the backrest <b>31</b> can therefore be achieved as compared with fixing of the backrest <b>31</b> only on one side. Further, the backrest <b>31</b> can be made immovable even when one of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> is operated unintentionally.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, the restriction plate <b>58</b> that restricts the operating range of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> is disposed on the seat rail <b>21</b>, which prevents the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> from coming off position.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition, the rubber sheets <b>60</b> are disposed on both sides of each of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>. The rubber sheet <b>60</b> is therefore disposed between the seat rail <b>21</b> and each of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> and between each of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> and the restriction plate <b>58</b>. This prevents vehicle body oscillations from being transmitted to the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> or the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> from being rubbed against other parts (the seat rail <b>21</b> and the restriction plate <b>58</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a side elevational view showing a backrest structure for a motorcycle according to a second embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a plan view showing the backrest structure of the motorcycle according to the second embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention, a backrest <b>31</b> serves as a rider's backrest supporting the back of a rider. More specifically, in a seat rail <b>21</b> according to the second embodiment of the present invention, a rider's seat <b>11</b>A is supported on a pair of left and right seat rail portions <b>22</b>, <b>22</b> and the backrest <b>31</b> is movably disposed rearwardly of the rider's seat <b>11</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A base portion <b>23</b> in which the backrest <b>31</b> can be accommodated includes a rearward extension portion <b>23</b>R that extends further rearwardly than the base portion <b>23</b> shown in, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <b>4</b>. A passenger's seat <b>11</b>B configured separately from the rider's seat <b>11</b>A is removably disposed on an upper surface of a first half part (portion excluding the rearward extension portion <b>23</b>R) of the base portion <b>23</b>. The rearward extension portion <b>23</b>R is disposed rearwardly of the passenger's seat <b>11</b>B, so that the rearward extension portion <b>23</b>R functions as a carrier portion. More specifically, the first half part of the base portion <b>23</b> functions as a support member of the passenger's seat <b>11</b>B, while a second half part of the base portion <b>23</b>, specifically, the rearward extension portion <b>23</b>R functions as the carrier portion.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The passenger's seat <b>11</b>B is bolted to the seat rail <b>21</b> by, for example, using mounting holes <b>61</b> formed in the base portion <b>23</b>. This is not the only possible arrangement; rather, the passenger's seat <b>11</b>B may be removably configured using a key for starting an engine through a seat lock mechanism having a key cylinder not shown. Further, grab rails <b>24</b>, <b>24</b> are attached on both sides of the passenger's seat <b>11</b>B in the seat rail <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the passenger's seat <b>11</b>B includes a pair of left and right retreat portions (recessed portions) <b>11</b>C, <b>11</b>C that serve as spaces for retreating from a pair of left and right column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> when the backrest <b>31</b> is raised upright. Accordingly, the passenger's seat <b>11</b>B can be mounted even when the backrest <b>31</b> is raised to a use position. When, on the other hand, the backrest <b>31</b> is lowered into a non-use position, the backrest <b>31</b> does not protrude from an upper surface of the seat rail <b>21</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> or <b>11</b>, so that the passenger's seat <b>11</b>B can be easily mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">According to the second embodiment of the present invention, operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> that raise or lower the backrest <b>31</b> are disposed in the seat rail <b>21</b> (inside a width of the seat rail <b>21</b>) downwardly of the rider's seat <b>11</b>A. The operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> can therefore be operated only when the rider's seat <b>11</b>A is removed. This prevents any third person from operating the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>. Operation of the backrest <b>31</b> can be disabled at all times except when the occupant intends to operate with a simple structure. Further, in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention, the backrest <b>31</b> is foldably disposed rearwardly of the rider's seat <b>11</b>A and the passenger's seat <b>11</b>B can be mounted regardless of whether the backrest <b>31</b> is in the use position or the non-use position. The motorcycle can therefore be configured as a two-seater at all times, while having the movable rider's backrest.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a side elevational view showing a backrest structure for a motorcycle according to a third embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a plan view showing the backrest structure of the motorcycle according to the third embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The backrest structure according to the third embodiment of the present invention includes a rider's backrest <b>31</b>F that supports the back of a rider and a passenger's backrest <b>31</b>R that supports the back of a passenger. The backrest structure according to the third embodiment of the present invention differs from that of the second embodiment of the present invention in that the backrest structure according to the third embodiment of the present invention includes a rearward base portion <b>123</b>R disposed rearwardly of a passenger's seat <b>11</b>B, the rearward base portion <b>123</b>R for accommodating therein the passenger's backrest <b>31</b>R, though the two share the same arrangement of having the removable rider's backrest <b>31</b>F and the removable passenger's seat <b>11</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The rearward base portion <b>123</b>R is integrally molded through casting, disposed at a rear end of a base portion <b>23</b> in which the rider's backrest <b>31</b>F can be accommodated. The rearward base portion <b>123</b>R extends upwardly toward the rear in a side view (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>). In a plan view, on the other hand, the rearward base portion <b>123</b>R connects to a rear end of the base portion <b>23</b> with the same width as the base portion <b>23</b> and is then gradually narrower toward the rear (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In addition, the rearward base portion <b>123</b>R includes a recessed portion <b>21</b>H, a pair of left and right shaft support members <b>41</b>, <b>41</b>, a lock mechanism <b>50</b>, and an opening portion <b>57</b>. More specifically, the recessed portion <b>21</b>H accommodates therein the passenger's backrest <b>31</b>R that is smaller in size than the rider's backrest <b>31</b>F. The shaft support members <b>41</b>, <b>41</b> rotate the passenger's backrest <b>31</b>R. The lock mechanism <b>50</b> fixes a rotatable position. The opening portion <b>57</b> exposes operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> of the lock mechanism <b>50</b> to a space in a seat rail <b>21</b> (inside a width of the seat rail <b>21</b>). More specifically, the rearward base portion <b>123</b>R is formed into a shape reduced in size relative to the base portion <b>23</b> to thereby function also as a carrier portion.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the backrest structure according to the third embodiment of the present invention includes the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> for folding the passenger's backrest <b>31</b>R disposed in the seat rail <b>21</b> that is disposed downwardly of the passenger's seat <b>11</b>B. The operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> can therefore be operated only when the passenger's seat <b>11</b>B is removed. This prevents any third person from operating the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>. Further, the backrest structure according to the third embodiment of the present invention shares with that of the second embodiment of the present invention an arrangement in which the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> for the rider's backrest <b>31</b>F can be operated only when a rider's seat <b>11</b>A is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As described above, the backrest structure according to the third embodiment of the present invention includes the rider's backrest <b>31</b>F and the passenger's backrest <b>31</b>R and achieves a simple and similar structure to disable the operation of the rider's backrest <b>31</b>F and the passenger's backrest <b>31</b>R unless the occupant intends to operate. Therefore, the embodiment can achieve the highly versatile backrest structure.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described heretofore. The present invention is not, however, limited to the foregoing embodiments. For example, in the above-described preferred embodiments of the present invention, the rubber sheets <b>60</b> are disposed on both sides of each of the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b>. This is not the only possible arrangement; rather, for example, the rubber sheet <b>60</b> or any other cushioning member may be disposed on at least either the seat rail <b>21</b> side or the restriction plate <b>58</b> side, to thereby prevent the operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> from being rubbed against other parts (the seat rail <b>21</b> or the restriction plate <b>58</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In addition, in each of the above-described preferred embodiments of the present invention, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, for example, another fixing structure (a fixing member different from the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>) may be disposed for fixing the backrest <b>31</b> and the seat rail <b>21</b> when the backrest is not in use. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a side elevational view showing an arrangement having an addition to the arrangement of the first embodiment of the present invention. The left and right column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> of the backrest <b>31</b> include internal threaded holes <b>71</b>, <b>71</b> disposed at a longitudinally intermediate position thereof. The seat rail <b>21</b> includes a pair of left and right hole portions <b>73</b>, <b>73</b> that allow bolts <b>72</b>, <b>72</b> to be threaded into the internal threaded holes <b>71</b>, <b>71</b> when the backrest <b>31</b> is lowered into the non-use position. As a result, if the bolts <b>72</b>, <b>72</b> are secured in the internal threaded holes <b>71</b>, <b>71</b> via the hole portions <b>73</b>, <b>73</b> from the outside in the vehicle width direction of the seat rail <b>21</b> when not in use, the bolts <b>72</b>, <b>72</b> serve as a non-use position fixing member (fixing portion) that fixes the backrest <b>31</b> and the seat rail <b>21</b>. The backrest <b>31</b> can therefore be fixed to the seat rail <b>21</b> at a position away from the rotatable portion thereof (at the longitudinally intermediate position according to the modified example). By having the fixing portion in addition to the rotation fixing shafts <b>51</b>, <b>51</b>, the backrest <b>31</b> and the seat rail <b>21</b> can be reliably fixed in place when the backrest <b>31</b> is not in use.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further, in the modified example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the left and right column portions <b>32</b>, <b>32</b> of the backrest <b>31</b> include use position fixing members <b>74</b>, <b>74</b> of a triangular shape in a side view. The use position fixing members <b>74</b>, <b>74</b> have internal threaded holes <b>74</b>A having communication with the hole portions <b>73</b>, <b>73</b> disposed in the seat rail <b>21</b> when the backrest <b>31</b> is raised to the use position. The backrest <b>31</b> and the seat rail <b>21</b> can therefore be even more reliably fixed in place when in use. The use position fixing members <b>74</b>, <b>74</b> protrude downwardly of the seat rail <b>21</b> as shown by a dash-double-dot line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> when the backrest <b>31</b> is moved into the non-use position. Vehicle body covers (for example, rear covers) disposed on both sides of the seat rail <b>21</b>, however, can cover the use position fixing members <b>74</b>, <b>74</b> such that the use position fixing members <b>74</b>, <b>74</b> are invisible on the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Each of the above-described preferred embodiments of the present invention has been described to include two operation levers <b>55</b>, <b>55</b> for lowering the backrest <b>31</b>, each disposed on either side of the backrest structure. This is not the only possible arrangement; rather, the operation lever <b>55</b> may be one and a single operation lever is still able to fold the backrest <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The invention being thus described, it will be obvious that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be obvious to one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.</p>
