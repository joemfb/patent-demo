<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A remote control light receiver receives the infrared rays from an infrared LED incorporated in a remote control unit operated by the user, extracts the signal transmitted from the remote control unit, and outputs the extracted signal to a control microcomputer. The carrier frequency of the signal transmitted from the remote control unit is 38 kHz. A PWM control circuit performs PWM control by using an arbitrary PWM frequency within a range of 300 Hz to 3 kHz. By separating the PWM frequency and the frequency (carrier frequency) of the signal for remote control into different bands, the signal for remote control can be restrained from being affected by the turning on of the light source by PWM control, whereby remote control can be prevented from malfunctioning.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the national phase under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 of PCT International Application No. PCT/JP2009/004725 which has an International filing date of Sep. 18, 2009 and designated the United States of America.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a lighting device having a light source such as a light emitting diode, and more particularly, relates to a lighting device in the form of an electric light bulb.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, lighting devices with light emitting diodes (LEDs) as the light source have been developed for various uses, and have been replacing lighting devices using conventional light sources such as an incandescent light bulb and a fluorescent lamp. Moreover, a lighting device has been developed that has a remote control function by means of a remote terminal such as a remote control unit in order to adjust the light source to the desired brightness and adjust the lighting condition. Moreover, many lighting devices using a light emitting diode as the light source adopt a switching circuit of the PWM control method or the like in order to adjust the brightness of the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As a lighting device having the remote control function, for example, a fluorescent lamp lighting device having an infrared remote control function has been disclosed in which by providing an electric filter on the transmission line of the electric output of infrared receiving means, even when an infrared ray with a high-intensity argon spectrum that is prone to be generated when the fluorescent lamp is activated in a low-temperature atmosphere is received, the infrared receiver can be prevented from malfunctioning by blocking the received infrared ray by attenuating it with the electric filter (see Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-268159).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, although the lighting device of Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-268159 is capable of preventing interference between the infrared signal for remote control and the infrared ray generated from the fluorescent lamp, there is no disclosure as to the case of a lighting device using not a fluorescent lamp but a light emitting diode as the light source. Since many lighting devices using a light emitting diode as the light source adopt a switching circuit of the PWM control method or the like, there is a possibility that interference with the infrared signal for remote control occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention is made in view of such circumstances, and an object thereof is to provide a lighting device capable of preventing remote control from malfunctioning.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A lighting device according to the present invention is characterized in that in a lighting device provided with a light source unit; a receiver that receives a signal for remote control; and a PWM driver that drives the light source unit according to the signal received by the receiver, the PWM driver is structured so as to perform driving by using a PWM frequency different from a frequency of the signal.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the present invention, the PWM driver drives the light source by using a PWM frequency different from the frequency of the signal for remote control. The frequency of the signal for remote control is, for example, the carrier frequency for infrared-ray communication. That frequencies are different is that the frequency bands thereof are separated. By separating the PWM frequency and the frequency of the signal for remote control into different bands, the signal for remote control can be restrained from being affected by the turning on of the light source by PWM control, whereby remote control can be prevented from malfunctioning.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The lighting device according to the present invention is characterized in that the PWM frequency is made different by separating the frequency band thereof from the frequency of the signal to the extent that interference with the frequency of the signal does not readily occur.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the present invention, the PWM frequency is made different by separating the frequency band thereof from the frequency of the signal for remote control to the extent that interference with the frequency of the signal for remote control does not readily occur. Thereby, the frequency bands of these are separated to restrain the signal for remote control from being affected by the turning on of the light source by PWM control, whereby remote control can be prevented from malfunctioning.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The lighting device according to the present invention is characterized in that the PWM frequency is a frequency where it is reduced that flickering of the light source unit is viewed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the present invention, the PWM frequency is a frequency where it is reduced that flickering of the light source unit is viewed. For example, when the light source unit is turned on at a frequency lower than substantially 300 Hz, flickering is viewed. Therefore, by setting the PWM frequency, for example, to 300 Hz or higher, the flickering of the light source unit can be prevented from being viewed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The lighting device according to the present invention is characterized in that the frequency of the signal is substantially 38 kHZ, and the PWM frequency is 300 Hz to 3 kHz.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the present invention, the frequency of the signal is substantially 38 kHz, and the PWM frequency is 300 Hz to 3 kHz. In infrared-ray communication, for example, the carrier frequency is 38 kHz, 40 kHz or the like. When the PWM frequency is higher than 3 kHz, as it approaches the carrier frequency for infrared-ray communication, the distance where remote control can be performed without any malfunction decreases. When the PWM frequency is lower than 300 Hz, flickering of the light source is viewed. By setting the PWM frequency to 300 Hz to 3 kHz, remote control using infrared rays can be prevented from malfunctioning.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The lighting device according to the present invention is characterized in that the receiver is provided so as to receive the signal from a side where light from the light source unit is emitted.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the present invention, the receiver is provided so as to receive the signal from the side where light from the light source unit is emitted. Even when the receiver is provided on the light emitting side of the light source unit, remote control can be prevented from malfunctioning.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The lighting device according to the present invention is characterized in that the light source unit includes: a circuit board; and a plurality of light emitting diodes mounted on the circuit board so as to be separated in a circular pattern, and the receiver is provided substantially in the center of the plurality of light emitting diodes.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the present invention, the light source unit includes the circuit board and the plurality of light emitting diodes mounted on the circuit board so as to be separated in a circular pattern. The receiver is provided substantially in the center of the plurality of light emitting diodes. Since the signal for remote control can be restrained from being affected by the turning on of the light source by PWM control and remote control can be prevented from malfunctioning, the lighting device can be reduced in size by providing the light emitting diodes around the periphery of the receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the present invention, remote control can be prevented from malfunctioning.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The above and further objects and features of the invention will more fully be apparent from the following detailed description with accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="h-0005" num="0000">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Hereinafter, the present invention will be described based on the drawings showing embodiments thereof. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an external view of a lighting device <b>100</b> of a first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a relevant part exploded perspective view of the lighting device <b>100</b> of the first embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the lighting device <b>100</b> of the first embodiment. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the lighting device <b>100</b> is an LED bulb of a bulb type of 40 W, 60 W, etc., and is provided with, when viewed externally: a cap <b>10</b> as a power source connector for electrically connecting the device to the commercial power source by inserting it into an external socket; a heat releasing portion <b>13</b>; a coupling member <b>11</b> between the cap <b>10</b> and the heat releasing portion <b>13</b>; a translucent portion <b>50</b> which is in the form of a hollow substantially hemispherical shell; and a disk-shaped heat releasing plate <b>20</b> on which LED modules described later are placed and that is thermally connected to the heat releasing portion <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, to the heat releasing plate <b>20</b>, a light source module <b>40</b> where the LED modules <b>42</b> are mounted on the surface of a board <b>41</b> is attached by screws <b>21</b>. By applying a thermally conductive sheet or a highly thermally conductive resin between the light source module <b>40</b> and the heat releasing plate <b>20</b> in order to improve heat conduction efficiency, the heat generated by the light source module <b>40</b> can be released to the outside through the heat releasing plate <b>20</b> and the heat releasing portion <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The heat releasing portion <b>13</b> is made of, for example, a lightweight and highly thermally conductive metal such as aluminum, and is substantially cylindrical. Moreover, the heat releasing portion <b>13</b> has a plurality of heat releasing grooves on the outer peripheral surface of the cylinder, and the heat transmitted from the light source module <b>40</b> to the heat releasing portion <b>13</b> is released from the outer peripheral surface into the external air by using the heat releasing grooves. Between the heat releasing portion <b>13</b> and the heat releasing plate <b>20</b>, a synthetic rubber waterproofing packing <b>19</b> is provided so that water does not enter the inside.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The heat releasing portion <b>13</b> has a cavity formed inside, and a power source unit <b>30</b> for supplying required electric power (voltage, current) to the LED modules <b>42</b> of the light source module <b>40</b> through a wiring <b>22</b> and an accommodating portion <b>15</b> for accommodating the power source unit <b>30</b> are disposed inside the heat releasing portion <b>13</b>. Moreover, power wires <b>17</b> for supplying commercial power to the power source unit <b>30</b> are provided between the power source unit <b>30</b> and the cap <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Between the heat releasing portion <b>13</b> and the coupling member <b>11</b>, a synthetic rubber waterproofing ring member <b>12</b> is provided so that water does not enter the inside, and the heat releasing portion <b>13</b> and the coupling member <b>11</b> are secured by screws <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Moreover, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, around the power source unit <b>30</b> accommodated in the accommodating portion <b>15</b>, a highly conductive synthetic resin <b>25</b> (for example, polyurthane resin) is filled in order that the heat generated at the power source unit <b>30</b> is efficiently conducted to the heat releasing portion <b>13</b> and the cap <b>10</b>. It is preferable that the synthetic resin <b>25</b> have high electrical insulation property, low water permeability and fire retardancy.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The synthetic resin <b>25</b> is filled into the heat releasing portion <b>13</b> under a condition where the electric wiring inside the heat releasing portion <b>13</b> is finished and the heat releasing portion <b>13</b> and the cap <b>10</b> are mechanically joined together. The synthetic resin <b>25</b> is in a liquid form when filled. After the synthetic resin <b>25</b> is filled, it is hardened at a required temperature. The hardened synthetic resin <b>25</b> sticks to the inner surface of the cap <b>10</b> and also sticks to the inner surface of the heat releasing portion <b>13</b>. Thereby, the entrance of water from the junction of the cap <b>10</b> can be more reliably prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Moreover, since the synthetic resin <b>25</b> has high electrical insulation property, the heat releasing portion <b>13</b> and the charging portion of the power source unit <b>30</b> can be reliably prevented from suffering an insulation breakdown to be short-circuited. Moreover, since the synthetic resin <b>25</b> has high thermal conductivity, the heat generated at the power source unit <b>30</b> is released not only from the heat releasing portion <b>13</b> but also from the cap <b>10</b> thermally connected through the synthetic resin <b>25</b>, so that increase in the temperature of the power source unit <b>30</b> is suppressed and consequently, the reliability of the electric parts used in the power source unit <b>30</b> can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">To the light emitting surface side of the light source module <b>40</b>, a reflecting plate <b>23</b> is attached by the screws <b>21</b>. In the reflecting plate <b>23</b>, insertion holes of substantially the same size as that of the LED modules <b>42</b> are provided in positions corresponding to the positions where the LED modules <b>42</b> are disposed, and the reflecting plate <b>23</b> is attached under a condition where the LED modules <b>42</b> are inserted in the insertion holes. The reflecting plate <b>23</b> is not essential but may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The translucent portion <b>50</b> is made of milky white glass, and secured to the heat releasing plate <b>20</b> with an adhesive. The translucent portion <b>50</b> is not limited to glass, but milky white polycarbonate resin or the like may be used. When the translucent portion <b>50</b> is made of polycarbonate resin, it can be screwed to the heat releasing plate <b>20</b> by being threaded.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A light diffusing member <b>50</b><i>a </i>for diffusing the light from the LED modules <b>42</b> (light source module <b>40</b>) is added to the translucent portion <b>50</b>. As the light diffusing member <b>50</b><i>a</i>, for example, a member is used that has a crystalline structure and the optical characteristics of which are, for example, being high in refractive index, being low in light absorptive capacity and being high in light scattering power. For example, a pigment having a crystalline structure such as a fluorescent substance may be added. The percentage of addition of the light diffusing member <b>50</b><i>a </i>is, for example, approximately several percent. As the fluorescent substance, for example, 3Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Ca(F, Cl)<sub>2</sub>SbMn may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Thereby, when the LED modules <b>42</b> having a surface-emitting characteristic are used as the light source, even if the directivity of the light of the LED modules <b>42</b> is narrow, the light emitted from the LED modules <b>42</b> is diffused by the light diffusing member <b>50</b><i>a </i>when passing through the translucent portion <b>50</b>, so that the light distribution characteristic can be widened with a simple structure. When the light diffusing member <b>50</b><i>a </i>is a fluorescent substance, a material may be used that diffuses light and is excited by the light to emit light. By the light diffusing member <b>50</b><i>a </i>itself emitting light, the light distribution can be more widened.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Moreover, since the translucent portion <b>50</b> is in the form of a hollow substantially hemispherical shell, a bulb-type lighting device can be provided that uses the LED modules <b>42</b> (light emitting diodes) and has a wide light distribution characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In particular, since the translucent portion <b>50</b> and the heat releasing plate <b>20</b> are joined together at a part where the diameter is slightly smaller than the maximum diameter of the translucent portion <b>50</b> in the form of a substantially hemispherical shell, the light emitted from the LED modules <b>42</b> passes from, of the surface of the translucent portion <b>50</b>, a part from the junction of the translucent portion <b>50</b> and the heat releasing plate <b>20</b> to the maximum diameter, whereby the light is radiated also in a direction from the heat releasing portion <b>13</b> toward the cap <b>10</b> and consequently, the light distribution characteristic can be further widened.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a plan view showing an example of the structure of the light emitting surface of the light source module <b>40</b>. In the light source module <b>40</b>, on the substantially circular board <b>41</b> made of an aluminum alloy or the like, a plurality of LED modules <b>42</b> are arranged in a circular pattern so as to be separated at appropriate intervals. While six LED modules <b>42</b> are arranged in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the number and arrangement of the LED modules <b>42</b> are not limited to those of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, but changing the number, arranging them in a substantially rectangular pattern and the like may be performed as appropriate according to the specifications and uses of the lighting device. The board <b>41</b> may be made of ceramic or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As the LED modules <b>42</b>, LED modules of a required emission color may be used; for example, LED modules of white may be used. The emission color is not limited to white, but may be neutral white or warm white.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Second Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">While the light diffusing member <b>50</b><i>a </i>is added to the translucent portion <b>50</b> in the above-described example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the present invention is not limited thereto. A structure may be adopted in which a light diffusing member is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a relevant part cross-sectional view of a translucent portion <b>51</b> of the second embodiment. Like the translucent portion <b>50</b> of the first embodiment, the translucent portion <b>51</b> is made of milky white glass and secured to the heat releasing plate <b>20</b> with an adhesive. The translucent portion <b>51</b> is not limited to glass, but milky white polycarbonate resin or the like may be used. When the translucent portion <b>51</b> is made of polycarbonate resin, it can be screwed to the heat releasing plate <b>20</b> by being threaded.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">To the inner side surface of the translucent portion <b>51</b>, a light diffusing member <b>52</b> is applied (for example, baking application or electrostatic application). When baking application is performed, application is performed by, for example, applying the light diffusing member <b>52</b> which is a fluorescent substance to the surface of the translucent portion <b>51</b>, heating it by increasing the temperature from room temperature to 100&#xb0; for approximately 30 minutes, and then, further heating it at 150&#xb0; for approximately 30 minutes. Moreover, as the light diffusing member <b>52</b>, as in the first embodiment, for example, a member is used that has a crystalline structure and the optical characteristics of which are, for example, being high in refractive index, being low in light absorptive capacity and being high in light scattering power. The thickness of application of the light diffusing member <b>52</b> is approximately 1 mm to 2 mm. Since light is not readily transmitted if the thickness of the light diffusing member <b>52</b> is too thick, by setting the thickness within the above-mentioned range, light can be diffused while being transmitted. Thereby, when the LED modules <b>42</b> having a surface-emitting characteristic are used as the light source, even if the directivity of the light of the LED modules <b>42</b> is narrow, the light emitted from the LED modules <b>42</b> is diffused by the light diffusing member <b>52</b> when passing through the translucent portion <b>51</b>, so that the light distribution characteristic can be widened with a simple structure. Depending on the material and composition of the light diffusing member <b>52</b>, the application thickness is not limited to the range of 1 mm to 2 mm, but may be, for example, approximately several tens of um.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">While the light diffusing member <b>52</b> is applied to the inner side surface of the translucent portion <b>51</b> in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the present invention is not limited thereto, but the light diffusing member <b>52</b> may be applied to the outer side surface of the translucent portion <b>51</b>. Alternatively, the translucent portion <b>51</b> may have a double structure where a layer formed of the light diffusing member <b>52</b> is sandwiched in between to form the translucent portion <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Third Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While the lighting device <b>100</b> has the structure of an LED bulb having a specific emission color in the above-described first and second embodiments, the lighting device <b>100</b> may be provided with a light control function. In a third embodiment, a structure can be provided in which a light controller (not shown) is interposed on the power wire between the commercial power source and the lighting device <b>100</b> and the brightness of the illumination light of the lighting device <b>100</b> is adjusted by the light controller.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a schematic view showing an example of the installation of the lighting device <b>100</b> of the third embodiment. The commercial power source is provided with a light controller <b>200</b>, and a plurality of lighting devices <b>100</b> are connected to the output side power wire of the light controller <b>200</b>. As described above, by providing the lighting device <b>100</b> with a bulb shape incorporating the LED modules <b>42</b>, existing light bulbs can be replaced with the lighting device <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, by turning a light control knob (operation switch or the like) of the light controller <b>200</b>, the lighting devices <b>100</b> installed in a wide range can be light-controlled by one operation. Moreover, the lighting devices <b>100</b> may be light-controlled by transmitting a signal to the light controller <b>200</b> by using a remote control unit for remote control. The lighting device <b>100</b> may have a structure in which the light controller <b>200</b> is incorporated by being accommodated in the accommodating portion <b>15</b> inside the heat releasing portion <b>13</b> like the power source unit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, the light control method in the third embodiment will be described. The light controller <b>200</b> outputs a phase-controlled AC voltage to each lighting device <b>100</b> according to the degree of light control (for example, 100% to 25%). Each lighting device <b>100</b> detects the phase angle of the input voltage, and turns on the LED modules <b>42</b> with the light quantity corresponding to the phase angle. For example, when the phase angle is small, the current passed through the LED modules <b>42</b> is increased, and as the phase angle increases, the current passed through the LED modules <b>42</b> is decreased, whereby light control according to the phase angle can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Descriptions of the parts similar to those of the first and second embodiments (for example, the structures shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 5</figref>) are omitted. Since the lighting device <b>100</b> of the third embodiment is capable of precisely performing light control also for phase-controlled AC voltages as described above, it can replace existing light bulbs adopting the light control method by phase control or may be used together with existing bulbs.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Fourth Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">While the first and the second embodiment has no light control function and the third embodiment has a structure in which light control is performed by using an external light controller, a structure may be provided in which the function of performing not only light control but also color control (adjusting the emission color to a desired color) by using a remote control unit for remote control is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the lighting device <b>100</b> of the fourth embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a plan view showing an example of the structure of the light emitting surface of the light source module <b>40</b> of the fourth embodiment. A difference from the first to third embodiments is that LED modules <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> of different light emission colors, a remote control light receiver <b>45</b> that receives signals from a remote terminal such as a remote control unit, and the like are provided. Hereinafter, details of the fourth embodiment will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, in the light source module <b>40</b>, the LED modules <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> of different emission colors are alternately disposed in a circular pattern so as to be separated at appropriate intervals on the substantially circular board <b>41</b> made of an aluminum alloy or the like. While the numbers of LED modules <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> used are each three in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the number and arrangement of the LED modules <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> are not limited to those of the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, but changing the numbers, arranging them in a substantially rectangular pattern and the like may be performed as appropriate according to the specifications and uses of the lighting device. The board <b>41</b> may be made of ceramic or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The LED modules <b>42</b> are capable of emitting, for example, white light, and the LED modules <b>43</b> are capable of emitting, for example, warm white light. The light emission colors are not limited thereto, but may be other colors such as red, green and blue.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the center of the substantially circular substrate <b>41</b>, the remote control light receiver <b>45</b> is disposed. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in the bulb-type lighting device <b>100</b>, the part that can be viewed under a condition where the lighting device <b>100</b> is attached to a lighting apparatus or the like is substantially only the translucent portion <b>50</b>. For example, in order that the user performs a remote control operation with a remote control unit, it is necessary to provide the remote control light receiver <b>45</b> in a region viewed as the translucent portion <b>50</b>. By providing the LED modules <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> around the remote control light receiver <b>45</b> so as to surround the remote control light receiver <b>45</b>, the size of the lighting device <b>100</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram showing the structure of the power source unit <b>30</b> of the fourth embodiment. The power source unit <b>30</b> is provided with: a noise filter circuit <b>31</b> for removing noises entering from the commercial power source or the like; a rectifying circuit <b>32</b> that rectifies an AC voltage and converts it into a DC voltage; a DC/DC converter <b>33</b> that converts the DC voltage outputted from the rectifying circuit <b>32</b> into a required DV voltage; a PWM control circuit <b>34</b> as a PWM driver that controls the current supplied to the LED modules <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> by performing pulse-width modulation on the DC voltage outputted form the DC/DC converter <b>33</b>; a control microcomputer <b>35</b> that controls the power source unit <b>30</b>; a current/voltage detecting circuit <b>36</b> that detects the current flowing through the LED modules <b>42</b> and the voltage applied thereto; and a current/voltage detecting circuit <b>37</b> that detects the current flowing through the LED modules <b>43</b> and the voltage applied thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The remote control light receiver <b>45</b> receives the infrared ray from the infrared LEDs incorporated in a remote control unit (not shown) operated by the user, extracts the signal transmitted from the remote control unit, and outputs the extracted signal to the control microcomputer <b>35</b>. The signal transmitted from the remote control unit is, for example, for turning on and off, light-controlling (for example, 70%, 50%, 30%) and color-controlling (for example, adjusting the emission color in steps from white to warm white) the light source.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is an explanatory view showing an example of the signal received by the remote control light receiver <b>45</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a signal transmitted from the remote control unit which is the signal transmitting end, that is, a signal received by the remote control light receiver <b>45</b>, and shows the output condition of the remote control light receiver <b>45</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the carrier frequency of the signal transmitted from the remote control unit is 38 kHz, and the cycle thereof is approximately 26 &#x3bc;s. The carrier frequency is not limited to 38 kHz but may be a different frequency such as 40 kHz.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">On the remote control unit side, when the blinking of the infrared LED is repeated at intervals of 26 &#x3bc;s for a predetermined time T, the remote control light receiver <b>45</b> outputs a high-level (H) electric signal. Moreover, on the remote control side, when the infrared LED is off for the predetermined time T, the remote control light receiver <b>45</b> outputs a low-level (L) electric signal.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The control microcomputer <b>35</b> outputs a control signal for turning on and off, light-controlling and color-controlling the light source, to the DC/DC converter <b>33</b> and the PWM control circuit <b>34</b> based on the signal outputted from the remote control light receiver <b>45</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Moreover, the control microcomputer <b>35</b> outputs a control signal for making the light source stay on with a predetermined light quantity, to the DC/DC converter <b>33</b> and the PWM control circuit <b>34</b> based on the detection result outputted from the current/voltage detecting circuits <b>36</b> and <b>37</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The PWM control circuit <b>34</b> obtains the control signal outputted from the control microcomputer <b>35</b>, and performs PWM control according to the obtained control signal on the LED modules <b>42</b> and <b>43</b>. The PWM control circuit may be provided in each of the LED modules <b>42</b> and <b>43</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The frequency band of the PWM control circuit <b>34</b> is a frequency band where interference does not readily occur with the carrier frequency (for example, 38 kHz) of the signal transmitted by the remote control unit through infrared rays. For example, PWM control can be performed by using an arbitrary PWM frequency within a range of 300 Hz to 3 kHz. Hereinafter, the relationship between the PWM frequency and the carrier frequency of the signal light-received by the remote control light receiver <b>45</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is an explanatory view showing the relationship between the PWM frequency and the distance of reach of the signal from the remote control unit. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the horizontal axis represents the PWM frequency, and the vertical axis represents the distance of reach of the signal from the remote control unit. The distance of reach is the distance between the remote control unit and the remote control light receiver <b>45</b> where the signal from the remote control unit can be reliably received, and it is desirable that it is 7 m or longer for practical use.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, when the PWM frequency is approximately 3 kHz or lower, a distance of reach of 7 m or longer can be secured. When the PWM frequency is 200 kHz or higher, a distance of reach of 7 m or longer can be secured.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">However, when the PWM frequency is 300 Hz or lower, flickering of the light source is viewed. Therefore, it is desirable that the PWM frequency be within a range of 300 Hz to 3 kHz. By thus separating the PWM frequency and the frequency (carrier frequency) of the signal for remote control into different bands, the signal for remote control is restrained from being affected by the turning on of the light source by PWM control, so that remote control can be prevented from malfunctioning. In particular, by setting the PWM frequency to 300 Hz to 3 kHz, remote control using infrared rays can be prevented from malfunctioning. Consequently, even if the remote control light receiver <b>45</b> is provided so as to receive the infrared signal for remote control from the side where light is emitted from the LED modules <b>42</b> and <b>43</b>, remote control using infrared rays can be prevented from malfunctioning.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Moreover, by disposing the remote control light receiver <b>45</b> substantially in the center of the LED modules <b>42</b> and <b>43</b> arranged in a circular pattern, the size of the lighting device can be reduced, and the signal for remote control can be restrained from being affected by the turning on of the light source by PWM control, whereby remote control can be prevented from malfunctioning.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">While the PWM frequency can be set to not less than 200 kHz, since there is a possibility that heat generation by a switching element such as an FET used for the PWM control circuit <b>34</b> increases, the above-mentioned range of 300 Hz to 30 kHz is more desirable.</p>
