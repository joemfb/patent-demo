<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An integrated mechanical stop and securing apparatus for the safe positioning and securing of a short cut-off workpiece in close proximity to a cutting tool during a cutting operation. The mechanical stop is attached to a fence, work surface or similar structure using a moveable clamp. The workpiece stop further includes a pivotally attached securing member that abuts a surface of a workpiece during a cutting operation involving a relatively short cut-off. Biasing force for the securing member is provided by an operator grasping a handle on the securing member. Increased safety is provided when the stop device maintains the operator's hands outside of the effective cutting area of the power tool, while providing an accurate and reliable stop to index the cut.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention relates generally to a workpiece cut-off stop for the purpose of cutting a repeatable length, in combination with a workpiece securing device, and more particularly to an apparatus which attaches to an extended work surface of a power saw or similar cutting machine to accurately index the length of a relatively short workpiece and then securing the workpiece in place while cutting, thereby reducing the risk of injury to the operator.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Power miter saws are routinely found in woodworking environments for use in various cutting applications, such as bias cutting of long, but narrow stock. Over the past several years, the use of the miter saw has expanded significantly due largely to versatility, accuracy, cost and simplicity of use. Today, miter saws are commonly found in commercial wood working shops, home shops and even in retail outlets in the place of radial arm and table saws.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A typical power miter saw includes a relatively compact horizontal flat top work surface measuring about two feet in length having a vertically projecting backstop, commonly referred to as a fence. The material to be cut, such as a wood, plastic, metal, ceramic, masonry or similar materials is horizontally supported by the work surface and vertically aligned along the fence. A rotary blade and associated motor are pivotally mounted to, and above, the work surface to plunge cut into a stationary workpiece and thereby accurately forming a cut to separate the workpiece at a specified dimension. Some miter saws are referred to as &#x201c;sliding miter saws&#x201d; because they are pulled to the front of the work table in the raised position, lowered, and then pushed towards the fence while cutting through the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While the power miter saw, also referred to as a &#x201c;chop&#x201d; saw, is an efficient and proven power cutting tool, there remain a number of shortcomings associated with the operation thereof. One such problem with the miter saw operation relates to the precise and repeatable measuring of the cut length, specifically as it relates to a relatively short workpiece. Previously, a table saw was utilized wherein a movable rip fence and/or miter guide would position the workpiece based on a pre-determined dimension. While this problem has been widely recognized for many years by the users, miter saw manufactures have failed to develop an effective measuring and securing means for use with these saws, especially when a short piece length is required.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Miter saws are designed and manufactured according to the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and Underwriter's Laboratories Inc. (UL) standards contained in ANSI/UL 987, Stationary and Fixed Electric Tools. Miter saws are required by this standard to have the necessary blade guards to mitigate the potential for hand and finger injuries. Despite these standards there remains an ongoing risk of serious injury inherent with conventional miter saw designs. In 2005 alone the US Product Safety Commission reported 29,779 miter saw injuries requiring a trip to a hospital emergency room. (NIESS code 832 &#x26; 895)</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In response to the problem associated with accurately controlling the cut length of a workpiece, U.S. Pat. No. 5,845,555, MULTI-POSITION ADJUSTABLE WORK STOP ASSEMBLY, was issued to Dawley the inventor to the present application. Other solutions are suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 6,899,006 issued to Jolkovski and in U.S. Pat. No. 6,557,601 issued to Taylor, where a linear scale provides a reference stop for a substantially long workpiece. However, in all of the noted patents, the fence and motor, as well as the associated blade guard, potentially interfere when short pieces are to be safely cut.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Therefore, a serious problem remains with the use of miter saws in relation to operator safety&#x2014;particularly when executing a cut on a relatively short piece. The potential for injury is further increased when angled or miter cuts are being made on short pieces. More particularly, during normal use the rotating saw blade often comes in close proximity to the operator's hands and fingers as the rotating blade plunges down into the workpiece. As a result individuals have been seriously injured by inadvertent contact with the saw blade while operating the miter saw. When cutting relatively short pieces the risk of injury is increased since the operator is now required to position and support a workpiece against the fence in close proximity to the blade while cutting. If the cut-off piece is not held in some manner there is also the risk of the piece becoming a projectile once the cut is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Several devices are intended to protect operators from injury while operating miter saws, including blade guards and electric brakes, which serve to limit hand contact with the rotating blade. Blade guards and brakes, however, have proven ineffective because the blade becomes exposed when cutting and moving at up to 8,000 RPM (275 MPH) while the operator is attempting to secure the workpiece within inches of the blade. Other attempts to improve safety features include providing a workpiece securing member designed to assist the operator in mechanically mounting the work in a &#x201c;hands free&#x201d; manner. U.S. Pat. No. 4,283,977, issued to Baton, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,422,115, issued to Shibata, disclose mechanisms adapted for clamping the workpiece during the sawing process, so as to keep the operator's hands free from the danger area of the saw. These devices, however, are adapted for securing a relatively long workpiece within the cutting area, and are generally not usable when a relatively short cut-off is required.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Again, the blade guard and motor interfere with a securing device, which limits the clamp's proximity to the blade, especially since a miter saw is capable of rotating at least +/&#x2212;45 degree about the axis perpendicular to a work surface. As discussed above, this limits the applicability of such clamps for use with smaller workpieces, which must be secured much closer to the saw blade path. Hence, a need exists for improvements directed to protecting operators from injury by securing a relatively short workpiece during the cutting operation.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further, as noted above, a need also exists for a securing mechanism that is capable of adequately controlling and indexing the cut-off length in order to provide greater accuracy, but more importantly to provide adequate safety for an operator.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with the present invention there is provided a safety apparatus for securely holding a workpiece, comprising: a work surface; and a securing member operable in cooperation with, and pivotally attached to, said work surface, said securing member securing the workpiece while operated on by a cutting tool.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, there is provided A workpiece stop and securing apparatus for positioning and securely holding a workpiece in relation to a saw blade, comprising: an adjustable mount movably attached to a fence, said adjustable mount including a stop member attached thereto in order to control a distance between the saw blade and the stop member; and a workpiece securing member pivotally attached to said adjustable mount, in a plane generally parallel to a work surface, to apply a holding force to a surface of the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In accordance with yet another aspect of the invention, there is disclosed a method for cutting a short piece from a workpiece, comprising: attaching an adjustable mount to a work surface of a power tool; pivotally attaching a workpiece stop, including a securing member, to the mount; setting and locking the mount to position to provide a workpiece stop at a defined distance from a cutting tool; abutting an end of the workpiece to the stop member; applying a force against a surface of the workpiece with the pivotally attached securing member; energizing the power tool; and engaging the cutting portion of the power tool at the specified workpiece cut-off length, while continuing to grasp the workpiece with the securing member in a securing orientation.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention will be described in connection with various embodiments, however, it will be understood that there is no intent to limit the invention to the embodiment described. On the contrary, the intent is to cover all alternatives, modifications, and equivalents as may be included within the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For a general understanding of the present invention, reference is made to the drawings. In the drawings, like reference numerals have been used throughout to designate identical elements.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with the disclosed embodiments a safety device is provided to assist an operator in locating and securing short pieces of material, or stock (referred to as &#x201c;workpieces&#x201d;), while the workpiece is operated upon by a power miter saw, or alternatively other power tools such as radial arm, table, and ceramic tile saws, and possibly drill presses or similar material cutting, shaping and forming tools. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide a novel and improved accessory (e.g., for a miter saw) that will maximize the safety to the operator while still providing accurate positioning for a relatively short workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring generally to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, for example, the disclosed embodiments provide an integrated securing mechanism for both positioning and securing a workpiece on a work surface, preferably one having a fence attached thereto. The positioning mechanism may include a multi-position sliding mount movable along a fence, such as that disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,845,555, issued to Dawley. In the disclosed embodiments herein the securing member may be integrated with the sliding mount and pivotally connected to a cut-off stop to provide a force for capturing and securing the workpiece between the securing member and the fence.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In one embodiment described herein the profile of the first end of the securing member provides for a point of contact within about 0.01 inches of the blade and is angled so as to clear the blade path when making a miter cut up to at least 45-degrees. The force applied by the securing member is directed in a plane substantially perpendicular to the workpiece and generally against or &#x201c;into&#x201d; the fence. In this configuration the securing member is capable of opposing the cutting forces applied by the power tool to the workpiece. A compliant tip may also be added to the first end of the securing member to augment the &#x201c;grip&#x201d; and conform to the workpiece, absent of marring. This applied force is essential when working with short lengths for several reasons; (i) controlling or preventing movement of the workpiece against or along the fence during the cutting operation (e.g., chattering, can roughen the miter cut and produce inaccuracies); (ii) both the angular and radial force of the teeth on the blade introduce inaccuracies in the desired length; and (iii) once the cutting operation is complete a short cut-off piece that is not constrained, often re-engages the moving blade and may damage the piece or/and cause the piece to be propelled into the air, causing damage or personal injury.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Still another aspect of the various embodiments disclosed is a provision for an extension of the work surface and fence on either or both sides of a power miter saw. Such extensions may be employed with a power miter saw stand whereby the extensions, stand and saw are integrated into a cutting workstation to provide for the handling of stock on a worksite or in a shop environment. In accordance with one embodiment, there is provided an integrated workpiece stop and securing member that incorporates an angled workpiece securing member, a stop member and a movable clamping mechanism into a single apparatus that may be attached and positioned on a fence or directly to the work surface. In one embodiment, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the integrated workpiece holder includes a movable clamp <b>100</b> engaged to fence <b>143</b>. Clamp <b>100</b> provides for a means to attach tools that enhance the utility of clamp <b>100</b> for the purpose of securing and indexing workpiece <b>112</b>. The movable clamp assembly <b>100</b> is particularly versatile for mounting and locating a variety of jigs, fixtures and measuring tools. Accordingly, clamp assembly <b>100</b> includes one or more &#x201c;T&#x201d; shaped slots (T-slots) that can receive tools, such as the stop and securing assembly <b>200</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Although described in accordance with a clamp-type stop, it will be further appreciated that the present invention may include an integrated clamp or similar fixture that enables its connection to a range of fences or even directly to a work surface (e.g., horizontal table top (<b>114</b>)) or similar structure that will allow the tool to be repeatedly or removably attached to the extended fence and adjusted to locations necessary for holding and cutting off short workpieces. Stop screw <b>160</b> serves to accurately and consistently locate and index stop and securing assembly <b>200</b>, relative to linear scale <b>145</b> found on fence <b>143</b>. A predetermined offset must be subtracted from the indicia so as to compensate for the additional length of stop member <b>172</b>. The offset is preferably based on a whole integer, for example 10 or 12 inches to facilitate the offset of the actual dimension of the cut-off relative to the distance between the saw blade and the extended stop <b>172</b>. The offset may then be more finely tuned by the adjustment of accessory position screw <b>160</b> resting against stop screw <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Once clamp assembly <b>100</b> is accurately positioned for the desired length of cut, it is secured in place by locking mechanism <b>130</b>, such as a cam or other quick-release locking mechanism, etc. Additionally, the end of stop member <b>172</b> may be adapted (e.g., having one or more of variously shaped stop ends) as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>to accommodate a bias profile of the workpiece. Stop end modifier <b>174</b> is positioned so the apex of the angled surface of the workpiece <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> is directly engaged with the beveled or chamfered edge <b>178</b> of stop end modifier <b>174</b>. Accordingly, stop extension member <b>172</b> provides for extending the workpiece stop well within the miter saw cutting zone, in the case of relatively small cut-off dimensions&#x2014;a particularly advantageous feature of the disclosed embodiment. The transverse motion of clamp <b>100</b> is constrained and limited to the length of the fence extension <b>143</b>; accordingly the minimum workpiece stop was previously determined by the width of miter saw work surface <b>114</b>, which is generally within the range of about 10 to 12 inches. Stop <b>172</b> will now position a workpiece down to at least 1. inch in length or possibly smaller, and yield a repeatable accuracy of at least about +/&#x2212;0.016 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">It should be apparent that the present invention provides a workpiece stop extension assembly that is particularly versatile and easy to use. The workpiece stop and securing assembly <b>200</b> can be removed from the work surface and hung using storage hole <b>194</b>, and then subsequently re-attached to clamp assembly <b>100</b> precisely at the correct position by placing stop screw <b>160</b> against stop <b>140</b>, requiring no additional set-up. As previously noted an inherent problem with a short cut-off workpiece is the inability to safely hold the cut off piece up against fence <b>146</b> and stop <b>170</b>, before, during and after the blade engages the workpiece. In accordance with the requirement to secure the short cut-off piece, securing member <b>187</b> is attached directly to stop extension member <b>172</b> using fastener <b>190</b> to provide a pinion and a pivot point for rotational movement of securing member <b>187</b> relative to stop extension member <b>172</b> and clamp assembly <b>100</b>. A lock nut secures screw <b>190</b> and is adjusted to place a nominal pivotal frictional force on the pivot point of the securing member <b>187</b>. As evident in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the workpiece contact point <b>165</b> must extend out beyond stop point <b>170</b> to secure the cut-off from workpiece <b>112</b>, having blade <b>142</b> immediately to the right side, stop <b>170</b> on the left, fence <b>146</b> at the rear and now securing member <b>187</b> applying a force on the front side of the cut-off.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Interposed between securing member <b>187</b> and stop extension member <b>172</b> is connection plate <b>197</b> providing a slideable interface to stop member <b>172</b> and a pivotal connection point to securing member <b>187</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Hold down position screws <b>155</b> secures connection plate <b>197</b> to workpiece stop extension <b>172</b> within slot <b>168</b> having an opening length in the general range of about 1-3 inches. The motivation for using slot <b>168</b> is to position hold down contact point <b>165</b>, as close to blade <b>142</b> as possible without contact, in order to mitigate the potential for a short workpiece to break free of the workpiece stop and securing assembly <b>200</b>. Therefore slot <b>168</b> provides the ability to adjust the position of securing member <b>187</b> relative to the blade and stop member <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Attached to securing member <b>187</b> is the securing member handle <b>185</b>. The functionality of this handle is two fold. First, the operator is compelled to place one hand on the miter saw switch/handle assembly (not shown) and the other on handle <b>185</b>, thereby ensuring that both hands of the operator are free and clear of the blade before power is applied to saw motor <b>141</b>. Safety interlock switch <b>182</b>, which may be any suitable momentary normally open switch that is actuated while an operator grasps handle <b>185</b>, is wired in series with the miter saw power so as the operator must activate both handle switch <b>182</b> and the primary saw switch before the miter saw motor is energized. Switch <b>182</b> is expected to comply with OSHA or similar safety standards for providing two-handed power lockout when operating hazardous machine tools. The intent of such a safety switch is to interlock the electrical power so that the saw motor can only be energized when both the operator's hands are a safe distance from the blade (one on the securing member and the other controlling a power switch on the saw handle).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The second function of handle <b>185</b>, is to assist the operator in providing the required force to retain the short cut-off workpiece in position while the blade is cutting. In the case of a bias cut, or miter, the handle is mounted at a distal position of securing member <b>187</b> to ensure that the now angled saw blade is a safe distance from the operator's hand. Notably in this case fulcrum point <b>190</b> is located there between handle <b>185</b> and the blade set for a miter cut, therefore the operator must pull on handle <b>185</b> to secure the workpiece. In the case of a strait cut, handle <b>185</b> may be moved, or a handle added, so that it is mounted at inward position <b>186</b>, located in between the blade and fulcrum point <b>190</b>, and thereby requiring a pushing or inward force from the operator to secure the short workpiece in place.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, there are shown two possible cutting options, a mitered cut as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> and a straight cut as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>. Securing member <b>187</b> has a securing tip portion angled at least 45 degree towards stop <b>170</b> to provide clearance for blade <b>142</b> (e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) when making an angle cut on a short workpiece. Additionally, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, stop tip <b>174</b>, on stop extension member <b>172</b>, includes beveled or chamfered edge <b>178</b> on one end and flush edge <b>179</b> on the opposite end. Fasteners <b>171</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, position stop tip <b>174</b> so beveled edge <b>178</b> is in contact with a workpiece having an angle cut. The bevel serves to conform to the angled end of the workpiece and thereby improve the accuracy of the cut line. Accordingly, on straight cuts stop tip <b>174</b> is either moved back flush with the stop extension member or turned end for end.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Also located in proximity to the distal end of member <b>187</b> is glide <b>180</b>, which extends through the end of member <b>187</b> and facilitates a smooth frictionless motion of the securing member <b>187</b> when in contact with the work surface <b>114</b>. Hold down compliant tip <b>176</b> is made from a relatively soft material (e.g., rubber, pliable polymer, etc.) to improve the effectiveness by increasing the securing friction between securing member <b>187</b> and workpiece <b>112</b>. Additionally, compliant tip <b>176</b> serves as a sacrificial attachment to the end of securing member <b>187</b> and is constructed in such a manner so that any inadvertent contact with blade <b>142</b> will only serve to damage tip <b>176</b>, thereby keeping the end of securing member <b>187</b> intact. Additionally, a damaged tip <b>176</b> is readily replaceable and is secured in position, for example, by an interference fit, threads, setscrew or any other similar restraining means.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As previously discussed, and as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, workpiece stop and securing assembly <b>200</b> may be operatively associated with movable clamp <b>100</b> that is suitable for setting and permitting repeatable indexing of stop member <b>172</b> to various lengths along work surface extension <b>173</b> and associated fence extension <b>143</b>. One such device is the Glide-Stop&#x2122; manufactured and sold by J. A. Dawley. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary version of a fence/work surface having adjustable support leg <b>205</b>. Notably the position of work surface extension may be transposed to permit the mounting of work surface extension <b>173</b> to the right and/or left side of miter saw <b>105</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In the alternative, fence extension <b>143</b> may be moved to the opposite edge of work surface extension <b>173</b> and reattached thereby providing a single work surface extension for use on either the left or right side of miter saw <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, work surface extensions <b>173</b> may be subsequently appended to miter saw work table <b>215</b> using index pins or a similar connecting device. Miter saw work table <b>215</b> encompasses collapsible legs and is designed to accommodate &#x201c;on-site&#x201d; use of miter saw <b>105</b>, either alone or in conjunction with, at least one work surface extension <b>173</b>. Primary power is supplied to the miter saw <b>105</b> by plugging the power cord into saw power outlet <b>222</b> located within safety switch relay housing <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The power safety interlock switch embodiment, contained within housing <b>218</b>, comprises a low voltage/current power transformer and a double pole, normally open relay, either solid state or mechanical, which transfers power to operate the saw. A relay coil (not shown), safety switch <b>182</b> and the low voltage power supply (not shown) are each connected in series to one another within relay box <b>218</b> so that when the power relay is energized 120 VAC is provided to outlet <b>222</b> where power cord <b>220</b> is plugged in. Once safety switch <b>182</b> is actuated, saw motor <b>141</b> will energize only when the trigger switch on the saw is pressed by the operator. Notably the operator is now substantially clear of blade <b>142</b> by virtue of securing member <b>187</b> and the required actuation of safety switch <b>182</b> incorporated within handle <b>185</b>. Alternate switch types and positions for switch <b>182</b> are conceivable as long as the operator's hands are assured to be significantly clear of blade <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> where the present invention is depicted in an operational setting having saw <b>105</b> diagrammatically illustrated as having blade <b>142</b> and motor <b>141</b> mounted to an upper movable portion. Miter saw <b>105</b> rotates the blade in a manner conducive to cutting stock material as the operator moves the motor/saw assembly downward into the stationary workpiece <b>112</b>. Fence <b>143</b> horizontally positions workpiece <b>112</b> relative to the blade <b>142</b>. Saw <b>105</b> can be any type in which the saw is moved relative to the stationary workpiece <b>112</b>, as is the case with a radial-arm saw. Work surface extensions <b>173</b> may be attached at either or both ends of miter saw work table <b>215</b> to provide a longer effective work surface for performing operations on a workpiece over 12 inches in length. Extensions <b>173</b> are connected to miter saw work table <b>215</b>. Accordingly the entire cutting apparatus, including table <b>215</b>, saw <b>105</b> and extension(s) <b>173</b> may be portable between work sites, however, they are also well suited to the stationary needs of a work shop environment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, there are shown exemplary alternative embodiments, specifically showing an angle cut on a relatively short workpiece, wherein the movable clamp assembly <b>100</b> includes not only the stop extension and securing member, <b>172</b> and <b>187</b> respectively, but is operatively associated with the Glide-Stop&#x2122; device for providing accurate and repeatable linear indexing of stop and securing assembly <b>200</b> to various locations along work fence <b>143</b>. As further illustrated, assembly <b>200</b> is affixed to the Glide-Stop&#x2122; indexing device as an accessory for cutting and securing relatively short cut-off pieces. In this manner, the present invention may be employed as an optional attachment for use with a Glide-Stop&#x2122; indexing mechanism or similar device that connects the holding apparatus to a work surface.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In recapitulation, the present invention is a method and apparatus for the improved safety and accuracy of miter saws by providing a means to reliably measure and secure a substantially short cut-off workpiece while the operator's hands are well removed from the cut zone. It is, therefore, apparent that there has been provided, in accordance with the present invention, a safe method and apparatus for measuring and securing a workpiece within a miter saw. While this invention has been described in conjunction with embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications and variations that fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims.</p>
