<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Provided are a method of heating a composition which is applicable to a substrate provided with a material having low heat resistance and a method of forming a glass pattern which leads to reduction of cracks. A composition formed over a substrate is irradiated with a laser beam to bake the paste through local heating. Scan with the laser beam is performed so that there can be no difference in the laser beam irradiation period between the middle portion and the perimeter portion of the composition. Specifically, irradiation with the laser beam is performed so that the width of the beam spot overlapping with the composition in the scanning direction is substantially uniform.</p>

<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A technique in which a highly airtight sealed structure is formed in such a manner that two substrates are bonded to each other by a glass layer including low-melting glass is known. In a technique disclosed in Patent Document 1, a sealed structure with high hermeticity is formed as follows: a paste containing a binder and glass fits (denoted by a &#x201c;frit material&#x201d; in the document) including low-melting glass is applied to a glass substrate along an edge of the glass substrate; by baking of the paste, the binder is removed and the glass fits are melted to form a glass layer (denoted by &#x201c;frit glass&#x201d; in the document); and the glass layer is irradiated with a laser beam with the substrate overlapping with a counter substrate, so that the glass layer is welded to the substrate and the counter substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Since such a glass layer has a high gas barrier property, a sealed space can be kept away from the external atmosphere. A method of sealing using such a glass layer is applied to a device employing an element, such as an organic EL (electroluminescent) element, whose performance is rapidly impaired once the element is exposed to air (including moisture or oxygen).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Examples of the device employing an organic EL element are a lighting device using an organic EL element as a light source, an image display device in which a thin film transistor and an organic EL element are combined, and the like. An organic EL element can be formed into a film and can easily form a large-area element, which leads to a lighting device including a planar light source. In addition, an image display device using an organic EL element needs no, backlight which is necessary for a liquid crystal display device and the like, and accordingly, can achieve a thin, lightweight, high contrast, and low power consumption display device.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">As described above, in the method of manufacturing a sealed structure with the glass layer, baking for removing the binder is necessary after the paste containing the glass fits and the binder (hereinafter referred to as a frit paste) is applied to the substrate. The removal of the binder enables the glass layer which has been irradiated with the laser beam to have a high gas barrier property. In general, the removal of the binder requires baking at a high temperature of about 350&#xb0; C. to 450&#xb0; C., although that depends on a material used for the binder.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Baking at a high temperature cannot be employed for the substrate to which the frit paste is applied in some cases, for example, when a material having low heat resistance is provided over the substrate. Examples of the material having low heat resistance in a device using an organic EL element are an organic EL element, a color filter, an optical adjustment film for improving light extraction efficiency, such as a microlens array, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">When the baking of the frit paste is insufficient, the binder or the like might remain in the glass layer which has been irradiated with the laser beam, resulting in low hermeticity. Alternatively, a crack might be generated in the glass layer to break the sealing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is made in view of the foregoing technical background. Thus, an object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide a method of heating a composition which can also be used for a substrate provided with a material having low heat resistance. Another object is to provide a method of forming a glass pattern which leads to reduction of cracks.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One embodiment of the present invention solves at least one of the above problems.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to achieve the above object, the present invention has arrived at the following idea: irradiation with a laser beam is performed to bake the paste through local heating after the frit paste is applied to the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a conventional method, as a laser beam used for local heating, a laser beam (hereinafter, also referred to as a circular laser beam) whose beam spot has a substantially circular shape and intensity distributions having substantially circular symmetry has been used.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">However, application of the circular laser beam to the bake of the frit paste has the following problem.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref> schematically illustrates a beam spot shape of a circular laser beam and intensity distributions thereof. A circular laser beam <b>10</b> has intensity distributions having substantially circular symmetry: for example, an intensity distribution in a section X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b> corresponding to the diameter in the horizontal direction of this figure and an intensity distribution in a section Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b> corresponding to the diameter in the vertical direction of this figure are substantially the same. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17A</figref>, the intensity is lower at portions closer to the periphery; however, the intensity can have an ideal flat-top shape.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17B</figref> schematically illustrates the state in which scan with the circular laser beam <b>10</b> is performed along a glass layer <b>11</b>. The circular laser beam <b>10</b> has a beam spot shape with a diameter wider than the width of the frit paste <b>11</b> such that a region that is not irradiated with a laser beam is not generated in the frit paste <b>11</b>. The scan is performed in such a way that the locus of the circle runs along the middle portion of the frit paste <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Since the beam spot of the circular laser beam <b>10</b> has a substantially circular shape, as illustrated in the figure, the middle portion and the perimeter portion of the glass layer <b>11</b> differ in irradiation period and in accumulated values of energy applied to the frit paste <b>11</b> even in the case where the circular laser beam <b>10</b> has intensity distributions having the ideal flat-top shape. Consequently, the middle portion and the perimeter portion of the glass layer <b>11</b> differ in heating temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For example, in the case where conditions (e.g., beam intensity and scanning speed) for irradiation with the circular laser beam <b>10</b> are made optimum for the middle portion of the frit paste <b>11</b>, baking of the perimeter portion is insufficient and consequently the binder remains. In contrast, in the case where the conditions are made optimum for the perimeter portion of the frit paste <b>11</b>, heating of the middle portion is excessive, resulting in a difference in the melted state between the middle portion and the perimeter portion of the glass fits, which might cause failure in sealing in the next step.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Since thermal shrinkage occurs when the frit paste <b>11</b> is cooled after heated, a large temperature distribution in the frit paste during the heating makes a difference in the degree of the thermal shrinkage, which leads to a difference in thermal stress; consequently, a crack might be formed in the glass layer that has been cooled or even in a substrate overlapping with the glass layer due to internal stress in the glass layer. Further, since the substrate is also heated directly or indirectly by the irradiation with a laser beam, a crack might also be formed in the substrate itself by internal stress due to the temperature distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Therefore the present invention focuses on the beam spot shape of a laser beam used for heating of a frit paste and a method of scanning with the laser beam, which solves any of the problems. Specifically, scan with a laser beam is performed so that there can be no difference in the laser beam irradiation period between the middle portion and the perimeter portion of the frit paste. More specifically, irradiation with a laser beam is performed so that the width of the beam spot overlapping with the frit paste in the scanning direction is substantially uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Typically, a laser beam having a rectangular (oblong or square) or elliptical beam spot shape can be used in the present invention. Scan is performed so that two opposite sides of the rectangular beam spot constantly intersect with opposite edges of a pattern of the fit paste.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Specifically, in a method of heating a dispersion composition of one embodiment of the present invention, when a composition including a dispersoid and a disperse medium having a lower boiling point or decomposition temperature than the dispersoid is scanned and irradiated with a laser beam to be heated, the beam spot of the laser beam is shaped into a rectangle and two opposite sides of the rectangle constantly intersect with opposite ends of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Scan is thus performed with a laser beam along the frit paste in which the glass frits are dispersed in the binder or the like, whereby the frit paste can be uniformly heated without a difference in the laser beam irradiation period between the middle portion and the perimeter portion of the frit paste.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Further, this heating method has a wide variety of applications without limitation to the frit paste. Specifically, the heating method also enables uniform heating of a dispersion composition including a dispersoid and a disperse medium having a lower boiling point or decomposition temperature than the dispersoid.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Another example of such a dispersion composition is an electrically conductive paste in which electrically conductive particles of metal or the like are dispersed in a binder formed of a resin and an organic solvent. In general, in an electrically conductive paste, the particle size of an electrically conductive particle needs to be less than 1 &#x3bc;m so that the temperature for baking can be reduced. In contrast, with the use of the heating method of one embodiment of the present invention, the particle size can be increased because local heating can be uniformly performed, which leads to higher electric conductivity after the baking.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In a method of heating a dispersion composition in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the beam spot shape of the above laser beam has a major axis and a minor axis orthogonal to the major axis.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As the above laser beam, use of a laser beam (hereinafter, also referred to as a linear laser beam) having a linear beam spot shape with a major axis and a minor axis orthogonal to the major axis is especially preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For example, with the use of a circular laser beam as the above laser beam, the spot diameter needs to be sufficiently larger than the width of the frit paste to be formed in order to prevent a difference in the irradiation period between the middle portion and the perimeter portion in the frit paste. In this case the area of a region that does not overlap with the frit paste and not contribute to heating of the frit paste is extremely large, and energy is wasted accordingly. In contrast, with the use of the linear laser beam described above, the area of a region that does not contribute to heating of the frit paste can be reduced, so that the frit paste can be efficiently heated.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A larger beam spot area requires higher output in order to achieve the same energy density. When the linear laser beam described above is used, the total beam spot area can be reduced, so that the frit paste can be efficiently heated with lower output than when a circular laser beam is used.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a method of forming a glass pattern in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, when a frit paste which includes low-melting glass and a binder and has a closed curve shape is scanned and irradiated with a laser beam to be heated, the beam spot of the laser beam is shaped into a rectangle and two opposite sides of the rectangle constantly intersect with opposite ends of the frit paste.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When a heating method of one embodiment of the present invention is thus applied to a frit paste provided to have a closed curve shape, the frit paste can be uniformly heated even with a substrate provided with a material having low heat resistance, and accordingly a highly reliable sealed structure which has few cracks can be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a method of forming a glass pattern in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, the beam spot shape of the above laser beam has a major axis and a minor axis orthogonal to the major axis.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When scan with the linear laser beam is performed along the frit paste forming a closed curve to fabricate a sealed structure as described above, the area of a region that is irradiated with the laser beam twice (overlap region) in an irradiation starting region can be extremely small. Accordingly, few cracks are generated and a highly reliable sealed structure can be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the case where scan is performed while the minor axis of the linear laser beam is tilted to the scanning direction thereof, an angle formed between the minor axis and the scanning direction is preferably greater than or equal to 0&#xb0; and less than or equal to 60&#xb0;. When a region having a uniform width is irradiated, the necessary length of the major axis direction of the beam spot is proportional to 1/cos(&#x3b8;), where &#x3b8; represents the angle formed between the minor axis and the scanning direction. Therefore, when this angle exceeds 60&#xb0;, the necessary length of the major axis direction of the linear laser beam increases suddenly, and accordingly the necessary beam spot area enlarges suddenly. When this angle is less than or equal to 60&#xb0;, the beam spot area can be small.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In a method of forming a glass pattern in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, which includes the steps of the above method of forming a glass pattern, the frit paste is provided to have a closed curve shape with four sides in which two pairs of opposite sides are parallel, and scan with the laser beam is performed so that an angle formed between the minor axis and each of the sides of the frit paste is greater than or equal to 0&#xb0; and less than or equal to 60&#xb0; and so that the minor axis is turned 90&#xb0; at a corner portion connected to two sides of the closed curve shape which are not opposite to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In such a method, the laser irradiation step can be completed by one-time scan along the frit paste forming a closed curve shape; thus, process simplification can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Further, a sealed structure sealed with a glass layer with corner portions having the same shapes can be fabricated. By having the same shapes, the corner portions do not differ in residual stress caused by internal deformation, which leads to a highly reliable sealed structure. In addition, both the outer edge and the inner edge of each corner portion can be shaped like an arc. With such corner portions having a curvature, internal stress in the glass layer can be diminished, so that generation of a crack can be made more difficult. In this case, the curvature radius is preferably large.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a method of forming a glass pattern in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, which includes the steps of the above method of forming a glass pattern, the frit paste is provided to have a closed curve shape with four sides in which two pairs of opposite sides are parallel, and scan with the laser beam is performed so that an angle formed between the minor axis and each of the sides of the frit paste is greater than or equal to 0&#xb0; and less than or equal to 60&#xb0; and so that the minor axis is turned 90&#xb0; in a region between two corner portions connected to one side of the closed curve shape.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In such a method, with corner portions having the same shapes, scan is performed linearly at the corner portions, whereby uniform irradiation can be performed without generating a difference in the laser beam irradiation period between the inner portion and the perimeter portion; thus, a sealed structure which has few cracks can be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a method of forming a glass pattern in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, which includes the steps of the above method of forming a glass pattern, the frit paste is provided to have a closed curve shape with four sides in which two pairs of opposite sides are parallel, and scan with the laser beam is performed so that an angle formed between the minor axis and each of the sides of the frit paste is 45&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When scan is performed with the minor axis tilted 45&#xb0; to the scanning direction of the linear laser beam as described above, scan with the linear laser beam can be performed along the frit paste without turning the linear laser beam even in the case where the scanning direction is turned 90&#xb0; at a corner portion of the substrate or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When the angle formed between the minor axis direction and the scanning direction is set to 45&#xb0;, scan can be performed while this angle is constantly kept 45&#xb0; over the four sides of the frit paste, especially in the case where a right angle is formed between two sides of the frit paste which are not opposite to each other. Hence, even when conditions for the irradiation with the laser beam are common to the two sides that are not opposite to each other, the heating state of the frit paste can be equalized and the welded state of the glass fits can be uniform; thus, a highly reliable sealed structure can be filmed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Note that in this specification and the like, the expression a substantially uniform width is not limited to a completely uniform width and a width is substantially uniform as long as the length of the narrowest portion is 90% or more of that of the widest portion.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Note that the term closed curve in this specification and the like means a continuous curve having no end points. The term curve here includes the concept of straight line and line segment in a broad sense. Therefore, a component which includes a plurality of line segments each having an end point overlapping with any of the other end points, such as a periphery of a quadrilateral, is also one mode of the closed curve shape. Further, a circle, an ellipse, a shape in which a plurality of curves having different curvatures is continuously connected, a shape including a straight linear portion and a curve portion, and the like are also modes of the closed curve shape.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this specification and the like, the term direction means not only a given direction but also a direction obtained by turning the given direction 180 degrees, that is, a direction opposite to the given direction. Further, a direction is referred to as an orientation in some cases. Furthermore, the term parallel in this specification and the like means not only the state in which directions are exactly parallel to each other but also the state in which an angle formed between directions that are parallel to each other is within &#xb1;10&#xb0;. The term orthogonal in this specification and the like means not only the state in which directions exactly orthogonal to each other but also the state in which an angle formed between directions that are orthogonal to each other is within &#xb1;10&#xb0;. The term perpendicular in this specification and the like means not only the state in which directions are exactly perpendicular to each other but also the state in which an angle formed between directions that are perpendicular to each other is within &#xb1;10&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, the term angle in this specification and the like means not only an exact angle but also an angle that is deviates by an angle within &#xb1;10&#xb0;. For example, the term right angle means not only an exact right angle but also an angle that is deviates from an exact right angle by an angle within &#xb1;10&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The term an EL layer in this specification and the like means a layer provided between a pair of electrodes of a light-emitting element, and specifically means at least a layer including a light-emitting organic compound (also referred to as a light-emitting layer), or a stack including the light-emitting layer.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The term a light-emitting device in this specification means an image display device, and a light source (including a lighting device). In addition, the light-emitting device includes any of the following modules in its category: a module in which a connector such as an FPC (flexible printed circuit), a TAB (tape automated bonding) tape, or a TCP (tape carrier package) is attached to a light-emitting device; a module having a TAB tape or a TCP provided with a printed wiring board at the end thereof; and a module having an IC (integrated circuit) directly mounted over a substrate over which a light-emitting element is formed by a COG (chip on glass) method.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In accordance with the present invention, a method of heating a composition which is applicable to a substrate provided with a material having low heat resistance can be provided. Further, a method of forming a glass pattern by which generation of a crack can be made difficult can be provided.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. Note that the invention is not limited to the following description, and it will be easily understood by those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Therefore, the invention should not be construed as being limited to the description in the following embodiments. Note also that in the structures of one embodiment of the present invention described below, the same reference numerals in different drawings represent components that are identical or have similar functions, the description of which is not repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Note that in each drawing of this specification, the size, the thickness, or the region of each component is exaggerated for clarity in some cases. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to such scales.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this embodiment, a method of heating a composition and a method of manufacturing a sealed structure in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2F</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5F</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A to 7C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9D</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>. Here, as one example of the method of heating a composition, a method of heating a frit paste which is one mode of the composition is described. The frit paste is a composition containing low-melting glass frits as a dispersoid and a binder formed of an organic resin and an organic solvent as a disperse medium.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In the heating method of one embodiment of the present invention, scan with a laser beam is performed so that there can be no difference in the laser beam irradiation period between the middle portion and the perimeter portion of the frit paste. Specifically, irradiation with a laser beam is performed so that the width of the beam spot shape overlapping with the frit paste in a direction parallel to the scanning direction is substantially uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Therefore the beam spot shape which is used is a shape in which two opposite sides intersecting with the scanning direction are substantially parallel to each other, such as a quadrilateral such as a rectangle (an oblong or a square) or a parallelogram, or an ellipse, in a region of the beam spot which overlaps with the frit paste. Alternatively, a circular laser beam can be used as long as its spot diameter is sufficiently larger than the width of the frit paste.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">&#x3c;Heating Method Using Laser Beam Having Rectangular Beam Spot&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> schematically illustrates the beam spot shape of a laser beam <b>150</b> having a rectangular beam spot, which can be used for the heating method of one embodiment of the present invention, and illustrates the intensity distributions thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Among the intensity distributions in the directions along sides (X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b> and Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b>) of the laser beam <b>150</b>, the intensity distribution in the direction perpendicular to the scanning direction is preferably uniform as much as possible. For example, the intensity distribution in the direction perpendicular to the scanning direction preferably has a flat-top shape. Further, the intensity distribution in the direction parallel to the scanning direction is also preferably uniform, but may have an intensity distribution in which the intensity varies along the direction parallel to the scanning direction like a Gaussian distribution, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> schematically illustrates the state where scan with the laser beam <b>150</b> is performed along the frit paste <b>110</b> in the scanning direction <b>103</b>. Scan with the laser beam <b>150</b> is preferably performed in a direction parallel to a pair of opposite sides of the beam spot shape. By such scanning, the middle portion and the perimeter portion of the frit paste are irradiated in one period as indicated by the arrows in the drawing, and thus uniform heating is possible.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the case of the frit paste <b>110</b> provided to be curved, it is scanned while the laser beam <b>150</b> is turned along a curvature of the frit paste <b>110</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. Thus, even a curved portion can be uniformly heated.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Furthermore, in the case where part of the glass frits in the frit paste <b>110</b> are melted by the irradiation with the laser beam <b>150</b> and then cooled and solidified, the solidification proceeds uniformly in one direction, so that concentration of a stress at the middle portion can be prevented; accordingly, a residual stress in the glass layer, which may cause a crack, can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Here, in particular, when a laser beam having a beam spot shape with a major axis and a minor axis orthogonal to the major axis (linear laser beam) is used as the laser beam, the spot area can be extremely reduced compared with a circular laser beam. Accordingly, the area of a useless region that does not contribute to heating of the frit paste can be reduced, which achieves effective heating of the frit paste. The spot area is preferably reduced also in that the frit paste can be effectively heated with lower output than when a circular laser beam is used.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">A method of heating the frit paste using a linear laser beam is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">&#x3c;Spot Shape of Linear Laser Beam&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">First, a linear laser beam which can be used for the heating method applicable to one embodiment of the present invention is described.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> schematically illustrates the beam spot shape of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> and the intensity distributions thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The linear laser beam <b>100</b> is a laser beam whose beam spot shape on an irradiated surface has a major axis <b>101</b> and a minor axis <b>102</b> orthogonal to each other. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the linear laser beam <b>100</b> having an oblong beam spot shape is illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In terms of the ratio between the major axis <b>101</b> and the minor axis <b>102</b>, the major axis <b>101</b> is longer than at least the minor axis <b>102</b>. Here, when the major axis <b>101</b> is 1.3 or more times as long as the minor axis <b>102</b>, the beam spot area of the laser beam can be smaller than that of a circular laser beam having a diameter the length of which is the same as the length of the major axis <b>101</b>. When the linear laser beam <b>100</b> having such a beam spot shape is used, energy efficiency can be higher than when a circular laser beam is used; accordingly, the fit paste can be efficiently heated with lower output.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The intensity distribution of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> in the direction (X<b>1</b>-X<b>2</b>) along the major axis <b>101</b> is preferably uniform as much as possible. For example, the intensity distribution in the direction along the major axis preferably has a flat-top shape. In addition, the intensity distribution in the direction (Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b>) along the minor axis <b>102</b> is preferably uniform, but may have an intensity distribution in which the intensity varies along the direction (Y<b>1</b>-Y<b>2</b>) like a Gaussian distribution, for example, because the scanning direction and the minor axis <b>102</b> are not orthogonal to each other in scan with the linear laser beam <b>100</b>, as described later.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> may take various shapes without being limited to an oblong. For example, the beam spot shape may be an ellipse as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> or an oblong having rounded corners as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Alternatively, the linear laser beam <b>100</b> may be formed in such a way that circular laser beams are overlapped with each other. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, circular laser beams are partly overlapped with each other in the major axis <b>101</b> direction. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, circular laser beams are partly overlapped with each other both in the major axis <b>101</b> direction and in the minor axis <b>102</b> direction. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, laser beams having an ellipse beam spot shape are partly overlapped with each other in the major axis <b>101</b> direction.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A method of optically Ruining the linear laser beam <b>100</b> having a shape described above is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The above explanation is provided of the beam spot shape of the linear laser beam <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">&#x3c;Scan with Linear Laser Beam <b>100</b>&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Next, a scanning method with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> for heating the frit paste using the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The frit paste <b>110</b> formed over the first substrate <b>111</b> is irradiated with the linear laser beam <b>100</b>. At this time, scan with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is performed along a region where the frit paste <b>110</b> is provided. The irradiation with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> heats the frit paste <b>110</b>. The binder is removed by decomposition or volatilization of the organic resin and the organic solvent in the binder. Note that this step is also referred to as prebaking. At this time, the glass fits are partly or wholly welded or aggregated, thereby forming the glass layer including low-melting glass.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">At this time, in the solidified glass layer, the glass frits may be completely melted and then welded to form a whole or the glass frits may be partially welded. An absorbent material which can absorb the laser beam with which the irradiation is performed may be dispersed in the glass layer after the prebaking. In addition, it is preferable that the binder be completely removed, although it might fail to be completely removed and remain in the glass layer depending on the conditions for the irradiation with the laser beam.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In order that a sealed structure is fabricated after that, with the second substrate <b>112</b> placed to face the first substrate <b>111</b> and to be in contact with the glass layer, the glass layer is heated by irradiation with a laser beam or the like through the first substrate <b>111</b> or the second substrate <b>112</b>, and accordingly can be melted and welded to the second substrate <b>112</b>. Thus, the sealed structure having a sealed region surrounded by the first substrate <b>111</b>, the second substrate <b>112</b>, and the glass layer can be fabricated. Note that the glass layer can be heated using the heating method of one embodiment of the present invention and accordingly can be uniformly heated. Thus, a highly reliable sealed structure which has few cracks can be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Here, an angle formed between the scanning direction, in which scan is performed with the linear laser beam <b>100</b>, and the major axis or the minor axis of the beam spot of the linear laser beam is described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. For clarity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the relationship between the major axis direction <b>101</b><i>a </i>parallel to the major axis <b>101</b> of the linear laser beam <b>100</b>, the minor axis direction <b>102</b><i>a </i>parallel to the minor axis <b>102</b>, and the scanning direction <b>103</b> of the linear laser beam <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Scan is performed with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> while it is held so that the scanning direction <b>103</b> and the minor axis direction <b>102</b><i>a </i>are not orthogonal to each other, i.e., so that a cosine component of the minor axis direction <b>102</b><i>a </i>with respect to the scanning direction <b>103</b> is not 0 (cos(&#x3b8;) is not 0).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">An angle between the scanning direction <b>103</b> and the minor axis <b>102</b> (&#x3b8; in FIG. <b>3</b>) is preferably greater than or equal to 0&#xb0; and less than or equal to 60&#xb0;. When a region having a uniform width is irradiated, the necessary length of the major axis <b>101</b> of the beam spot is proportional to 1/cos(&#x3b8;), where &#x3b8; represents the angle formed between the minor axis <b>102</b> and the scanning direction <b>103</b>. Therefore, when this angle exceeds 60&#xb0;, the necessary length of the major axis <b>101</b> of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> increases suddenly, and accordingly the necessary beam spot area enlarges suddenly. When this angle is less than or equal to 60&#xb0;, the beam spot area can be small.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> schematically illustrates the case where scan with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is performed along the frit paste <b>110</b> so that the angle between the scanning direction <b>103</b> and the minor axis <b>102</b> can be 0&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Such scan with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> enables uniform heating without a difference in the laser beam irradiation period between the middle portion and the perimeter portion of the frit paste <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Further, when the glass frits and the substrate heated by the linear laser beam <b>100</b> are cooled, the cooling proceeds in one direction along the scanning direction <b>103</b> as indicated by the dashed-line arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, and hence concentration of a stress at the middle portion of the glass layer or the substrate after the solidification can be made difficult. Accordingly, internal deformation in the glass layer or the substrate after the solidification becomes uniform, so that a residual stress, which may cause a crack, can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> schematically illustrates the case where scan is performed along the frit paste <b>110</b> while the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is tilted so that the angle between the scanning direction <b>103</b> and the minor axis <b>102</b> can exceed 0&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Also when the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is tilted to the scanning direction <b>103</b> as described above, uniform heating can be achieved without a difference in the laser beam irradiation period between the middle portion and the perimeter portion of the frit paste <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Further, when the glass frits and the substrate heated by the linear laser beam <b>100</b> are cooled, the solidification proceeds in one direction which is substantially parallel to the minor axis <b>102</b> direction of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> as indicated by the dashed-line arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. Accordingly, stress concentration at the glass layer or the substrate after the solidification can be made difficult, so that a residual stress, which may cause a crack, can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the case where the linear laser beam <b>100</b> having an ellipse beam spot shape is used, for example, there may be a slight difference in the laser beam irradiation period between the middle portion and the perimeter portion of the frit paste <b>110</b>. In such a case, scanning speed, output, or the like is preferably adjusted so as to reduce a difference in temperature between the middle portion and the perimeter portion. Further, with the use of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> having an ellipse beam spot shape, the irradiation period of the perimeter portion of the frit paste <b>110</b> is preferably 90% or more, preferably 95% or more, of the irradiation period of the middle portion.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">&#x3c;Methods of Heating Frit Paste and Manufacturing Sealed Structure&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Examples of a method of heating a frit paste using the above-described linear laser beam and a method of manufacturing a sealed structure including a sealed region surrounded by two opposite substrates and a glass layer are described below.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In formation of the sealed structure, the frit paste is provided over the first substrate so as to have a closed curve shape. Scan with the linear laser beam is performed along the closed curve shape. Specifically, scan with the linear laser beam is performed so that an angle formed between the minor axis direction of the beam spot and the tangent of the closed curve shape is kept in the range greater than or equal to 0&#xb0; and less than or equal to 60&#xb0;. A specific scanning method is also described below.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Method Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">In this method example, a method in which scan is performed along the frit paste <b>110</b> while the minor axis of the linear laser <b>100</b> is tilted to the scanning direction <b>103</b> to heat the frit paste <b>110</b> and a method of manufacturing a sealed structure are described using <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5F</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5F</figref> are schematic top views of this method example.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">First, the frit paste <b>110</b> is formed over the first substrate <b>111</b>. The frit paste <b>110</b> is provided to have a closed curve shape having four sides, in which two pairs of opposite sides are parallel. In other words, the frit paste <b>110</b> is provided to have a shape which has two pairs of opposite parallel linear portions and in which two linear portions that are not opposite to each other forms a continuous line at a corner portion.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Here, the shape of the corner portion to which the two linear portions that are not opposite to each other are connected may be a right angle, an acute angle, or an obtuse angle. The corner portion may be curved or may have a plurality of obtuse angles.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The shapes of the inner and outer edges of the frit paste <b>110</b> forming a closed curve may be different. For example, the inner edge may be a quadrilateral while the outer edge is a polygonal.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The shapes of the corner portion and the inner and outer edges of the frit paste <b>110</b> described above are determined as appropriate so as to overlap with a region irradiated with the linear laser beam <b>100</b>, in accordance with a scanning method with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> which is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In this method example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the frit paste <b>110</b> is formed so that it has four corner portions (corner portions <b>115</b><i>a </i>to <b>115</b><i>d</i>) and the inner edge is a quadrilateral while the outer edge is a hexagon, in which each of a pair of opposite corner portions (corner portions <b>115</b><i>b </i>and <b>115</b><i>d</i>) has two obtuse angles (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The frit paste <b>110</b> can be formed as follows: a frit paste in which glass fits formed of powder glass are combined with a binder formed of an organic resin diluted with an organic solvent, for example, is applied to the first substrate <b>111</b> by a known method such as a screen printing method or a dispensing method.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The glass material used for the glass frits preferably contains one or more compounds selected from, for example, the following group: magnesium oxide, calcium oxide, barium oxide, lithium oxide, sodium oxide, potassium oxide, boron oxide, vanadium oxide, zinc oxide, tellurium oxide, aluminum oxide, silicon dioxide, lead oxide, tin oxide, phosphorus oxide, ruthenium oxide, rhodium oxide, iron oxide, copper oxide, titanium oxide, tungsten oxide, bismuth oxide, antimony oxide, lead borate glass, tin phosphate glass, vanadate glass, and borosilicate glass.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">After that, the frit paste <b>110</b> is scanned and irradiated with the linear laser beam <b>100</b>. The frit paste <b>110</b> is heated and the binder is removed. Hereinafter, the way how scan with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is performed along the frit paste <b>110</b> is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">First, the frit paste <b>110</b> is scanned with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> along one linear portion (also referred to as one side) of the frit paste <b>110</b> and irradiated with the laser beam. At this time, irradiation is performed while the minor axis direction of the spot shape of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is tilted to the scanning direction (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). Here, the hatch pattern of the glass layer <b>113</b>, which has been irradiated with the laser beam and from which the binder has been removed, is different from the hatch pattern of the frit paste <b>110</b> for clarity in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A to 5F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Here, an angle formed between the minor axis direction of the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> and the scanning direction <b>103</b> is preferably set to 45&#xb0;. When the angle formed between the minor axis direction and the scanning direction <b>103</b> is set to 45&#xb0;, scan can be performed while this angle is constantly kept 45&#xb0; over the four sides of the frit paste <b>110</b>, especially in the case where a right angle is formed between two sides of the frit paste <b>110</b> which are not opposite to each other. Hence, even when conditions for the irradiation with the laser beam are common to the two sides that are not opposite to each other, the frit paste <b>110</b> can be uniformly heated; thus, a highly reliable sealed structure can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In this method example, the case where the angle formed between the minor axis direction of the beam spot shape of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> and the scanning direction <b>103</b> is set to 45&#xb0; is described.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Next, after the linear laser beam <b>100</b> reaches the corner portion <b>115</b><i>a </i>of the frit paste <b>110</b>, scan is then performed along the frit paste <b>110</b> toward the corner portion <b>115</b><i>b </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Next, after the linear laser beam <b>100</b> reaches the corner portion <b>115</b><i>b </i>of the frit paste <b>110</b>, scan is then performed along the frit paste <b>110</b> toward the corner portion <b>115</b><i>c </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Here, since the minor axis direction of the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is tilted to the scanning direction <b>103</b> in scanning, part of the corner portion <b>115</b><i>b </i>is irradiated with the laser beam twice. Therefore a condition for irradiation with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is preferably changed at the corner portion <b>115</b><i>b</i>. For example, at the corner portion <b>115</b><i>b</i>, scanning speed is increased or irradiation intensity is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">After that, scan with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is performed as described above along the frit paste <b>110</b> from the corner portion <b>115</b><i>c </i>toward the corner portion <b>115</b><i>d </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">After the linear laser beam <b>100</b> reaches the corner portion <b>115</b><i>d</i>, scan with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is performed to an irradiation starting region between the corner portion <b>115</b><i>d </i>and the corner portion <b>115</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>). At this time a condition for irradiation with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is preferably changed at the corner portion <b>115</b><i>d</i>, as at the corner portion <b>115</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Thus, the frit paste <b>110</b> provided over the first substrate <b>111</b> is heated, so that the binder can be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In one embodiment of the present invention, because of the use of the linear laser beam <b>100</b>, the area of the region that is irradiated with the laser beam twice (also referred to as an overlap region) in the irradiation starting region can be extremely smaller than that with the use of a circular laser beam. The heat history of the overlap region is different from that of the other region, and therefore the welded state of the glass layer <b>113</b>, from which the binder is removed and which is solidified, or internal deformation generated in the substrate might be different from that in the other region; hence, such a difference might cause stress concentration to generate a crack. By use of the linear laser beam <b>100</b>, the area of the overlap region can be extremely small; accordingly, few cracks are generated and a highly reliable sealed structure can be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">After that, a second substrate is placed to face the first substrate <b>111</b> and to be in contact with the glass layer <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Next, the glass layer <b>113</b> is scanned and irradiated with a laser beam through the first substrate <b>111</b> or the second substrate <b>112</b> so that the glass layer <b>113</b> is melted and solidified; accordingly the glass layer <b>113</b> is welded to the second substrate <b>112</b>. At this time, the glass layer <b>113</b> and the second substrate <b>112</b> are preferably treated while a pressure is applied so that they can be in contact with each other without fail. The glass layer <b>113</b> and the second substrate <b>112</b> may be treated while interposed using a clamp or the like outside the region irradiated with the laser beam, or may be treated while a pressure is uniformly applied to a substrate surface from one or both of the first substrate <b>111</b> and the second substrate <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">At this time, the inside of the sealed region is preferably brought into an inert gas atmosphere or a reduced pressure atmosphere after the irradiation with the laser beam. For example, before the irradiation with the laser beam, a sealing material such as an ultraviolet curable resin or a thermosetting resin is formed in advance outside or inside a region where the frit paste <b>110</b> is applied; then, the two substrates are temporarily bonded to each other with the sealing material in an inert gas atmosphere or a reduced pressure atmosphere and then irradiated with the laser beam in an air atmosphere or an inert gas atmosphere. When the sealing material is provided to have a closed curve shape, the structure of an apparatus can be simplified because the inside of the sealed region is kept in an inert gas atmosphere or a reduced pressure atmosphere and the irradiation with the laser beam can be performed in an air atmosphere. Further, when the inside of the sealed region is brought into a reduced pressure atmosphere in advance, the irradiation with the laser beam can be performed while the glass layer <b>113</b> and the second substrate <b>112</b> are in contact with each other without fail due to a pressure difference, without using a mechanism such as a clamp for pressing the two substrates.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Note that the above-described heating method using the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is also preferably applied to the step of irradiating the glass layer <b>113</b> with a laser beam. With the use of the linear laser beam <b>100</b>, the glass layer <b>113</b> can be uniformly heated, which reduces internal stress in the glass layer <b>113</b> after the solidification. Accordingly, a highly reliable sealed structure which has few cracks can be fabricated.</p>
<heading id="h-0012" level="1">Method Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">A method of heating the fit paste <b>110</b>, which is different from that in the above method example, is described. The linear laser beam <b>100</b> used in this method example not only can be used for scan along the frit paste <b>110</b> but also can be turned around a turn axis perpendicular to an irradiated surface.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Scan with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is performed along the frit paste <b>110</b> provided to have a closed curve shape having four sides in which two pairs of opposite sides are parallel so that the beam spot can be turned 90&#xb0; at a corner portion or in a region between two corner portions that are not opposite to each other, whereby the glass layer <b>113</b> with corner portions having the same shapes can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> illustrate examples of methods in each of which scan is performed so that the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can be turned 90&#xb0; at a corner portion.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In the method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the angle funned between the minor axis direction of the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> and the scanning direction <b>103</b> is greater than or equal to 0&#xb0; and less than or equal to 60&#xb0; over a linear portion (side) of the frit paste <b>110</b>. In this method example, scan is performed so that the angle can be 0&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">When the linear laser beam <b>100</b> reaches the corner portion, scan is performed in such a way that the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is turned around a turn axis <b>117</b>. At this time, the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is turned so that one end in the major axis direction of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can constantly correspond to the turn axis <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">After that, scan with the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is performed along the frit paste <b>110</b>. At this time, since the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is turned 90&#xb0; at the corner portion, the angle formed between the minor axis direction and the scanning direction <b>103</b> can constantly be the same (0&#xb0; here) on the two sides forming a continuous line at the corner portion.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The shape of the frit paste <b>110</b> at the corner portion is adjusted so that it can overlap with a region irradiated with the linear laser beam <b>100</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the frit paste <b>110</b> is provided so as to have an inner edge having a right angle and an outer edge having two obtuse angles at the corner portion.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">By scan at the four corner portions of the frit paste <b>110</b> as described above, a sealed structure sealed with the glass layer <b>113</b> with corner portions having the same shapes can be fabricated. By having the same shapes, the corner portions do not differ in residual stress caused by internal deformation, which leads to a highly reliable sealed structure.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the turn axis <b>117</b> does not correspond to one end in the major axis direction of the linear laser beam <b>100</b>. Scan is performed so that the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can be turned around a point on the extension of the major axis, which serves as the turn axis <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Such scan can reduce a difference in the laser beam irradiation period between the inner portion and the perimeter portion when the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is turned. Accordingly, variation in the heating temperatures of the frit paste <b>110</b> at the corner portion can be small, so that internal stress generated in the glass layer <b>113</b> or the substrate after the heating can be diminished and few cracks are generated at the corner portion.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the outer and inner edges of each corner portion can be shaped like an arc. With such curved corner portions, internal stress in the glass layer <b>113</b> can be diminished, so that generation of a crack can be made more difficult. In this case, the curvature radius is preferably large.</p>
<heading id="h-0013" level="1">Method Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">In this method example, a method in which the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is turned in a region including a linear portion (side) of the fit paste <b>110</b> is described, although the method in which the beam spot is turned at a corner portion is described in the above Method example 2.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates the state in which scan is performed so that the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can be turned 90&#xb0; between two corner portions that are not opposite to each other. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, scan is performed so that the locus of a center <b>118</b> of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can be parallel to the scanning direction <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">When scan is thus performed so that the center <b>118</b> of the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can overlap with the middle portion of the frit paste <b>110</b>, use of an end portion of the linear laser beam <b>100</b>, which has a relatively low intensity, is unnecessary and accordingly the frit paste <b>110</b> can be uniformly heated.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Alternatively, the locus of the center <b>118</b> of the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can be shaped like an arc, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7B and 7C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">For example, in order that the area of a portion inside the sealed region which is irradiated with the laser beam can be reduced, specifically, in order that a circuit element, a light-emitting element, or the like can be formed even in the vicinity of the frit paste <b>110</b>, scan is performed so that the locus of the center <b>118</b> can be shaped like an arc outside the sealed region as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. Consequently, the locus of the laser beam in the sealed region can be linear.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In contrast, in order that the area of a portion outside the sealed region which is irradiated with the laser beam can be reduced, specifically, in order that a display device with a narrow frame can be formed, scan is performed so that the locus of the center <b>118</b> can be shaped like an arc inside the sealed region as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. Consequently, the locus of the laser beam outside the sealed region can be linear.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In the scanning method illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, scan is performed so that the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can be turned 90&#xb0; at a linear portion and so that an angle between the minor axis direction and the scanning direction can be 45&#xb0; at the corner portion as described in the above method example. Note that although scan is performed so that the locus of the center <b>118</b> can be parallel to the scanning direction at a linear portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the locus may be shaped like an arc as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In such a scanning method, the glass layer <b>113</b> with corner portions having the same shapes can be formed and uniform irradiation can be performed by linear scan at the corner portions without generating a difference in the laser beam irradiation period between the middle portion and the perimeter portion; thus, a sealed structure which has few cracks can be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">The above explanation is provided of the scanning method with the linear laser beam <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">[Method of Forming Linear Laser Beam <b>100</b>]</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">A method of optically forming the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">As an exit hole through which the laser beam is emitted, for example, an optical fiber is used and may be directly connected to a laser oscillator so that the laser beam can be extracted. Any of mirrors and lenses may be combined so that the laser beam can be extracted.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Here, by using an optical fiber as described above whose cross section is a square, the laser beam <b>150</b> having a square beam spot shape as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> can be formed. Alternatively, by using an optical fiber whose cross section is an oblong, the linear laser beam <b>100</b> having an oblong beam spot shape with a major axis and a minor axis orthogonal to the major axis can be formed. Further alternatively, concentration of light with a mirror or a lens may be utilized to form a square or oblong beam spot on an irradiated surface so that the laser beam <b>150</b> or the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Alternatively, the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can also be fainted in such a way that circular laser beams are overlapped with each other. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A to 9D</figref> are schematic views each illustrating the case where circular laser beams emitted through exit holes <b>121</b> to an irradiated surface <b>123</b> are overlapped with each other to form the linear laser beam <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, the exit holes <b>121</b> are arranged at equal intervals on a straight line and the circular laser beams <b>120</b> emitted through the exit holes <b>121</b> are overlapped with each other; thus, the linear laser beam <b>100</b> having a linear beam spot can be formed on the irradiated surface <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In this case, when the exit holes <b>121</b> are arranged so that the beam spots of the circular laser beams <b>120</b> can be partly overlapped with each other, the intensity distribution in the major axis direction of the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can be made closer to a uniform distribution.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, a matrix of exit holes <b>121</b> may be arranged in the horizontal and vertical directions to form the linear laser beam <b>100</b>. This structure leads to uniform intensity distribution in the minor axis direction of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> and a wide width in the minor axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9C</figref>, groups of exit holes including the plurality of exit holes <b>121</b> arranged at equal intervals on a straight line may be arranged while being tilted to the direction perpendicular to the irradiated surface <b>123</b> so that the circular laser beams <b>120</b> emitted through the plurality of exit holes <b>121</b> can be condensed on the irradiated surface <b>123</b> to form the linear laser beam <b>100</b>. This structure can improve the intensity distributions of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> and reduce the width in the minor axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>, a light-blocking mask <b>125</b> having an opening may be provided between the plurality of exit holes <b>121</b> and the irradiated surface <b>123</b> so that the linear laser beam <b>100</b> having a beam spot shape reflecting the shape of the opening of the light-blocking mask can be formed. When the light-blocking mask blocks an outer end portion of the laser beam <b>100</b>, which has a relatively low intensity, in this way, the intensity distributions of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> are improved and the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can take any shape.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">A lens may be used to condense the linear laser beam <b>100</b> on the irradiated surface <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> is a schematic view illustrating the case where a cylindrical lens <b>127</b> is used to condense the circular laser beam <b>120</b> so that the linear laser beam <b>100</b> having an ellipse beam spot can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">The cylindrical lens <b>127</b> can converge or diverge light only in one axis direction. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, when the circular laser beam <b>120</b> enters the cylindrical lens <b>127</b>, the circular laser beam <b>120</b> is converged only in the Y axis direction, so that it has an ellipse beam spot after passing through the cylindrical lens <b>127</b>. Thus, the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can be formed with the circular laser beam <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Instead of the cylindrical lens <b>127</b>, a toroidal lens with different curvatures in two orthogonal axes may be used. The toroidal lens enables concentration of light or divergence also in the major axis direction, so that not only the length of the minor axis of the beam spot but also the length of the major axis thereof can be controlled. Alternatively, an aspheric lens or the like may be used for concentration of light so that a desired beam spot can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Alternatively, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, a plurality of circular laser beams may be condensed on the irradiated surface <b>123</b> through the cylindrical lens <b>127</b> so that the beam spots of the circular laser beams can be partly overlapped with each other to form the linear laser beam <b>100</b>. With this structure, the linear laser beam <b>100</b> can have a narrow width in the minor axis direction and high energy density.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Note that when scan is performed in such a way that the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is turned, groups of exit holes are provided capable of being turned around the axis perpendicular to the irradiated surface. Alternatively, when a lens is used, the lens is provided capable of being turned.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Alternatively, the irradiated surface may be provided capable of being turned while the beam spot of the linear laser beam <b>100</b> is not turned. For example, as a stage supporting a substrate having a surface to be irradiated, a stage which is not only movable in the X-direction and the Y-direction but also provided with a turn axis perpendicular to the X-Y plane is used.</p>

<p id="p-0173" num="0172">As a material for the substrate provided on the side from which light is extracted, a material having a light-transmitting property, such as glass or quartz, can be used. A material for the substrate provided on the side opposite to the side from which light is extracted does not necessarily have a light-transmitting property, and a material such as a metal, a semiconductor, or ceramics can be used as well as the above materials. In the case where an electrically conductive substrate is used, it preferably has an insulating property by having an oxidized surface or a surface provided with an insulating film. An organic resin can also be used as long as it is resistant to heat during the process.

Note that when a metal material (or a nitride thereof) is used, its thickness is reduced so that light-transmitting property can be obtained. Alternatively, a stack of films of any of the above materials can be used as the electrically conductive layers.

Examples of the alloy material are alloys containing aluminum (aluminum alloys) such as an alloy of aluminum and titanium, an alloy of aluminum and nickel, and an alloy of aluminum and neodymium; and alloys containing silver such as an alloy of silver and copper and an alloy of silver and magnesium. An alloy of silver and copper is preferable because of its high heat resistance. Further, by stacking a metal film or a metal oxide film in contact with an aluminum alloy film, oxidation of the aluminum alloy film can be suppressed. Examples of a material for the metal film or the metal oxide film are titanium, titanium oxide, and the like. Alternatively, a stack of a film containing any of the above light-transmitting materials and a film containing any of the above metal materials may be used.

<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Further alternatively, a high molecular compound (e.g., an oligomer, a dendrimer, or a polymer) can be used. A high molecular compound to which acid is added can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">In particular, the hole-injection layer <b>701</b> is preferably formed with a composite material in which an acceptor substance is mixed with an organic compound having a high hole-transport property. The use of the composite material in which an acceptor substance is mixed with a substance having a high hole-transport property, allows efficient hole injection from the first electrode <b>403</b>, and reduction in driving voltage of the light-emitting element. Such a composite material can be formed by co-evaporation of a substance having a high hole-transport property and an acceptor substance (an electron acceptor). By using the composite material for the hole-injection layer <b>701</b>, holes can be easily injected from the first electrode <b>403</b> to the EL layer <b>405</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">As the organic compound used for the composite material, any of a variety of compounds such as aromatic amine compounds, carbazole derivatives, aromatic hydrocarbons, and high molecular compounds (such as oligomers, dendrimers, and polymers) can be used.

<p id="p-0233" num="0232">Examples of the acceptor substance are organic compounds and transition metal oxides. Any of oxides of metals belonging to Groups 4 to 8 in the periodic table can also be used. Specifically, it is preferable to use vanadium oxide, niobium oxide, tantalum oxide, chromium oxide, molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide, manganese oxide, or rhenium oxide because of their high electron-accepting property. Among these metal oxides, molybdenum oxide is especially preferable because it is stable in the air, has a low hygroscopic property, and is easily treated.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">A composite material may be formed using a high molecular compound and the aforementioned electron acceptor and used for the hole-injection layer <b>701</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0237" num="0236">For the layer <b>703</b> including a light-emitting organic compound, a fluorescent compound which exhibits fluorescence or a phosphorescent compound which exhibits phosphorescence can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Note that the layer <b>703</b> including a light-emitting organic compound may have a structure in which a light-emitting organic compound (guest material) is dispersed in another substance (host material). Various kinds of materials can be used as the host material, and it is preferable to use a substance which has a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital level (LUMO level) higher than that of the light-emitting substance and has a highest occupied molecular orbital level (HOMO level) lower than that of the light-emitting substance.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Alternatively, two or more kinds of materials can be used as the host material. For example, a substance preventing crystallization may be added in order to prevent crystallization. A different kind of substance may be further added in order to efficiently transfer energy to the guest material. In addition, another substance may be added in order to efficiently transfer energy to the guest material.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">When a structure in which a guest material is dispersed in a host material is employed, crystallization of the layer <b>703</b> including a light-emitting organic compound can be suppressed. Further, concentration quenching due to high concentration of the guest material can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">For the layer <b>703</b> including a light-emitting organic compound, a high molecular compound can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">Further, when a plurality of layers each including a light-emitting organic compound is provided and the emission colors of the layers are made different, light emission of a desired color can be obtained from the light-emitting element as a whole. For example, in a light-emitting element including two layers each including a light-emitting organic compound, the emission color of a first layer including a light-emitting organic compound and the emission color of a second layer including a light-emitting organic compound are made complementary, so that the light-emitting element as a whole can emit white light. Note that &#x201c;complementary colors&#x201d; refer to colors that can produce an achromatic color when mixed. In other words, by mixing light obtained from substances which emit light of complementary colors, white light emission can be obtained. This can be applied to a light-emitting element including three or more layers each including a light-emitting organic compound.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The electron-transport layer <b>704</b> is a layer including a substance having a high electron-transport property. Examples of the substance having a high electron-transport property are mainly ones that have an electron mobility of 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs or higher. Furthermore, the electron-transport layer is not limited to a single layer and may be a stack of two or more layers including any of the above substances.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">The electron-injection layer <b>705</b> is a layer including a substance having a high electron-injection property. For the electron-injection layer <b>705</b>, an alkali metal, an alkaline-earth metal, or a compound thereof, such as lithium, cesium, calcium, lithium fluoride, cesium fluoride, calcium fluoride, or lithium oxide, can be used. A rare-earth metal compound such as erbium fluoride can also be used. Any of the above substances for forming the electron-transport layer <b>704</b> can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">Note that the hole-injection layer <b>701</b>, the hole-transport layer <b>702</b>, the layer <b>703</b> containing a light-emitting organic compound, the electron-transport layer <b>704</b>, and the electron-injection layer <b>705</b> which are described above can each be formed by a method such as an evaporation method (e.g., a vacuum evaporation method), an inkjet method, or a coating method.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>, a plurality of EL layers may be stacked between the first electrode <b>403</b> and the second electrode <b>407</b>. In that case, a charge generation layer <b>803</b> is preferably provided between a first EL layer <b>800</b> and a second EL layer <b>801</b> which are stacked. The charge generation layer <b>803</b> can be formed using the above-described composite material. Further, the charge generation layer <b>803</b> may have a stacked-layer structure including a layer including the composite material and a layer including another material. In that case, as the layer including another material, a layer including a substance having an electron-donating property (a donor substance) and a substance having a high electron-transport property, a layer formed of a transparent conductive film, or the like can be used. A light-emitting element having such a structure is unlikely to suffer the problem of energy transfer, quenching, or the like and gives wider choice of materials, thereby easily having both high light emission efficiency and a long lifetime. In addition, a light-emitting element which provides phosphorescence from one EL layer and fluorescence from another EL layer can be easily obtained. This structure can be combined with any of the above-mentioned EL layer structures.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Furthermore, different emission colors of the EL layers enable light emission of a desired color to be obtained from the light-emitting element as a whole. For example, the emission colors of first and second EL layers are complementary in a light-emitting element having the two EL layers, so that the light-emitting element can be made to emit white light as a whole. This can be applied to a light-emitting element having three or more EL layers.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">In order to obtain white light with a high color rendering property, an emission spectrum needs to cover the whole visible light range and thus a light-emitting element preferably includes three or more EL layers stacked. For example, such a light-emitting element can be formed by stacking EL layers emitting light of the respective colors of red, blue, and green. In this manner, the color rendering property of a light-emitting element can be improved by stacking EL layers of different three or more colors.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">An optical adjustment layer may be formed between the first electrode <b>403</b> and the second electrode <b>407</b>. The optical adjustment layer adjusts the optical distance between a reflective electrode and a light-transmitting electrode. With the optical adjustment layer, light with wavelengths in a specific range can be enhanced so that the color tone can be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, the EL layer <b>405</b> may include, between the first electrode <b>403</b> and the second electrode <b>407</b>, the hole-injection layer <b>701</b>, the hole-transport layer <b>702</b>, the layer <b>703</b> including a light-emitting organic compound, the electron-transport layer <b>704</b>, an electron-injection buffer layer <b>706</b>, an electron-relay layer <b>707</b>, and a composite material layer <b>708</b> that is in contact with the second electrode <b>407</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">The composite material layer <b>708</b> which is in contact with the second electrode <b>407</b> is preferably provided, in which case damage caused to the EL layer <b>405</b> particularly when the second electrode <b>405</b> is formed by a sputtering method can be reduced. The composite material layer <b>708</b> can be formed using the above-described composite material in which an acceptor substance is mixed with an organic compound having a high hole-transport property.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">With the electron-injection buffer layer <b>706</b>, an injection barrier between the composite material layer <b>708</b> and the electron-transport layer <b>704</b> can be reduced, and accordingly electrons generated in the composite material layer <b>708</b> can be easily injected into the electron-transport layer <b>704</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">For the electron-injection buffer layer <b>706</b>, any of the following substances having a high electron-injection property is, used: alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, rare-earth metals, compounds thereof (including alkali metal compounds (including oxides such as lithium oxide, halides, and carbonates such as lithium carbonate or cesium carbonate), alkaline-earth metal compounds (including oxides, halides, and carbonates), and rare-earth metal compounds (including oxides, halides, and carbonates)).</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">In addition, in the case where the electron-injection buffer layer <b>706</b> contains a substance having a high electron-transport property and a donor substance, the donor substance is preferably added so that the mass ratio of the donor substance to the substance having a high electron-transport property is from 0.001:1 to 0.1:1. Note that as the donor substance, an organic compound such as tetrathianaphthacene (abbreviation: TTN), nickelocene, or decamethylnickelocene can also be used other than any of alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, rare-earth metals, compounds thereof (including alkali metal compounds (including oxides such as lithium oxide, halides, and carbonates such as lithium carbonate or cesium carbonate), alkaline-earth metal compounds (including oxides, halides, and carbonates), and rare-earth metal compounds (including oxides, halides, and carbonates)). Note that as the substance having a high electron-injection property, a material similar to the material for the electron transport layer <b>704</b> described above can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">The electron-relay layer <b>707</b> is preferably formed between the electron-injection buffer layer <b>706</b> and the composite material layer <b>708</b>. The electron-relay layer <b>707</b> is not necessarily provided; however, with the electron-relay layer <b>707</b> having a high electron-transport property, electrons can be rapidly transported to the electron-injection buffer layer <b>706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">The structure in which the electron-relay layer <b>707</b> is provided between the composite material layer <b>708</b> and the electron-injection buffer layer <b>706</b> is a structure in which the acceptor substance included in the composite material layer <b>708</b> and the donor substance included in the electron-injection buffer layer <b>706</b> are less likely to interact with each other, and thus their functions hardly interfere with each other. Accordingly, an increase in the driving voltage can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">The electron-relay layer <b>707</b> contains a substance having a high electron-transport property and is formed so that the LUMO level of the substance having a high electron-transport property is located between the LUMO level of the acceptor substance included in the composite material layer <b>708</b> and the LUMO level of the substance having a high electron-transport property which is included in the electron-transport layer <b>704</b>. In the case where the electron-relay layer <b>707</b> contains a donor substance, the donor level of the donor substance is controlled so as to be located between the LUMO level of the acceptor substance in the composite material layer <b>708</b> and the LUMO level of the substance having a high electron-transport property which is included in the electron-transport layer <b>704</b>. As a specific value of the energy level, the LUMO level of the substance having a high electron-transport property which is included in the electron-relay layer <b>707</b> is preferably greater than or equal to &#x2212;5.0 eV, more preferably greater than or equal to &#x2212;5.0 eV and less than or equal to &#x2212;3.0 eV.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">As the substance having a high electron-transport property which is included in the electron-relay layer <b>707</b>, a phthalocyanine-based material or a metal complex having a metal-oxygen bond and an aromatic ligand is preferably used.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">As the metal complex having a metal-oxygen bond and an aromatic ligand, which is included in the electron-relay layer <b>707</b>, a metal complex having a metal-oxygen double bond is preferably used. The metal-oxygen double bond has an acceptor property (a property of easily accepting electrons); thus, electrons can be transferred (donated and accepted) more easily. Further, the metal complex which has a metal-oxygen double bond is considered stable. Thus, the use of the metal complex having the metal-oxygen double bond makes it possible to drive a light-emitting element at low voltage more stably.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">As a metal complex having a metal-oxygen bond and an aromatic ligand, a phthalocyanine-based material is preferable. A substance in which a metal-oxygen double bond is more likely to act on another molecular in terms of a molecular structure is particularly preferable because it has a high acceptor property.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">Note that as the phthalocyanine-based materials described above, a phthalocyanine-based material having a phenoxy group is preferred. Specifically, a phthalocyanine derivative having a phenoxy group, such as PhO-VOPc, is preferred. A phthalocyanine derivative having a phenoxy group is soluble in a solvent. For that reason, such a phthalocyanine derivative has an advantage of being easily handled during formation of a light-emitting element. Further, owing to the solubility in a solvent, such a phthalocyanine derivative also has an advantage of facilitating maintenance of an apparatus used for foaming a film.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">The electron-relay layer <b>707</b> may further contain a donor substance. As the donor substance, an organic compound such as tetrathianaphthacene (abbreviation: TTN), nickelocene, or decamethylnickelocene can be used other than any of alkali metals, alkaline-earth metals, rare-earth metals, compounds thereof (including alkali metal compounds (including oxides such as lithium oxide, halides, and carbonates such as lithium carbonate or cesium carbonate), alkaline-earth metal compounds (including oxides, halides, and carbonates), and rare-earth metal compounds (including oxides, halides, and carbonates)). When such a donor substance is included in the electron-relay layer <b>707</b>, electrons can be transferred easily and the light-emitting element can be driven at lower voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">In the case where a donor substance is included in the electron-relay layer <b>707</b>, in addition to the materials described above as the substance having a high electron-transport property, a substance having a LUMO level greater than the acceptor level of the acceptor substance included in the composite material layer <b>708</b> can be used. Specifically, it is preferable to use a substance having a LUMO level higher than or equal to &#x2212;5.0 eV, preferably higher than or equal to &#x2212;5.0 eV and lower than or equal to &#x2212;3.0 eV. Examples of such a substance, a perylene derivative are nitrogen-containing condensed aromatic compounds and the like. Note that a nitrogen-containing condensed aromatic compound is preferably used for the electron-relay layer <b>707</b> because of its stability.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">Note that in the case where a donor substance is included in the electron-relay layer <b>707</b>, the electron-relay layer <b>707</b> may be formed by a method such as co-evaporation of the substance having a high electron-transport property and the donor substance.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">The hole-injection layer <b>701</b>, the hole-transport layer <b>702</b>, the layer <b>703</b> containing a light-emitting organic compound, and the electron-transport layer <b>704</b> may be formed using the above-described materials.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">In the above manner, the EL layer <b>405</b> of this embodiment can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">This embodiment can be combined with any of the other embodiments described in this specification as appropriate.</p>

<p id="p-0275" num="0274"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref> illustrates an example of a mobile phone. A mobile phone set <b>7400</b> includes a display portion <b>7402</b> incorporated in a housing <b>7401</b>, an operation button <b>7403</b>, an external connection port <b>7404</b>, a speaker <b>7405</b>, a microphone <b>7406</b>, and the like. The mobile phone set <b>7400</b> is manufactured using the light-emitting device for the display portion <b>7402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">When the display portion <b>7402</b> is touched with a finger or the like, data can be input into the mobile phone set <b>7400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15D</figref>. Operations such as making a call and creating an e-mail can be performed by touch on the display portion <b>7402</b> with a finger or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">There are mainly three screen modes of the display portion <b>7402</b>. The first mode is a display mode mainly for displaying images. The second mode is an input mode mainly for inputting data such as text. The third mode is a display-and-input mode in which two modes of the display mode and the input mode are combined.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">For example, in the case of making a call or composing an e-mail, a character input mode mainly for inputting a character is selected for the display portion <b>7402</b> so that a character displayed on a screen can be input. In this case, it is preferable to display a keyboard or number buttons on almost all the area of the screen of the display portion <b>7402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">When a detection device including a sensor for detecting inclination, such as a gyroscope or an acceleration sensor, is provided inside the mobile phone set <b>7400</b>, display on the screen of the display portion <b>7402</b> can be automatically changed by determining the orientation of the mobile phone set <b>7400</b> (whether the mobile phone set is placed horizontally or vertically for a landscape mode or a portrait mode).</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">The screen modes are switched by touching the display portion <b>7402</b> or operating the operation button <b>7403</b> of the housing <b>7401</b>. Alternatively, the screen modes can be switched depending on kinds of images displayed on the display portion <b>7402</b>. For example, when a signal of an image displayed on the display portion is a signal of moving image data, the screen mode is switched to the display mode. When the signal is a signal of text data, the screen mode is switched to the input mode.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Moreover, in the input mode, when input by touching the display portion <b>7402</b> is not performed within a specified period while a signal detected by an optical sensor in the display portion <b>7402</b> is detected, the screen mode may be controlled to be switched from the input mode to the display mode.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">The display portion <b>7402</b> may function as an image sensor. For example, an image of a palm print, a fingerprint, or the like is taken by touching the display portion <b>7402</b> with the palm or the finger, whereby personal authentication can be performed. Further, by providing a backlight or a sensing light source which emits a near-infrared light in the display portion, an image of a finger vein, a palm vein, or the like can also be taken.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15E</figref> illustrates an example of the lighting device. In a lighting device <b>7500</b>, light-emitting devices <b>7503</b><i>a </i>to <b>7503</b><i>d </i>of one embodiment of the present invention are incorporated in a housing <b>7501</b> as light sources. The lighting device <b>7500</b> can be attached to a ceiling, a wall, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">Further, the lighting device includes a light-emitting panel that emits light of a pale color which has high brightness and causes less eyestrain even after long-time use, light of a bright red color, and light of a bright color different from these colors. By adjustment of conditions under which light-emitting elements are driven for each emission color, a lighting device whose hue can be adjusted by a user can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> illustrate a tablet terminal that can be folded. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, the tablet terminal is opened, and includes a housing <b>9630</b>, a display portion <b>9631</b><i>a</i>, a display portion <b>9631</b><i>b</i>, a display-mode switching button <b>9034</b>, a power button <b>9035</b>, a power-saving-mode switching button <b>9036</b>, a clip <b>9033</b>, and an operation button <b>9038</b>. The tablet terminal is manufactured using the light-emitting device for one or both of the display portion <b>9631</b><i>a </i>and the display portion <b>9631</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">A touch panel area <b>9632</b><i>a </i>can be provided in a part of the display portion <b>9631</b><i>a</i>, in which area, data can be input by touching displayed operation keys <b>9637</b>. Note that half of the display portion <b>9631</b><i>a </i>has only a display function and the other half has a touch panel function. However, one embodiment of the present invention is not limited to this structure, and the whole display portion <b>9631</b><i>a </i>may have a touch panel function. For example, a keyboard can be displayed on the whole display portion <b>9631</b><i>a </i>to be used as a touch panel, and the display portion <b>9631</b><i>b </i>can be used as a display screen.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">A touch panel area <b>9632</b><i>b </i>can be provided in part of the display portion <b>9631</b><i>b </i>like in the display portion <b>9631</b><i>a</i>. When a keyboard display switching button <b>9639</b> displayed on the touch panel is touched with a finger, a stylus, or the like, a keyboard can be displayed on the display portion <b>9631</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">The touch panel area <b>9632</b><i>a </i>and the touch panel area <b>9632</b><i>b </i>can be controlled by touch input at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">The display-mode switching button <b>9034</b> allows switching between a landscape mode and a portrait mode, between color display and black-and-white display, and the like. With the power-saving-mode switching button <b>9036</b>, the display luminance can be optimized in accordance with the amount of external light in use which is detected by an optical sensor incorporated in the tablet terminal. In addition to the optical sensor, other detecting devices such as sensors for detecting inclination, like a gyroscope or an acceleration sensor, may be incorporated in the tablet terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">Although the display portion <b>9631</b><i>a </i>and the display portion <b>9631</b><i>b </i>have the same display area in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, one embodiment of the present invention is not limited to this example. The display portion <b>9631</b><i>a </i>and the display portion <b>9631</b><i>b </i>may have different areas or different display quality. For example, one display panel may be capable of higher-definition display than the other display panel.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> illustrates the tablet terminal folded, which includes the housing <b>9630</b>, a solar battery <b>9633</b>, a charge and discharge control circuit <b>9634</b>, a battery <b>9635</b>, and a DCDC converter <b>9636</b>. Note that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>, an example in which the charge and discharge control circuit <b>9634</b> includes the battery <b>9635</b> and the DCDC converter <b>9636</b> is illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">Since the tablet terminal can be folded, the housing <b>9630</b> can be closed when not in use. Thus, the display portions <b>9631</b><i>a </i>and <b>9631</b><i>b </i>can be protected, which makes it possible to provide a tablet terminal with high durability and improved reliability for long-term use.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">The tablet terminal illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref> can have other functions such as a function of displaying various kinds of data (e.g., a still image, a moving image, and a text image), a function of displaying a calendar, a date, the time, or the like on the display portion, a touch-input function of operating or editing the data displayed on the display portion by touch input, and a function of controlling processing by various kinds of software (programs).</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">The solar battery <b>9633</b>, which is attached on the surface of the tablet terminal, supplies electric power to a touch panel, a display portion, an image signal processor, and the like. Note that a structure in which the solar battery <b>9633</b> is provided on one or both surfaces of the housing <b>9630</b> is preferable because the battery <b>9635</b> can be charged efficiently. The use of a lithium ion battery as the battery <b>9635</b> is advantageous in downsizing or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">The structure and operation of the charge and discharge control circuit <b>9634</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> are described with reference to a block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16C</figref> illustrates the solar battery <b>9633</b>, the battery <b>9635</b>, the DCDC converter <b>9636</b>, a converter <b>9638</b>, switches SW<b>1</b> to SW<b>3</b>, and the display portion <b>9631</b>. The battery <b>9635</b>, the DCDC converter <b>9636</b>, the converter <b>9638</b>, and the switches SW<b>1</b> to SW<b>3</b> correspond to the charge and discharge control circuit <b>9634</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">First, an example of the operation in the case where power is generated by the solar battery <b>9633</b> using external light is described. The voltage of power generated by the solar battery is raised or lowered by the DCDC converter <b>9636</b> so that a voltage for charging the battery <b>9635</b> can be obtained. When the display portion <b>9631</b> is operated with the power from the solar battery <b>9633</b>, the switch SW<b>1</b> is turned on and the voltage of the power is raised or lowered by the converter <b>9638</b> to a voltage needed for operating the display portion <b>9631</b>. When display is not performed on the display portion <b>9631</b>, the switch SW<b>1</b> is turned off and the switch SW<b>2</b> is turned on so that the battery <b>9635</b> can be charged.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">Although the solar battery <b>9633</b> is illustrated as an example of a charge means, there is no particular limitation on the charge means and the battery <b>9635</b> may be charged with another means such as a piezoelectric element or a thermoelectric conversion element (Peltier element). For example, the battery <b>9635</b> may be charged with a non-contact power transmission module which is capable of charging by transmitting and receiving power by wireless (without contact), or another charge means used in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">It is needless to say that one embodiment of the present invention is not limited to the electronic devices illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A to 15E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A to 16C</figref> as long as any of the light-emitting devices described in the above embodiment is included.</p>
