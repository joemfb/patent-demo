<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In a radio communication system defining a plurality of bandwidths, mobile terminals of kinds respectively corresponding to the plurality of bandwidths are accommodated in the system, and a minimum transmission bandwidth of the plurality of bandwidths is set as a transmission bandwidth of a downlink common channel. Or, every mobile terminal accommodated in the radio communication system is provided with a capability for processing a bandwidth equal to or greater than a predetermined value, and equal to or more than two transmission bandwidths that are equal to or less than a predetermined value are set as a transmission bandwidth of a downlink common channel. In the latter case, the mobile terminal identifies a bandwidth of a received downlink common channel.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a base station, a mobile terminal, and a signal transmission and reception method used in a radio communication system in which a plurality of different signal bandwidths are defined.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As a successor of W-CDMA and HSDPA, a communication scheme called Evolved UTRA (E-UTRA) is being studied. The E-UTRA is a radio access scheme that supports a plurality of bandwidths in an extensible manner, and that supports bandwidths from 1.25 MHz up to 20 MHz while maintaining compatibility with the existing 3G scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the existing W-CDMA, a single bandwidth of 5 MHz is supported in a same system, channels of uplink (from base station to terminal) and downlink (terminal to base station) are allocated so that data to be transferred is transmitted.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Problem to be Solved by the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In contrast, in a system corresponding to E-UTRA, a plurality of bandwidths are defined in a same system, and different bandwidths are supported according to base stations or carriers. That is, a state occurs in which bandwidths being used are different according to systems (cells in a system of a same carrier under certain circumstances) provided by each carrier. In such a state, it is necessary that every mobile terminal can connect to any base stations having different bandwidths.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition, a maximum transmission and reception bandwidth that the mobile terminal can support at a minimum is an important problem since it has an influence not only on implementation and configuration of the terminal but also on configuration of a physical channel corresponding to a synchronization channel (SCH) or a broadcast channel (BCH).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, it becomes important to set transmission bandwidths of a collision permissible channel used when initially accessing any base stations, from the mobile terminal, that use different bandwidths, and a pilot channel and a data channel that are transmitted from the mobile terminal to any base station.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0073">Before describing the preferred embodiments, an overview of the radio communication system on which the present invention is based is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The present invention is predicated on a system in which a plurality of bandwidths are defined in a same system. Therefore, transmission bandwidths of the downlink and reception bandwidths of the uplink are different according to base stations (or carriers). Every mobile terminal should connect to any of base stations having different bandwidths while moving.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0074">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the radio communication system includes base stations <b>1</b>-<b>5</b> using different transmission bandwidths that are 20 MHz, 10 MHz, 5 MHz, 2.5 MHz and 1.25 MHz, for example. The transmission frequency bandwidth used by each base station is determined based on a frequency spectrum that each carrier can use. Assuming that there are a plurality of bandwidths in such a same system, in order to connect the mobile terminal <b>10</b> to any base station, following items should be considered:</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0075">(1) Transmission of a common channel from a base station to a mobile station in the downlink, and setting of a maximum bandwidth of a mobile terminal <b>10</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0076">(2) Transmission of a pilot channel and a data channel in the uplink, and scheduling for them; and</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0077">(3) Transmission of collision permissible type channel in the uplink. In the following, each of them are described.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0078">&#x3c;Transmission of Common Channel and Setting of Maximum Bandwidth of the Mobile Terminal in the Downlink&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0079">In the downlink of the radio communication system that supports a plurality of transmission bandwidths, following two methods can be considered as methods for setting bandwidths such that the mobile terminal <b>10</b> can receive the common (physical) channel from any base station. That are methods of:</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0080">(i) Preparing mobile terminals <b>10</b> of all kinds that correspond to all of the bandwidths supported by the system, and transmitting the downlink common (physical) channel using a minimum bandwidth in the plurality of bandwidths supported by the system, or</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0081">(ii) Setting a maximum bandwidth that every mobile terminal <b>10</b> should support as a minimum value, and transmitting the downlink common (physical) channel using equal to or more than two bandwidths that are equal to or less than the bandwidth of the minimum value.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0082">In the first method, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, when the radio communication system supports five kinds of bandwidths, five kinds of mobile terminals <b>10</b> that are a mobile terminal supporting 1.25 MHz, a mobile terminal supporting 2.5 MHz, a mobile terminal supporting 5 MHz, a mobile terminal supporting 10 MHz, and a mobile terminal supporting 20 MHz are prepared, and they are accommodated in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0083">In this case, since there is a mobile terminal <b>10</b> that can receive only a signal of the signal bandwidth of 1.25 MHz, every base station transmits a physical channel corresponding to a common channel such as the synchronization channel (SCH) and the broadcast channel (BCH) using a bandwidth of 1.25 MHz that is the smallest bandwidth in the system irrespective of a bandwidth of the system used in the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0084">In the second method, every mobile terminal has at least a given maximum bandwidth. For example, every mobile terminal <b>10</b> is designed to have a bandwidth of 5 MHz at least, or a bandwidth of 10 MHz at least.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0085">According to this method, since every mobile terminal <b>10</b> that is accommodated in the system can support a maximum bandwidth that is equal to or greater than a given value, it is only necessary that the base station transmits the common channel using a bandwidth equal to or less than the given maximum bandwidth in a plurality of bandwidths defined in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram for explaining the first method (i) for setting the downlink signal bandwidth in more detail. As shown in the left side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the radio communication system supports five different kinds of system bandwidths depending on cells and accommodates mobile terminals <b>10</b> of kinds that correspond to all bandwidths. In this case, as shown in the right side of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the transmission bandwidth of the common channel (SCH, BCH, and the like) in each cell is 1.25 MHz in accordance with the smallest bandwidth in the system irrespective of system bandwidth that the cell can use.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0087">According to this scheme, every kind of mobile terminal <b>10</b> can receive a common channel from a base station even though the mobile terminal <b>10</b> moves to any cell.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0088">In addition, since every base station transmits the synchronization channel or the broadcast channel using the same minimum signal bandwidth, methods of demodulation and decoding of the common channel in the mobile terminal <b>10</b> becomes simple and unified. In addition, since terminals of the existing W-CDMA scheme and UMTS (W-CDMA)/GMS dual mode terminals have a 5 MHz downlink physical channel receiving capability, there is an advantage of commonality between the existing systems and the new system so that it can be considered that dual mode of both systems can be easily realized.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are diagrams for describing the second method (ii) for setting the downlink signal bandwidth in more detail. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the maximum bandwidth that every mobile terminal <b>10</b> should support at the minimum is set to be 5 MHz, and in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, it is set to be 10 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0090">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the left side indicates five kinds of bandwidths that the system supports, and the right side indicates signal bandwidths used for each base station to transmit the common channel when every mobile terminal <b>10</b> has the maximum bandwidth of 5 MHz at the minimum. A base station (carrier) that uses a bandwidth of 1.25 MHz transmits the common channel using the bandwidth. A base station that uses a bandwidth of 2.5 MHz transmits the common channel using 2.5 MHz or 1.25 MHz. Since the mobile terminal <b>10</b> supports a bandwidth of 5 MHz at the minimum, the mobile terminal <b>10</b> can receive the common channel from the base station in either case.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0091">Base stations using bandwidths of 5 MHz, 10 MHz and 20 MHz transmit the common channel using 5 MHz in accordance with the maximum bandwidth of the minimum value kept in every mobile terminal <b>10</b>. Since the common channel is transmitted using the bandwidth of 5 MHz, high diversity effect can be obtained. Therefore, reception quality when the mobile terminal <b>10</b> receives the channel. In addition, dual mode with the existing W-CDMA can be easily realized.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0092">In the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, since the downlink common channel is transmitted using 5 MHz or 1.25 MHz (or 2.5 MHz) according to the base station, it is necessary to set more than one kind of format of the common channel in the radio communication system. In addition, it is necessary to detect and identify the bandwidth of the common channel before demodulating and decoding SCH or BCH in the mobile terminal <b>10</b>. As a method for realizing this, there is a method in which the base station reports information on the bandwidth used for transmitting the common channel such as SCH and BCH to the mobile terminal <b>10</b> beforehand by separately preparing a control channel of 1.25 MHz, for example. Alternatively, a configuration may be adopted in which when information of a band of 1.25 MHz in SCH or BCH is decoded and when it is recognized that there is SCH or BCH of 5 MHz band based on the decoded information, information of the band of 5 MHz is decoded again. Alternatively, a configuration may be adopted in which the mobile terminal <b>10</b> estimates the parameter (bandwidth) using a blind method.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0093">As to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, since every mobile terminal <b>10</b> supports the maximum reception bandwidth of 10 MHz at the minimum, a base station using a 5 MHz bandwidth transmits the common channel using 5 MHz, and a base station using a bandwidth of 10 MHz or 20 MHz transmits the common channel using 10 MHz that is the reception bandwidth of the minimum value of the mobile terminal <b>10</b>. Also in this case, the mobile terminal <b>10</b> has a function of identifying the bandwidth of the common channel. That is, in the same way as the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, the bandwidth of the downlink common channel is identified by reporting bandwidth information using a control channel of the lowest bandwidth (1.25 MHz, for example) supported by the system or by estimating bandwidth using the blind method.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0094">According to the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, since every mobile terminal <b>10</b> has the maximum reception bandwidth equal to or greater than a given level, kinds and performance of mobile terminals <b>10</b> can be unified. In addition, improvement of reception quality due to diversity effect can be expected.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0095">By the way, in the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, although SCH and BCH are transmitted using a same bandwidth, it is not necessary to use the same bandwidth. For example, a base station having a bandwidth of 2.5 MHz may transmit BCH using 2.5 MHz and transmit SCH using 1.25 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0096">&#x3c;Transmission Bandwidth and Transmission Schedule in Uplink&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0097">Next, transmission bandwidths of a pilot channel and a data channel in the uplink, and the scheduling are described. As methods for setting bandwidths for transmitting a pilot channel and a data channel to any base station by the mobile terminal <b>10</b> in the uplink of the radio communication system, there are the following two methods like the case of the downlink common channel. That is:</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0098">(i) Preparing mobile terminals <b>10</b> of kinds corresponding to all bandwidths supported by the system; or</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0099">(ii) Setting a maximum bandwidth that every mobile terminal <b>10</b> should support as a minimum value.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a method for setting transmission bandwidth of the uplink when the first method is adopted, that is, when mobile terminals <b>10</b> of kinds corresponding to all bandwidths are accommodated. The left side shows five kinds of bandwidths supported by the radio communication system. The center section shows maximum bandwidths, for transmitting a data channel from the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, that can be processed in the corresponding cell. The right side shows transmission bandwidths of a pilot channel from the mobile terminal <b>10</b> that can be processed in the corresponding cell.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0101">Since all kinds of mobile terminals <b>10</b> corresponding to a plurality of kinds of maximum transmission bandwidths from 1.25 MHz to 20 MHz are accommodated in the uplink, each mobile terminal <b>10</b> transmits, to any base station, within a range of a bandwidth supported by the own mobile terminal, a pilot signal and a data signal according to a system bandwidth supported by the base station. For example, in a cell using a bandwidth of 2.5 MHz, a mobile terminal <b>10</b> supporting a bandwidth of 5 MHz transmits the pilot signal or the data signal using 2.5 MHz of the 5 MHz. When the mobile terminal <b>10</b> moves to a cell using a bandwidth equal to or greater than 5 MHz, the mobile terminal <b>10</b> transmits the pilot signal or the data signal using a bandwidth of 5 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0102">By the way, it is desirable that the mobile terminal <b>10</b> that supports a bandwidth equal to or greater than 2.5 MHz transmits a pilot channel using a bandwidth greater than that used for a data channel. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the pilot channel is transmitted using 2.5 MHz, and the data channel is transmitted using 1.25 MHz.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0103">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the pilot channel is transmitted using 5 MHz, and the data channel is transmitted using 2.5 MHz. By adopting such a configuration, the base station side can perform scheduling according to a channel state (SIR and the like) on the frequency axis using the received pilot channel. Details of the scheduling using the pilot channel are described later.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-5C</figref> show a method for setting the uplink transmission bandwidth when the second method is adopted, that is, when a maximum transmission bandwidth as minimum value is set for every mobile terminal <b>10</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, although every mobile terminal <b>10</b> supports 5 MHz at the minimum for transmitting the pilot channel, maximum transmission bandwidths for the data channel (and control channel) are set in accordance with all kinds of bandwidths. On the other hand, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, every mobile terminal <b>10</b> supports a transmission bandwidth of 5 MHz at the minimum for both of the pilot channel and the data channel. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, every mobile terminal <b>10</b> supports a transmission bandwidth of 10 MHz at the minimum for both of the pilot channel and the data channel.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0105">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, as to transmission of a data channel, mobile terminals <b>10</b> of kinds corresponding to all bandwidths supported by the system are prepared. But, as to transmission of pilot channel, the maximum bandwidth of at least 5 MHz is kept for every mobile terminal <b>10</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, in a cell that supports a bandwidth equal to or greater than 5 MHz, the mobile terminal <b>10</b> transmits a pilot channel using 5 MHz, and transmits a data channel using a bandwidth of 2.5 MHz according to scheduling from the base station. In a cell supporting 2.5 MHz, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a pilot channel is transmitted using 2.5 MHz of the 5 MHz, and a data channel is transmitted using a bandwidth of 1.25 MHz according to scheduling of the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref> are diagrams for describing scheduling using the pilot channel. It is assumed that every mobile terminal <b>10</b> can use a maximum transmission bandwidth of 5 MHz at the minimum for transmitting the pilot channel. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, each of mobile terminals of users <b>1</b>-<b>4</b> transmits a pilot channel using a bandwidth of 5 MHz in a cell (step <b>1</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0107">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, when the base station receives pilot signals from the users <b>1</b>-<b>4</b>, the base station measures channel states of the mobile terminals <b>10</b> of each user on the frequency axis (step <b>2</b>). For example, the pilot channel from the mobile terminal of the user <b>1</b> indicates a good channel state in the first half part of the 5 MHz bandwidth. The pilot channel of the user <b>2</b> indicates the peak in a side a little lower than the center of the 5 MHz bandwidth. The pilot channel of the user <b>3</b> indicates a good channel state in the latter half part of the 5 MHz bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0108">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, based on the measured channel states, the base station assigns data channels of bandwidths each narrower than the pilot channel on the frequency axis to the users <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the base station assigns first 1.25 MHz of the 5 MHz bandwidth to the user <b>1</b>, assigns next 1.25 MHz to the user <b>2</b>, and assigns the latter half 2.5 MHz to the user <b>3</b>. At this time, there is no assignment for user <b>4</b>. The bandwidth to be assigned for transmission of the data channel for each user can be determined based on information (capability) of a maximum transmission bandwidth of terminal transmitted from the mobile terminal. The mobile terminal of each user transmits the data channel using a band narrower than that of the pilot channel based on an assignment instruction from the base station (step <b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0109">Accordingly, even though a mobile terminal has low capability for transmitting the data channel, a predetermined maximum transmission bandwidth (5 MHz, for example) is kept for every mobile terminal <b>10</b> as to transmission of the pilot channel, and the bandwidth for transmitting the data channel is set to be smaller than that so that efficient scheduling according to channel states becomes possible. As a result, throughput of the system improves.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0110">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, in this example, every mobile terminal <b>10</b> has a maximum transmission bandwidth of 5 MHz at least for both of the pilot channel and the data channel. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, every mobile terminal <b>10</b> has a maximum transmission bandwidth of 10 MHz at least for both of the pilot channel and the data channel. In either case, like the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the base station can perform transmission scheduling of the data channels in bands each narrower than that of the pilot channel based on received pilot channels, so that throughput of the system can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a block diagram showing a transmitter <b>10</b><i>a </i>of the mobile terminal <b>10</b>. A baseband unit of the transmitter <b>10</b><i>a </i>includes, as a data channel processing system, a channel coding unit <b>21</b> for coding transmission data that is input, a data modulation unit <b>22</b> and a band limit filter <b>23</b>, and includes, as a pilot channel processing system, a pilot signal generation unit <b>24</b> and a band limit filter <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0112">When uplink scheduling is performed in the base station like the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>, the mobile terminal <b>10</b> transmits a pilot channel and a data channel of different bandwidths. In this case, a pilot channel/data channel transmission bandwidth control unit <b>31</b> controls the transmission bandwidths of the pilot channel and the data channel within a range of the maximum reception bandwidth of the base station that is reported by a downlink control channel. As methods for control, there are a method of setting transmission bandwidth of the data channel based on the transmission bandwidth specified by the scheduling from the base station using the method shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A-7C</figref>, and a method of setting transmission bandwidths of the pilot channel and the data channel selected by the control unit <b>31</b> itself.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0113">Each of a pilot channel signal and a data channel signal on which baseband processing has been performed is received by a D/A converter <b>26</b> of the IF unit so as to pass through an IF filter <b>27</b>. When transmission bandwidths of the pilot and the data are different, the bandwidth of the IF filter <b>27</b> is adjusted to the transmission bandwidth of the pilot. Output of the IF filter <b>27</b> is received by an up converter <b>28</b> of the RF unit so as to be converted to a RF frequency according to an uplink transmission frequency band that is set. By the way, a part of this function may be performed by the baseband unit. The RF-converted signal passes through the RF filter <b>29</b>. When transmission bandwidths of the pilot and the data are different, the bandwidth of the RF filter <b>27</b> is adjusted to the transmission bandwidth of the pilot. Output of the RF filter <b>27</b> is amplified by a power amplifier <b>30</b>. Since transmission power of the data channel is larger than that of the pilot channel, the size of the power amplifier is determined according to the transmission bandwidth of the data channel. The amplified transmission signal is transmitted from the transmission antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a block diagram of a receiver <b>10</b><i>b </i>of the mobile terminal <b>10</b>. A RF signal received by the antenna passes through a low noise amplifier (LNA) <b>41</b> and a RF filter <b>42</b>, and is converted into an intermediate frequency by a down converter <b>43</b> in the RF unit. Next, in the IF unit, the signal passes through an IF filter <b>44</b> and is converted into an analog signal by a D/A converter <b>45</b>. In the baseband unit, the signal is filtered, demodulated and decoded by a band limit filter <b>46</b>, a data demodulation unit <b>47</b> and a channel decoding unit <b>48</b>. When the maximum reception bandwidth of 5 MHz is kept in every mobile terminal <b>10</b> at the minimum, dual mode operation with the existing W-CDMA is easy for the RF filter <b>42</b> and the IF filter <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0115">In addition, when a maximum reception bandwidth equal to or greater than a given value is kept for the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, since a bandwidth of the common channel received from a base station is different according to a bandwidth used in the cell, it is necessary to perform filtering, demodulation and decoding processes in accordance with the bandwidth. A reception bandwidth control unit <b>50</b> supplies a control signal for performing settings according to the reception bandwidth to the band limit filter <b>46</b>, the data demodulation unit <b>47</b> and the channel decoding unit <b>48</b>. The reception bandwidth control unit <b>50</b> performs control based on bandwidth information reported by a downlink control channel, for example. Alternatively, although not shown in the diagram, a parameter estimation unit may be provided to estimate the bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a block diagram showing a configuration example of a base station used in a radio communication system that supports a plurality of bandwidth. The base station <b>60</b> includes a pilot signal reception unit <b>61</b> for receiving a pilot signal of a first bandwidth from the mobile terminal <b>10</b>, a channel measurement unit <b>62</b> for measuring a channel state of each mobile terminal on the frequency axis based on the received pilot channel, and a data channel transmission bandwidth assignment unit <b>63</b> for assigning a transmission band of a data channel using a second bandwidth that is narrower than the first bandwidth to each of mobile terminals based on the measurement result.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0117">This configuration of the base station is useful when a configuration is adopted in which every mobile terminal has a maximum transmission bandwidth equal to or greater than a given value. This is because uplink scheduling can be performed based on the pilot channel as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0118">&#x3c;Setting of Collision Permissible Channel in the Uplink&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0119"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref> are diagrams for describing a transmission method of an uplink collision permissible channel when the mobile terminal <b>10</b> accesses a base station initially in a radio communication system supporting a plurality of bandwidths. When the mobile terminal initially accesses the base station, the mobile terminal transmits a collision permissible channel such as a reservation channel and a random access channel based on the premise of the possibility of collision. When the radio communication system supports a plurality of bandwidth, it is necessary to consider the transmission method of the collision permissible channel since bandwidths used by base stations and capabilities of mobile terminals are different.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0120"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> shows a method for setting a minimum bandwidth (1.25 MHz, for example) supported by the radio communication system to be a bandwidth of the collision permissible channel. Since the bandwidth of the collision permissible channel is uniformly determined, every base station receives the collision permissible channel using a same method, so that system design becomes easy. This method may be applied to a case for accommodating mobile terminals of kinds supporting all bandwidths supported by the system, and also applied to a case for setting a maximum transmission bandwidth equal to or greater than a minimum value for every mobile terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0121">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the base station can use a bandwidth of 20 MHz. When accessing the base station initially, every mobile terminal (A, B, C) transmits the collision permissible channel using 1.25 MHz that is the minimum bandwidth of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0122">As a method for transmitting the collision permissible channel, there are methods of:</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0123">(1) Specifying, to the mobile terminal, using a control channel and the like, a band by which transmission of the collision permissible channel is allowed in the whole bandwidth used by the base station;</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0124">(2) In the base station, determining beforehand a band, in the whole bandwidth, by which transmission of the collision permissible channel is allowed;</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0125">(3) In the mobile terminal side, randomly determining a band for transmitting the collision permissible channel within a range of the bandwidth used by the base station which the mobile station tries to access.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0126">In the first method, the base station assigns bandwidths, that are unoccupied as a result of scheduling, for example, to the terminals A, B and C as transmission bandwidths of the collision permissible channel.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0127">In the second method, a reception permissible bandwidth of the uplink collision channel is determined beforehand as shown in the arrows of both directions so that reception is performed within the band. In this case, a configuration may be adopted in which the reception permissible bandwidth of the uplink collision permissible channel is shifted to another band on the frequency axis every predetermined time within a range of the whole bandwidth used by the base station. Accordingly, while the collision permissible channel is received within a range of a given narrow band, wide band effect can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0128">In the third method, the mobile terminal randomly determines the transmission band of the uplink collision permissible channel.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0129">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the mobile terminal A-C transmits the uplink collision permissible channel within a range of a predetermined bandwidth greater than the minimum bandwidth of the system, for example, within a range of the bandwidth of 5 MHz. Also in this case, any one of the methods of (1) transmitting using a band specified from the base station, (2) transmitting within a range of a reception permissible bandwidth determined by the base station beforehand, and (3) determining randomly by the mobile terminal can be used. By the way, in the examples shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, although the bandwidth assigned to the uplink collision permissible type channel is set to be small compared with the bandwidth of the system, the whole bandwidth of the system may be assigned as the band of the uplink collision permissible type channel depending on circumstances. Further, the bandwidth assigned to the collision permissible type channel is determined depending on a size of the system bandwidth, a number of mobile terminals accessing using the uplink, and a size of information amount necessary for the collision permissible type channel. In addition, when the bandwidth assigned for the uplink collision permissible type channel is greater than a band used for actually transmitting the collision permissible type channel, the mobile terminal performing accesses using the collision permissible type channel can perform transmission by temporally changing the frequency of the collision permissible type channel to be transmitted. In this case, improvement of communication quality can be realized due to frequency diversity effect.</p>
