<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Wireless communications have become increasingly prominent for sending and receiving information. For example, individuals may utilize a wireless communication device for voice communications, research, entertainment, or for conducting critical business transactions. To support these services, a wireless communication network may perform communications via forward-link communication channels and reverse-link communication channels. Forward-link communication channels typically carry communications from a wireless access network to wireless communication devices, while the reverse-link communication channels transfer communications from the wireless communication devices to the network. The forward-link channels may include data and control channels. The control channels may include pilot channels, sync channels, and paging channels. The data channels may include forward traffic channels.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Typically, the paging channels are used by the wireless access network to notify wireless communication devices when a request to communicate has been received. The paging channels are also used to transmit overhead messages and paging messages. A paging message is a short data message sent over the control channel to communicate information to a wireless communication device. Common pages include incoming call alerts, voice mail indicators, text messages, location requests, and data session requests. Conversely, overhead messages are not addressed to any specific wireless communication device. Instead, the overhead messages are intended for distribution to each mobile unit within a coverage area.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The overhead messages are typically received and processed by a wireless communication device when the wireless communication device is in an &#x201c;idle state,&#x201d; (i.e., the device is not engaged in a call or attempting to engage in a call). While in the idle state, a wireless communication device periodically wakes up and listens to the paging channel in order to receive the overhead messages. Because the overhead messages often remain the same for substantial periods of time, a version number may be transmitted along with the overhead message allowing the wireless communication device to wake up, receive the version number, and stay awake to decode the overhead message only if the overhead message has changed.</p>
<p id="h-0002" num="0000">Overview</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A communication transceiver transmits an overhead message including a version number associated with a first version of the overhead message. A processing system determines control channel occupancy and reverse noise generated by a plurality of wireless communication devices, compares the control channel occupancy to an occupancy threshold and the reverse noise to a reverse noise threshold, and updates the version number resulting in an updated version number if a criteria is met. The criteria is met if the control channel occupancy fails to exceed the occupancy threshold and the reverse noise exceeds the reverse noise threshold. The communication transceiver then transmits the overhead message including the updated version number if the criteria is met.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The following description and associated drawings teach the best mode of the invention. For the purpose of teaching inventive principles, some conventional aspects of the best mode may be simplified or omitted. The following claims specify the scope of the invention. Some aspects of the best mode may not fall within the scope of the invention as specified by the claims. Thus, those skilled in the art will appreciate variations from the best mode that fall within the scope of the invention. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the features described below can be combined in various ways to form multiple variations of the invention. As a result, the invention is not limited to the specific examples described below, but only by the claims and their equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates wireless communication system <b>100</b>. Wireless communication system <b>100</b> comprises wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>, transceiver <b>105</b>, wireless control system <b>110</b>, and communication network <b>120</b>. Transceiver <b>105</b> and wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> are in communication over wireless links <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>, respectively. Transceiver <b>105</b> and wireless control system <b>110</b> are in communication over communication link <b>106</b>. Wireless control system <b>110</b> and control system <b>120</b> are in communication over communication link <b>107</b>. In this example, two wireless communication devices are shown for simplicity. More or fewer wireless communication devices may be included in wireless communication system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In operation, wireless control system <b>110</b> transmits an overhead message to transceiver <b>105</b>, which in turn, transmits the overhead message to wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>. The overhead message includes a version number that indicates the current version of the overhead message. Upon reception of the overhead message, wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> compare the version number with the last version number received to determine if the version is different from a previously received version number. If the version is different, wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> replace existing internal communication data (i.e., communication data contained in the previously received overhead message) with the communication data contained in the received overhead message (i.e., communication data contained in the current overhead message). However, if the version is the same as the previously received version number, wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> ignore the communication data contained in the received overhead message.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Wireless control system <b>110</b> determines control channel occupancy and reverse noise generated by wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>, and compares the reverse noise to a noise threshold and the control channel occupancy to an occupancy threshold. If the reverse noise exceeds the reverse noise threshold and the control channel occupancy fails to exceed the occupancy threshold then wireless control system <b>110</b> updates the version number and transmits the updated overhead message to wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Once received, wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> compare the updated version number to the existing version number. In this case, the updated version number is not equivalent to the existing version number, and thus wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> replace their existing internal communication data with communication data contained in the overhead message.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the operation of wireless control system <b>110</b> in wireless communication system <b>100</b>. Wireless control system <b>110</b> transmits an overhead message including a version number associated with a first version of the overhead message (<b>202</b>). The overhead message may be transmitted over a paging channel and contain information that enables wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and/or <b>112</b> to communicate with wireless control system <b>110</b>. In some examples, the overhead messages may comprise system parameters, access parameters, channel lists, and/or neighbor lists. For example, the overhead message may comprise access parameters messages (APM) and/or a sector parameters messages (SPM).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Wireless control system <b>110</b> determines the control channel occupancy and reverse noise generated by wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> (<b>204</b>). The control channel occupancy may indicate a loading metric or an amount of utilization of the control channel. The reverse noise may indicate noise generated by any number of wireless communication devices. In some examples, the reverse noise comprises noise generated by wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b>. In other examples, the reverse noise may comprise noise generated by wireless communication devices <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> and noise generated by other wireless communication devices (not shown) located both in and out of the sector or coverage area.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Wireless control system <b>110</b> then compares the control channel occupancy to an occupancy threshold and the reverse noise to a noise threshold (<b>206</b>). In some examples, the loading metric or amount of utilization of the control channel may be compared to an occupancy threshold value, in which case the amount of utilization could be measured in or converted to compatible units with the applicable occupancy threshold. Likewise, the reverse noise may be compared to a reverse noise threshold value resulting in the reverse noise being measured in or converted to compatible units with the reverse noise threshold. Wireless control system <b>110</b> then updates the version number if a criteria is met, wherein the criteria is met if the control channel occupancy fails to exceed the occupancy threshold and the reverse noise exceeds the reverse noise threshold (<b>208</b>). Wireless control system <b>110</b> then transmits the overhead message including the updated version number if the criteria is met (<b>210</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the operation of wireless communication device <b>111</b> in wireless communication system <b>100</b>. The following description could also describe operation of wireless communication device <b>112</b>. To begin, wireless communication device <b>111</b> receives an overhead message including a version number (<b>302</b>). The overhead message may be received over a paging channel and contain information that enable wireless communication device <b>111</b> to communicate with wireless control system <b>110</b>. As discussed above, the overhead message may comprise messages including an APM and/or an SPM.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Wireless communication device <b>111</b> compares the received version number to an existing version number associated with existing communication data (<b>304</b>). In this example, the existing version number may be a previously received version number stored in memory by wireless communication device <b>111</b> which is associated with existing communication data from a previously received overhead message.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">If the version numbers are equivalent then wireless communication device <b>111</b> does not replace its existing communication data with the communication data contained within the currently received overhead message (<b>306</b>). Conversely, if the version numbers are not equivalent, wireless communication device <b>111</b> replaces the existing communication data with the communication data contained in the currently received overhead message (<b>308</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates wireless communication system <b>400</b>. In this example, wireless communication system <b>400</b> comprises wireless communication devices WCD<b>1</b>-WCD<b>7</b>, base stations BTS <b>410</b> and BTS <b>420</b>, a mobile switching center (MSC) <b>420</b>, and a communication network <b>450</b>. Each wireless communication device is shown with a link to a base station. In this example, the links comprise forward communications links.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The forward communication links may include one or more data channels, a pilot channel, and one or more paging channels, all of which are transmitted from each of the base stations to the wireless communication devices. The pilot channel or pilot signal may serve to define the boundaries of the cell or sector area served by a base station. Moreover, in some instances the pilot signal may also provide for time reference and for amplitude and phase tracking and allows wireless communication devices to identify and become synchronized with the various base stations that are within range of their communication capability. In this example, a single sector boundary crossing is shown for simplicity.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">As shown, BTS <b>410</b> includes a transceiver configured to communicate a first overhead message M<b>1</b> for delivery to wireless communication devices located within a first sector or coverage area (i.e., the coverage area of BTS <b>410</b>). Overhead message M<b>1</b> may be transmitted over a paging channel and contain information that enables wireless communication devices within the first sector to communicate with BTS <b>410</b>, and thereby with the communication network.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Overhead messages M<b>1</b> and M<b>2</b> include version numbers associated with the current version of the transmitted overhead message. In some examples, the version number may comprise one or more signatures in signature fields. Each signature field may include a modulo count. For example, a modulo count may be included for the version number or signature of the APM. Likewise, a second modulo count may be included for the version number or signature of the SPM. The modulo count is typically increased or updated each time that the value of the APM or SPM changes. Wireless communication devices periodically read the signature fields to see if the APM and SPM messages have been updated.</p>

In this example, each forward communication link comprises a periodic cycle of a data stream transmitted from the base station to the wireless communication devices within range. The forward communication link includes a paging channel and a forward traffic (or data) channel. The paging channel includes a version number capsule and an overhead message capsule. The version number capsule contains at least one version number. In this example, a single version number representing a group of overhead messages (i.e., APM and SPM) is shown. However, multiple version numbers may be included in each capsule. If multiple version numbers are included in each capsule, each version number may represent one or more overhead messages.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The overhead message capsule includes at least one overhead message. As previously discussed, the overhead messages are not addressed to any specific wireless communication device but are intended for distribution to each wireless communication device within the corresponding sector or coverage area. Possible overhead messages include, but are not limited to, system parameters, access parameters, channel lists, and neighbor lists. Other overhead message may include any type of parameters used to establish and maintain communication between a wireless communication device and a base station or wireless access point.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Overhead messages are received and processed by wireless communication devices within range of the base station. Typically, the wireless communication device is in an &#x201c;idle state&#x201d; or low power state when not in use. During the idle state, the wireless communication device periodically wakes up and listens to the paging channel and processes messages on that paging channel. The base station transmits the overhead message including the version number allowing the wireless communication device to process the version number and go back into the &#x201c;idle state&#x201d; without replacing the existing communication data such as, for example, the existing APM and/or the existing SPM.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, which illustrates forward communication link <b>510</b> according to one example of operation.

<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Typically, whenever the APM or the SPM changes, the version number modulo count will be updated or incremented by the base station and then transmitted during the following paging channel cycle. The updated version number modulo count is then received by the wireless communication device when it wakes up from the &#x201c;idle state.&#x201d; The wireless communication device processes the received version number and recognizes that the version number modulo count is updated. Accordingly, the wireless communication device replaces the existing APM and SPM with the received APM and SPM associated with the updated version number.</p>

In this example, the version number is updated or incremented regardless of whether the overhead message changed in order to prevent the scenario discussed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The version number may be updated or incremented in any number of ways. For example, base station BTS <b>410</b> may update or increment the version number based on a distribution of wireless communication devices. In this case, BTS <b>410</b> determines the control channel occupancy and reverse noise generated by wireless communication devices.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The control channel occupancy may indicate a loading metric or an amount of utilization of the control channel. The reverse noise may indicate noise generated by any number of wireless communication devices. In some examples, the reverse noise comprises noise generated by wireless communication devices located within communication range of BTS <b>410</b>. The communication devices may be within the sector or coverage area. Alternatively, the reverse noise may comprise noise generated by wireless communication devices both within and outside of the sector or coverage area.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">BTS <b>410</b> may then compare the control channel occupancy to an occupancy threshold and the reverse noise to a noise threshold. In some examples, the loading metric or amount of utilization of the control channel may be compared to an occupancy threshold value, in which case the amount of utilization could be measured in or converted to compatible units with the applicable occupancy threshold. Likewise, the reverse noise may be compared to a reverse noise threshold value resulting in the reverse noise being measured in or converted to compatible units with the reverse noise threshold. BTS <b>410</b> then updates the version number if the control channel occupancy fails to exceed the occupancy threshold and the reverse noise exceeds the reverse noise threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The version number may also be updated or incremented by a wireless communication device. For example, the wireless communication device may disable version number verification if the wireless communication device experiences an idle handoff. The idle handoff condition occurs when the wireless communication device moves from a first sector to a second sector while in an &#x201c;idle state.&#x201d; The wireless communication device may include a verification disable module that monitors for an idle handoff condition and ensures that the wireless communication device receive the next overhead message and update existing overhead information with the overhead information contained in the next overhead message.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The verification disable module may disable version verification or ensure that the next overhead message is received in any number of ways. For example, the wireless communication device may simply disable version number verification so that the wireless communication device does not check the version number of the next one or more overhead messages, and thus stays awake to receive the overhead messages regardless of the version number. Alternatively, the wireless communication device may modify or alter one or more bits of the existing version number in the wireless communication device. In this case, the altered version number will likely not be equivalent to the received version number, and thus the wireless communication device will stay awake to receive the overhead message and replace existing communication data with communication data contained within the received overhead message.</p>
