<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention refers to a dimensional inspection method of fabricated composite parts and, more particularly, to a dimensional inspection method of large composite parts such as a wing cover of an aircraft. The invention also refers to a workstation to carry out said dimensional inspection method.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Dimensional inspection techniques shall be used in the fabrication process of, particularly, large composite parts, i.e. parts made out with composite materials consisting of fibers or fiber bundles embedded in a matrix of thermosetting or thermoplastic resin, such as aircraft wing covers, to assure that the dimensional and geometrical features of the fabricated part do not deviate from its nominal values by more than a predetermined amount.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Since the acceptability and reliability of a composite part can be affected if said features do not conform to design objectives, it is necessary to perform a detailed dimensional inspection in the final stage of the fabrication process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the prior art, the dimensional inspection of a large composite part is usually done in the curing tool using a manual laser interferometer and assuming that the curing tool surface is the nominal or theoretical composite part outer surface, i.e. the aerodynamic surface in the case of aircraft wing covers. In this respect, vacuum is used to push the composite part inner surface to the curing tool surface in order to overcome the deformations that may appear after the curing cycle. Deviations are calculated by comparing directly the distance from a number of selected points in the inner surface to the curing tool surface with the corresponding nominal distance.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the assumption that the curing tool surface can be used as the nominal outer surface of the composite part, as it has been seen in several tests, is erroneous: the curing tool may not follow exactly the nominal outer surface due to machining deviations and/or to level problems and the vacuum power may not be enough to overcome the stiffness of the part. Consequently the dimensional inspection results are not as accurate as is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention focuses on finding a solution for these drawbacks.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The detailed description of the present invention will refer to the dimensional inspection of an aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> made out with composite materials.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The basic idea of the present invention is performing the dimensional inspection of the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> out of the curing tool used in the final stage of its fabrication process, having the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> in a vertical position so as to be able to scan its inner and outer surfaces, and comparing the dimensional inspection results with the expected results in an efficient and accurate manner.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The key steps of the dimensional inspection method according to the present invention are the following:</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Providing a scanning plan of the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b>, i.e. a number of points I<sub>ij </sub>in its inner surface and a number of points O<sub>ij </sub>in its outer surface where positional data shall be obtained. The distribution of said points I<sub>ij</sub>, O<sub>ij </sub>shall be made in accordance to the objectives of the inspection. The geometrical parameters to be inspected would typically include at least the skin thickness and the stringer web and foot height in the aircraft wing cover sections were the ribs or other structural elements will be attached and, as well, the skin thickness in other relevant locations. Consequently, as seen in the partial view of a transversal section R<sub>i </sub>of the wing cover <b>9</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> corresponding to a preferred embodiment, said distribution will include points such as the points O<sub>i1</sub>, O<sub>i2</sub>, O<sub>i3</sub>, O<sub>i4 </sub>in is outer surface and the points I<sub>i1</sub>, I<sub>i2</sub>, I<sub>i3</sub>, I<sub>i4 </sub>in its inner surface that allow to measure the thickness of the skin <b>5</b> and the heights of the web and the foot of the stringer <b>7</b>. In the case of an aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> of an span of, for instance 33 m, the number of points I<sub>ij</sub>, O<sub>ij </sub>to be scanned in both sides may amount to 8000. The sub-index i is then used for indicating the number of a transversal section of the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> with respect to axis H in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and the sub-index j is used for numbering the points within said transversal section. It is therefore a reference system adapted to said preferred embodiment but as the skilled man will readily understand any other suitable reference system can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Obtaining the positional data of said points I<sub>ij</sub>, O<sub>ij </sub>in the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> hold in a vertical position in a dimensional inspection workstation <b>11</b> as a first set of positional data WI<sub>ij</sub>, WO<sub>ij </sub>(for instance x, y, z coordinates of said points I<sub>ij</sub>, O<sub>ij</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Obtaining the positional data of said points I<sub>ij</sub>, O<sub>ij </sub>from an analytical model defining the theoretical geometry of the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> as a second set of positional data TI<sub>ij</sub>, TO<sub>ij </sub>(using the same coordinate system than for WI<sub>ij</sub>, WO<sub>ij</sub>) and comparing both sets of data WI<sub>ij</sub>, WO<sub>ij</sub>; TI<sub>ij</sub>, TO<sub>ij </sub>to obtain the deviations between the fabricated aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> and its theoretical geometry taking into account that the first set of data WI<sub>ij</sub>, WO<sub>ij </sub>is obtained in a workstation <b>11</b> that causes deformations in the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> because it can only grab the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> in a few sections to give access to the scanning tools all along inner and outer surfaces of the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">We will now proceed to a description of a preferred embodiment of the method and the workstation according to the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Following <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> it can be seen that the workstation <b>11</b> includes, on one side, a number of arms <b>15</b> for holding the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> in a vertical position and, on the other side, robots <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> (for instance KUKA Robots KR210L100-2K) that are installed in linear guides <b>25</b>, <b>27</b> with probes <b>29</b> such as laser interferometers (for instance a Leica Absolute Tracker AT-901 LR) for collecting positional data of points located, respectively, in the inner and outer surface of the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b>. Said robots <b>21</b>, <b>23</b> may translate horizontally as indicated by arrows H and its probes <b>29</b> can scan points in the aircraft wing cover inner and outer surfaces following vertical paths as indicated by arrows V.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The displacement of said robots probes <b>29</b> as they follow the inner and outer surfaces of the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> is detected using suitable means and its output is transmitted to a computer system (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) through a suitable communication link. Data indicating a relative position of probes <b>29</b> along the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> may be transmitted to said computer system where it will used for obtaining dimensional parameters of aircraft wing cover <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a curve <b>31</b> corresponding to the outer surface of the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> in one transversal section R scanned with said probes <b>29</b> and the position of three points P&#x2032;<sub>i1</sub>, P&#x2032;<sub>i2</sub>, P&#x2032;<sub>i3 </sub>in the inner surface at distances h&#x2032;<b>1</b>, h&#x2032;<b>2</b>, h&#x2032;<b>3</b> from the outer surface. Said curve <b>31</b> is obtained processing the positional information WO<sub>i1</sub>, WO<sub>i2</sub>, WO<sub>i3</sub>, . . . provided by the workstation <b>11</b> of the scanned points O<sub>i1</sub>, O<sub>i2</sub>, O<sub>i3</sub>, . . . in the outer surface of the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> by any suitable mathematical method, for example, a regression analysis. The position of said points P&#x2032;<sub>i1</sub>, P&#x2032;<sub>i2</sub>, P&#x2032;<sub>i2 </sub>is obtained processing the positional information WI<sub>i1</sub>, WI<sub>i2</sub>, WI<sub>i3 </sub>provided by the workstation <b>11</b> of the scanned points I<sub>i1</sub>, I<sub>i2</sub>, I<sub>i3</sub>, . . . in the inner surface of the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also shows a curve <b>33</b> corresponding to the nominal outer surface of aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> in the same transversal section R and the position of the points P<sub>i1</sub>, P<sub>i2</sub>, P<sub>i3 </sub>in the inner surface at distances h<b>1</b>, h<b>2</b>, h<b>3</b> from the outer surface. Said curve <b>33</b> is obtained processing the positional information TO<sub>i1</sub>, TO<sub>i2</sub>, TO<sub>i3</sub>, . . . provided by the analytical model of the aircraft wing cover with respect to the points O<sub>i1</sub>, O<sub>i2</sub>, O<sub>i3</sub>, . . . in the outer surface of the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> by any suitable mathematical method, for example, a regression analysis. The position of said points P<sub>i1</sub>, P<sub>i2</sub>, P<sub>i3 </sub>is obtained processing the positional information TI<sub>i1</sub>, TI<sub>i2</sub>, TI<sub>i3 </sub>provided by the analytical model of the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b> with respect to the points I<sub>i1</sub>, I<sub>i2</sub>, I<sub>i3</sub>, . . . in the inner surface of the aircraft wing cover <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows said curves <b>31</b>, <b>33</b> and the points P&#x2032;<sub>i1</sub>, P&#x2032;<sub>i2</sub>, P&#x2032;<sub>i3</sub>, P<sub>i1</sub>, P<sub>i2</sub>, P<sub>i3 </sub>developed on the common reference plane <b>35</b> with respect to a reference point <b>37</b> that allow an easy calculation of the deviations &#x3b4;<sub>1</sub>, &#x3b4;<sub>2</sub>, &#x3b4;<sub>3 </sub>between them. As the skilled man will readily understand the calculation of said deviations is done by a suitable algorithm implemented in computer means.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In general terms, it is considered that the present invention is applicable to any composite part of a moving vehicle (having hence an outer aerodynamic surface) and preferably to large composite parts.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">One advantage of the present invention is that it allows the reduction of the composite fabrication process lead time and costs as the dimensional inspection is not carried out in the autoclave which is a very expensive curing tool.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with preferred embodiments, it is evident that modifications may be introduced within the scope thereof, not considering this as limited by these embodiments, but by the contents of the following claims.</p>
