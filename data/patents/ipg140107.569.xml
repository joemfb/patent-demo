<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a printed wiring board (hereinafter referred to as a PWB) and a method of manufacturing a PWB. More specifically, the present invention relates to a PWB having a resistor element and a method of manufacturing such a PWB.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication 11-4056, a resistor element is formed by a screen printing method as follows. First, an insulation material layer and a conductive material layer are laminated together and a predetermined conductive pattern is formed by a photo-etching method on the insulation material layer. Then, an undercoat layer is formed between the predetermined conductive patterns formed on the insulation material layer. By screen-printing a carbon paste on the undercoat layer and the edge of the conductive pattern adjacent to the undercoat layer, a resistor element is formed. A paste may be applied directly on a resin without forming an undercoat layer. The contents of this publication are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one aspect of the present invention, a printed wiring board includes an insulation layer having a surface, electrodes embedded in the insulation layer, a resistor formed on the surface of the insulating layer and electrically connected to the electrodes, and an external connection conductive pattern formed over the surface of the insulating layer and electrically connected to one or more electrodes. The insulation layer and the electrodes form a component-mounting surface on the surface of the insulation layer, the component-mounting surface is substantially leveled with the surface of the insulation layer and includes a resistor forming region on which the resistor is formed, and the external connection conductive pattern is separated by a space from the resistor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect of the present invention, a printed wiring board includes an insulation layer having a surface, electrodes embedded in the insulation layer, a resistor formed on the surface of the insulation layer and electrically connected to the electrodes, and an external connection conductive pattern formed over the surface of the insulation layer and electrically connected to one or more electrodes. The insulation layer and the electrodes form a component-mounting surface on the surface of the insulation layer, the component-mounting surface is leveled with the surface of the insulation layer and includes a resistor forming region on which the resistor is formed, and the resistor has a thickness which is set to be less than a thickness of the external connection conductive pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to yet another aspect of the present invention, a manufacturing method of a printed wiring board includes forming electrodes on a conductive layer formed on a substrate by a plating method, forming an insulation layer on the electrodes and the conductive layer, removing the substrate from the conductive layer, patterning the conductive layer except for a resistor forming region reserved for forming a resistor, thereby forming an external connection conductive pattern, and forming a resistor in the resistor forming region such that the resistor is separated by a space from the external connection conductive pattern.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The embodiments will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals designate corresponding or identical elements throughout the various drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A PWB according to one embodiment of the present invention is described below. As described above, a PWB according to one embodiment of the present invention has an insulation layer, multiple electrodes, a resistor formed in the resistor forming region, and an external connection conductive pattern. A resistor element formed in the PWB is constructed with the electrodes, the conductive pattern and the resistor.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The resistor element is formed between the multiple electrodes and electrically connects the electrodes, each of which is connected to an external connection wiring pattern (a conductive layer). The multiple electrodes are embedded in a surface of the insulation layer and form a component-mounting surface with the surface of the insulation layer. The substrate surface and the embedded electrode surfaces are made substantially leveled and form an element-mounting surface which is almost flat. The resistor forming region includes sections of the surfaces of the electrodes on the component-mounting surface. The resistor physically contacts with the electrodes with a predetermined contact surface area on the element-mounting surface. Thus, the resistance value can be stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Here, the resistor is separated by a space from the conductive pattern and does not physically contact with the conductive pattern (The external connection conductive pattern is separated by a space from the resistor and formed in a region that excludes the resistor forming region but includes the sections of the surfaces of the electrodes on the component-mounting surface). By keeping the conductive pattern and the resistor from physically contacting with each other, electron migration is prevented between the resistor and the conductive pattern which are made with a metal, and thus corrosive reactions are suppressed accordingly. As a result, fluctuation in resistance value caused by corrosive reactions is suppressed and the resistance value can be stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Also, as described above, a resistance value of the resistor element formed in a conventional PWB are affected by the thickness of the conductive pattern and fluctuate accordingly. Especially, if the width of the conductive pattern is small, the impact is larger. However, since the resistor is set not to physically contact with the conductive pattern according to the structure of one embodiment of the present invention, fluctuation of the resistance value, which is influenced by change of the conductor thickness, can be smaller. By setting the resistor not to physically contact with the conductive pattern at all, the above-described influence can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The resistor element formed in the PWB according to one embodiment of the present invention can further include an element-mounting region excluding the area where the resistor is formed, and an external connection conductive pattern. The external connection conductive pattern is formed on the region, excluding sections of electrodes which are part of the element-mounting surface. Namely, the resistor element has an external connection wiring pattern. The resistor and the wiring pattern are electrically connected through the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">And the resistor is formed without covering the external connection wiring pattern. Also, the contact surface area between each electrode and the resistor is set constant. Accordingly, the resistance values of the resistor element are stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition, the electrodes are made of the primary metal and a contained element. The &#x201c;contained element&#x201d; indicates an element contained in the electrodes in a predetermined amount when the electrodes are formed. As the primary metal, nickel is preferred, being resistant to corrosion from acid or alkali and easy to process. As a contained element, phosphorus is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When forming electrodes, nickel, combined with the later-described amount of a contained element, can prevent the formation of pinholes, which is a factor in hampering a stable resistance value. As a result, the surface in contact with the electrodes is made flat and smooth, and the contact surface area is kept constant, thereby stabilizing the resistance value. Among the above-mentioned metals, nickel is further preferred, since nickel makes a dense film and thus more easily stabilizes a resistance value.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When forming the above electrodes by using nickel and phosphorus, the phosphorus content is preferred to be in the approximate range of 9-11 wt. pct. When making the above electrodes by using nickel and phosphorus, if the phosphorus content is in the approximate range of 9-11 wt. pct., pinholes are not formed on the electrode surfaces, thus sufficiently even surfaces are achieved. Furthermore, since the bonding strength between in nickel crystals is high, it is possible to produce a resistor which is resistant to corrosion from heat and chemical solutions containing acid or alkali and has sufficiently high resistance values.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As described above, by using nickel, combined with phosphorus in the approximate range of 9-11 wt. pct., a resistor element can be produced that has sufficiently even electrode surfaces and is resistant to corrosion from heat and corrosion from chemical solutions containing acid or alkali. In addition, resistance values of such a resistor element seldom fluctuate when used in a high-temperature air atmosphere.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Moreover, in the PWB according to one embodiment of the present invention, the thickness of the above resistor is preferred to be less than that of the above conductive layer. If the thickness of the resistor is greater than that of the conductive layer, the resistor becomes disfigured from pressure during the lamination process, and the disfigurement causes a fluctuation of resistance values. However, if the thickness of the resistor is less than that of the conductive layer as described above, the fluctuation of resistance values caused by such disfigurement can be prevented. Also, solder-resists on the resistor can be formed well by a printing method. Furthermore, it is possible to laminate another resistor directly on top of the resistor which has been formed as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Also, employing a resistor element having the above-described structure can reduce pressure on the resistor when laminating other layers via a prepreg. As a result, a factor in fluctuating resistance values can be decreased. Accordingly, a resistor element whose resistance values show a small fluctuation from the designed value can be mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A PWB according to the second embodiment of the present invention has an insulation layer, multiple electrodes, a resistor formed in the resistor forming region, and an external connection conductive pattern. And a resistor element is structured the same as in the above-described PWB according to the first embodiment, and electrically connects each of the electrodes. The thickness of the resistor is set to be less than that of the external connection conductive pattern. Also, since the electrodes are formed the same way, the resistance value can be stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the above, the thickness of the resistor is set to be less than that of the external connection conductive pattern. Accordingly, when embedding the resistor and the external connection conductive pattern in the insulation layer, the resistor can be securely embedded without receiving unnecessary pressure and fixed. As a result, connection reliability can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Also, the thickness of an insulation layer to be formed in the area where the resistor is embedded can be formed to be the same as or greater than that of the insulation layer where the conductive pattern is embedded. Insulation reliability can be improved accordingly. Furthermore, when forming an insulation layer for embedding the resistor and external connection conductive pattern, disfigurement of the resistor from pressure and resultant fluctuation of resistance values can be prevented by using, for example, a prepreg containing an inorganic filler or fibers, and laminating it by applying pressure and heat.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition, when pressure is applied, it is not intensively loaded on the resistor, thus preventing breakage from pressure. Accordingly, a factor in fluctuating a resistance value can be decreased and a resistor element having a resistance value with a small disparity from the designed value can be mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the above resistor element formed in the PWB according to one embodiment of the present invention, the above resistor and the wiring pattern are electrically connected via electrodes. The resistor is formed without covering the external connection wiring pattern, and the surface area where each electrode comes in contact with the resistor is made constant, thereby stabilizing the resistance value of the resistor element.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the second embodiment of the present invention, interlayer connection via-holes are preferred to be formed in the other insulation layer where the above external connection conductive pattern is embedded. Here, the above interlayer connection via-holes are preferably filled with a conductive resin so that cracks in the interlayer connecting portions caused by heating and cooling can be prevented. The conductive resin is preferably one selected from a group that includes silver paste and copper paste, since each has good electrical conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Also, filling the above interlayer connection via-holes with a metal by plating is preferred, since cracks in the interlayer connection portions caused by heating and cooling are prevented, and electrical resistance at the interlayer connection is reduced. The metal to be used is preferably one selected from a group that includes copper, silver and aluminum, since each has excellent electrical conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The above electrodes and others are structured the same as in the above-mentioned first embodiment. Therefore, a resistor having corrosion resistance and a sufficiently high resistance value can be manufactured, while sufficiently even surfaces are maintained.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A PWB according to the third embodiment of the present invention has an insulation layer, multiple electrodes, a resistor formed in the resistor forming region, and an external connection conductive pattern. The multiple electrodes are embedded in an surface of the insulation layer and form a component-mounting surface with the surface of the insulation layer. The resistor forming region includes sections of the surfaces of the electrodes on the component-mounting surface. The external connection conductive pattern is formed on the component-mounting surface, excluding the resistor forming region but including part of the electrode surfaces, and is separated from the resistor by a space (The external connection conductive pattern is separated by a space from the resistor and formed in a region that excludes the resistor forming region but includes sections of the electrode surface on the component-mounting surface). In addition, the thickness of the resistor is set to be less than that of the external connection conductive pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">By making a space between the resistor and the external connection conductive pattern, as in the PWB according to the above-described first embodiment, corrosion resistance can be improved. Furthermore, the existence of the space can reduce the impact transmitted to the resistor and thus heighten its drop impact resistance. Also, as described above, by forming the thickness of the resistor to be less than that of the external connection conductive pattern, connection reliability and insulation reliability can be improved while preventing breakage of the resistor caused by pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">When forming interlayer connection via-holes in the PWB according to the above third embodiment, they can be formed in the same way as in the above-mentioned second embodiment. Such via-holes may be filled with above-described conductive resin or may be filled with metal by plating. For such a resin and metal, the same resin and metals listed above can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Also, as described above, one embodiment of the present invention is a method of manufacturing a PWB, featuring an electrode forming step, an insulation-layer forming step, a substrate removing step, a patterning step and a resistor forming step (The manufacturing method includes an electrode-forming step using a plating method to form electrodes on a surface of the conductive layer disposed on the substrate surface; an insulation-layer forming step to form an insulation layer on the electrodes and the conductive layer; a substrate-removing step to remove the substrate from the conductive layer; a patterning step to pattern the conductive layer formed in the area excluding the resistor forming region; and a resistor forming step to form a resistor to be separated by a space from the patterned conductive layer in the resistor forming region).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">By carrying out as such, the contact surface between the resistor and the conductive layer is set constant and the fluctuation in a resistance value is suppressed. It is possible to manufacture a PWB with a resistor element with a highly accurate resistor having a resistance value that would seldom change despite heat from surface treatment, or heat and pressure from laminating another layer on top of the resistor element via a prepreg.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the above resistor forming step, it is preferred to form a resistor by a printing method in the resistor forming region. In the above resistor forming region, as described above, the substrate surface and the embedded electrode surfaces form an almost flat surface. Accordingly, if the resistor is formed by a printing method, change in the resistor configuration after printing is small and a high resolution can be achieved. As a result, the resistance value seldom fluctuates.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">From a productivity point of view, the above printing method is preferably screen printing or ink-jet printing. A carbon paste is preferred for printing, since it can produce a resistor with a high resistance value. By using such a nano-paste, it is possible to produce a highly accurate resistor. Also, the above conductive pattern and resistor are preferred to be separated by a space. The reason for this has been described earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As described above, the electrodes are preferably made of nickel. It is more preferable for the nickel to contain a predetermined amount of phosphorus, since the evenness of electrode surfaces can be maintained, the level of resistance to corrosion from heat or chemical substances such as acid or alkali is high, the resistance value fluctuation is small when used in a high-temperature atmosphere, and so on. When the primary metal is nickel, the content of the above phosphorus is preferably in the approximate range of 9-11 wt. pct. to maintain an evenness of surface and prevent the formation of pinholes on the electrode surfaces. It is more preferable for the phosphorus content to be approximately 10 wt. pct.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">From the above reasons, the thickness of the resistor is preferred to be less than that of the conductive layer. By following the above manufacturing method of a PWB, the resistance value can be stabilized, thus a highly accurate resistor with a high resistance value can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A resistor element according to one embodiment of the present invention has the advantage of providing a resistor free of the effects of varying thicknesses of the electrodes. By following the manufacturing method of a PWB according to one embodiment of the present invention, a PWB can be produced that has a mounted resistor with a stable, high resistance value. Moreover, with reference to a PWB according to one embodiment of the present invention, a PWB can be produced that has a resistor with a stable, high resistance value.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-9</figref>, one embodiment of the present invention is described below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an X-Z cross-sectional view of PWB <b>10</b> with a mounted resistor element according to one embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, PWB <b>10</b> has (a) insulation layer (<b>18</b>U); (b) two electrodes (EU<sub>1</sub>, EU<sub>2</sub>), embedded in insulation layer (<b>18</b>U) in the minus-Z dimension (hereinafter may be referred to as the (&#x2212;Z) surface); (c) conductive pattern (CPL<sub>1</sub>), formed on the (&#x2212;Z) surface of insulation layer (<b>18</b>U); and (d) resistor (PR), formed on the component-mounting surface, the component-mounting surface being formed with electrodes (EU<sub>1</sub>, EU<sub>2</sub>) and the (&#x2212;Z) surface of insulation layer (<b>18</b>U). The resistor element has resistor (PR), electrodes (EU<sub>1</sub>, EU<sub>2</sub>), and a partial area of conductive pattern (CPL&#x2032;) which is electrically connected to electrodes (EU<sub>1</sub>, EU<sub>2</sub>). Further, PWB <b>10</b> has (e) conductive pattern (CPU&#x2032;), formed on the plus Z-dimension (hereinafter referred to as the (+Z) surface) of insulation layer (<b>18</b>U), and (g) conductive pattern (CPU&#x2032;).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As material for insulation layers (<b>14</b>, <b>18</b>U, <b>18</b>L), epoxy-resin, epoxy-resin blended with inorganic fillers such as silica, glass-cloth immersed in epoxy-resin (hereinafter may be referred to as &#x201c;glass-epoxy&#x201d; or &#x201c;prepreg&#x201d;), polyimide or the like, may be used. Among those, glass-epoxy is preferred, since it is excellent in dimension stability, mass productivity and thermal stability. Insulation layers <b>8</b>, <b>12</b> may be formed using the same material selected from among the above-listed materials, or materials may be different from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As material for conductive patterns (CPU&#x2032;, CPL&#x2032;), conductive metals such as copper, aluminum, stainless steel or the like can be used. Copper is preferred from a processability point of view. Conductive patterns (CPU&#x2032;, CPL&#x2032;) may be formed by using a single copper foil as described later, or by plating on a copper foil with carrier. Resistor (PR) formed in the resistor forming region is preferably not in contact with conductive pattern (CPL&#x2032;).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As material for electrodes (EU<sub>1</sub>, EU<sub>2</sub>), gold, silver, copper, platinum, palladium, nickel, aluminum, or the like may be used, but nickel is preferred. Those metals are conductive and are resistant to corrosion from an etching solution used to form a later-described top surface pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Electrodes (EU<sub>1</sub>, EU<sub>2</sub>) are formed to have at least one layer preferably by a plating method using a metal from the above list. It is preferred to use palladium or nickel which contains a predetermined amount of element as described later, since a resistor can be produced that has high resistance values and an excellent level of resistance to corrosion and chemical substances.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">By containing a predetermined amount of element, satisfactory results are achieved, such as prevention of pinholes when forming electrodes, high corrosion resistance to heat, acid or alkali, and fewer chances of resistance value fluctuation when used in a high-temperature air atmosphere. Phosphorus or boric acid may be used for a contained element, but phosphorus is preferred. If the formation of pinholes is prevented when forming electrodes, an inhibitory factor for achieving stable resistance values is reduced and the contact surface area is set constant, since the contact surfaces with the electrodes are made flat and smooth. Therefore, stable resistance values are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">When using nickel as the primary metal, it is preferred to contain phosphorus in the approximate range of 9-11 wt. pct. If the phosphorus content is in that range, the formation of pinholes when forming electrodes can be prevented and corrosion resistance can be also maintained. Also, phosphorus contained in nickel will not be air-oxidized when used in a high temperature air atmosphere, thus the resistance values will not fluctuate. The phosphorus content of approximately 10 wt. pct. is more preferable, since it can provide a dense film with better corrosion resistance and a stable resistance value.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">If an almost flat component-mounting surface is formed with electrodes (EU<sub>1</sub>, EU<sub>2</sub>) and the (&#x2212;Z) surface of insulation layer (<b>18</b>U), a printed paste is prevented from disfigurement caused by its flow before setting when resistor (PR) is formed by a printing method. By preventing deformation, resistance values of the resistor can be better stabilized.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Preferably, the thickness of resistor (PR) is formed at the same thickness as conductive pattern (CPL&#x2032;) or thinner. By forming it as such, when another element is mounted on conductive pattern (CPL&#x2032;), which is a top-surface wiring, any unnecessary load on the resistor can be avoided and disfigurement of the resistor can be prevented, thereby stabilizing its resistance value. Furthermore, another resistor may be disposed directly on top of the resistor formed as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Unlike the above-described conventional printed resistor illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in the resistor element according to one embodiment of the present invention, electrodes (EU<sub>1</sub>, EU<sub>2</sub>) are formed directly under top surface wiring (CPL&#x2032;) as described above, and resistor (PR) is formed in such a way that conductive pattern (CPL&#x2032;) does not touch resistor (PR).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Therefore, the resistance value of resistor (PR) does not fluctuate according to the thickness of the conductive layer. Also, the resistance value can be stabilized, since the contact surface area between the resistor and the electrodes can be kept constant regardless of the conductive layer thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Also, since resistor (PR) is formed on an almost level plane as mentioned above, the (+Z) surface of resistor (PR) is made flat. Thus, configuration change due to contraction before curing is very small. Accordingly, fluctuations in the resistance values of resistor (PR) can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Next, manufacturing steps of PWB <b>10</b> are described as follows. First, conductive film (CF) with carrier is prepared as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Regarding conductive film (CF) with carrier, on (+Z) surface of supporting material (hereinafter may be referred to as &#x201c;carrier material&#x201d; or &#x201c;carrier&#x201d;) (<b>12</b><i>c</i>), conductive film (<b>2</b><i>a</i>) such as a copper film or the like is laminated.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Above conductive film (CF) with carrier can be produced by press-laminating conductive film (<b>2</b><i>a</i>) on a surface of carrier material (<b>12</b><i>c</i>). Conductive film (<b>2</b><i>a</i>) is glued by using adhesives containing benzotriazole or benzotriazole derivatives, for example, VERZONE (SF-310, made by Daiwa Fine Chemical Co., Ltd.) in such a way that it can be peeled-off later. Products on the market may also be selected for use accordingly. As such commercial products, ones which allow carrier and the conductive film, for example, Micro Thin (made by Mitsui Mining and Smelting Co., Ltd.), XTR (made by Olin Corporation), UTC-Foil (made by Metfoils AB), or the like, to be separated later can be listed.</p>

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In the following, the resist of mask resist layers (<b>22</b>U, <b>22</b>L) is removed from regions, excluding portions where the conductive patterns are formed, by a conventional photolithographic method.

This has the advantage that, after resistor (PR) is formed by the above-mentioned printing method, the paste does not flow before the resin, such as phenol-resin, contained in the paste is thermally cured, and thus resistor (PR) is seldom deformed.</p>

Then, a die paste such as die bonding paste EPINAL (made by Hitachi Chemical Co., Ltd.) or the like is coated on the area where element IC will be bonded, then heat is added after element IC is mounted.
