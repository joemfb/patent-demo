<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An improved method and apparatus for dropping a ball, plug or dart during oil and gas well operations (e.g., cementing operations) employs a specially configured valving member with curved and flat portions that alternatively direct fluid flow through a bore or opening in the valving member via an inner channel or around the periphery of the valving member in an outer channel. In one embodiment, the ball(s), dart(s) or plug(s) are contained in a sliding sleeve that shifts position responsive to valve rotation. An optional indicator indicates to a user or operator that a ball or plug has passed a selected one of the valving members.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The present invention provides an improved method and apparatus for dropping balls, plugs, darts or the like as a part of a cementing operation. Such cementing operations are in general known and are employed for example when installing a liner such as liner <b>32</b>. In the drawings, arrows <b>75</b> indicate generally the flow path of fluid (e.g. cement, fluidized material or the like) through the tool body <b>34</b>. In that regard, the present invention provides an improved ball or plug or dart dropping head <b>15</b> that is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref>, <b>10</b>-<b>17</b> and <b>18</b>-<b>33</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C and <b>2</b>-<b>8</b>, ball/plug dropping head <b>15</b> has an upper end portion <b>31</b> and a lower end portion <b>33</b>. Ball/plug dropping head <b>15</b> provides a tool body <b>34</b> that can be of multiple sections that are connected together, such as with threaded connections. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>, the tool body <b>34</b> includes sections <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>. The section <b>35</b> is an upper section. The section <b>39</b> is a lower section.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Ball/plug dropping head <b>15</b> can be pre-loaded with a number of different items to be dropped as part of a cementing operation. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C there are a number of items that are contained in ball/plug dropping head <b>15</b>. These include an upper, larger diameter ball dart <b>40</b>, <b>41</b> and smaller diameter ball <b>42</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-26</figref>, an alternate embodiment is shown which enables very small diameter balls, sometimes referred to as &#x201c;frac-balls&#x201d; <b>102</b> (which can have a diameter of between about &#xbd; and &#x215d; inches) to be dispensed into the well below toll body <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The tool body <b>34</b> supports a plurality of valving members at opposed openings <b>90</b>. The valving members can include first valving member <b>43</b> which is an upper valving member. The valving members can include a second valving member <b>44</b> which is in between the first valving member <b>43</b> and a lower or third valving member <b>45</b>.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Threaded connections <b>46</b>, <b>47</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>49</b> can be used for connecting the various body sections <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> together end to end as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C. Tool body <b>34</b> upper end <b>31</b> is provided with an internally threaded portion <b>50</b> for forming a connection with tubular member <b>22</b> that depends from top drive unit <b>13</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. A flow bore <b>51</b> extends between upper end <b>31</b> and lower end <b>33</b> of tool body <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Sleeve sections <b>52</b> are secured to tool body <b>34</b> within bore <b>15</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C. Sleeves <b>52</b> can be generally centered within bore <b>51</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C using spacers <b>67</b> that extend along radial lines from the sections <b>35</b>-<b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Each valving member <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> is movable between open and closed positions. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>1</b>C each of the valving members <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> is in a closed position. In that closed position, each valving member <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> prevents downward movement of a plug, ball <b>40</b>, <b>42</b>, or dart <b>41</b> as shown. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the closed position of valving member <b>43</b> prevents downward movement of larger diameter ball <b>40</b>. Similarly, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a closed position of valving member <b>44</b> prevents a downward movement of dart <b>41</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a closed position of valving member <b>45</b> prevents a downward movement of smaller diameter ball <b>42</b>. In each instance, the ball, dart or plug rests upon the outer curved surface <b>68</b> of valving member <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> or <b>45</b> as shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Each valving member <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> provides a pair of opposed generally flat surfaces <b>69</b>, <b>70</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>17</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows in more detail the connection that is formed between each of the valving members <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> and the tool body <b>34</b>. The tool body <b>34</b> provides opposed openings <b>90</b> that are receptive the generally cylindrically shaped valve stems <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> that are provided on the flat sections or flat surfaces <b>69</b>, <b>70</b> of each valving member <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 17</figref>, the flat surface <b>69</b> provides valve stem <b>54</b>. Openings <b>90</b> are receptive of the parts shown in exploded view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> that enable a connection to be formed between the valving member <b>43</b>, <b>44</b> or <b>45</b> and the tool body <b>34</b>. For the stem <b>55</b>, fastener <b>91</b> engages an internally threaded opening of stem <b>55</b>. Bushing <b>92</b> is positioned within opening <b>90</b> and the outer surface of stem <b>55</b> registers within the central bore <b>95</b> of bushing <b>92</b>. Bushing <b>92</b> is externally threaded at <b>93</b> for engaging a correspondingly internally threaded portion of tool body <b>34</b> at opening <b>90</b>. O-rings <b>60</b> can be used to interface between stem <b>55</b> and bushing <b>92</b>. A slightly different configuration is provided for attaching stem <b>54</b> to tool body <b>34</b>. Sleeve <b>94</b> occupies a position that surrounds stem <b>54</b>. Sleeve <b>54</b> fits inside of bore <b>95</b> of bushing <b>92</b>. The externally threaded portion <b>93</b> of bushing <b>92</b> engages correspondingly shaped threads of opening <b>90</b>. Pins <b>99</b> form a connection between the stem <b>54</b> at openings <b>98</b> and the sleeve <b>94</b>. Fastener <b>96</b> forms a connection between bushing <b>92</b> and an internally threaded opening <b>97</b> of stem <b>54</b>. As assembled, this configuration can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> for example. The flat surfaces <b>69</b>, <b>70</b> enable fluid to flow in bore <b>51</b> in a position radially outwardly or externally of sleeve or sleeve section <b>52</b> by passing between the tool body sections <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b> and sleeve <b>52</b>. Thus, bore <b>51</b> is divided into two flow channels. These two flow channels <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> include a central flow channel <b>71</b> within sleeves <b>52</b> that is generally cylindrically shaped and that aligns generally with the channel <b>53</b> of each valving member <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b>. The second flow channel is an annular outer flow channel <b>72</b> that is positioned in between a sleeve <b>52</b> and the tool body sections <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>, <b>39</b>. The channels <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> can be concentric. The outer channel <b>72</b> is open when the valving members <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> are in the closed positions of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>1</b>C, wherein central flow channel <b>71</b> is closed. When the valving members <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> are rotated to a closed position, fins <b>73</b> become transversely positioned with respect to the flow path of fluid flowing in channel <b>72</b> thus closing outer flow channel <b>72</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). This occurs when a valving member <b>43</b>, <b>44</b>, <b>45</b> is opened for releasing a ball <b>40</b> or <b>42</b> or for releasing dart <b>41</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a closed position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the valving member <b>45</b> just before releasing smaller diameter ball <b>42</b>. Fins <b>73</b> are generally aligned with bore <b>15</b> and with flow channels <b>71</b>, <b>72</b> when flow in channel <b>72</b> is desired (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, valving member <b>45</b> is closed and outer flow channel <b>72</b> is open.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>-<b>8</b>, a tool <b>74</b> has been used to rotate valving member <b>45</b> to an open position that aligns its channel <b>53</b> with central flow channel <b>71</b> enabling smaller diameter ball <b>42</b> to fall downwardly via central flow channel <b>71</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, outer flow channel <b>72</b> has been closed by fins <b>73</b> that have now rotated about 90 degrees from the open position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to the closed position. Fins <b>73</b> close channel <b>72</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. It should be understood that tool <b>74</b> can also be used to rotate valving member <b>44</b> from an open position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> to a closed position such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> when it is desired that dart <b>41</b> should drop. Similarly, tool <b>74</b> can be used to rotate upper valving member <b>43</b> from the closed position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> to an open position such as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> when it is desired to drop larger diameter ball <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-16</figref> illustrate further the method and apparatus of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, lower or third valving member <b>45</b> has been opened as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> releasing smaller diameter ball <b>42</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, smaller diameter ball <b>42</b> is shown dropping wherein it is in phantom lines, its path indicated schematically by arrows <b>75</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a pair of commercially available, known plugs <b>76</b>, <b>77</b>. These plugs <b>76</b>, <b>77</b> include upper plug <b>76</b> and lower plug <b>77</b>. Each of the plugs <b>76</b>, <b>77</b> can be provided with a flow passage <b>79</b>, <b>81</b> respectively that enables fluid to circulate through it before ball <b>42</b> forms a seal upon the flow passage <b>81</b>. Smaller diameter ball <b>42</b> has seated upon the lower plug <b>77</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> so that it can now be pumped downwardly, pushing cement <b>80</b> ahead of it. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, arrows <b>78</b> schematically illustrate the downward movement of lower plug <b>77</b> when urged downwardly by a pumped substance such as a pumpable cement or like material <b>80</b>. Each of the plugs <b>76</b>, <b>77</b> can be provided with a flow passage <b>79</b>, <b>81</b> respectively that enables fluid to circulate through it before ball <b>42</b> forms a seal upon the flow passage <b>81</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). When plug <b>77</b> reaches float valve <b>28</b>, pressure can be increased to push ball <b>42</b> through plug <b>77</b>, float valve <b>28</b> and casing shoe <b>27</b> so that the cement flows (see arrows <b>100</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) into the space <b>101</b> between formation <b>26</b> and casing <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, second valving member <b>44</b> is opened releasing dart <b>41</b>. Dart <b>41</b> can be used to push the cement <b>80</b> downwardly in the direction of arrows <b>82</b>. A completion fluid or other fluid <b>83</b> can be used to pump dart <b>41</b> downwardly, pushing cement <b>80</b> ahead of it. Once valves <b>44</b> and <b>45</b> are opened, fluid <b>83</b> can flow through openings <b>84</b> provided in sleeves <b>52</b> below the opened valving member (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 12</figref>. Thus, as each valving member <b>43</b> or <b>44</b> or <b>45</b> is opened, fluid moves through the openings <b>84</b> into central flow channel <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">When valve <b>44</b> is opened, dart <b>41</b> can be pumped downwardly to engage upper plug <b>76</b>, registering upon it and closing its flow passage <b>79</b>, pushing it downwardly as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. Upper plug <b>79</b> and dart <b>41</b> are pumped downwardly using fluid <b>83</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 15</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, first valving member <b>43</b> is opened so that larger diameter ball <b>40</b> can move downwardly, pushing any remaining cement <b>80</b> downwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The ball <b>40</b> can be deformable, so that it can enter the smaller diameter section <b>86</b> at the lower end portion of tool body <b>34</b>. During this process, cement or like mixture <b>80</b> is forced downwardly through float collar <b>28</b> and casing shoe <b>27</b> into the space that is in between production casing <b>32</b> and formation <b>26</b>. This operation helps stabilize production casing <b>32</b> and prevents erosion of the surrounding formation <b>26</b> during drilling operations.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">During drilling operations, a drill bit is lowered on a drill string using derrick <b>12</b>, wherein the drill bit simply drills through the production casing <b>32</b> as it expands the well downwardly in search of oil.</p>

Arrows <b>125</b>, <b>126</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> illustrate the flow of fluid downwardly through gap <b>135</b> and in central channel <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">A sleeve <b>111</b> above a valving member <b>112</b> or <b>113</b> thus move up and down responsive to a rotation of that valving member <b>112</b> or <b>113</b>. Spacers <b>28</b> can be employed that extend from each sleeve <b>111</b> radially to slidably engage tool body <b>34</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20 and 21</figref>, each stem <b>119</b>, <b>120</b> can be provided with one or more annular grooves <b>131</b> that are receptive of o-rings <b>60</b> or other sealing material. As with the preferred embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-17</figref>, openings <b>132</b> in each stem <b>119</b>, <b>120</b> are receptive of pins <b>99</b>. Likewise, each stem <b>119</b>, <b>120</b> provides internally threaded openings <b>133</b>. Thus, the same connection for attaching a valving member <b>112</b>, <b>113</b> to tool body <b>34</b> can be the one shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A-33</figref> show another embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention wherein the tool body <b>136</b> provides an upper sleeve <b>140</b> that differs in construction from the sleeve of the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-26</figref>. Further, the tool body <b>136</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A-33</figref> provides an indicator <b>147</b> that indicates to a user whether or not a ball or dart <b>145</b>, <b>146</b> has in fact been discharged from the tool body <b>136</b>. Further, the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A-33</figref> provides specially configured inserts or sleeves <b>160</b>, <b>163</b> that are positioned below the lower valve <b>113</b>, this additional sleeve or insert <b>160</b> is configured to prevent a build-up of material within the flow bore <b>51</b> below lower valving member <b>113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27A-33</figref>, tool body <b>136</b> provides upper end portion <b>137</b> and lower end portion <b>138</b>. As with the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-26</figref>, the tool body <b>136</b> can be formed similarly to the tool body <b>34</b>, having multiple sections <b>35</b>, <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, <b>38</b> and <b>139</b>. The section <b>139</b> is similar to the section <b>39</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-26</figref>. However, the section <b>139</b> is configured to accept sleeve or insert <b>160</b> and sleeve or insert <b>163</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Sleeve <b>140</b> is similar to the sleeves <b>111</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18-26</figref>. The sleeve <b>140</b> provides a cap <b>141</b> that can be connected to the sleeve <b>140</b> using threaded connection <b>142</b>. Cap <b>141</b> provides one or more longitudinally extending and circumferentially spaced apart openings <b>143</b>. The cap <b>141</b> can also provide a tool receptive socket <b>144</b> that enables rotation of cap <b>141</b>, relative to sleeve <b>140</b>, using a tool (e.g. allen wrench) during assembly of cap <b>141</b> to sleeve <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27B</figref>, <b>28</b>-<b>33</b> indicator <b>147</b> is shown. The indicator <b>147</b> indicates to a user whether or not a dart <b>145</b>, <b>146</b> has passed the indicator <b>147</b>, thus indicating a discharge of the dart <b>145</b>, <b>146</b> from the tool body <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In FIGS. <b>27</b>B and <b>28</b>-<b>33</b>, indicator <b>147</b> provides a shaft <b>148</b> that extends horizontally relative to flow bore <b>51</b> of tool body <b>136</b>. Lever arm <b>149</b> moves between an extended position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref> and a collapsed position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. The lever arm <b>149</b> is initially set in the extended position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref> by placing pin <b>150</b> behind spring <b>151</b> upper end <b>154</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27B</figref>. Spring <b>151</b> thus holds the pin <b>150</b> in a generally vertical position by rotating shaft <b>148</b> so that arm <b>149</b> extends into flow bore <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, upper valve <b>112</b> is shown supporting a first dart <b>145</b>. Lower valve <b>113</b> is shown supporting a second dart <b>146</b>. Operation is the same as was described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-26</figref>. Lower valve <b>113</b>, is rotated to an open position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> by rotating the valve <b>113</b> through about ninety degrees. Dart <b>146</b> then drops as indicated by arrow <b>164</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. As the dart <b>146</b> travels downwardly, leaving valve <b>113</b> and moving toward lower end portion <b>138</b> of tool body <b>136</b>, the dart <b>146</b> engages lever arm <b>149</b>. The dart <b>146</b> continues to move downwardly, pushing the arm <b>149</b> to the retracted position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> as illustrated by arrow <b>165</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. In this position, the pin <b>150</b> deflects spring <b>151</b> until pin <b>150</b> assumes the position shown in phantom lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The spring <b>151</b> upper end portion <b>154</b> prevents the pin <b>150</b> from returning to the position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, as the pin is now being held in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. Arrow <b>152</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> illustrates the travel of arm <b>149</b> from the extended position to the retracted position. An operator can then reset the indicator <b>147</b> by rotating the pin <b>150</b> to the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> as illustrated by arrow <b>153</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. This procedure can then be repeated for the upper and second dart <b>145</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 30 and 31</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, the upper valve <b>112</b> is moved to an open position. A working fluid is pumped into tool body <b>136</b> at upper end <b>137</b>. Flow moves downwardly in the tool body <b>136</b> as illustrated by arrows <b>166</b>. Flow travels through openings <b>143</b> in cap <b>141</b> as illustrated by arrows <b>167</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. This downward flow moves the darts <b>145</b>, <b>146</b> downwardly.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Indicator <b>147</b> can be attached to tool body <b>136</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. A pair of recesses <b>155</b>, <b>156</b> on tool body <b>136</b> enable attachment of shaft <b>148</b>. The shaft <b>148</b> can be held in position using fasteners such as bolts, for example. Spring <b>151</b> can then be attached to tool body <b>136</b> at recess <b>156</b> using fasteners <b>158</b> such as bolts. Curved arrow <b>157</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> illustrates rotation of shaft <b>148</b> for moving arm <b>149</b> and pin <b>150</b> between the extended position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> and the retracted position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27C and 32</figref> illustrate placement of insert/sleeves <b>160</b>, <b>163</b>. The sleeve <b>160</b> provides an upper end portion that is conically shaped or tapered. This tapered section <b>161</b> is placed just below lower valve <b>113</b> and aids in the efficient flow of fluid downwardly in the tool body <b>136</b> eliminating unnecessary accumulation of material such as cement. Annular shoulder <b>162</b> on tool body <b>136</b> enables support of lower insert <b>163</b> which is placed below upper insert <b>160</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 27B and 27C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34A-39</figref> show another alternate embodiment of the apparatus of the present invention, designated generally by the numeral <b>170</b>. Plug dropping apparatus <b>170</b> provides an apparatus that can be used for launching plugs into casing <b>171</b>. Casing <b>171</b> is typically larger diameter and can have a diameter as large as about 20 inches. Examples of casing diameters are: 9&#x215d; inches, 10&#xbe; inches, 13&#x215c; inches and 20 inches. The casing <b>171</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34-37</figref> has a casing bore or annulus <b>172</b>. The casing bore or annulus <b>172</b> is defined by casing <b>171</b> inside surface <b>173</b>, which is typically generally cylindrically shaped.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The apparatus <b>170</b> of the present invention is designed to launch larger diameter (e.g. between about nine (9) and nineteen (19) inches) plugs such as the plugs <b>176</b>, <b>177</b> shown into a section of casing <b>171</b> having a casing bore or annulus <b>172</b>. This is accomplished using a tool body (e.g. <b>34</b>) having a pair or more of valving members and a pair of more smaller darts of one or more of the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-33</figref> in combination with the connectors <b>174</b>, <b>175</b> and casing <b>171</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 34-37</figref>, a tool body <b>34</b> is shown having a lower section <b>39</b> that connects to a smaller connector <b>174</b>. In order to launch one of the larger diameter plugs <b>176</b>, <b>177</b> that are a larger diameter which is larger than the diameter of tool body <b>34</b>, a pair of connectors <b>174</b>,<b>175</b> are used. These include a smaller connector <b>174</b> that is attached to section <b>39</b> of tool body <b>34</b> and a larger connector <b>175</b> that forms a connection between the first, smaller connector <b>174</b> and the casing <b>171</b>. Other connectors can be used as an interface between tool body <b>34</b> and casing <b>171</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In order to launch the larger diameter plugs <b>176</b>, <b>177</b>, a smaller diameter dart <b>199</b> is launched from the tool body <b>34</b> as shown and described in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-33</figref>. The dart <b>199</b> is configured to pass through the central channel or bore <b>184</b> of an upper or first plug <b>176</b> and connect with a sleeve <b>194</b> of the second or lower casing plug <b>177</b>. This connection of the first dart <b>199</b> with the second or lower casing plug <b>177</b> can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref>, arrow <b>200</b> illustrates a downward movement of the combination of second casing plug <b>177</b> and dart <b>199</b> followed by pumped cement <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, cement <b>203</b> is pumped downwardly through tool body <b>34</b> to first casing plug <b>176</b>, passing through channel or bore <b>184</b>. Pumping of cement through tool body <b>34</b> and its valving members is described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-33</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The sleeve <b>194</b> of the second casing plug <b>177</b> provides a beveled annular surface <b>197</b> at the sleeve enlarged lower end <b>195</b>. The sleeve upper end <b>196</b> can be generally cylindrically shaped, enabling the dart <b>199</b> to easily enter and lodge inside the sleeve <b>194</b> and the channel or bore <b>193</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35B</figref>). The dart <b>199</b> provides a domed or beveled annular surface <b>201</b> that seals and latches upon the beveled annular surface <b>197</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 35B</figref>, <b>36</b>B. In this position, fluid pressure and the downwardly flowing cement <b>203</b> can be used to shear pin <b>208</b> and force the combination of dart <b>199</b> and plug <b>177</b> down into the casing <b>171</b> bore or annulus <b>172</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Once the combination of dart <b>199</b> and second casing plug <b>177</b> move downwardly as indicated by arrow <b>200</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref>, cement can follow. A volume of cement <b>203</b> or cement mixture <b>203</b> can be a part of the driving force that moves the plug and dart combination <b>177</b>, <b>179</b> downwardly as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36B</figref>. For cementing operations in a casing <b>171</b>, the combination of second casing plug <b>177</b> and dart <b>199</b> move down followed by the volume of cement <b>203</b> followed by the combination of casing plug <b>176</b> and another dart <b>202</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38B</figref>, <b>39</b>). When the selected volume of cement <b>203</b> has been transmitted into the casing bore <b>172</b> behind second casing plug <b>177</b> and dart <b>199</b>, the dart <b>202</b> is launched from tool body <b>34</b> and connects with (e.g. seals and latches with) casing plug <b>177</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38A</figref>, <b>39</b>). The dart <b>202</b> has a lower beveled annular surface or domed or hemispherical surface <b>204</b> that registers upon a beveled annular surface <b>205</b> of sleeve <b>206</b> (see arrow <b>207</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</figref>). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36B</figref>, <b>37</b>, <b>38</b>B, and <b>39</b> the mass cement or cement mixture <b>203</b> has been injected in between the plugs <b>176</b>, <b>177</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The second dart <b>202</b> has a domed or hemispherical or beveled annular surface <b>204</b> that seals and latches with beveled annular surface <b>205</b> of sleeve <b>206</b> of casing plug <b>176</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</figref>). Arrow <b>207</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38B</figref> represent fluid pressure applied to the assembly of dart <b>202</b> and casing plug <b>176</b> which can be used to shear pin <b>208</b>, forcing plug <b>176</b> and dart <b>202</b> downwardly behind cement <b>203</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>). Shear pin <b>208</b> can be used to hold the sleeves <b>194</b>, <b>206</b> prior to launch. Fluid pressure applied to a dart and plug <b>199</b>, <b>177</b> or <b>202</b>, <b>176</b> can be used to shear pin <b>208</b>.</p>
