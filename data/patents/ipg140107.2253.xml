<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a composition comprising a poorly water soluble substance, used in the fields of drugs, foods and the like, more specifically to a composition wherein the absorbability of a poorly water soluble substance is improved, a method of producing the same, and a use thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">As techniques for improving the absorption of a poorly water soluble substance from the gastrointestinal tract and suppressing the variation thereof, solubilization by the addition of cyclodextrin and the like, solid dispersion and micronization are known (International Patent Publication Nos. WO96/019239 and WO02/048142). Hence, it is known that poorly water soluble substance is micronized to improve the absorption of a poorly water soluble substance and to suppress the variation in the absorption. However, as a method of micronizing a poorly water soluble substance, dry pulverization using jet mill and the like is commonly used; in the dry pulverization, because the surface area increases with the progress of pulverization, resulting in re-aggregation, it is difficult to micronize a poorly water soluble substance until the median diameter becomes not more than several microns (that is, the particle size reached is up to several microns as the median diameter).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">On the other hand, to obtain microparticles not more than several microns, it is common practice to use a build-up method such as crystallization, wherein particles are formed from a dissolved state with gradually increasing sizes. However, in build-up methods such as crystallization, because it is usually necessary to dissolve the poorly water soluble substance once in a good solvent such as an organic solvent, and then add the solution to a poor solvent, various crystallization conditions must be carefully evaluated for each kind of poorly water soluble substance to be micronized, which involves complicated operation. Also, because a poorly water soluble substance micronized by the build-up method to the extent that makes the median diameter to be not more than several microns is microcrystalline unlike in the crystallization operation for preparing macrocrystals for purification, the solvent and the like used are likely to remain as residues. It is hard to obtain pure microparticles. Particularly, when the build-up method is used in the pharmaceutical field, there is a problem in which if a solvent other than water remains as a residue, the residual amount must be measured and safety must be assured.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Also, wet pulverization usually enables pulverization to finer particle sizes than dry pulverization, but because the pulverization performance differs depending on the choice of dispersion stabilizer and the amount added, it is necessary to carefully evaluate the pulverization formula (choice of dispersion stabilizer and the amount added) for each kind of poorly water soluble substance. Even when the pulverization formula is prepared, it is not always easy to micronize the formulation to the extent that the median diameter is not more than several microns; it has been substantially difficult to sufficiently improve the absorption of a poorly water soluble substance or suppress the variation in the absorption.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In view of the above-described situation, the present invention is intended to provide a micronized composition comprising a poorly water soluble substance wherein the poorly water soluble substance is sufficiently micronized to improve the absorbability of the poorly water soluble substance (preferably absorption is improved and variation in absorption is suppressed), and a method of producing the same, and a use thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present inventors diligently investigated with the aim of accomplishing the above-described objects, found that when a composition prepared by blending a poorly water soluble substance with polyvinylpyrrolidone or a vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer is pulverized by wet pulverization, suitably when a composition prepared by blending a poorly water soluble substance with polyvinylpyrrolidone or a vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer and further with an auxiliary dispersion stabilizer is pulverized by wet pulverization, surprisingly, the poorly water soluble substance is efficiently micronized independently of the properties of the poorly water soluble substance, and the absorbability thereof was improved, and developed the present invention.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0048">The present invention is hereinafter described in more detail.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0049">The present invention provides a composition having a median diameter of not more than 1 &#x3bc;m, comprising (i) a poorly water soluble substance and (ii) polyvinylpyrrolidone or a vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, preferably a composition having a median diameter of not more than 1 &#x3bc;m, comprising (i) a poorly water soluble substance, (ii) polyvinylpyrrolidone or a vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer and (iii) an auxiliary dispersion stabilizer. &#x201c;A composition having a median diameter of not more than 1 &#x3bc;m&#x201d; means &#x201c;comprising a poorly water soluble substance having a median diameter of not more than 1 &#x3bc;m&#x201d;.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0052">As mentioned herein, &#x201c;individual differences in the in vivo environment&#x201d; refers to, for example, differences in intragastric pH level in patients with anacidity or hypoacidity from healthy humans; &#x201c;day-to-day variation in the in vivo environment&#x201d; refers to, for example, differences in intragastric pH level among different days in patients with hypoacidity. &#x201c;Dietary conditions&#x201d; refers to differences in the timing of intake relative to mealtimes and differences in the contents of meals. &#x201c;Differences in the contents of meals&#x201d; is, for example, a difference in the balance or quantity of nutritive components of high-calorie diets, low-calorie diets and the like. A poorly water soluble substance has the solubility thereof differing depending on the change in these conditions of the in vivo environment, often resulting in a change in the absorption.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0053">In the present invention, the poorly water soluble substance can be a free form or a salt. As examples of the salt, pharmacologically acceptable salts such as those with metals, those with inorganic acids, those with organic acids, and those with acidic amino acids can be mentioned. As preferable examples of metal salts, alkali metal salts such as sodium salts and potassium salts; alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium salts, magnesium salts, and barium salts; zinc salts and the like can be mentioned.

As preferable examples of salts with acidic amino acids, salts with aspartic acid, glutamic acid and the like can be mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0054">The poorly water soluble substance used in the present invention can be of low biological membrane permeability, as long as it is nutritionally or pharmacologically useful. The poorly water soluble substance can be a prodrug thereof. With respect to molecular weight, there is no particular limitation. As used herein, &#x201c;biological membrane permeability&#x201d; refers to the apparent membrane permeability of the substance in the gastrointestinal tract mucosa involved in the absorption of the substance.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0056">When the composition of the present invention is for food use, examples of the poorly water soluble substance include vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin B2, vitamin D, vitamin E, vitamin K and vitamin P, vitamin-like substances such as &#x3b1;-lipoic acid and coenzyme Q10, minerals such as calcium salts and heme iron and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0057">The present invention is applicable to poorly water soluble substance having a solubility in water of, for example, not more than 0.1 mg/ml at 37&#xb0; C., and further to poorly water soluble substance having a solubility of not more than 0.05 mg/ml at 37&#xb0; C.; preferably, the lower limit of the solubility of the poorly water soluble substance in water is not less than 1 &#x3bc;g/ml at 37&#xb0; C. However, in the mode wherein the composition of the present invention comprises (i) a poorly water soluble substance, (ii) polyvinylpyrrolidone or a vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer and (iii) an auxiliary dispersion stabilizer, and (iii) the auxiliary dispersion stabilizer is an anionic surfactant (preferably a long-chain alkyl sulfate salt such as sodium lauryl sulfate), a sufficient absorption-improving effect can be obtained even on a poorly water soluble substance having a solubility in water of less than 1 &#x3bc;g/ml at 37&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0058">The term solubility as mentioned herein refers to the amount of poorly water soluble substance in the filtrate obtained by adding the poorly water soluble substance in excess to purified water (manufactured by Millipore, Milli-Q System (trade name)), allowing the mixture to stand in a constant-temperature chamber at 37&#xb0; C. for 2 hours, during which period samples were taken every 30 minutes, stirring each sample in a volutex mixer, and filtering the resulting suspension through a syringe filter (manufactured by Nihon Pall Ltd., Acrodisc LC25, PVDF, pore diameter 0.2 &#x3bc;m).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0059">Although the poorly water soluble substance used in the present invention can be crystalline or amorphous, it is preferably crystalline. Hence, when the poorly water soluble substance is crystalline, the chemical stability and physical stability of the poorly water soluble substance are improved. Whether the poorly water soluble substance is crystalline or amorphous can be determined by the presence or absence of a diffraction peak in powder X-ray crystal diffraction. In the present invention, poorly water soluble substances can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0060">Although the molecular weight of the &#x201c;(ii) polyvinylpyrrolidone (hereinafter also abbreviated &#x201c;PVP&#x201d;) or a vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer (hereinafter also abbreviated &#x201c;PVP-PVAc&#x201d;)&#x201d; used in the present invention is not subject to limitation, one having a relatively low molecular weight is preferable, and the relative viscosity (25&#xb0; C.) is preferably not more than 5.195, more preferably not more than 1.281, and particularly preferably not more than 1.201. In the case of one having a higher relative viscosity (25&#xb0; C.), it can be used with the amount added thereof reduced. The PVP-PVAc can be a random copolymer or a block copolymer, and the copolymerization ratio of vinylpyrrolidone and vinyl acetate (vinylpyrrolidone:vinyl acetate) is not subject to limitation, but is preferably 99.99:0.01 to 2:8 (molar ratio), more preferably 99.99:0.01 to 5:5 (molar ratio).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0061">Specifically, as examples of PVP, &#x201c;Kollidon 90F&#x201d; (trade name), manufactured by BASF Takeda Vitamin K.K., (relative viscosity (25&#xb0; C.): 3.310 to 5.195), &#x201c;Kollidon 30&#x201d; (trade name) (relative viscosity (25&#xb0; C.): 1.201 to 1.281), &#x201c;Kollidon 25&#x201d; (trade name) (relative viscosity (25&#xb0; C.): 1.146 to 1.201) &#x201c;Kollidon 17PF&#x201d; (trade name) (relative viscosity (25&#xb0; C.): 1.430 to 1.596) &#x201c;Kollidon 12PF&#x201d; (trade name) (relative viscosity (25&#xb0; C.): 1.222 to 1.361) and the like can be mentioned. As examples of PVP-PVAc, &#x201c;Copovidone VA64&#x201d; (trade name), manufactured by BASF Takeda Vitamin K.K., (relative viscosity (25&#xb0; C.): 1.178 to 1.255) can be mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0062">&#x201c;Relative viscosity (25&#xb0; C.)&#x201d; as used herein is a value measured at a concentration of 1% (wt./vol) at 25&#xb0; C. using purified water as the solvent by the method described in USP and Ph. Eur. Monograph. However, the above-described relative viscosities (25&#xb0; C.) of &#x201c;Kollidon 17PF&#x201d; and &#x201c;Kollidon 12PF&#x201d; are measurements at a concentration of 5% (wt./vol).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0063">(iii) The auxiliary dispersion stabilizer used in the present invention can be used without limitation, as long as it is capable of improving the dispersion stability of a poorly water soluble substance. For example, nonionic surfactants (for example, polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, polyethylene glycol fatty acid esters, polyoxypropylene alkyl ethers, polypropylene glycol fatty acid esters, sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene hardened castor oil, polyglycerin fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene glycerin fatty acid esters, glycerin monofatty acid esters, alkyl polyglucoside, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene block polymers, alkanolamide and the like), ampholytic surfactants (betaine alkyldimethylaminoacetate, betaine amidopropyldimethylaminoacetate, amide amino-acid salts, alkyliminodiacetate and the like), anionic surfactants (for example, alkyl sulfate, alkyl ether sulfate, &#x3b1;-olefin sulfonate, acylmethyltaurate, acylglutamate, acylglycine salt, acylsarcosine salt, acylisethionate, alkyl ethercarboxylate, amide ether sulfate, alkylphosphate ester salt and the like), cationic surfactants (for example, alkyltrimethylammonium chloride, dialkyldimethylammonium chloride and the like), bile acid and salts thereof, soaps and fatty acids, and salts thereof, oils, glycerin fatty acid esters, enamine, chelating agents, phenothiazine, carnitine or peptide fatty acid derivatives, a substance selected from the group consisting of azone, concanavalin A, diethyl maleate and diethylethoxymethylene malonate, Maillard reaction products, and polymers (for example, block copolymers and biodegradable polymers, chitosan and chitosan derivatives) can be mentioned. Of these, surfactants, hydrophilic polymers, cyclodextrin derivatives, cholic acid derivatives and the like are preferable, and surfactants are particularly preferable. Of the surfactants, at least one selected from among anionic surfactants, cationic surfactants and nonionic surfactants is preferable, particularly preferably an anionic surfactant; of anionic surfactants, long-chain alkyl (preferably having a carbon number of 10 to 20) sulfate are preferable, and sodium lauryl sulfate is most preferable. The sodium lauryl sulfate mentioned herein is a single substance. In the present invention, auxiliary dispersion stabilizer can be used singly or in combination of two or more kinds.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0064">The composition of the present invention comprises at least (i) poorly water soluble substance and (ii) PVP or PVP-pvaC, wherein provided that (iii) an auxiliary dispersion stabilizer is not contained, the content ratio by weight of (i) poorly water soluble substance and (ii) PVP or PVP-PVAc [(i) poorly water soluble substance: (ii) PVP or PVP-PVAc] is preferably 99.99 to 85.0:0.01 to 15.0, more preferably 99.95 to 85.0:0.05 to 15.0.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0065">When the composition of the present invention is a composition further comprising (iii) an auxiliary dispersion stabilizer, along with (i) poorly water soluble substance and (ii) PVP or PVP-PVAc, the content ratio by weight of (i) the poorly water soluble substance, (ii) the PVP or PVP-PVAc, and (iii) the auxiliary dispersion stabilizer [(i) poorly water soluble substance: (ii) PVP or PVP-PVAc: (iii) auxiliary dispersion stabilizer] is preferably 99.98 to 80.0:0.01 to 15.0:0.01 to 5.0, more preferably 99.98 to 82.0:0.01 to 15.0:0.01 to 3.0.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0066">The composition of the present invention is prepared by taking a step for pulverizing (i) a poorly water soluble substance and (ii) PVP or PVP-PVAc in a liquid (hereinafter also referred to as &#x201c;wet pulverization&#x201d;), or by pulverizing (i) a poorly water soluble substance (ii) PVP or PVP-PVAc, and (iii) an auxiliary dispersion stabilizer in a liquid (step A). In the step A, the solid concentration of the poorly water soluble substance in the liquid is preferably 10 to 60% (wt/wt), more preferably 20 to 60% (wt/wt), most preferably 20 to 40% (wt/wt). Here, the solid concentration of the poorly water soluble substance is calculated by dividing the weight of the poorly water soluble substance contained in the suspension by the weight of the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0067">In the present invention, although the liquid used for the above-described wet pulverization is preferably water, organic solvents, oils, and heat-melted organic liquids (for example, molten liquid of wax and the like) can also be used, and the liquid can be a mixture prepared by mixing these organic liquids in water. Milling operation can be performed using a commonly known method of wet pulverization; for example, the method using a grinding container and pulverization ball, described in &#x201c;Chemical Pharmaceutical Bulletin, Vol. 41, pp. 737 to 740, 1993&#x201d;, the method using a high-pressure homogenizer, described in &#x201c;International Journal of Pharmaceutics, Vol. 196, pp. 161 to 164, 2000&#x201d;, a method using a media mill (for example, a method using a rod mill, a method using a roller mill and the like) and the like. The above-described method using a grinding container and pulverization ball is a method using what is called a method using a ball mill, classified as a method using a media mill. In the methods using a media mill, such as the method using a ball mill, impurity contamination of the composition obtained is of concern, whereas the high-pressure homogenizer produces extremely low levels of impurity contamination of the composition. Therefore, in case of drugs and foods, because impurity contamination of the composition obtained is unwanted, it is preferable, from the viewpoint of impurity contamination of the composition, to perform pulverization using a high-pressure homogenizer.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0068">In wet pulverization in the present invention, when a poorly water soluble substance having a low chemical stability is used, the chemical stabilizer can be added to pulverization formula. As examples of the chemical stabilizer, antioxidants such as citric acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, vitamin C sodium, erythorbic acid, and dibutylhydroxy toluene can be mentioned. If the chemical stability of the poorly water soluble substance can be improved by changing the pH of the liquid, pH regulators such as citric acid and sodium citrate can be mentioned. The amount of chemical stabilizer added is not subject to limitation, but when the composition is a drug, it is preferable that the amount of additive added per day should not exceed levels that have been used in actual clinical settings. If the levels are exceeded, safety must be confirmed. When a substance for use as is in clinical treatment, for example, vitamin C, is added for any purpose other than treatment, it is stated in the &#x201c;Guidelines for Manufacture of Drugs 2001&#x201d; (published by Jiho, Inc.) that the amount added is set at a level not more than &#x2155; of the minimum clinical dose, and this rule is followed in the present invention as well.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0069">Milling using a high-pressure homogenizer is preferably performed under conditions involving a pressure of not less than 500 bar and not more than 5000 bar exerted on the high-pressure homogenizer, more preferably under conditions involving a pressure of not less than 1000 bar and not more than 3000 bar exerted on the high-pressure homogenizer.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0070">When (i) poorly water soluble substance has a melting point of not less than 140&#xb0; C., it is preferable that the temperature of the composition just before flowing in the pulverization portion during operation of the high-pressure homogenizer be a temperature lower by not less than 100&#xb0; C. (preferably a temperature lower by not less than 110&#xb0; C.) than the melting point of (i) poorly water soluble substance. By doing so, the elasticity of the poorly water soluble substance can sometimes be nullified, a feature suitable for pulverization.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0071">When (i) poorly water soluble substance has a melting point of less than 140&#xb0; C., it is preferable that the temperature of the composition just before flowing in the pulverization portion during operation of the high-pressure homogenizer be not more than 40&#xb0; C. (preferably not more than 30&#xb0; C.). By doing so, the elasticity of the poorly water soluble substance can sometimes be nullified, a feature suitable for pulverization.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0072">The compound A used as the poorly water soluble substance in an Example below is crystalline and has crystalline polymorphs of type A (melting point: 119&#xb0; C.) and type B (melting point: 161&#xb0; C.). Provided that such a poorly water soluble substance exhibits crystalline polymorphism, the temperature of the composition just before flowing in the pulverization portion during operation of the high-pressure homogenizer must be determined with the melting point of the crystalline polymorph having the lowest melting point as the index.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0073">Hence, when (i) poorly water soluble substance has crystalline polymorphs, and the melting point of the crystalline polymorph having the lowest melting point is not less than 140&#xb0; C., it is preferable that the temperature of the composition just before flowing in the pulverization portion during operation of the high-pressure homogenizer be lower than the melting point of (i) poorly water soluble substance by not less than 100&#xb0; C. By doing so, the elasticity of the poorly water soluble substance can sometimes be nullified, a feature suitable for pulverization.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0074">When (i) poorly water soluble substance has crystalline polymorphs, and the melting point of the crystalline polymorph having the lowest melting point is less than 140&#xb0; C., it is preferable that the temperature of the composition just before flowing in the pulverization portion during operation of the high-pressure homogenizer be not more than 40&#xb0; C. By doing so, the elasticity of the poorly water soluble substance can sometimes be nullified, a feature suitable for pulverization.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0075">In the present invention, whether or not the poorly water soluble substance has crystalline polymorph can be determined by attempting various methods of crystallization under various conditions, and analyzing the thus-obtained crystal by X-ray diffraction analysis, thermal analysis, density analysis, solubility analysis, microscopic observation and the like, and the melting point of the poorly water soluble substance, and, when poorly water soluble substance has crystalline polymorphs, the melting point of the crystalline polymorph having the lowest melting point are measured by using a thermal analyzer, for example, a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0076">The composition of the present invention is prepared by pulverizing (i) poorly water soluble substance and (ii) PVP or PVP-PVAc in a liquid, or by pulverizing (i) poorly water soluble substance, (ii) PVP or PVP-PVAc, and (iii) an auxiliary dispersion stabilizer in a liquid, as described above, and is used as is in the form of the thus-obtained pulverized suspension wherein the composition of the present invention is dispersed, or is used in the form of a powdery solid composition prepared by powdering the thus-obtained pulverized suspension by spray drying, freeze drying, vacuum drying and the like. Hence, when a powdery solid composition is to be obtained, after a step for pulverizing (i) poorly water soluble substance and (ii) PVP or PVP-PVAc in a liquid, or pulverizing (i) poorly water soluble substance, (ii) PVP or PVP-PVAc, and (iii) an auxiliary dispersion stabilizer in a liquid (step A), a step for powdering the pulverized suspension obtained in the step A (step B) is performed. By powdering the pulverized suspension, a powder comprising (i) a poorly water soluble substance and (ii) polyvinylpyrrolidone or a vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, or a powder comprising (i) a poorly water soluble substance, (ii) polyvinylpyrrolidone or a vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer, and (iii) an auxiliary dispersion stabilizer is obtained, and the composition of the present invention is collected as a powder (solid composition). In powdering, if necessary, an anti-aggregation agent, an antistatic agent and the like can be added; as examples of the anti-aggregation agent, antisolidification agents such as talc, corn starch, hydrated silicone dioxide, Light Anhydrous Silicic Acid, and magnesium metasilicic aluminate, sugar alcohols such as lactose, mannitol (D-mannitol), and trehalose, and the like can be mentioned. As examples of the antistatic agent, talc, hydrated silicon dioxide, Light Anhydrous Silicic Acid and the like can be mentioned.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0077">In addition to the above-described spray drying, freeze drying, vacuum drying and the like, the above-described powdering can also be achieved by a method comprising suspending and dispersing a liquid composition in a heat-melted wax etc. to be used as the liquid in step A, solidifying the liquid composition by returning the temperature to normal temperature, and pulverizing the solid product. The above-described powdering can also be achieved by a method comprising adding a heat-melted wax and the like to a pulverized suspension obtained via the step A, solidifying the mixture by returning the temperature to normal temperature, and pulverizing the solid product.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0078">It is also possible to directly spraying the pulverized suspension obtained via the step A as a binder solution during spray drying, or during fluidized bed granulation, during tumbling fluidized granulation and during centrifugal tumbling granulation, to obtain a granulated powder. In this case, a binder can be newly added as required. The pulverized suspension can be added simply at the time of agitation granulation or extrusion granulation.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0079">The composition of the present invention has a median diameter of not more than 1 &#x3bc;m. The term median diameter generally refers to the particle diameter corresponding to the median (frequency 50%) of the integral distribution curve generated from the particle size distribution indicating the number of particles per particle size class, and, in the present invention, refers to the particle diameter of 50% frequency as measured using a laser diffraction/scattering particle size distribution analyzer (LA-920, Horiba Ltd.) (50% frequency particle diameter). The dispersion medium used for the measurement is usually water, but an aqueous solution of a substance other than the poorly water soluble substance contained in the composition and the like (for some purposes, buffer solutions at various pH levels, mimicked body fluid, 0.5% methylcellulose aqueous solution and the like) can also be used. The suspending concentration of the composition at the time of measurement is measured after dilution with the dispersion medium used for the measurement so that the transmittance of the light source will be 80 to 99% compared to blank determinations.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0080">The composition of the present invention preferably has a median diameter of not more than 0.8 &#x3bc;m, more preferably not more than 0.6 &#x3bc;m. Although the lower limit of the median diameter is not subject to limitation, the limit is generally preferably not less than 0.05 &#x3bc;m more preferably not less than 0.1 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0081">The composition of the present invention preferably has a 90% frequency particle diameter of not more than 2 &#x3bc;m, more preferably not more than 1 &#x3bc;m. &#x201c;90% frequency particle diameter&#x201d; is a particle diameter corresponding to the 90% frequency of the above-described integral distribution curve and, in the present invention, means the particle diameter of 90% frequency (90% frequency particle diameter) of the composition dispersed in a liquid, as measured using a laser diffraction/scattering particle size distribution analyzer (LA-920, Horiba Ltd.).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0082">Because the composition of the present invention has the above-described particular particle size characteristics, the solubility of the poorly water soluble substance generally remains unchanged, the dissolution speed of the poorly water soluble substance is improved, and hence the absorption of the poorly water soluble substance is improved and variation in absorption is suppressed. In the composition of the present invention, degree of crystallinity as calculated from measurements taken using a powder X-ray diffraction apparatus remains almost unchanged compared to that before wet pulverization. However, depending on the properties of the poorly water soluble substance, the crystalline form sometimes changes after wet pulverization, and degree of crystallinity sometimes rises after wet pulverization.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0083">Because the composition of the present invention has the above-described particular particle size characteristics, the dissolution rate of the poorly water soluble substance at 37&#xb0; C. is accelerated not less than 2 times, preferably not less than 5 times, compared to conventional. The elution rate of the poorly water soluble substance is measured by the dissolution test method described below.</p>

    <li id="ul0002-0006" num="0089">6) Test environment: When the light stability of the poorly water soluble substance is low, the test is started in a shaded room, or in a room in the absence of light sources other than light sources deprived of particular wavelengths that influence the light stability, for example, in a room in the absence of light sources other than sodium lamps, after which 5 mL of test fluid is collected at specified time intervals using a syringe filter (manufactured by Nihon Pall Ltd., Acrodisc LC25, PVDF, pore diameter 0.2 um), the filtrate deprived of the first 3 mL is used as the sample solution. The concentration of the poorly water soluble substance in this sample solution is measured, and the dissolution rate is calculated. From the dissolution rate thus obtained, the dissolution speed is calculated by, for example, comparing times taken to reach a dissolution rate of not less than 85%.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0090">The increase in the dissolution speed of the poorly water soluble substance in the present invention is attributable to an increase in surface area per unit weight of the poorly water soluble substance due to micronization, and, in the case of a water-repelling poorly water soluble substance, is also attributable to an improvement in wettability.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0091">In the present invention, an improvement in the absorption of a poorly water soluble substance refers to an improvement in the absorption rate of the poorly water soluble substance or an improvement in the absorption amount of poorly water soluble substance; as indexes thereof, Cmax and AUC as mentioned in pharmacokinetics, respectively, can be mentioned. Cmax refers to the time to reach the maximum plasma concentration after administration; AUC refers to the area under the plasma concentration-time curve. Specifically, in the composition of the present invention, each of the Cmax and AUC of the poorly water soluble substance is improved not less than 2 times, preferably not less than 5 times, compared to conventional compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0092">The composition of the present invention is used as a drug, quasi-drug or food material in the form of the pulverized suspension after the aforementioned wet pulverization as is (that is, the suspension wherein the composition is dispersed in a liquid), or after being powdered from the pulverized suspension. Also, a powder obtained by powdering the pulverized suspension (solid composition) can be used as is, and can be used as a mixed powder prepared by adding a pharmaceutically acceptable appropriate excipient and the like. Although the powder or mixed powder thus obtained can be orally administered as is, it can be prepared as various forms of solid preparations commonly known as preparations for oral administration, that is, tablets, powders, granules, capsules and the like by a conventional method. The pulverized suspension can be used as is in the form of a liquid, and in the form of a capsular preparation filled in capsules, thus offering the advantage of reducing the number of steps for preparation making. By using a wax heat-melted in a liquid (dispersion medium) for pulverized suspensions, the composition of the present invention can also be prepared as a solid preparation integrally formed in a single process.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0093">To obtain tablets or granules, the composition of the present invention can be prepared as film-coated tablets, film-coated granules and the like. The solid preparation can be given a sustained-release quality by conferring an appropriate release control function (prepared as a sustained release preparation). For example, the solid preparation is applicable to water soluble or wax matrix tablets, release control membrane coated granules or tablets, and dry coated tablets having a release control function.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0094">The composition of the present invention is particularly suitable for assuring a long span of absorption required for sustained-release preparations. Hence, particularly, because a poorly water soluble substance is likely to lose the amount dissolved and have decreased absorption in the lower gastrointestinal tract, in which the water content is smaller than in the upper gastrointestinal tract, the composition of the present invention is effective in preparing the poorly water soluble substance as a sustained-release preparation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0095">When a solid preparation is obtained using the composition of the present invention, in addition to excipients, lubricants, binders, surfactants, disintegrants, coating agents and the like can be contained as required; when a liquid preparation is obtained, solvents, isotonizing agents, buffering agents, soothing agents and the like can be contained. Pharmaceutical preparation additives such as antiseptics, antioxidants, coloring agents, and taste correctives can also be contained as required.</p>

<p id="p-0062" num="0103">Because the poorly water soluble substance in the composition of the present invention is micronized to exhibit good absorption, the use of the composition of the present invention makes it possible to realize a composition as effective as a conventional composition comprising the same poorly water soluble substance while reducing the amount of poorly water soluble substance contained in the composition compared to the conventional composition comprising the same poorly water soluble substance. Therefore, the composition of the present invention can also be prepared as a small, easily ingestible dosage form.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0104">In the present invention, it is preferable that wet pulverization of a composition prepared by blending a poorly water soluble substance with polyvinylpyrrolidone or a vinylpyrrolidone-vinyl acetate copolymer be performed using a high-pressure homogenizer, but the aforementioned preferable content ratios in the composition of the present invention are of course applied to any other method of wet pulverization that the wet pulverization using a high-pressure homogenizer. This is because the pulverizer pulverizes a poorly water soluble substance into microparticles while providing energy, and the substance added as the dispersion stabilizer or both the substance added as the dispersion stabilizer and the substance added as the auxiliary dispersion stabilizer serve to suppress the aggregation of the poorly water soluble substance micronized in a liquid. Usually, if no appropriate dispersion stabilizer is added, the poorly water soluble substance pulverized by the pulverizer rapidly gets aggregated and is substantially unmicronizable.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0105">In the present invention, the anti-aggregation performance of the poorly water soluble substance in liquid by content ratio of the composition can be evaluated by pulverization using a simple pulverizer (mechanical mixer), for example, ball mill and the like.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0165">From Table 1, it is appreciated that the degree of crystallinity of each substance decreased somewhat after pulverization, but the turbulent factor increased simultaneously. The turbulent factor indicates that the molecules move about during X-ray measurement and that the diffraction intensity decreases. Considering that the below-mentioned solubility and fusion enthalpy are almost unchanged before and after pulverization, the above-mentioned certain decrease in the degree of crystallinity is considered to be attributable to a decrease in the diffraction intensity due to micronization, and the actual degree of crystallinity is considered to have hardly changed.</p>

<p id="p-0140" num="0194">The pulverized suspensions obtained in Reference Examples 1, 2 and Example 17 in a dose of 100 mg as nifedipine were administered p.o. to 6 male beagle dogs under fasting. After 30 min, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 24 hr from the administration, the blood was sampled from the Cephalic vein of the forefoot using an injection syringe equipped with a heparin-treated 23 gauge injection needle. After centrifugal fractionation, nifedipine concentration in the plasma component was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) was calculated by the trapezoid method and used as an index of absorption amount. In addition, dispersion in the areas under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of individual dogs was calculated as a coefficient of variation (C.V. value). The results are shown in the following Table 6.</p>
