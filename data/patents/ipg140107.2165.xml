<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention is a Continuation-In-Part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/653,447 filed Dec. 14, 2009, by the same inventors of the subject invention.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to the field of hunting game animals, and more specifically to animal attractant compositions, devices, systems and methods to attract game animals by stimulating several of the animal's senses.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the past, science has discovered that some animals possess vision capable of detecting light both in the visible spectrum (&#x2dc;400 to &#x2dc;700 nanometers wavelength) and the near ultraviolet (&#x2dc;200 to &#x2dc;400 nanometers wavelength). The evolutionary advantages afforded by this ability are varied. Many fruits, flowers, and seeds are more prominent when viewed in ultraviolet light as compared with normal visible wavelengths. Insects use ultraviolet emissions from stars and the moon to aid in flight navigation. The blood and urine of some animals is easily detected using ultraviolet light.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various fabric dyes have been found to &#x201c;glow&#x201d; when viewed with ultraviolet light and are undesirable in hunting applications. Clothing treated with such dyes, including clothing that appears camouflaged when viewed in visible light, has been found to be unsuitable for hunters. Hunters wearing such clothing appears as a bright, moving beacon to game animals. Calling attention to oneself in such a manner often frightens game animals causing them to flee from the hunter.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Common household laundry detergents have often included ultraviolet brighteners designed to give clothes a whiter appearance upon washing. While a whiter appearance can be considered a positive selling point for the average consumer, for the hunter seeking to blend into the forest, using such products only compounds the problem of camouflage. An entire industry has developed to produce fabric dyes and detergents that are themselves not visible in ultraviolet light or mute ultraviolet signatures in existing products.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">While all the aforementioned prior art seeks to avoid detection by animals capable of seeing ultraviolet light, there is little in the prior art directed towards using an animal's ability to see ultraviolet light as an attractant.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Published Patent Application 2007/0199228 to Johnson (formerly U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/711,409) describes a decoy with a surface reflection that closely matches the spectral reflectance of the animal it is designed to mimic, including both human-visible and ultraviolet wavelengths in order to make the decoy appear more realistic to the target animals.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, this reference is limited in scope insofar as it only teaches the use of ultraviolet reflectance for lifelike mimicry. The prior art publication is silent about the use of ultraviolet reflectance in combination with other attractant methods or the use of ultraviolet brighteners to render an object &#x201c;super bright&#x201d; as an animal attractant.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Thus, the need exists for solutions to the above problems with the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A primary objective of the present invention is to provide animal attractant compositions, devices, systems and methods to attract game animals by stimulating several of the animal's senses.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The novel invention includes deployable animal attractant compositions, devices, systems and methods that can be used to attract animals to a desired location using a combination of ultraviolet brighteners for visual interest and one or more of scent, salt, and motion. The invention can capitalize on the link between many animals' ability to see ultraviolet light with their desire to visualize urine territory markers left by other animals of the same species.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the presently preferred embodiments which are illustrated schematically in the accompanying drawings.</p>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="tail"?>
<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Before explaining the disclosed embodiments of the present invention in detail it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its applications to the details of the particular arrangements shown since the invention is capable of other embodiments. Also, the terminology used herein is for the purpose of description and not of limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention can include a base substrate, an ultraviolet brightener, and, optionally, one or more additional attractants such as animal scent, salt, and motion.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The base substrate can be fashioned into any geometry, but most advantageously such a geometry should not approximate naturally occurring shapes such as animals or plants. One such preferred geometry can include an elongated, flat, rectangular plate roughly the size and shape of a common paint stirring stick. Another geometry can be an irregular, unnatural shape such as several cojoined circular disks. These and other geometries when hung from a tree branch by a lanyard, can flutter and move in the breeze in a manner that piques an animal's curiosity with pleasing, natural motion while not appearing threatening. A nonthreatening yet unnatural looking object draws visual attention from far away.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The base substrate can be composed of, but not limited to, thermoplastics, thermosets, wood, and metal. Thermoplastics are preferred for their easy manipulation plus the ability to incorporate additives, such as pigments and ultraviolet brighteners into the molten plastic instead of applying them as a surface treatment. The substrate can be fashioned by physical methods common in the art such as molding of molten materials or machining from rough stock.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment, the base substrate can be fabricated from a brightly-colored material to make it visible from great distances by a human observer or hunter. The substrate also incorporates an ultraviolet brightener, defined as a pigment, dye, or surface treatment that renders the base substrate brightly visible in near ultraviolet light (&#x2dc;200 to &#x2dc;400 nanometer wavelength). This can be a key feature of the invention. One such commercially available optical brightener can include but is not limited to 2,2&#x2032;-(2,5-thiophenediyl) bis (5-tert-butylbenzoxazole), trade named Benetex&#xae; OB (CAS #7128-64-5) and manufactured by Mayzo Corporation.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In the preferred embodiment, the base substrate can be fabricated from a flexible, porous ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymer that can be charged with a natural or synthetic animal scent attractant. The scent attractant can include, but is not limited to, any combination of animal attractant oil secretion, musk, urine, pheromone, preorbital gland secretion, and a proprietary synthetic attractant.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In one embodiment, the scent attractant can be packaged separately from the base substrate. Just prior to deployment, the scent attractant can include a liquid, aerosol, or semi-solid, and can be applied to the outer surface of the base substrate. The At periodic intervals (daily, weekly, etc.), the base substrate can be recharged with the scent material.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Many wild animals also crave salt. The base substrate of the present invention can be impregnated or coated with crystalline salt, typically sodium chloride, as a way of enticing wild animals to repeatedly return to the invention. While scents may attract animals once, their dietary need for salt will condition them to return regularly.</p>

Liquid Deer Scent can include deer urine based scents including but not limited to doe urine, buck urine, mixed urine, doe-in-heat urine, doe-in-estrus urine, rutting buck, and the like. RuttingBuck can include urine collected from genetically superior breeding bucks. This urine, which contains a high concentration of testosterone, attracts dominant bucks.
</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Liquid UV Brightener can include UV tracer dyes or UV dyes. For our test subject we used UV tracer dyes from Risk Reactor of Santa Ana, Calif. Other companies make tracer dyes and dyes also that can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">We found that the Liquid UV Brightener should be added to the Liquid Deer scent and mixed as the UV brightener is introduced. Room temperature seems to work best. Once the deer scent and liquid UV brightener were mixed in correct amounts the deer scent would &#x201c;fluoresce&#x201d; when exposed to black or UV light. In consumer use the consumer will need to agitate, stir or shake the mixture to ensure proper mixing. The mixture should be stored in a dark tinted bottle to prevent breakdown of the UV enhancers.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Liquid (Aqueous) Food Attractant Scent can include any scent that attracts game animals in particular deer. Examples would be scents such as liquid mixtures of edible foods, such as mixing ground up versions of edible foods into water, and the like. The edible foods can be selected from at least one of: acorn, corn, beets, apples, pears, persimmons, clovers, grasses, grains, and the like. There is a wide variety of liquid scent used to attract deer.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Liquid UV Brightener can include UV tracer dyes or UV dyes. For our test subject we used UV tracer dyes from Risk Reactor, as well as several other companies make tracer dyes and dyes also.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">We found that the Liquid UV Brightener should be added to the Liquid Food scent and mixed as the UV brightener is introduced. Room temperature seems to work best. Once the food scent and liquid UV brightener are mixed in correct amounts the deer scent would &#x201c;fluoresce&#x201d; under black or UV light. In consumer use the consumer will need to agitate, stir or shake the mixture to ensure proper mixing. The mixture should be stored in a dark tinted bottle to prevent breakdown of the UV enhancers.</p>
