<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to provisional application 61/365,400, filed Jul. 19, 2010.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention pertains to the art of tools for removing a film layer or coating from a printed matter such as a lottery ticket or game piece.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The tool is a small hard-surfaced too used to remove the top layer of film of coating off of printed matter to reveal info printed underneath the film coating. For example, a coupon or an ad campaign that offers a prize or other important information that is prized underneath a film coating and once the film is scratched off the prize of info is then revealed to the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The tool shape may circular, semicircular or any other shape that can be easily held in order to position it in way so that the film can easily be scratched off to reveal the printed information.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The tool may be made from any hard surfaced material such as metal that can be shaped or molded into the required size and that will provide a hard edge to easily and safely remove film coating. Materials that can be used could be aluminum, silver, steel, gold, tin, copper as well as plastic or wood. The design of the tool will be a small circular disk with an attached handle; sandwiched between or otherwise embedded on top of the handle will be a small brush that can be used for removing film shaving residue.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The tool would be marketed with several options to the consumer. The possibility that the tool may be made from a variety of metals either together in the product or as a separate metal choice that would depend on the most economical way to produce the tool or there may also be an option to produce the tool from a metal that may provide better longevity therefore this would be a metal option that would not be cost driven. Again, the tool may be bought and cold with or without an accompanying cleanup bag.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The tool could be marketed and cold but not limited to as a point of purchase from catering to the many vendors who sell lottery scratch off games as well as useful household or office tool that can be utilized in the home or office to remove the film from mail, magazine promotions and a hose of advertising campaigns that use the scratch off method as a way of communicating to the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The advantage of the tool is that there is a definite need for this type of easy to use film removing tool. Currently, there is no such tool available although the need is clearly there based on the amount of consumer products that are crated using film coating technology as a way of connecting to the consumer as is evident by the widespread advertising campaigns that use this method as well as high volume of scratch off games of chance that are bought by a huge and diverse cross-section of consumers.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The tool has a body (<b>10</b>) having at one end thereof a circular disk-shaped portion (<b>12</b>) and extending from the disk is an elongate handle member (<b>14</b>). The edge surface of the disk member (<b>12</b>) in use acting as a scraper for removing the film or coating from the printed matter such as a lottery ticket. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, it is shown that the body (<b>10</b>) is formed by similarly-shaped body portions (<b>10</b>A,<b>10</b>B) that are secured to define the assembled body (<b>10</b>). At the end of the handle member (<b>14</b>) and between the pair of body portions (<b>10</b>A,<b>10</b>B) is a brush portion (<b>16</b>) sandwiched or otherwise embedded at the top of the handle portion. The brush portion being provided for removing film shaving residue.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">There is also provided a loop (<b>18</b>) on one side of the handle that will allow the tool to be hooked onto a key chain, wallet or any other linking device that us suitable for the tool without making it too cumbersome for the consumer.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, there is provided a patch of hook/loop material (<b>20</b>) on a back side of the tool that will allow for a small easy to use cleanup bag to be attached to it. A cleanup bag may or may not be sold with the tool; however, the backside hook/loop will make it easy for the consumer to always have a cleanup bag handy for easy and quick cleanup and for the disposal of film shaving residue.</p>
