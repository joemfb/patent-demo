<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to electrical power lines and, more particularly, to cable termination systems for electrical power lines.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electrical cables often must be terminated or joined in various environments, such as underground or overhead. Such cables may be, for example, high voltage electrical distribution or transmission lines. In order to form such connections, a connector may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In-line isolation devices such as in-line disconnect switches are commonly employed in electrical power transmission lines where it is desired to permanently or selectively isolate a power line such as an overhead power line. Known isolation devices include a pair of end pieces (which may be referred to as dead ends) connected by an elongate insulator. The end pieces are each clamped to a power line using wedge connectors. The power line is then cut between the end pieces so that the isolation device mechanically couples and electrically isolates the two ends of the power line. Examples of devices of this type are disclosed in Canadian Patent No. 2,092,741, U.S. Pat. No. 5,581,051 to Hill, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,942,723 to Laricchia.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to embodiments of the present invention, a conductor termination system for use with an electrical power transmission conductor includes a termination assembly and a connector. The termination assembly includes an end member and an integral retainer mechanism. The end member includes a receiver portion configured to receive a segment of the conductor. The retainer mechanism includes a moveable keeper member on the end member. The retainer mechanism is operable to selectively clamp a segment of the conductor in the receiver portion to the end member and to apply a retention load to the conductor segment. The connector is adapted to be applied to the end member and the conductor to securely clamp the conductor segment to the end member.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In some embodiments, the receiver portion has a longitudinal axis and is configured to laterally receive the conductor segment to extend along the longitudinal axis and the retainer mechanism is selectively alternatively positionable in each of: an open position, wherein the keeper member is positioned such that the receiver portion is open to laterally receive the conductor segment; and a clamping position wherein the keeper member is positioned to prevent removal of the conductor segment laterally from the receiver portion and to apply a clamping load to the conductor segment to resist axial displacement of the conductor segment with respect to the receiver portion.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The retainer mechanism may be further selectively alternatively positionable in a closed position, wherein the keeper member is positioned to retain the conductor segment and to prevent removal of the conductor segment laterally from the receiver portion while permitting axial displacement of the conductor segment with respect to the receiver portion.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, the keeper member is pivotable about a pivot axis and across the receiver portion between the open and clamping positions. According to some embodiments, the retainer mechanism includes a latch member on a side of the receiver portion opposite the pivot axis, and the keeper member is anchored by the latch member when in the clamping position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In some embodiments, the latch member includes a latch bolt, the retainer mechanism further includes a pivot bolt about which the keeper member pivots about the pivot axis between the open and clamping positions, and the keeper member can be clamped onto the conductor segment by tightening the latch bolt and the pivot bolt.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The keeper member may include an engagement portion configured to substantially conform to and transfer the clamping load to the conductor segment.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to some embodiments, the connector comprises a wedge connector adapted to be force-applied to the end member and the conductor, the wedge connector including a sleeve member defining a sleeve cavity, and a wedge member configured to be forcibly inserted into the sleeve cavity to capture the conductor segment and the end member therebetween such that the wedge connector inhibits axial movement of the wedge connector, the conductor segment and the end member.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In some embodiments, the conductor termination system is an isolating apparatus further including an elongate insulator having opposed first and second insulator ends, a second termination assembly, and a second connector. The second termination assembly includes a second end member and a second integral retainer mechanism. The second end member includes a second receiver portion configured to receive a second segment of the conductor. The second integral retainer mechanism includes a second moveable keeper member on the second end member. The second keeper member is operable to selectively clamp the second conductor segment in the receiver portion to the end member and to apply a retention load to the conductor. The second connector is adapted to be applied to the second end member and the second conductor segment to securely clamp the second conductor segment to the second end member. The first insulator end is secured to the first end member and the second insulator end is secured to the second end member.</p>

No. 5,942,723 to Laricchia and/or U.S. Published Patent No. 2007/0240301 (Johnston et al.), for example, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-11</figref>, according to embodiments of the present invention, the cable termination system <b>10</b> may be used as follows to form the in-line isolation assembly <b>5</b>. The power line <b>16</b> may be an aerial power transmission line, for example. The installation may be executed in whole or in part using hot sticks and/or electrically insulating gloves with the installer working from the ground or a raised platform.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The retainer mechanisms <b>160</b> are placed in their open positions as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 7</figref> with the keeper bars <b>170</b> positioned out of the way of the conductor grooves <b>126</b>, <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With the keeper bars <b>170</b> in the open position, the isolating apparatus <b>100</b> is laid on the power line <b>16</b> with the grooves <b>126</b>, <b>136</b> facing downwardly and such that conductor segments <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> of the power line <b>16</b> extend through the conductor grooves <b>126</b>, <b>136</b>, respectively, and between the end members <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>. The conductor segments <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are thereby received laterally into the grooves <b>126</b>, <b>136</b> (i.e., in the direction I of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The keeper bars <b>170</b> are then moved (e.g., by hand or using hotsticks) to their closed positions as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> so that they capture the conductor segments <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> in the grooves <b>126</b>, <b>136</b>. According to some embodiments, each keeper bar <b>170</b> must be pulled up (direction U of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) against the load of the spring <b>183</b> in order to permit the keeper bar <b>170</b> to clear the post <b>166</b> and pivot into engagement with the latch bolt <b>184</b>. The keeper bars <b>170</b> can be released after the slot <b>174</b>A is positioned about the latch bolt <b>184</b>. The pressure head <b>176</b> may then seat on the conductor in the corresponding conductor groove <b>124</b>, <b>134</b> to prevent the keeper bar <b>170</b> from pivoting back into the open position.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With the keeper bars <b>170</b> in the closed position, the conductor segments <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> cannot be removed laterally (i.e., in a direction E (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>)) with respect to the longitudinal axis C-C) from the conductor grooves <b>126</b>, <b>136</b>. However, because the keeper bars <b>160</b> are not yet loaded onto the conductor segments <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> or are only loaded by the relatively weak pivot bolt spring <b>183</b>, the conductor segments <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> can still be easily rotated and axially displaced with respect to the conductor grooves <b>126</b>, <b>136</b>. The isolating apparatus <b>100</b> is then rotated 180 degrees about the power line <b>16</b> to the upright position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The wedge clamps <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are then installed about the conductor segments <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and each coupling rod <b>124</b>, <b>134</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The wedge clamps <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be installed using a powder-actuated impact tool, for example. Suitable powder actuated impact tools include the AMPACT&#x2122; tool sold by Tyco Electronics Corporation of Pennsylvania. According to some embodiments, the powder actuated impact tool may be constructed and operated as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,851,262 to Gregory et al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">With the conductor segments <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> secured to the coupling rods <b>124</b> and <b>134</b>, respectively, by the wedge connectors <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, the retainer mechanisms <b>160</b> are each placed in their clamping position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> by tightening down each of the pivot bolts <b>180</b> and the latch bolts <b>184</b>. This may be accomplished by rotatively driving the bolt heads <b>180</b>B, <b>184</b>B and/or the nuts <b>182</b>, <b>186</b> using a suitable driver tool, for example. The opposed end portions of each keeper bar <b>170</b> are thereby pulled inwardly, drawing the pressure head <b>176</b> thereof (cantilevered from each side) toward the corresponding conductor segment <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this manner, each conductor segment <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> is forcibly clamped between the adjacent coupling rod <b>124</b>, <b>134</b> and the corresponding pressure head <b>176</b>. The compressively loaded keeper bars <b>170</b> can thereby resist, prevent or inhibit axial movement of the associated conductor segments <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> in the cable grooves <b>126</b>, <b>136</b>. It will be appreciated that the clamping force of the loaded keeper bars <b>170</b> alone may not be sufficient to prevent axial movement of the conductors, but rather the loaded keeper bars <b>170</b> may enhance the pull out resistance provided by the wedge connectors <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. According to some embodiments, each bolt <b>180</b>, <b>184</b> is driven to a torque in a prescribed range to provide a clamp force or load on the conductor segment <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> in a prescribed range.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The power line <b>16</b> can then be cut between the end members <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> to divide the power line <b>16</b> into two separate conductor segments or conductors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. The conductors <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> are securely coupled to the end member <b>120</b> and the end member <b>130</b>, respectively, by both the wedge connectors <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and the retainer mechanisms <b>160</b> so that the tension from the power line <b>16</b> is now applied to the isolating apparatus <b>100</b>. The cut conductor ends <b>12</b>A, <b>14</b>A can then be bent away from one another as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> to electrically isolate the conductors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> from one another and/or a section of the power line <b>16</b> between the end members <b>120</b>, <b>130</b> can be cut out and removed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">When it is desired to electrically connect the conductors <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, the blade member <b>142</b> can be pivoted into the closed position to electrically connect the end members <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>. The blade member <b>142</b> can be securely and releasably retained in the closed position by the latch mechanism <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When it is desired to electrically isolate or disconnect the cables <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, the blade member <b>142</b> can be pivoted into its open position. The lockout mechanism <b>148</b> can be used to securely and releasably retain the blade member <b>142</b> in its open position.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The in-line isolation assembly <b>5</b> and, more particularly, the termination assemblies <b>121</b>, <b>131</b> in cooperation with the wedge connectors <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> can provide significant advantages in installation and service. The retainer mechanisms <b>160</b> serve as load bearing mechanical clamps in the final assembly and provide an additional clamping force on the conductor segments <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> in the conductor grooves <b>126</b>, <b>136</b>. As a result, the pullout force required to axially withdraw the conductor segment from the coupling rod <b>124</b>, <b>134</b> is increased. The retainer mechanisms <b>160</b> can thus provide more secure, robust and reliable connections between the conductor segments <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and the end members <b>120</b>, <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to further embodiments of the present invention, the isolating apparatus <b>100</b> can be provided without the blade mechanism <b>140</b> and/or the lockout mechanism <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">While the insulating apparatus <b>100</b> has been described herein installed on segments <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> of a power line <b>10</b>, according to some embodiments, the insulating apparatus <b>100</b> may be installed on each of a cable and a dead end post, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">While the cable termination system <b>10</b> has been described above in terms of an in-line isolation apparatus <b>100</b>, according to other embodiments, the connector unit may be a dead end or other termination assembly adapted to be secured directly or indirectly to a wall or post, for example. In this case, the connector unit may include only the termination assembly <b>121</b> (with the end member <b>120</b> suitably configured to couple to the desired bracket or the like) and may be used with the wedge connector <b>22</b> only.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">According to further embodiments, an in-line isolation apparatus as disclosed herein may be used without one or both of the wedge connectors <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> or with supplemental connectors of other types.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The foregoing is illustrative of the present invention and is not to be construed as limiting thereof. Although a few exemplary embodiments of this invention have been described, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that many modifications are possible in the exemplary embodiments without materially departing from the novel teachings and advantages of this invention. Accordingly, all such modifications are intended to be included within the scope of this invention. Therefore, it is to be understood that the foregoing is illustrative of the present invention and is not to be construed as limited to the specific embodiments disclosed, and that modifications to the disclosed embodiments, as well as other embodiments, are intended to be included within the scope of the invention.</p>
