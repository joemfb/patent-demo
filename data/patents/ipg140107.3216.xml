No. 12/902,761, filed Oct. 12, 2012, and claims priority from and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2010-35789, filed on Apr. 19, 2010, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a display substrate and a method of manufacturing the display substrate. More particularly, exemplary embodiments of the present invention relate to a display substrate that may be manufactured by a simplified manufacturing process and may have an enhanced reliability, and a method of manufacturing the is display substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, a liquid crystal display (&#x201c;LCD&#x201d;) device includes a display substrate (i.e., a thin-film transistor (&#x201c;TFT&#x201d;) substrate), an opposition substrate (or a counter substrate), and a liquid crystal layer disposed between the display substrate and the opposition substrate. The display substrate includes a gate line and a data line crossing the gate line. In addition, the display substrate includes a switching element connected to the gate line and the source line, and a pixel electrode connected to the switching element. The switching element includes a gate electrode, a semiconductor pattern, a source electrode and a drain electrode. The gate electrode is connected to the gate line, and the semiconductor pattern is overlapped with and insulated from the gate electrode. The source electrode is connected to the data line, electrically isolated from the gate electrode, and electrically connected to the semiconductor pattern. The drain electrode is spaced apart from the source electrode to be electrically connected to the semiconductor pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to manufacture a display substrate, a plurality of masks is used. For example, a first mask for forming the gate line and the gate electrode, a second mask for forming the semiconductor pattern, a third mask for forming the data line, the source electrode and the drain electrode, a fourth mask for forming a contact hole exposing the drain electrode and a fifth mask for forming the pixel electrode are used to manufacture the display substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Recently, in order to reduce time and costs associated with manufacturing, a manufacturing process reducing a number of masks has been developed to simplify a masking process. For example, a four-masking process has been developed in which a semiconductor pattern, a data line, a source electrode and a drain electrode are formed using only one mask. However, in the four-masking process, the semiconductor pattern is formed below the data line. The semiconductor pattern formed below the data line may generate display defects such as a waterfall.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When the number of the masks is increased, element characteristics and driving reliability of the display substrate may be enhanced. However, manufacturing costs and manufacturing time of the display substrate are increased.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The above information disclosed in this Background section is only for enhancement of understanding of the background of the invention and, therefore, it may contain information that does not form any part of the prior art nor what the prior art may suggest to a person of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention provide a display substrate that may be manufactured by a simplified manufacturing process and may have an enhanced reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention also provide a method of manufacturing the above-mentioned display substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additional features of the invention will be set forth in the description which follows, and in part will be apparent from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention discloses a display substrate including a gate line, a gate insulation layer, a data line, a switching element, a protection insulation layer, a gate pad portion and a data pad portion. The gate line is extended in a first direction on a substrate. The gate insulation layer is disposed on the gate line. The data line is extended in a second direction crossing the first direction.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The present invention is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the present invention are shown. The present invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these exemplary embodiments are provided so that this disclosure is thorough, and will fully convey the scope of the present invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the sizes and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it can be directly on, connected to or coupled to the other element or layer, or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. Like numerals refer to like elements throughout. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another element, component, region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular example embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the present invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Exemplary embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized exemplary embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, exemplary embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be explained in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a plan view showing a display substrate according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross-sectional view taken along line I-I&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the display substrate <b>100</b> includes a gate line GL, a gate pad portion GP, a data line DL, a data pad portion DP, a switching element TR, a storage line STL and a pixel electrode PE.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The gate line GL is disposed on a substrate <b>101</b> to be extended in a first direction D<b>1</b>. The gate lines GL are arranged in a second direction D<b>2</b> crossing the first direction D<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The gate pad portion GP is formed at an end portion of the gate line GL to receive an electric signal which will be applied to the gate line GL. For example, the gate pad portion GP includes an end portion <b>111</b> of the gate line GL, a first gate pad electrode <b>163</b> and a second gate pad electrode <b>193</b>. The first gate pad electrode <b>163</b> makes contact with the end portion <b>111</b> through a hole formed through a gate insulation layer <b>130</b>. The second gate pad electrode <b>193</b> makes contact with the first gate pad electrode <b>163</b> through a hole formed through a protection insulation layer <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The data line DL is disposed on the substrate <b>101</b> to be extended in the second is direction D<b>2</b>. The data lines DL are arranged in the first direction D<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The data pad portion DP is formed at an end portion of the data line DL to receive an electric signal which will be applied to the data line DL. For example, the data pad portion DP includes an end portion <b>161</b> of the data line DL and a data pad electrode <b>195</b> electrically connected to the end portion <b>161</b> through a hole formed through the protection insulation layer <b>180</b>. The data pad portion DP may further include a dummy pattern <b>113</b> to compensate for a stepped difference between the gate pad portion GP and the data pad portion DP. The dummy pattern <b>113</b> is electrically floated.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The switching element TR is electrically connected to the gate line GL, the data line DL and the pixel electrode PE to include a gate electrode GE, a semiconductor pattern <b>141</b>, an etching prevention pattern <b>155</b>, a source electrode SE and a drain electrode DE. The gate electrode GE is connected to the gate line GL, and the semiconductor pattern <b>141</b> is overlapped with the gate electrode GE. The semiconductor pattern <b>141</b> may include an oxide semiconductor material. The etching prevention pattern <b>155</b> is disposed on the semiconductor pattern <b>141</b> corresponding to a channel area of the switching element TR. The source electrode SE is overlapped with a first end portion of the semiconductor pattern <b>141</b>, and the drain electrode DE is overlapped with a second end portion of the semiconductor pattern <b>141</b> to be spaced apart from the source electrode SE by interposing the etching prevention pattern <b>155</b> therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The storage line STL is disposed on the substrate <b>101</b>. The storage line STL is extended in the first direction D<b>1</b> to be parallel with the gate line GL. The storage lines STL are arranged in the second direction D<b>2</b>. The storage line STL is electrically connected to a storage capacitor CST. For example, the storage capacitor CST includes a storage line STL, a gate insulation layer <b>130</b>, which covers the storage line STL, and a storage electrode STE, which overlaps with the storage line STL and is disposed on the gate insulation layer <b>130</b>. The storage electrode STE is electrically connected to the pixel electrode PE through a hole formed through the protection insulation layer <b>180</b>. The storage line STL receives a common voltage, and the storage electrode STL is electrically connected to the pixel electrode PE to receive a pixel voltage applied to the pixel electrode PE.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The pixel electrode PE is electrically connected to the switching element TR. For example, the pixel electrode PE is electrically connected to the storage electrode STE extended from the drain electrode DE, so that the pixel electrode PE may be electrically connected to the switching element TR.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to the present exemplary embodiment, the data line DL makes contact directly with the gate insulation layer <b>130</b>. That is, the semiconductor pattern <b>141</b> of the switching element TR makes contact with the source and drain electrodes SE and DE of the switching element TR; however, the semiconductor pattern <b>141</b> is not disposed below the data line DL. Thus, the semiconductor pattern is not formed between the data line DL and the gate insulation layer <b>130</b>, so that display defects such as a waterfall may be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view showing a first mask for manufacturing the display substrate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref> are cross-sectional views explaining a method of manufacturing the display substrate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by using the first mask of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the first mask <b>410</b> is a mask for patterning a positive photoresist to include a light-blocking portion <b>411</b>, a slit portion <b>413</b> and a light-transmitting portion <b>415</b>. The light-blocking portion <b>411</b> is an area in which light is blocked, the slit portion <b>413</b> is an area in which light is diffracted, and the light-transmitting portion <b>415</b> is an area in which light is transmitted. Thus, the light-blocking portion <b>411</b> and the slit portion <b>413</b> are formed in correspondence with an area where a pattern is formed on the substrate <b>101</b>, and the light-transmitting portion <b>415</b> is disposed in correspondence with an area where a pattern is not formed on the substrate <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For example, the slit portion <b>413</b> is formed on an area on which the gate line GL, the gate electrode GE and the storage line STL are formed. Moreover, when the data pad portion DP includes the dummy pattern <b>113</b>, the slit portion <b>413</b> may be further formed on an area where the dummy pattern <b>113</b> is formed. The light-blocking portion <b>411</b> is disposed on an area through which a hole exposing an end portion of the gate line GL is formed, and the light-transmitting portion <b>415</b> is disposed on an area in which the pattern is not formed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the substrate <b>101</b> includes an optically transparent insulation material capable of transmitting light. A gate metal layer <b>110</b> and a first sacrificial metal layer <b>120</b> are formed on the substrate <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The gate metal layer <b>110</b> may include, for example, a metallic material such as molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti), copper (Cu), aluminum (Al), neodymium (Nd), etc., or a metal alloy thereof. The gate metal layer <b>110</b> may have at least a double-layered structure of metallic materials having different physical characteristics to each other. For example, the gate metal layer <b>110</b> includes a first metal layer and a second metal layer that is sequentially formed on the first metal layer. The gate metal layer <b>110</b> may be formed on the substrate <b>101</b> through a sputtering process.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The first sacrificial metal layer <b>120</b> may include a material having an etch selectivity with respect to the gate metal layer <b>110</b>. The first sacrificial metal layer <b>120</b> may include, for example, a metallic material such as molybdenum (Mo), titanium (Ti), copper (Cu), is aluminum (Al), indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), etc., or a metal alloy thereof. The first sacrificial metal layer <b>120</b> may have at least a double-layered structure of metallic materials having different physical characteristics to each other. For example, the first sacrificial metal layer <b>120</b> may have a Mo/Al/Mo structure, a Cu/Ti structure, a Mo/ITO structure, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A positive photoresist material is deposited on the substrate <b>101</b> in which the first sacrificial metal layer <b>120</b> is formed to form a first photoresist layer. The first photoresist layer is patterned by using the first mask <b>410</b>. The first photoresist layer includes a first photo pattern PR<b>11</b> and a second photo pattern PR<b>12</b> that are formed through the first mask <b>410</b>. A thickness of the second photo pattern PR<b>12</b> is greater than that of the first photo pattern PR<b>11</b>. The first photo pattern PR<b>11</b> is formed on an area where the gate line GL, the gate electrode GE, the storage line STL and the dummy pattern <b>113</b> are formed, and the second photo pattern PR<b>12</b> is formed on an area where an end portion <b>111</b> of the gate line GL is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this exemplary embodiment, a positive photoresist of which an exposed area is removed by a developing solution is described as an example of the first photoresist layer. Alternatively, a negative photoresist of which a non-exposed area is removed by a developing solution may be formed as an example of the first photoresist layer. When the negative photoresist material is used, a disposing area of the light-blocking portion <b>411</b> and a disposing area of the light-transmitting portion <b>415</b> may be exchanged with each other in the first mask <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, the gate metal layer <b>110</b> and the first sacrificial metal layer <b>120</b> are etched using the first photo pattern PR<b>11</b> and the second photo pattern PR<b>12</b> as a mask to form a first metal pattern M<b>1</b>. The first metal pattern M<b>1</b> includes a gate metal pattern in which the gate metal layer <b>110</b> is patterned and a first sacrificial metal pattern <b>121</b> in which the first sacrificial metal layer <b>120</b> is patterned to be formed on the gate metal pattern. For example, the gate metal pattern includes the gate line GL, the gate electrode GE, the storage line STL and an end portion <b>111</b> of the gate line GL.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The gate metal layer <b>110</b> and the first sacrificial metal layer <b>120</b> may be etched through a wet-etching process or a dry-etching process.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, the first photo pattern PR<b>11</b> formed on the first metal pattern M<b>1</b> is removed by using an etch back process and the second photo pattern PR<b>12</b> formed on the first metal pattern M<b>1</b> is partially removed by using the etch back process, so that a first remaining pattern PR<b>13</b> is formed. Thus, the first sacrificial metal pattern <b>121</b>, which is respectively formed on the gate line GL, the gate electrode GE, the storage line STL and the dummy pattern <b>113</b>, is exposed, and the first remaining pattern PR<b>13</b> is disposed on an end portion <b>111</b> of the gate line GL.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The first sacrificial metal pattern <b>121</b> formed on the gate line GL, the gate electrode GE, the storage line STL and the dummy pattern <b>113</b> is etched using the first remaining pattern PR<b>13</b> as a mask. The first remaining pattern PR<b>13</b> forms an undercut U in the first sacrificial metal pattern <b>121</b> formed on an end portion <b>111</b> of the gate line GL.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>, the gate insulation layer <b>130</b> is formed on the substrate <b>101</b> having the undercut U formed thereon. The gate insulation layer <b>130</b> may include a soluble organic-inorganic material such as a silicon oxide (SiOx), a silicon nitride (SiNx), a silicon polymer, etc. The gate insulation layer <b>130</b> may be formed through a chemical vapor deposition (&#x201c;CVD&#x201d;) process or a coating process, etc. Moreover, the gate insulation layer <b>130</b> may have at least a double-layered structure of insulating materials having different physical characteristics to each other. For example, the gate insulation layer <b>130</b> may have a double-layered structure in which a silicon nitride (SiNx) layer and a silicon oxide (SiOx) layer are sequentially deposited.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The gate insulation layer <b>130</b> covers the gate line GL, the gate electrode GE, the storage line STL and the dummy pattern <b>113</b>, and further covers the first remaining pattern PR<b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>, in the substrate <b>101</b> on which the gate insulation layer <b>130</b> is formed, the first sacrificial metal pattern <b>121</b> formed on an end portion <b>111</b> of the gate line GL is removed by using an etching solution. The etching solution is infiltrated into a gap of the gate insulation layer <b>130</b> which is formed by the undercut U, so that the first sacrificial metal pattern <b>121</b> formed on the end portion <b>111</b> of the gate line GL is etched. Thus, the first sacrificial metal pattern <b>121</b> is removed, and the first remaining pattern PR<b>13</b> formed on the first sacrificial metal pattern <b>121</b> is removed simultaneously with the removal of the first sacrificial metal pattern <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As a result, a first hole H<b>1</b> exposing an end portion <b>111</b> of the gate line GL is formed through the gate insulation layer <b>130</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Moreover, after the etch back process, the ohmic contact layer <b>142</b><i>b </i>corresponding to a channel area of the switching element TR may be removed to form a channel of the switching element TR, and then the second sacrificial metal pattern <b>171</b> formed on the data line DL, the source electrode SE and the drain electrode DE may be removed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Due to a process of removing the second sacrificial metal pattern <b>171</b> formed on the data line DL, the source electrode SE and the drain electrode DE, an undercut U is formed on the second sacrificial metal pattern <b>171</b> formed on the end portion <b>161</b> of the data line DL, a portion area of the storage electrode STE and the first gate pad electrode <b>163</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12E</figref>, the protection insulation layer <b>180</b> is formed on the substrate <b>301</b> on which the undercut U is formed. The protection insulation layer <b>180</b> covers the source metal pattern including the data line DL, the source electrode SE, the drain electrode DE and the storage electrode STE, and covers the third remaining pattern PR<b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12E</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12F</figref>, in the substrate <b>301</b> on which the protection insulation layer <b>180</b> is formed, the second sacrificial metal pattern <b>171</b> formed on an end portion <b>161</b> of the data line DL, the first gate pad electrode <b>163</b> and a portion area of the storage electrode STE is removed by using an etching solution. The etching solution is infiltrated into a gap of the protection insulation layer <b>180</b> which is formed by the undercut U, so that the second sacrificial metal pattern <b>171</b> formed on an end portion <b>161</b> of the data line DL, the first gate pad electrode <b>163</b> and a portion area of the storage electrode STE is etched. Thus, the second sacrificial metal pattern <b>171</b> is removed, and the third remaining pattern PR<b>33</b> formed on the second sacrificial metal pattern <b>171</b> is removed simultaneously with the removal of the second sacrificial metal pattern <b>171</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As a result, the second hole H<b>2</b> exposing the first gate pad electrode <b>163</b>, the third hole H<b>3</b> exposing the end portion <b>161</b> of the data line DL and the fourth hole H<b>4</b> exposing a portion area of the storage electrode STE are formed through the protection insulation layer <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12F</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12G</figref>, a transparent conductive layer <b>190</b> is formed on the substrate <b>301</b> through which the second hole H<b>2</b>, the third hole H<b>3</b> and the fourth hole H<b>4</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">A fourth photoresist layer is formed on the substrate <b>301</b> on which the transparent conductive layer <b>190</b> is formed. The fourth photoresist layer is patterned by using a fourth mask <b>540</b>. In the fourth photoresist layer, a seventh photo pattern PR<b>4</b> is formed by using a light-blocking portion <b>541</b>. The seventh photo pattern PR<b>4</b> is disposed on an area on which a transparent electrode pattern is formed. For example, the seventh photo pattern PR<b>4</b> is disposed on an area on which the pixel electrode PE, the second gate pad electrode <b>193</b> and the data pad electrode <b>195</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The transparent electrode layer <b>190</b> is patterned by using the seventh photo pattern PR<b>4</b> as a mask to form the pixel electrode PE, the second gate pad electrode <b>193</b> and the data pad electrode <b>195</b>. Then, the seventh photo pattern PR<b>4</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">According to the present exemplary embodiment, the display substrate <b>300</b> may be manufactured by using a four-masking process. Moreover, although the four-masking process is used thereto, a semiconductor pattern is not disposed between the data line DL and the gate insulation layer <b>130</b>, so that display defects such as a waterfall may be prevented. Accordingly, the number of masks in manufacturing the display substrate may be decreased.</p>
