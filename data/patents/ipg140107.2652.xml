<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/468,693, filed May 10, 2012 the entire content and disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to semiconductor structures and methods of forming the same. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to interconnect structures for integrated microelectronic circuits which include a graphene cap located atop at least an uppermost surface of an embedded copper structure and methods of forming the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The continuous reduction of active semiconductor device dimensions from one technology node (i.e., generation) to the next necessitates a similar scaling of interconnect structures between neighboring devices (e.g., local wires and vias). One of the problems the semiconductor industry faces as cross-sectional wiring dimensions shrink is the pronounced increase in the electrical resistivity of copper, Cu, interconnects with decreasing linewidths. This increase in electrical resistivity is partly due to the increase in surface and grain boundary scattering, and there is a sharp resistivity increase starting at dimensions comparable to the mean free path of electrons in copper.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, the highly resistive diffusion barrier(s) surrounding the Cu body of the interconnect structure contributes significantly to total interconnect resistance, at an increasing proportion as dimensions get smaller. As diffusion barrier thickness is scaled down with metal width to meet conductor effective resistivity goals, copper containment becomes increasing problematic, and eventually new copper passivation techniques and/or diffusion-resistant dielectrics are needed. Otherwise, the diffusion barrier thickness will not be possible to be scaled anymore together with scaling pitch. Obviously, this will have adverse effects on line, and especially, via resistances.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present disclosure, which discloses interconnect structures for integrated microelectronic circuits which include a graphene cap located atop at least an uppermost surface of a copper structure and methods of forming the same, will now be described in greater detail by referring to the following discussion and drawings that accompany the present application. It is noted that the drawings of the present application are provided for illustrative purposes and, as such, they are not drawn to scale. In the drawings and the description that follows, like elements are referred to by like reference numerals. For purposes of the description hereinafter, the terms &#x201c;upper&#x201d;, &#x201c;lower&#x201d;, &#x201c;right&#x201d;, &#x201c;left&#x201d;, &#x201c;vertical&#x201d;, &#x201c;horizontal&#x201d;, &#x201c;top&#x201d;, &#x201c;bottom&#x201d;, and derivatives thereof shall relate to the components, layers and/or elements as oriented in the drawing figures which accompany the present application.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth, such as particular structures, components, materials, dimensions, processing steps and techniques, in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present disclosure. However, it will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art that the present disclosure may be practiced with viable alternative process options without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures or processing steps have not been described in detail in order to avoid obscuring the various embodiments of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the present disclosure, graphene is used as a diffusion barrier and/or cap for copper based interconnect structures. The term &#x201c;graphene&#x201d; as used throughout the present disclosure denotes a one-atom-thick planar sheet of sp<sup>2</sup>-bonded carbon atoms that are densely packed in a honeycomb crystal lattice. The graphene employed in the present disclosure has a two-dimensional (2D) hexagonal crystallographic bonding structure. In some embodiments, the interconnect structures of the present disclosure can have improved electromigration (EM) resistance as a result of utilizing graphene as a diffusion barrier and/or cap for copper interconnect structures. Electromigration is the transport of material caused by the gradual movement of ions in a conductor due to the momentum transfer between conducting electrons and diffusing metal atoms. The effect is important in applications where high direct current densities are used, such as microelectronics and related structures. As the structure size decreases, the practical significance of EM increases.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> which illustrate an interconnect structure in accordance with one embodiment of the present disclosure and through various stages of forming the same. The interconnect structure of this embodiment (as shown, for example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>) includes at least one copper structure <b>22</b>&#x2032; contained within at least one opening <b>16</b> present in a dielectric material (represented by dielectric material portions <b>14</b>L, <b>14</b>R). The at least one copper structure <b>22</b>&#x2032; has an uppermost surface that is coplanar with an uppermost surface of the dielectric material. The interconnect structure of this embodiment of the present disclosure further includes a graphene cap <b>24</b> located atop the uppermost surface of the at least one copper structure <b>22</b>&#x2032;, wherein the graphene cap <b>24</b> has edges that are vertically coincident with edges of the at least one copper structure <b>22</b>&#x2032;. It should be noted that the uppermost surface of the at least one copper structure <b>22</b>&#x2032; is horizontally orientated as shown in the drawings of the present application. As such, the graphene cap has vertical sidewall surfaces, i.e., edges that are vertically, with respect to the uppermost surface of the at least one copper structure <b>22</b>&#x2032;, coincident with the edges (also vertically orientated) of the at least one copper structure <b>22</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is illustrated a structure including a substrate <b>10</b>, a first dielectric material <b>12</b>, and a second dielectric material <b>14</b> that can be employed in one embodiment of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The substrate <b>10</b> that is employed in the present disclosure can include a semiconductor material such as, for example, Si, SiGe, SiGeC, SiC, Ge alloys, GaAs, InAs, InP and other III/V or II/VI compound semiconductors. The substrate <b>10</b> can be a single semiconductor layered substrate or it can be a multi-layered semiconductor substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one embodiment, the substrate <b>10</b> may comprise a bulk semiconductor substrate in which at least one semiconductor material is contiguously present therein. In other embodiments, the substrate <b>10</b> may comprise a semiconductor-on-insulator material such as, for example, silicon-on-insulator (SOI) or silicon germanium-on-insulator (SGOI). The substrate <b>10</b> can be an intrinsic, i.e., non-doped, semiconductor material. Alternatively, substrate <b>10</b> can be a doped semiconductor material. In one embodiment, the substrate <b>10</b> is comprised of a single crystalline semiconductor material such as, for example, single crystal silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The substrate <b>10</b> may comprise one or more semiconductor devices (not shown in the drawings) such as, for example, resistors, diodes, capacitors, and/or transistors located thereon. The one or more semiconductor devices can be formed utilizing techniques that are well known to those skilled in the art. For example, a transistor can be formed utilizing a gate first or a gate last process.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first dielectric material <b>12</b> of the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes any middle-of-the-line (MOL) dielectric material including, for example, silicon oxide, C-doped oxides (i.e., organosilicates), silsequioxanes, undoped silicate glass (USG), fluorosilicate glass (FSG), borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG), a spin-on low-k dielectric layer, or a plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) low-k dielectric layer. By &#x201c;low-k&#x201d; it is meant a dielectric material having a dielectric constant, k, of less than silicon oxide. The first dielectric material <b>12</b> can be formed utilizing a conventional deposition process including, for example, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), evaporation and spin-on coating.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Contact vias (not shown) are typically present within the first dielectric material <b>12</b> and are in contact with conductive surfaces present within and/or the surface of substrate <b>10</b>. The contact vias (not shown) include a metal such as Cu, Ti, Al or alloys. The contact vias typically extend through the entirety of the first dielectric material <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments of the present disclosure, the first dielectric material <b>12</b> can be omitted from the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The second dielectric material <b>14</b> comprises any interlevel or intralevel dielectric material including inorganic dielectrics and/or organic dielectrics. In one embodiment, the second dielectric material <b>14</b> is porous. In another embodiment, the second dielectric material <b>14</b> is non-porous. Porous dielectric materials typically have a lower dielectric constant than there corresponding non-porous counterparts. The second dielectric material <b>14</b> may comprise a same or a different dielectric material as the first dielectric material <b>12</b>. Some examples of suitable dielectrics that can be used as the second dielectric material <b>14</b> include, but are not limited to, silicon oxide, silsesquioxanes, C doped oxides (i.e., organosilicates) that include atoms of Si, C, O and H, thermosetting polyarylene ethers, or multilayers thereof. The term &#x201c;polyarylene&#x201d; is used in this application to denote aryl moieties or inertly substituted aryl moieties which are linked together by bonds, fused rings, or inert linking groups such as, for example, oxygen, sulfur, sulfone, sulfoxide, carbonyl and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The first dielectric material <b>12</b> and the second dielectric material <b>14</b> typically have a dielectric constant that is about 4.0 or less, with a dielectric constant of about 2.8 or less being even more typical. All dielectric constants mentioned herein are relative to a vacuum, unless otherwise noted. These dielectrics generally have a lower parasitic cross talk as compared with dielectric materials that have a higher dielectric constant than 4.0. The thickness of the first and second dielectric materials may vary depending upon the dielectric material used as well as the exact number of dielectrics layers within the first and second dielectric materials. Typically, and for normal interconnect structures, the first dielectric material <b>12</b> and second dielectric material <b>14</b> each have a thickness from 50 nm to 1000 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, there is illustrated the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> after forming at least one opening <b>16</b> within the original second dielectric material <b>14</b>. In the drawings, reference numerals <b>14</b>L and <b>14</b>R represent second dielectric material portions that are formed after forming the at least one opening <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, at least one pad material (not shown) can be formed atop the second dielectric material <b>14</b> prior to forming the at least opening <b>16</b>. The at least one pad material can be used as a pattern mask in the subsequent formation of the at least one opening <b>16</b>. When the at least one pad material is present, the at least one pad material may be an oxide, nitride, oxynitride or multilayers thereof (e.g., a pad stack comprising a pad oxide and a pad nitride). The at least one pad material typically comprises a semiconductor oxide, a semiconductor nitride and/or a semiconductor oxynitride. In one embodiment, the at least one pad material comprises an oxide of silicon and/or a nitride of silicon.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the at least one pad material may be formed utilizing any conventional deposition process including, for example, CVD, PECVD, evaporation, chemical solution deposition, physical vapor deposition (PVD) and atomic layer deposition. In other embodiments, the at least one pad material can be formed by a thermal process such as, for example, a thermal oxidation process, and/or a thermal nitridation process. In yet other embodiments, the at least one pad material can be formed utilizing a combination of deposition and thermal processes. The thickness of the at least one pad material may vary depending on the number of pad materials as well as the technique that was used in forming the same. Typically, the at least one pad material has a thickness from 10 nm to 80 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Notwithstanding whether the at least one pad material is or is not employed, the at least one opening <b>16</b> can be formed into the second dielectric material <b>14</b> by lithography and etching. The lithographic step includes forming a photoresist (organic, inorganic or hybrid) atop the second dielectric material <b>14</b> utilizing a conventional deposition process such as, for example, CVD, PECVD and spin-on coating. Following formation of the photoresist, the photoresist is exposed to a desired pattern of radiation. Next, the exposed photoresist is developed utilizing a conventional resist development process.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">After the development step, an etching step is performed to transfer the pattern from the patterned photoresist into the second dielectric material <b>14</b>. When the at least one pad material is present, the etching step transfers the pattern from the patterned photoresist into the at least one pad material and thereafter into the second dielectric material <b>14</b>. In such an embodiment, the patterned photoresist is typically removed from the surface of the structure after transferring the pattern into the at least one pad material utilizing a conventional resist stripping process such as, for example, ashing. In other embodiments, the patterned photoresist is removed after the pattern is completely transferred into the second dielectric material <b>14</b>. The etching step used in forming the at least one opening <b>16</b> can comprise a dry etching process (including reactive ion etching, ion beam etching, plasma etching or laser ablation), a wet chemical etching process or any combination thereof. Typically, reactive ion etching is used to form the at least one opening <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After forming the at least one opening <b>16</b>, the remaining portions of the at least one pad material can be removed from the structure at this point of the present disclosure by a conventional planarization process such as, for example, chemical mechanical polishing and/or grinding. Alternatively, the remaining portions of the at least one pad material can remain atop the second dielectric material portions <b>14</b>L, <b>14</b>R and be removed during a subsequently performed planarization step that is used in forming the embedded copper structure within the second dielectric material.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The at least one opening <b>16</b> may include a via opening, a line opening, a combined via and line opening, or any combinations thereof. When a combined via and line opening is formed, a second iteration of lithography and etching is typically used to form the same. Via openings typically have a narrower width than line openings.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there is illustrated the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> after forming a first diffusion barrier material <b>18</b> lining the at least opening <b>16</b> and an uppermost surface each second dielectric material portion <b>14</b>L, <b>14</b>R. The first diffusion barrier material <b>18</b> comprises a metal nitride such as, for example, TaN, TiN, RuN, RuTaN, IrTaN, WN or any other metal nitride that can serve as a barrier to prevent conductive material from diffusing there through. The first diffusion barrier material <b>18</b> can be formed by any conventional deposition process including, for example, CVD, PECVD, PVD, sputtering and plating. The thickness of the first diffusion barrier <b>18</b> may vary depending on the deposition process used as well as the material employed. Typically, the first diffusion barrier material <b>18</b> has a thickness from 4 nm to 40 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, there is illustrated the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> after forming a second diffusion barrier material <b>20</b> atop the first diffusion barrier material <b>18</b>. The second diffusion barrier material <b>20</b> comprises a metal such as, for example, Ta, Ti, Ru, RuTa, IrTa, W or any other metal that can serve as a barrier to prevent conductive material from diffusing there through. The second diffusion barrier material <b>20</b> can be formed by any conventional deposition process including, for example, CVD, PECVD, PVD, atomic layer deposition (ALD), sputtering and plating. The thickness of the second diffusion barrier material <b>20</b> may vary depending on the deposition process used as well as the material employed. Typically, the second diffusion barrier material <b>20</b> has a thickness from 4 nm to 40 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, a single layered diffusion barrier including one of the above mentioned metal or metal nitride diffusion barrier materials can be used instead of the multilayered diffusion barrier including the first and second diffusion barrier materials <b>18</b>, <b>20</b> illustrated in the drawings of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In other embodiments, an optional plating seed layer (not shown) can be formed on the second diffusion barrier material <b>20</b> prior to forming a layer of copper or a copper alloy. The optional plating seed layer is employed to selectively promote subsequent electroplating of the layer of copper or a copper alloy. The optional plating seed layer may comprise Cu, a Cu alloy, Ir, an Ir alloy, Ru, a Ru alloy (e.g., TaRu alloy) or any other suitable noble metal or noble metal alloy having a low metal-plating overpotential. Typically, Cu or a Cu alloy plating seed layer is employed. The thickness of the optional seed layer may vary depending on the material of the optional plating seed layer as well as the technique used in forming the same. Typically, the optional plating seed layer has a thickness from 2 nm to 80 nm. The optional plating seed layer can be formed by a conventional deposition process including, for example, CVD, PECVD, ALD, and PVD.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, there is illustrated the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> after forming a layer of copper or a copper alloy atop the second diffusion barrier material <b>20</b>. The layer of copper or copper alloy, which is labeled as element <b>22</b> in the drawings, fills the remaining portions of the at least one opening and extends onto the uppermost surface of the second diffusion barrier material <b>20</b> that is present outside of the at least one opening <b>16</b>. The term &#x201c;copper alloy&#x201d; denotes a compound that comprises copper and at least one other element such as, for example, Al. The layer of copper or copper alloy <b>22</b> can be formed utilizing any conventional deposition process including, for example, CVD, PECVD, PVD, sputtering, plating, chemical solution deposition and electroless plating. As shown, the layer of copper or copper alloy <b>22</b> fills the remaining portion of the at least one opening <b>16</b> and extends onto the exposed uppermost surface of the second diffusion barrier material <b>20</b> that is present on the uppermost surface of each second dielectric portion <b>16</b>L, <b>16</b>R.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is illustrated the structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> after planarization and forming a graphene cap <b>24</b> atop a copper structure <b>22</b>&#x2032;, which is embedded within the original second dielectric material <b>14</b> between second dielectric material portions <b>14</b>L and <b>14</b>R. The copper structure <b>22</b>&#x2032; thus can be referred to herein as embedded copper structure <b>22</b>&#x2032;. The graphene cap <b>24</b> of the present disclosure has a high conductivity (on the order of 10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>&#x3a9;&#xb7;cm in suspended graphene, lower in graphene deposited on substrates) and, most importantly, it has the ability to prevent diffusion of Cu through it.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The planarization process used in providing the structure shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> may include chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) and/or grinding. The planarization process provides a planar structure in which the uppermost surfaces of the second dielectric material portions <b>14</b>L, <b>14</b>R, the remaining second diffusion barrier material <b>20</b>&#x2032; (which is now U-shaped), the remaining first diffusion barrier material <b>18</b>&#x2032; (which is also now U-shaped) and the embedded copper structure <b>22</b>&#x2032; (i.e., remaining portions of the layer of copper or copper alloy <b>22</b>) are substantially coplanar with each other. The term &#x201c;U-shaped&#x201d; denotes that the layer includes two vertical portions which extend upwards from a horizontal connecting portion. If not previously done, the remaining portions of the at least one pad material can be removed from the structure during this planarization step of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this embodiment, the graphene cap <b>24</b> is formed directly on the uppermost surface of the copper structure <b>22</b>&#x2032;. The graphene cap <b>24</b> has edges which are vertically coincident with edges of the embedded copper structure <b>22</b>. As such, the graphene cap <b>24</b> does not extend onto the uppermost surface of any of the second dielectric material portions <b>14</b>L, <b>14</b>R, the remaining second diffusion barrier material <b>20</b>&#x2032; (which is now U-shaped), and the remaining first diffusion barrier material <b>18</b>&#x2032;. The graphene cap <b>24</b> is thus selectively positioned only atop the exposed uppermost surface of the copper structure <b>22</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The graphene cap <b>24</b> can be comprised of single-layer graphene (nominally 0.34 nm thick), few-layer graphene (2-10 graphene layers), multi-layer graphene (&#x3e;10 graphene layers), a mixture of single-layer, few-layer, and multi-layer graphene, or any combination of graphene layers mixed with amorphous and/or disordered carbon phases that result by graphene formation at lower temperatures (between 200&#xb0; C. and 900&#xb0; C.). The graphene cap <b>24</b> can also include, if desired, substitutional (where C atoms in graphene are replaced with dopant atoms covalently bonded to next nearest neighbor, nnn, atoms), and dopant atoms or molecules that do not form covalent bonds to graphene and lie on top of the graphene layer or between graphene layers in the case few layer or multilayer intercalated graphene.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment the graphene cap <b>24</b> can be formed utilizing a selective deposition process such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD), or ultraviolet (UV) assisted CVD. The selective deposition process that can be employed in the present disclosure occurs on any metallic surface such as, for example, Cu, Ru, Ir, Rh, Pt, Co and alloys thereof, which catalyze graphene growth. The selective deposition, i.e., catalytic growth, of graphene, on metallic surfaces can be performed at a temperature up to, but not exceeding, 400&#xb0; C. In one embodiment, the selective growth of graphene occurs at a temperature from 200&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C. In another embodiment, the selective growth of graphene occurs at a temperature from 350&#xb0; C. to 400&#xb0; C. It is noted that growth temperatures which exceed 400&#xb0; C. are not used in Cu containing interconnect structures since at such high temperature the integrity and service lifetime of the Cu interconnects can be negatively affected. The selective deposition process that can be used in the present disclosure for graphene growth includes utilizing any known carbon sources including, for example, benzene, propane, ethane and other hydrocarbons, and other C-containing gases.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">If higher quality graphene is necessary to be used for forming an effective cap layer, then graphene that is initially grown on Cu foils can be transferred onto the surface of the interconnect level that needs to be capped, and then be optionally patterned by photolithography and RIE, so that the graphene cap has edges which coincide with edges of the embedded copper structure. One or more graphene layers can be transferred sequentially using a single step or multi-step transfer process, respectively. The Cu foils as well as any base substrate that the Cu foils might be located thereon can be removed during the transfer process.</p>
