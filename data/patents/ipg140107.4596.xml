<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(a) to a Korean Patent Application filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Mar. 6, 2006 and assigned Serial No. 2006-20989, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a wireless communication system, and in particular, to an apparatus and method for estimating a symbol timing offset in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In the 4<sup>th </sup>Generation (4G) communication system, which is the next generation communication system, research is being conducted to provide users with high-speed services having various Qualities-of-Service (QoS). Particularly, in the 4G communication system, research is being carried out to support high-speed services while guaranteeing mobility and QoS for a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) communication system, such as a wireless Local Area Network (LAN) system and a wireless Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) system.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Therefore, in the 4G communication system, Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) is being studied as a scheme suitable for high-speed data transmission in wire/wireless channels. OFDM, a scheme for transmitting data using multiple carriers, is a kind of Multi Carrier Modulation (MCM) that converts a serial input symbol stream into parallel symbol streams and modulates them with multiple orthogonal sub-carriers before transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The 4G communication system needs broadband-spectrum resources in order to provide high-speed, high-quality wireless multimedia services. However, the use of the broadband-spectrum resources causes a considerable fading effect in the wireless transmission path due to multipath propagation, and also causes a frequency selective fading effect even in transmission bands. Therefore, for the high-speed wireless multimedia services, OFDM, which is robust against the frequency selective fading compared with Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), has a higher gain. Therefore, OFDM is popularly used for the 4G communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The wireless channel environment in a mobile communication system, unlike the wired channel environment, suffers inevitable errors occurring due to several factors such as multipath interference, shadowing, wave attenuation, time-varying noise, Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) caused by delay spread, frequency selective fading, and the like, thereby causing a loss of information data. The loss of information data causes considerable distortion of actual transmission signals, thereby reducing the entire performance of the mobile communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to overcome the ISI and the frequency selective fading, the OFDM communication system transmits OFDM symbols by inserting Guard Intervals (GI) as well as using multiple orthogonal sub-carriers. A method for inserting the guard interval is classified into a Cyclic Prefix scheme of copying last specific samples of an OFDM symbol in the time domain and inserting the samples into an effective OFDM symbol, and a Cyclic Postfix scheme of copying first specific samples of an OFDM symbol in the time domain and inserting the samples into an effective OFDM symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described above, the OFDM communication system reduces the ISI effect using the guard intervals. That is, the OFDM communication system minimizes an effect of wireless channels using the guard intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, in the OFDM communication system, an effect of symbol timing is considerable in high-order modulation of the sub-carriers, for example, in 64-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (64 QAM) or 256 QAM, and in this situation, the ISI effect remains.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">An aspect of the present invention is to address at least the problems and/or disadvantages and to provide at least the advantages described below. Accordingly, an aspect of the present invention is to provide a scheme capable of minimizing an effect of wireless channels in a wireless communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another aspect of the present invention is to provide a scheme capable of minimizing ISI in high-order modulation of sub-carriers in a wireless communication system.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Yet another aspect of the present invention is to provide a scheme capable of minimizing ISI through accurate symbol timing offset estimation in a wireless communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method for estimating a symbol timing offset in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication system. The method includes detecting a channel impulse response within one Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) duration; and estimating a symbol timing offset taking the detected channel impulse response into account. The symbol timing offset estimation includes calculating a channel delay duration depending on the detected channel impulse response; and estimating the symbol timing offset such that the channel impulse response is detected within a guard interval, taking into account the calculated channel delay duration and the guard interval existing in the one FFT duration.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for estimating a symbol timing offset in an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication system. The apparatus includes an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) unit for converting a frequency-domain OFDM symbol, in which channel estimation is performed, into a time-domain OFDM symbol; and a symbol timing offset estimator for receiving the time-domain OFDM symbol, detecting a channel impulse response within one Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) duration, and estimating a symbol timing offset taking the detected channel impulse response into account.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the annexed drawings. In the following description, a detailed description of known functions and configurations incorporated herein has been omitted for clarity and conciseness.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Generally, an Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) communication system minimizes an effect of wireless channels using guard intervals (GI). However, in the OFDM communication system, an effect of symbol timing is considerable in high-order modulation of sub-carriers, for example, in 64-ary Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (64 QAM) or 256 QAM.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Therefore, the present invention estimates an accurate symbol timing offset using a channel impulse response, and through the estimation, minimizes an effect of Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI) which may occur in the conventional technology.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As described above, in order to cope with multipath channels, the OFDM communication system inserts a guard interval between symbols in the time domain before transmission. However, the use of the guard interval causes a reduction in frequency efficiency of the OFDM communication system. Therefore, research is being conducted on a method capable of efficiently removing an ISI effect while minimizing the use of the guard intervals. In order to solve these problems, the present invention estimates an accurate symbol timing offset using the channel impulse response and minimizes the ISI using the estimated symbol timing offset.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">That is, the present invention provides a symbol timing offset estimation scheme using a channel impulse response. In order to estimate the symbol timing offset, an embodiment of the present invention varies a search range in detecting the peak power, and begins the search starting point at the middle of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) duration.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The foregoing OFDM receiver reduces a negative effect on the system due to multipath and delay spread with use of guard intervals. Generally, transmission of OFDM symbols is performed symbol by symbol. However, while the OFDM symbols are transmitted over a multipath channel, they are affected by previous symbols.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In order to prevent interference between the OFDM symbols, a guard interval longer than the maximum delay spread of a channel is inserted between consecutive symbols. In this case, an OFDM symbol period is the sum of an effective symbol period, for which data is actually transmitted, and the guard interval. The receiver gathers data for the effective symbol period after removing the guard interval, and then performs demodulation thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In order to prevent orthogonality destruction which may occur due to a delay of sub-carriers, a signal of the last interval is copied in an effective symbol interval, and then inserted in the guard interval, and this is called a Cyclic Prefix (CP). The insertion of the CP reduces bandwidth efficiency and brings a loss of a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) for the effective symbol interval. Therefore, it is necessary to set a length of the effective symbol interval such that the SNR loss due to the CP insertion is minimized. In addition, it is possible to cancel the ISI by inserting a CP longer than a delay spread into a guard interval between adjacent guard intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">That is, as described above, the OFDM communication system inserts the CP between all symbols in the time domain before transmission in order to cope with multipath channels. In order to completely cancel the ISI occurring in the multipath channels, the CP should be longer in length than the channel impulse response.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the OFDM communication system, an effect of symbol timing is considerable in high-order modulation of sub-carriers. Therefore, the OFDM communication system estimates a symbol timing offset using the channel impulse response and minimizes the ISI through the estimation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> illustrate symbol timing offset estimation operations according to the conventional technology.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, there is shown a general method for estimating a symbol timing offset in the OFDM communication system. It is noted that the method intactly uses the symbol timing offset estimated from training symbols. However, this structure does not consider the channel delay at all. Therefore, this method generally shifts a symbol timing offset forward by about 4 samples before processing, taking an effect of the channel delay into account.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, there is shown a cross-correlation method for estimating a symbol timing offset in the OFDM communication system. It is noted that the cross-correlation method estimates a fine symbol timing offset. However, like the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, the cross-correlation method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> also does not consider the channel delay at all. For reduction of the channel delay, the cross-correlation method shifts a symbol timing offset forward by a predetermined size to reduce an effect of the channel delay. In this case, however, the method is less susceptible to an effect of noises, but decreases in reliability of peak detection.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the receiver, a training symbol buffer <b>301</b> buffers received specific samples, for example, a channel impulse response, and delivers the channel impulse response to a frequency offset estimator <b>303</b>. The frequency offset estimator <b>303</b> estimates a frequency offset using the channel impulse response, and delivers the estimated frequency offset to a training symbol compensator <b>305</b>.</p>

The channel estimator <b>311</b> performs channel estimation using the symbols output from the FFT unit <b>309</b> and previously known training symbols, and delivers the channel estimation result to an Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT) unit <b>313</b>. The IFFT unit <b>313</b> performs IFFT processing on the frequency-domain signal output from the channel estimator <b>311</b>, generating a time-domain signal, and delivers the time-domain signal to a symbol timing offset estimator <b>315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For estimation of a fine symbol timing offset, the symbol timing offset estimator <b>315</b>, receiving the output signal of the IFFT unit <b>313</b>, varies a search range and detects the peak power. Thereafter, the symbol timing offset estimator <b>315</b> estimates the best symbol timing offset by calculating channel delay duration using a variable threshold. That is, the symbol timing offset estimator <b>315</b> estimates the channel delay duration, and estimates a symbol timing offset if the channel delay duration is less than or equal to the guard interval. For estimation of the channel delay duration, the symbol timing offset estimator <b>315</b> estimates a search starting point and ending point, and estimates the channel delay duration using a difference between the starting point and the ending point. In addition, it is preferable that the search range is set as an FFT duration length, and the threshold is set so as to estimate up to a path having a specific percentage of the peak power.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a symbol timing offset estimation operation according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in step <b>401</b>, a receiver according to an embodiment of the present invention receives a signal transmitted by a transmitter, via a reception antenna, and buffers a channel impulse response in the signal received via the reception antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In step <b>403</b>, the receiver, after buffering the channel impulse response, sets a search range for symbol timing offset estimation, and then proceeds to step <b>405</b>. Herein, preferably, the receiver can vary a value of the search range taking complexity into account, and basically sets an FFT duration length to N. In addition, preferably, the search range is set such that it starts at a middle point of the FFT duration.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In step <b>405</b>, the receiver detects peak power in the set search range, and then proceeds to step <b>407</b> where it sets a threshold.

In addition, the threshold should be set lower than the peak power, and preferably, the threshold is set to estimate up to a path having 75% of the peak power. That is, the threshold is set to a power value corresponding to 75% of the peak power.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">After setting the threshold, the receiver estimates a starting point and an ending point in step <b>409</b>, and then calculates channel delay duration in step <b>411</b>. In other words, the receiver estimates the starting point and the ending point, and calculates channel delay duration using a difference between the estimated ending point and starting point. In addition, in calculating the channel delay duration, the receiver uses the set variable threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">After calculating the channel delay duration in step <b>411</b>, the receiver proceeds to step <b>413</b> where it compares the calculated channel delay duration with the guard interval. In an embodiment of the present invention, if the channel delay duration is greater than the guard interval, the receiver re-estimates a profile of the channel. This is to prevent the channel delay duration from being greater than the guard interval, thereby maximally reducing the ISI. That is, with use of a size of the channel delay duration, the receiver optimizes the channel delay profile to be estimated, thereby minimizing the ISI. To this end, the receiver proceeds to step <b>407</b> if the channel delay duration is greater than the guard interval.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">However, if the channel delay duration is less than or equal to the guard interval, the receiver proceeds to step <b>415</b> where it estimates a fine symbol timing offset. Herein, the fine symbol timing offset can be estimated using Equation (2).
