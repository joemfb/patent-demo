<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention concerns packaging with several recipients provided with dispensing necks adjacent or placed side by side and used for storing and distributing different liquid, viscous, creamy or pasty products simultaneously (these products will henceforward be referred to as &#x201c;pasty&#x201d;). In particular, it concerns flexible tubes known as &#x201c;multiple&#x201d; tubes. Such packaging is used to store products separately from each other and to dispense them simultaneously via openings that are close together and, if possible, side by side, for example with a view to preparing a magisterial (or extemporaneous) prescription of a pharmaceutical product in a particular dosage form that is not commercially available, or with a view to preparing an adhesive from polymerizing agents, typically a cyanoacrylate, or with a view to preparing a chemically unstable cosmetic product, such as hair dye (a mixture of an oxidizing agent and a precursor), or, finally, simply with a view to providing a pleasant, amusing visual aspect when simultaneously dispensing pasty products of different colors (hair gels, toothpaste, etc.).</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">While single, separate recipients enable products to be kept intact before mixing, the point of having a multiple recipient is to facilitate package management by being certain, at any time, of having available all the constituent parts of the mixture to be made, and to make it easier to make said mixture. Another advantage, which has appeared over the last few years, is related to the pleasant and amusing visual effect of pasty products of different colors simultaneously coming out of neighboring openings.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Whether for an extemporaneous preparation or for a simple visual effect, the aim is to keep the different products contained in the multiple recipient isolated from each other until they are first used and, if possible, to continue to ensure perfect leak-tightness between these products after said first use. To illustrate the multiple recipients concerned by the invention, we shall describe multiple flexible tubes and, more specifically, double tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A multiple flexible tube comprises a head with a multiple-opening neck, connected to an external flexible skirt via a shoulder. The tube may comprise several concentric skirts, the products being contained either in the inner volume of the tube itself, or between the walls of the tube skirt and that of the tube which immediately surrounds the previous tube. In general, these are double tubes, comprising an inside and an outside tube. Such multiple tubes are described in patent applications EP 0 561 719, WO 00/63112 and WO 00/6311, in which the inside tube is fitted into the outside tube.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, other double tubes have been described, in which a single, flexible skirt forms the outer envelope of the multiple tube. At least one transverse wall separates the compartments in the inside volume bounded by the skirt, said compartments being designed to contain different products. Multiple tubes are described, for example, in application WO 00/55602.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention more specifically concerns the first type of multiple tube in which the tubes are produced separately and then assembled like a nest of dolls, each tube, with the exception of the smallest, encasing a tube of smaller dimensions (the dimensions involved being at least the skirt diameter and the neck diameter). It can also apply to the second type of tube, even though the leak-tightness problem described below is less important, as this second type of double tube is of necessity obtained by molding a dispensing head with a complex shape and with multiple openings, the bulk of the difficulty here having to do with obtaining a leak-tight connection for the head, not only with the outside cylindrical skirt, but also with the internal separating wall.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In patent application FR 1 209 359, the &#x201c;self-mixing&#x201d; tube comprises three tubes with a neck closed by a top wall, each fitted into the others and held concentrically in relation to each other by their respective necks. As long as the tube is not open, the products conditioned in the three separate envelopes formed in this way are correctly isolated. The self-mixing tube is opened in a single operation by simultaneously perforating or cutting the walls of the three tubes at an appropriate point.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The tubes described in application WO 00/12309 are obtained in the following way:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0009">a) an outside tube and an inside tube are made separately, the neck of the latter, having a complex shape, being designed so that it provides one or more flow paths for pasty product A that is to be contained in the inner tube and, in conjunction with the inside of the cylindrical wall of the neck of the outer tube, one or more flow paths for pasty product B that is to be contained between the inner tube and the outer tube, once these have been assembled;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0010">b) the inner tube is assembled by insertion into the outer tube, the inner tube being held in place inside the outer tube at the level of the base of the neck using complementary means of axial fixing, typically a rib/groove clipping system.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0011">c) the internal volume of the inner tube is filled with pasty product A;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0012">d) the volume between the wall of the inner tube and that of the outer tube is filled with pasty product B;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0013">e) the multiple tube is sealed by means of a final weld, by compressing and raising to a high temperature the open end of the skirt of the inner tube and the open end of the skirt of the outer tube, preferably simultaneously.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0014">Prior to this, the tubes are made using conventional techniques: the head of the outer (or inner) tube is molded, the sprue removed and fixed to the end of a skirt that will become the outer skirt (or inner skirt). When the head is molded and fixed to the end of the skirt simultaneously (the head is overmolded to the end of the skirt), the molding tool is preferably designed so that the excess plastic resulting from the injection molding process (the sprue) or from the compression molding process, is localized above the top part of the neck. This surplus material must be removed. As the neck is cylindrical, said surplus material is removed, advantageously for large production runs, by turning, generally on devices known as plugging machines, where tubes, placed on rotary chucks, undergo various operations such as sprue removal, lid fitting, closure screwing, etc. But this process has the drawback of not being very accurate in terms of the both the axial positioning and the perpendicularity of the sprue removal cut. Because of this it is not possible to have perfect control over the neck height of each of these tubes, specifically the distance between the mouth&#x2014;the top part of the neck&#x2014;and the means of axial fixing designed to work in conjunction with the complementary means of axial fixing of the other tube. The dispersion of these heights and the imperfect perpendicularity of the cut do not make it possible to obtain leak-tightness between the products during storage, even before they are used for the first time. Consideration was given to the idea of using leak-tight seals with a staggered profile to match the differences between the mouths of the inner and outer necks, but this solution proved to be of little worth, either technically or economically.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0015">The applicant therefore attempted to obtain a double tube by assembling an inner and an outer tube made separately, said double tube making it possible to store two products separately and in a leak-tight manner, before and even after they are used for the first time.</p>

<p id="p-0012" num="0016">A first subject according to the invention is a double dispensing recipient comprising an outer and an inner recipient, said inner recipient being designed to contain a pasty product A and being housed inside the outer recipient in such a way that the volume bounded by its outer surface and the inner surface of the outer recipient is to contain a pasty product B, each recipient comprising a body and a head provided with a neck and a shoulder connecting said neck to said body, said neck having a side wall and an open end provided with one or more dispensing openings, the neck of the inner recipient being housed inside the neck of the outer recipient and having a cross-section shaped so as to offer one or more flow paths for dispensing pasty product A and, in combination with the inner surface of the neck of the outer recipient, one or more flow paths for pasty product B leading to a single or multiple opening for dispensing product B, wherein the inner neck is extended by means of a top portion which is connected to said neck by a slender ring-shaped zone and which blocks the single or multiple dispensing opening of product A.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0017">The double dispensing recipient, according to the invention, may be a double tube, comprising an outer tube and an inner tube housed inside the outer tube so that the volume bounded by the outer surface of the inner tube and the inner surface of the outer tube can contain a pasty product B different from the pasty product A contained within the inner tube. Each tube comprises a flexible skirt and a head provided with a neck and a shoulder connecting said neck to said flexible skirt. Each of the parts of the recipient or of the tube will be referred to as inner if it belongs to the inner tube, and outer if it belongs to the outer tube.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">The inner neck is housed inside the outer neck. It has a cross-section shaped so that it offers one or more flow paths for pasty product A, leading to one or more dispensing openings. In combination with the inner surface of the neck of the outer recipient, the outer surface of the inner neck offers one or more flow paths for pasty product B leading to a single or multiple opening. The inner neck is covered by a top portion which is connected to said inner neck by a slender ring-shaped zone, i.e. less thick than that of the barrel of the inner neck and that of the top portion. This top portion closes the single or multiple dispensing opening of product A contained within the inner tube.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">In a first embodiment of the invention, the top portion may, for example, be a single top wall which includes said slender ring-shaped zone, the outline of the latter bounding the desired shape of the opening or openings. The slender ring-shaped zone is a breakable area that comprises a notch, whose cross-section in a plane comprising the axis of the neck is turned in a direction that is substantially parallel with said axis. In such a geometrical layout, the top portion acting as a lid may be removed by exerting an axial force perpendicular to said top wall.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">But in order to improve hermetic separation between product A and product B after they have been used for the first time, it is preferable to provide the inner neck with said top wall by locating the slender ring-shaped zone on the side wall of said inner neck, so that once burst, the open end of the inner neck systematically protrudes beyond the mouth of the outer neck, whatever the dispersions due to manufacturing tolerance. In such a case, the end of the inner neck is extended by means of a top portion connected to said inner neck by a slender ring-shaped zone located on the barrel of the neck and preferably notched so as to localize deformation until bursting occurs during first-time use. The inner head assembly, including the top portion can to advantage be molded in a single piece and the mold is designed so that the slender ring-shaped zone is accessible after the two tubes have been assembled: once the slender ring-shaped zone has been burst and the top portion detached, the open end of the inner neck protrudes slightly from the mouth of the outer neck, which makes it possible to provide, by means of a leak-tight seal placed on the cap, at the bottom of the screw thread, for example, hermetic separation between product A and B.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">According to this method of the invention, slender ring-shaped zone is a breakable area which extends on the side wall from the inner neck with a notch whose cross-section in a plane comprising the axis of the inner neck is turned in a direction that is substantially perpendicular with said axis. In this case, the breakable zone is placed at a distance from the means of axial fixing (typically a rib clipping system) such that the breakable area is on the outside after assembly of the inner tube and the outer tube, i.e. it is &#x201c;above&#x201d; the mouth of the outer neck (the tube being conventionally presented vertically, with the head at the top). In this way, if a double tube is produced according to the process describes in WO 00/63112, the axial position of the breakable zone is defined by a certain distance from the rib clipping system located at the base of the inner neck; said distance has to be higher than the distance between the mouth of the outer neck and the clip-on groove of the outer neck</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">The top portion, acting as a lid, can be cleanly cut out using a cutting tool which is moved along the slender ring-shaped zone. The top portion can be made to move greatly in relation to the remainder of the inner neck, this large relative movement resulting in a large deformation located in the slender ring-shaped zone, which then bursts. If the top portion is provided with a grooved side wall or one that is polygonal in cross-section, preferably concave (star-shaped, for example), this can easily be made to rotate around the axis of the neck. One can thus impose on the top portion of the inner neck can thus be made to undergo a large rotation, while the remainder of the double tube is motionless.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0023">Whatever the form of the inner neck, therefore, the top portion closing the inner (single or multiple) opening and separated from said inner neck by said breakable zone can have an arbitrary form appropriate to the application of a large movement (typically a rotation) which said top portion is made to undergo.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0024">It may, for example, have a polygonal edge cross-section, that can easily be made to rotate. To tear this breakable zone the first time the recipient is used, the closure cap may be used, to avoid having to use of a special tool. This latter has, for example on the outer wall, following the example of the closure cap described in application EP 0 192 136, a housing of a shape that is complementary to that of the side wall of the top portion. This housing, once the cap has been turned through 180&#xb0; in relation to its usual closing position, acts as a lock inside which the top portion of the inner neck is inserted, this acting as a key. The cap is turned around the axis of the neck, causing a tear located at the level of the slender ring-shaped zone and the top portion is detached from the neck.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">Obviously, the key-lock functions can be reversed. The top wall has in this case a cavity bordered by a ribbed inner side wall or one with a polygonal cross-section, preferably concave, and the closure cap has a protuberance complementary in shape on its outer wall.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0026">The outer neck can to advantage also be surmounted by a top portion which closes the multiple opening. This top portion is also connected to the outer neck via a slender or notched ring-shaped zone. Preferably, this top portion is hollow so that the top portion of the inner tube can be housed in its cavity. Preferably also, in the version in which the top portion is torn by rotation, the inner and outer surfaces of its side wall typically have a polygonal contour, typically star-shaped; for the first, this is complementary to the contour of the side wall of the top portion of the inner neck and, for the second, it is complementary to the contour of the inner surface of the cap. In this way, rotating the cap leads to bursting of the two breakable areas which connect the inner and outer top portions to their respective neck.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0027">The invention has been described relative to double tubes and double containers. It can of course be applied to containers or multiple tubes designed to contain more than two different products. Another subject of the invention is therefore a multiple dispenser including an outer container, an inner container and n intermediate containers (n&#x2267;1), said inner container being designed to contain a pasty product A and being placed inside an intermediate container, itself placed, like a nest of dolls, inside an intermediate container of greater dimensions, the largest of these being placed inside the outer container, each container being placed inside the container that is immediately larger so that the volume bounded by its outer surface and the inner surface of said immediately larger container can contain a pasty product Bi (l=1 to n+1) separated from the other pasty products, each container including a body and a head provided with a neck and a shoulder connecting said neck to said body, said neck having a side wall and an open end provided with one or more dispensing openings, the neck of the inner container being housed inside the neck of the outer container and having a cross-section with a shape such as offers at least one flow path for pasty product A and, in combination with the inner surface of the neck of the immediately larger container, at least one flow path for pasty product Bi, wherein the inner neck is prolonged by a top portion which is connected to said inner neck by a slender ring-shaped zone which closes the single or multiple dispensing opening of product A.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0028">As indicated above, for each inner container, the neck of the immediately larger container is, to advantage, also surmounted by a top portion, connected to the neck of said container via a slender and/or notched ring-shaped zone. Preferably, this latter top portion is hollow so that the top portion of the immediately smaller container can be housed in its cavity.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0029">Said slender and/or notched ring-shaped zone is placed on the wall of the neck of said inner container so that, after assembly of said neck with that of the immediately larger container, followed by bursting of the slender and/or notched ring-shaped zone and detachment of said top portion, the open end of said neck is above the mouth of the neck of the immediately larger container, the tube being presented vertically, with the head at the top.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0053">When being used for the first time, the strip <b>453</b>&#x2014;which can, for example be, used as a tamperproof device&#x2014;is torn along the ring-shaped bursting zone <b>457</b> and cap <b>450</b> is turned through 180&#xb0; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>) to remove the top wall <b>426</b> of the inner tube and that <b>416</b> of the outer tube, by rotation. The open end of the skirt arrives, in closed position, near shoulder <b>414</b> of the tube head. The height of strip <b>453</b> is substantially equal to that of the top portion <b>416</b> of the outer tube, which is above the notched ring-shaped breakable area <b>417</b>, so that, when cap <b>450</b> is once again turned through 180&#xb0; to close the opening, the leak-tight seal <b>480</b> comes in contact with the mouth <b>4230</b> of the inner neck <b>423</b> and <b>4130</b> of the outer neck <b>413</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0054">Double tube <b>400</b> includes an outer tube <b>410</b> and an inner tube <b>420</b> housed inside the outer tube <b>410</b> so that the volume bounded by the outer surface <b>425</b> of the inner tube <b>420</b> and the inner surface <b>415</b> of the outer tube <b>410</b> can contain a pasty product B different from the pasty product A contained in the inner tube <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0055">The inner tube <b>420</b> includes a flexible inner skirt <b>421</b> and an inner head <b>422</b> provided with an inner neck <b>423</b> and an inner shoulder <b>424</b> connecting said inner neck to said inner flexible skirt. The outer tube <b>410</b> comprises a flexible skirt <b>411</b> and an outer head <b>412</b> provided with an outer neck <b>413</b> and an outer shoulder <b>414</b> connecting said outer neck to said outer flexible skirt. Shoulder <b>414</b> is provided with an insert <b>470</b> made of PBT which acts as an efficient barrier to odors.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0056">The end of inner neck <b>423</b> which surrounds the dispensing opening of pasty product A is prolonged by a top portion <b>426</b> connected to said inner neck by a breakable intermediate zone <b>427</b>. The top portion <b>426</b> is provided with a grooved side wall <b>429</b> that can easily be made to rotate. To tear this breakable area when using for the first time, closure cap <b>450</b> is used. This has a hollow, ribbed housing <b>451</b> of complementary shape to that of the side wall <b>419</b> of the top portion <b>416</b> of outer neck <b>413</b>. This top portion <b>416</b> is connected to outer neck <b>413</b> via a notched ring-shaped area <b>417</b>. The top portion <b>416</b> is hollow so that the top portion <b>426</b> of the inner tube can be housed in its cavity. The inner and outer surfaces of the side wall <b>419</b> are provided with ribs, giving a relief that is complementary to the contour of the side wall <b>429</b> of the inner top portion <b>426</b> and to the contour of the hollow housing <b>451</b> of closure cap <b>450</b> respectively, to ensure that the inner <b>429</b> and outer <b>419</b> top portions are made to rotate relatively and simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0057">The slender ring-shaped zone <b>427</b> is placed on the side wall of the inner neck <b>423</b> so that after assembly of the inner neck and the outer neck, it is on the outer surface of the double tube, i.e. it is &#x201c;above&#x201d; the mouth <b>4130</b> of the outer neck <b>413</b>. When molding the head of the inner tube, the axial position of the slender ring-shaped zone is defined by its distance from the clipping system rib of the inner neck <b>423</b>, which must be greater than the distance between mouth <b>4130</b> and the clipping system groove of the outer neck <b>413</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0058">Once cap <b>450</b> has been turned through 180&#xb0;, hollow housing <b>451</b> acts as a lock inside which the top portion <b>416</b> of the outer neck <b>413</b>, which acts as a key, is inserted. Closure cap <b>450</b> is turned around the axis, causing a tear located at the level of the notched breakable ring-shaped zone <b>417</b> and another tear at the level of the notched breakable ring-shaped zone <b>427</b>. As the mouth <b>4230</b> of the inner neck <b>423</b> remains above mouth <b>4130</b> of the outer neck <b>413</b>, the leak-tight seal <b>480</b> first comes into contact with the inner mouth <b>4230</b> to ensure leak-tightness between products. This leak-tight seal <b>480</b> is made from an elastomer. It is flexible and thick enough to also come into contact with the outer mouth <b>4130</b> and to ensure that the products are properly sealed in relation to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0059">In the example illustrated, hollow ribbed housing <b>451</b> has a shape that is complementary and very similar to that of the side wall <b>419</b> of the top portion <b>416</b> of the outer neck <b>413</b>, so that after the breakable zone <b>417</b> has burst, said top portion remains trapped in said hollow housing, acting as proof that the recipient has been used for the first time. Similarly, the top portion <b>426</b> of the inner tube can also remain trapped in the hollow of the top portion <b>416</b> of the outer tube.</p>
