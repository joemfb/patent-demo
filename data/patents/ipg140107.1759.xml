<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The subject matter of the present application refers to compression therapy devices and methods of treatment, in particular to a device and method of treatment of lymphedema.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Lymphedema is a medical condition in which lymphatic return in the soft tissues is interrupted or reduced. The area of the body from which outflow has been compromised becomes swollen with lymph fluid, and as the condition progresses, may become fibrotic as scar tissue accumulates. Lymphedema generally affects the extremities but may also affect the abdomen, genitals and other areas of the torso. When the limb becomes fibrotic and greatly enlarged, the disease is known as elephantiasis. Lymphedema can afflict people of any size; however, it frequently afflicts the morbidly obese. In some cases the patient's lymphedema is in itself the cause of morbid obesity; in other cases, morbid obesity leads to lymphedema.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Lymphedema is treated primarily by compression and special massage. One of the most effective techniques is calibrated gradient sequential compression therapy with a multiplicity of inflating chambers, which inflate and deflate in a predetermined sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">U.S. Pat. No. 6,406,445 discloses a garment comprising a pneumomassage articulated sleeve adapted to fit onto a foot, lower leg and an abdominal area of a patient afflicted with lymphedema or other disorder resulting in excess body fluid. Enveloped by the sleeve is a series of overlapping inflatable cells which when the sleeve is worn, are sequentially inflated to create massaging forces giving rise to a peristaltic action pumping the excess fluid away from the foot, leg and abdominal area. Along the rear of the sleeve is a row of transverse slots forming articulation joints, each of which is normally fastened. To accommodate the sleeve to the patient's foot to be treated, a slot in the row is unfastened to define a foot section conforming to the foot of the patient and a leg section hinged to the foot section conforming to the lower leg of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There are only a few systems available for treating lymphedema of the morbidly obese, as these patients vary widely in shape, requiring expensive custom garments.</p>

        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0038">The bag used in the method described above may comprise any of the features according to the above aspects of the subject matter according to the present application, in any combination.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0039">The method may further comprise an adjustment of the length of the separating insert by reducing therefrom or adding thereto said inflatable cells.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0040">The method may further comprise accommodating the patient within the bag so that the patient's feet are received within the feet area of the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0041">The method may further comprise adjusting the adjustable region from its extended state to its folded state by means of the fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0042">Due to the structure of the bag according to the subject matter of the present application, and in particular the way it forms pants, the bag according to the subject matter of the present invention can diminish or even eliminate any need in assistance to a patient in wearing it or in receiving a therapy. This fact is especially important for morbidly obese patients who suffer from restricted mobility due to their great weight having extreme difficulty donning and doffing pneumatic compression therapy garments and usually do not have any assistance in donning and doffing pneumatic compression therapy garments for treating lymphedema.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0043">In this connection, it should be noted that lymphedema affects the morbidly obese in the abdomen and inner legs, more so than in the normative sized lymphedema patient. Lymphedema of morbid obesity tends to affect the abdomen, which is often pendulous, sometimes hanging down below the knees. Patients with morbid obesity may get huge lobules of fat and lymphatic fluid, known as &#x201c;massive localized lymphedema,&#x201d; on their inner thighs and legs. The bag according to the subject matter of the present application can access and, therefore, treat these areas. In particular, the separating insert, being located between the patient's legs, is configured for applying pressure to the inner parts of the legs. The adjustable regions of the bag, when kept in their folded state by the fastener, apply increased pressure to the abdominal area of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0044">The bag according to the subject matter of the present application has great adjustability due to the possibility to control the separating insert's length, to achieve a better fit between the bag and the patient by fastening the adjustable regions and the option to add adjustment side inserts. This allows the bag to be produced as a one-size garment, overcoming great size and extreme variability of shapes of the patients, which is extremely advantageous for mass production, and then be adjusted individually for each patient at bedside without compromising the compression. In addition, the bag overcomes significant fluctuations in the patients' shape and size that may occur as treatment progresses.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0101">The bag <b>10</b> can further comprise adjustment side inserts, such as, for example, inserts <b>151</b> and <b>153</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13B and 13C</figref>. The adjustment side inserts are configured for the insertion between the right edges <b>27</b> and <b>37</b> and the left edges <b>29</b> and <b>39</b> (not seen) of the front <b>21</b> and back <b>31</b> parts of the bag <b>10</b>, and they have fastening means <b>155</b> which can be of the same kind as the closure means <b>41</b> of the bag <b>10</b> and can be configured for detachable engagement therewith, increasing thereby the distance between the right edges <b>27</b> and <b>37</b> and the left edges <b>29</b> and <b>39</b> and fitting the size of the bag <b>10</b> to a patient.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0102">As seen, the adjustment side inserts have a length corresponding to that of the bag and they can have a uniform height along their entire length, such as the insert <b>151</b>, or can vary in height, e.g., have an area of local widening such as in the insert <b>153</b>, allowing to suit the width of the bag to local peculiarities of the patient's body.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0103">As mentioned above, the bag <b>10</b> is configured to apply pressure to the body of a patient P by inflating and deflating the bag's cells according to a predetermined protocol, which can be any protocol known per se for the treatment of such diseases as of lymphatic/circulatory disorders and deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0104">In order to start the treatment, a patient has to be located within the bag, and in as close fitting as possible should be provided of the bag's geometry to the patient's body. There are three main stages by which this can be done, when the bag is first used by the patient, namely, a pre-adjustment preparatory stage, a final preparatory stage and a final adjustment stage, as described in detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A to 14D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0105">At the pre-adjustment preparatory stage relevant dimensions of the patient P, such as the length of the legs, circumference of the patient's body at different locations thereof, etc., are measured and, if necessary, the adjustable zones <b>123</b>, <b>125</b> and <b>127</b> of the adjustment layer <b>121</b> of the back part <b>31</b> of the bag are partially or completely closed, if needed. In addition, if so required, the adjustment side inserts such as the insert <b>151</b> or <b>153</b>, are attached to the right and left sides of the bag <b>10</b>. Alternatively, the side inserts may be added at a later stage. Based on the length of the patient's legs, a decision is made on the desired length L of the separating insert arrangement <b>51</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0106">Before and during the performance of the above pre-adjustment preparatory stage, the front part <b>21</b> of the bag <b>10</b> can be completely separated from the back part <b>31</b>, or can be attached to the back part at least along the feet area <b>130</b> and a part of the lower portion <b>13</b> of the bag <b>10</b> adjacent thereto, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14A</figref>, if in its initial state, the bag already had its separating insert arrangement <b>51</b> of a suitable length installed.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0107">At the final preparatory stage, the separating insert <b>51</b> is installed, and if its desired length is shorter than the maximal length of the insert, the installation is made without the detachable member <b>83</b>, i.e., only the ridges <b>53</b> and <b>53</b>&#x2032; of the separating insert arrangement <b>51</b> are installed. If the bag in its initial state had the detachable member <b>83</b> installed, at this stage the member <b>83</b> is removed. If the front part <b>21</b> has not yet been attached to the back part at the lowermost area of the lower portion <b>13</b> of the bag, this is then done at this stage and the tubes <b>93</b> and <b>93</b>&#x2032; connected to the inlets <b>91</b> and <b>91</b>&#x2032; of the cells I<sub>M </sub>to I<sub>N </sub>and I<sub>M</sub>&#x2032; to I<sub>N</sub>&#x2032; of the ridges <b>53</b> and <b>53</b>&#x2032; are then connected to the corresponding outlets <b>69</b> and <b>69</b>&#x2032; of the cells C<sub>M </sub>to C<sub>N </sub>and C<sub>M</sub>&#x2032; to C<sub>N</sub>&#x2032; of the respective front and back parts <b>21</b> and <b>31</b> of the bag <b>10</b>. In addition, if the desired length of the separating insert <b>51</b> is shorter than the length of its ridges <b>53</b> and <b>53</b>&#x2032;, the ridges are installed with their cells that are not to be inflated, folded (not shown). Normally, the latter cells would be those that are furthest from the lower end <b>14</b> of the bag <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0108">The final preparatory stage results in the bag <b>10</b> having therein pants and being opened at two sides thereon at least along the upper portion <b>11</b> of the bag <b>10</b>, thus being ready for the patient to enter it as regular pants, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0109">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14C</figref>, the final adjustment stage is performed with the patient having entered the bag <b>10</b>, having the separating insert arrangement <b>51</b> between his/her legs and having his/her feet located at the feet area <b>130</b> of the bag <b>10</b>. At this stage the position the ridges <b>51</b> and <b>51</b>&#x2032; can be displaced right or left to fit the actual position of the patient's legs, and the upper portion of the front part <b>21</b> of the bag <b>10</b>, is arranged to cover the patient so as to allow the front part's complete attachment to the back part <b>31</b> by the closure means <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0110">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14D</figref>, upon the patient being fully wrapped by the bag <b>10</b> so that the upper portion <b>11</b> of the bag accommodates the abdominal area of the patient's body and the lower portion <b>13</b> of the bag accommodates the patient's legs, final adjustment is performed, if necessary, using one or more of the adjustable zones <b>103</b>, <b>105</b>, <b>107</b> and <b>139</b>, to achieve a more tight fit between the bag <b>10</b> and the patient P. The tightening strap <b>109</b> is then tightened.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0111">The above procedures can be performed by the patient alone or with assistance of another person, if available, in which case the patient can lie down on the back part <b>31</b> of the bag after the pre-adjustment preparatory stage, and the assisting person to perform for him the remaining procedures.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0112">Moreover, it can be possible for a patient to enter the bag being in vertical position, in case the bag's back part <b>31</b> is attached to a special bed which can be moved between a vertical state and a horizontal state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A-15D</figref>. This option can be advantageous for patients that are incapable of taking themselves a horizontal position. Once the bag <b>10</b> is closed and the patient is accommodated therein (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14E</figref>), the plugs <b>68</b> and <b>68</b>&#x2032; are connected to the pressure source (not shown) to allow the application of inflation-deflation cycles to the cells C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>N </sub>and C<sub>1</sub>&#x2032; to C<sub>N</sub>&#x2032;, and consequently the cells I<sub>M </sub>to I<sub>N </sub>and the cells I<sub>M</sub>&#x2032; to I<sub>N</sub>&#x2032;, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0113">In operation, the cells C<sub>1 </sub>to C<sub>N </sub>and C<sub>1</sub>&#x2032; to C<sub>N</sub>&#x2032; when inflated increase their dimension in a direction perpendicular to the axes A<sub>1 </sub>and A<sub>2</sub>, as shown by arrows D<sub>1 </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and thereby apply pressure to the corresponding parts of the front and the back of the patient including front and back regions of his legs. The cells I<sub>M </sub>to I<sub>N </sub>and I<sub>M</sub>&#x2032; to I<sub>N</sub>&#x2032; are inflated simultaneously with the cells C<sub>M </sub>to C<sub>N </sub>and C<sub>M</sub>&#x2032; to C<sub>N</sub>&#x2032; since they are in fluid communication, as detailed above, whereby their dimension is increased along the transverse axis A<sub>2</sub>, as shown by arrows D<sub>2</sub>, thereby applying pressure to the side regions of the legs of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0114">The pressure source can be a compatible pneumatic compression therapy system control unit, such as, for example, Lympha Press Optimal&#x2122;, produced by the Applicant or other compatible pneumatic compression therapy control units compressors used in the industry.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0115">Those skilled in the art to which this invention pertains will readily appreciate that numerous changes, variations and modifications can be made without departing from the scope of the invention, mutatis mutandis.</p>
