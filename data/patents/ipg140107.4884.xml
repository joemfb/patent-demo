<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED PATENT APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the priority benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0009153, filed on Feb. 1, 2010, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments relate to a photographing apparatus, and more particularly, to a photographing apparatus comprising a shake correction module.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A photographing apparatus takes photographs of an object. Recently, photographing apparatuses such as digital still cameras and digital video cameras are widely used.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A photographing apparatus generally includes an optical system including a lens unit, an imaging device disposed near the lens unit, an image processing unit that processes electrical signals received from the imaging device, and a memory for storing captured images.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A conventional photographing apparatus is operated as follows. When a photograph is taken, light corresponding to an image of an object is transmitted through the optical system and onto the imaging device, which may be a charge-coupled device (CCD). Accordingly, the imaging device transforms the incident image light into an electrical signal, the image processing unit processes the image signal, and then the memory stores the photographed image.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Recently, in order to prevent a reduction in definition with respect to an image due to shaking or an external impact, a shake correction module is employed in a photographing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A conventional shake correction module generally adopts an electronic shake correction method or an optical shake correction method.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The electronic shake correction method produces an un-shaken image by electronically controlling locations and colors of the image after detecting shaking from a result of the image.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The optical shake correction method produces an un-shaken image by moving the lens or the imaging device in directions which offset shaking of the photographing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The optical shake correction method is superior to the electronic shake correction method in that the optical shake correction method does not generate an afterimage, performs a zooming operation without difficulty, and generates clean images, and thus is widely used.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The shake correction technique of photographing apparatuses is continuously developed, and high performance shake correction modules are continuously being developed to meet market requirements.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The timing generator <b>129</b> inputs a timing signal to the imaging device <b>118</b>. The timing signal generated by the timing generator <b>129</b> determines a shutter speed. That is, the imaging device <b>118</b> is driven according to the timing signal generated by the timing generator <b>129</b>. Thus, when an image is input to the photographing apparatus <b>100</b> while the imaging device <b>118</b> is being driven, an electrical signal as a basis of image data is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The control unit <b>131</b> generates and transmits signal commands to the imaging device <b>118</b>, the timing generator <b>129</b>, or the CDS circuit <b>122</b>, or generates operational commands corresponding to an input operation by the operation unit <b>132</b>. In the current embodiment, the photographing apparatus <b>100</b> includes only one control unit <b>131</b>; however, the signal commands may be generated by one control unit and the operational commands may be generated by another control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The control unit <b>131</b> performs an image processing function. That is, the control unit <b>131</b> typically performs gamma correction on the captured data transmitted from the imaging device <b>118</b>. The gamma correction denotes coding of information to match the non-linearity of human eyes. That is, since human eyes react non-linearly with respect to brightness, according to Weber's law, when a limited bit depth is given, posterization is caused if the brightness of light is linearly recorded. Therefore, in order to display a high quality image having a given bit depth, image information must be coded using a non-linear transfer function. This performance is referred to as gamma correction.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The control unit <b>131</b> performs gamma correction on an input image signal according to a gamma curve. For example, the control unit <b>131</b> performs gamma correction on an input image signal having 12 bit brightness levels to generate a signal having 8 bit brightness levels.</p>

However, other buttons and operational keys may be included in the operation unit <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">The memory <b>134</b> is an example of an image memory unit, and temporarily stores image data or data required for operations. The memory <b>134</b> has a memory capacity that is sufficient to store a plurality of images. Reading and writing of an image from and into the memory <b>134</b> is controlled by the image input controller <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The VRAM <b>136</b> maintains contents of images displayed on the LCD <b>128</b>. The resolution and the maximum display color of the LCD <b>128</b> depend on the capacity of the VRAM <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The recording media <b>140</b> is an example of an image recorder, and records captured images.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The flash <b>150</b> instantly generates a flash of light when photographing in a dark place. The flash <b>150</b> is used in a flash mode such as an auto-flash mode, a forced lighting mode, a light prohibited mode, a red-eye prevention mode, or a slow synchronization mode.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The auxiliary light emitting device <b>160</b> radiates auxiliary light onto an object so that the photographing apparatus <b>100</b> can automatically focus rapidly and correctly on the object when the amount of light from the object is not enough or photos are taken at night.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">An operation of temporarily fixing the shake correction module <b>114</b> of the photographing apparatus <b>100</b> by using the fixing member <b>116</b> according to an embodiment will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 9</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">When the power button <b>132</b><i>b </i>of the photographing apparatus <b>100</b> is pressed, the photographing apparatus <b>100</b> is in an &#x201c;ON&#x201d; state. Then, the control unit <b>131</b> moves the lens module <b>111</b> forward along the optical axis toward the front of the photographing apparatus <b>100</b> by operating the lens module driving unit <b>112</b>. In this case, the control unit <b>131</b> also controls the lens cap assembly <b>111</b><i>c </i>to open an optical path so that the photographing apparatus <b>100</b> may be in a photographing ready-state.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">In this case, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 6</figref>, the lens module <b>111</b> protrudes out from the front of the photographing apparatus <b>100</b>, and the lens module <b>111</b> is separated from the fixing member <b>116</b>. In this case, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the fixing member <b>116</b> and the shake correction module <b>114</b> are separated from each other. In this state, if the photographing apparatus <b>100</b> is in a shake correction mode, an image shake is compensated for by operating the shake correction module <b>114</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In this case, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 8</figref>, the lens module <b>111</b> moves in a rear direction of the lens module <b>111</b> toward an inner side of the lens barrel <b>110</b>, and presses the fixing member <b>116</b>. At this point, the elastic member <b>117</b> is compressed and the fixing member <b>116</b> presses the shake correction module <b>114</b>, and thus the shake correction module <b>114</b> is temporarily fixed. As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the contact member <b>116</b><i>a </i>of the fixing member <b>116</b> presses against the shake correction module <b>114</b>, and thus the shake correction module <b>114</b> is temporarily fixed due to friction between the contact member <b>116</b><i>a </i>and the shake correction module <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">When the fixing member <b>116</b> temporarily fixes the shake correction module <b>114</b>, even if the photographing apparatus <b>100</b> is shaken, the shake correction module <b>114</b> is prevented from vibrating and making any noise since the shake correction module <b>114</b> is fixed by the fixing member <b>116</b>.

Then, as described above, the lens module <b>111</b> moves forward along the optical axis toward the front of the photographing apparatus <b>100</b>. In this case, a force pressing on the fixing member <b>116</b> is removed, the potential energy of the compressed elastic member <b>117</b> is transformed into kinetic energy, and then the fixing member <b>116</b> returns to its original position. As a result, the contact between the fixing member <b>116</b> and the shake correction module <b>114</b> is released.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As described above, the lens barrel <b>110</b> according to the present embodiment and the photographing apparatus <b>100</b> having the lens barrel <b>110</b> may prevent the shake correction module <b>114</b> from making noise and vibrating when the photographing apparatus <b>100</b> is shaking and may prevent the shake correction module <b>114</b> from being out of order due to excessive shaking of the photographing apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref>, according to the current embodiment, a first inclined surface <b>314</b><i>a </i>is formed on a portion of the shake correction module <b>314</b> that contacts the fixing member <b>316</b>, and a second inclined surface <b>316</b><i>a </i>is formed on a portion of the fixing member <b>316</b> that contacts the first inclined surface <b>314</b><i>a </i>of the shake correction module <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">When the photographing apparatus <b>100</b> is in the &#x201c;ON&#x201d; state, the lens module <b>111</b> protrudes out from the front of the photographing apparatus <b>100</b>.

In this case, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, the first inclined surface <b>314</b><i>a </i>contacts the second inclined surface <b>316</b><i>a</i>, and thus the first inclined surface <b>314</b><i>a </i>slides along the second inclined surface <b>316</b><i>a </i>since force is applied to the first inclined surface <b>314</b><i>a </i>in a direction indicated by an arrow.

However, as described above, when the shake correction module <b>314</b> moves in a direction indicated by the arrow, that is, a direction perpendicular to the optical axis, the balance of elastic force of the elastic supporting unit <b>115</b><i>a </i>is broken. Accordingly, the shake correction module <b>314</b> is biased on a side. At this point, an elastic force for restoring the position of the shake correction module <b>314</b> is generated in a direction opposite to the biased direction. However, since the direction of the elastic force and the direction of force generated by the fixing member <b>316</b> are opposite to each other, the shake correction module <b>314</b> is fixed by the balance of force.</p>
