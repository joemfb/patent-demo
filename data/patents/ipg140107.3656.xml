<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The exemplary embodiments may generally relate to management of tools, and may more specifically relate to tracking of tools in supply chain management.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Surgical instrument storage and sterilization systems are known. These systems, sometimes referred to as surgical instrument trays or surgical instrument kits, typically include metal or plastic trays that hold a variety of general purpose and/or procedure specific surgical instruments, such as, forceps, scissors, clamps, retractors, scalpels, etc. These trays are brought into the operating room (OR) when preparing for surgery, and also are used as a means to organize, transport, and store surgical instruments in a medical facility.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A primary function provided by surgical trays, in addition to storage, is to facilitate group sterilization. Sterilization is of paramount importance in a surgical setting, such as a hospital, to prevent infecting patients undergoing surgery with potentially deadly infections. Prior to and after every surgical procedure, all surgical instruments and trays must be sterilized before subsequent usage. In order to increase the speed and efficiency of sterilization, entire surgical trays containing several instruments often are placed in a sterilization chamber at once. The sterilization chamber may apply to the trays and to all the instruments contained therein, any combination of heat, pressure, fluid, and/or vaporous sterilant. Sterilization techniques are well known. Thus, a detailed discussion of them has been intentionally omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Because of the need to perform sterilization and the general need to maintain surgical instrument kits in good working order, they often are transported in and out of medical facilities through a distribution center for processing. For example, several surgical instrument kits may be picked up from a hospital or other medical facility at one time. In order to easily and efficiently transport the kits, several kits are placed in a single shipping tote. The shipping tote is a large bin, usually made of plastic or other durable, lightweight material that is able to securely hold two or more instrument kits inside. A worker then may load the shipping totes into a vehicle thereby reducing the number of manual operations that must be performed. Before transporting each shipping tote, a bar coded shipping label is sometimes prepared that identifies certain information such as the point of origin, the destination, and possibly the contents of the tote, i.e., the identification number of each surgical instrument tray contained in the tote. The bar coded label allows the tote to be easily and efficiently tracked and entered into inventory at the receiving facility. These labels are sometimes referred to as &#x201c;airbills.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Over time, and through ordinary usage, as well as due to rigors of the sterilization process, surgical instruments suffer wear and tear and eventually reach the end of their life cycle. Thus, it is necessary to periodically inspect and maintain records on usage of surgical instruments so that they can be replaced as necessary. Also, due to the fact that they are constantly moved from the operating room to sterilization, to storage through processing facilities, and back to the operating room, various instruments on a given tray may become lost. Because certain instruments are so specialized that they have no functional substitutes, it also has become necessary to regularly inspect trays and to readily identify specific instruments that are missing.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Existing technology for uniquely marking surgical instruments for identification is based upon visual markings, bar coding, or two-dimensional (2D) matrix (micro-dots) marking. These technologies are limited by being orientation restrictive, highly manual, require complex manufacturing processes, or are intrusive to the user of the instrument. Moreover, existing methods for performing these necessary identification functions are overly reliant on costly human interpretation. In some cases, a skilled technician may be required to identify the surgical instruments, which keeps the skilled technician from performing other valuable functions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The description herein of various advantages and disadvantages associated with known apparatus, methods, and materials is not intended to limit the scope of the invention to their exclusion. Indeed, various embodiments of the invention may include one or more of the known apparatus, methods, and materials without suffering from their disadvantages.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The following description is intended to convey a thorough understanding of the exemplary embodiments by providing a number of specific exemplary embodiments and details involving exemplary methods and apparatuses for embedding a transmitter into a tool and exemplary systems for communicating with tools having an embedded transmitter. It should be appreciated, however, that the exemplary embodiments are not limited to these specific embodiments and details. It is further understood that one possessing ordinary skill in the art, in light of known systems, methods, and apparatuses, would appreciate the use of the exemplary embodiments for their intended purposes and benefits in any number of alternative embodiments, depending upon specific design and other needs.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit the scope of the exemplary embodiments. As used throughout this disclosure, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an,&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural reference unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, a reference to &#x201c;a tool&#x201d; includes a plurality of such tools, as well as a single tool, and a reference to &#x201c;an instrument&#x201d; is a reference to one or more instruments and equivalents thereof known to those skilled in the art, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meanings as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. All publications mentioned herein are cited for the purpose of describing and disclosing the various implants, prosthesis, components, methods of implantation, coatings and surface treatments, and other components that are reported in the publications that might be used in connection with the embodiments. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the embodiments described herein are not entitled to antedate such disclosures by virtue of prior invention.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein, the expressions and terms &#x201c;surgical instrument,&#x201d; &#x201c;surgical tool,&#x201d; &#x201c;instrument,&#x201d; or &#x201c;tool&#x201d; will refer to any type of surgical or medical instrument or portable equipment or device to which it may be desirable to attach a transmitter, such as, but not limited to, a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag. Though the specification is written in the context of medical and/or surgical instruments, it should be appreciated that the transmitter of the exemplary embodiments may be used with a variety of different items to be identified as shape and design constraints permit, including tools and equipment in other fields unrelated to the medical field. This may include hand tools or other objects and/or equipment that are used in construction, manufacturing, maintenance, automotive, consumer, aviation, or other similar and differing industries.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The exemplary embodiments may generally relate to placing a transmitter below the surface of a tool, such as, but not limited to, a surgical instrument or other metal tools or utensils, and encapsulating the transmitter in a protective material. In an exemplary embodiment, natural conductive properties of the metal instrument may allow a transmitter, such as, but not limited to, a Ultra-High Frequency (UHF) transmitter or a Microwave RFID) tag, to be completely embedded below the metal surface of the tool and also may allow the transmitter to communicate identification information about the tool.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The exemplary embodiments also may overcome problems with embedding a transmitter in a metal tool. Simply embedding a transmitter within a metal instrument may be problematic for at least the following three reasons. First, conventional transmitter form factors may not be designed for use with very small diameter or thin surface tools, which may frequently occur in surgical instruments.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Second, embedding a transmitter operating at radio frequency (RF), ultra-high frequency (UHF), and microwave frequencies in an electrical conductor may severely detune the performance of the transmitter. Detuning may generally refer to a degradation in performance of the transmitter. Detuning may occur because the electrical conductor absorbs and reflects electromagnetic wireless signals, which may modify the frequency of the wireless signal. This may cause problems when a wireless reader device expects to receive a wireless signal from the transmitter within a certain frequency band, and, because of the electrical conductor, the modified frequency of the wireless signal may fall outside of the frequency band and may not be detected by the wireless reader device.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Third, affixing a transmitter to a surgical instrument may be problematic due to the sterilization requirements of surgical instruments, and the specialty of surgical instruments may limit any changes that may affect the aesthetics, function, or ergonomics of the instruments for users. Exemplary embodiments overcome transmitter design limitations allowing for a very small, low profile transmitter that performs highly while embedded within a metal tool.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Exemplary embodiments are initially discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a tool <b>100</b> having a slot <b>108</b> prior to placing a transmitter <b>104</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in the slot <b>108</b>. The tool <b>100</b> may be a surgical tool, such as, but not limited to, a scalpel useable during surgery, or other types of surgical and non-surgical tools. The tool <b>100</b> also may be of other sizes and shapes, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The slot <b>108</b> may be formed in an outer wall of a body <b>102</b> of the tool <b>100</b>. In various exemplary embodiments, the body <b>102</b> may be composed of an electrical conductor. Any electrical conductor, such as, but not limited to, a metal, surgical stainless steel, titanium, or other known electrical conductors may be used. The slot <b>108</b> may form a depression beneath the surface of the outer wall of the body <b>102</b>. The slot <b>108</b> may be formed using any machining mechanical process that etches into the body <b>102</b>. Alternatively, a tool die may form the slot <b>108</b> when the tool <b>100</b> is manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of the tool <b>100</b> with a transmitter <b>104</b> placed in the slot <b>108</b>. The transmitter <b>104</b> may be any device capable of wirelessly communicating RF, UHF, microwave frequency signals, or other wireless signals capable of containing information. The transmitter <b>104</b> may be a miniature electronic circuit that may include a microprocessor. The transmitter <b>104</b> may be adapted to wirelessly communicate in various wireless environments. Various wireless environments may include responding to a RF signal emitted from a RF field generator, where, upon receipt of the RF signal, the transmitter <b>104</b> may transmit a wireless response signal with information about the transmitter <b>104</b>. Alternatively, the RF signal may be a RF field. The transmitter <b>104</b> may be referred to as passive in this wireless environment, where the transmitter <b>104</b> only transmits a signal after receiving a signal from another source. Alternatively, the transmitter <b>104</b> may be active and periodically or aperiodically transmit signals. In various exemplary embodiments, the transmitter <b>104</b> may be wireless signal powered (also referred to as beam powered), where power from a received wireless signal may energize circuitry of the transmitter <b>104</b> and may cause the transmitter <b>104</b> to perform a data operation, such as, but not limited to, emitting a wireless signal.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In an exemplary embodiment, the transmitter <b>104</b> may include an RFID tag. The basic structure and operation of RFID tags can be found in, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,075,632, 4,360,801, 4,390,880, 4,739,328 and 5,030,807, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entireties. RFID tags also may be described in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/341,489, titled &#x201c;Surgical Instrument Tray RFID Tag,&#x201d; filed Jan. 30, 2006, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety. In various exemplary embodiments, the transmitter <b>104</b> may be state machine oriented, have global lock capability, write to every non-locked byte, have multiple functions, write to one byte individually, have bulk write capability, have group select capability, be anti-collision capable (e.g., may sort X number of transmitters per second), have cyclic redundancy check (CRC) 16 messaging, operate over &#x2212;40&#xb0; C. to +85&#xb0; C., and may have high speed operation. The transmitter <b>104</b> may have other features, and/or combinations of one or more of these features, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The transmitter <b>104</b> may transmit data within specified frequency bands that conform to regulatory standards for the country in which the transmitter <b>104</b> is used. In various exemplary embodiments, the transmitter <b>104</b> may operate in the frequency band of 860-960 MHz. Alternatively, the transmitter <b>104</b> may operate at other frequency bands. Transmission within the frequency bands also may conform with the regulatory standards of the host country or the needs of the system, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The transmitter <b>104</b> may generally be rugged enough to survive typical use in a surgical environment. The transmitter <b>104</b> may be designed to survive multiple sterilization cycles that tools in a surgical environment may be exposed to, such as, but not limited to, autoclaving and citric passivation baths. Alternatively, the transmitter <b>104</b> may be designed to survive other harsh environments. Various exemplary embodiments may permit the transmitter <b>104</b> to survive harsh environments to which the tool <b>100</b> may be exposed, such as, but not limited to, extreme temperatures, high pressure, vibrations, droppage of the tool <b>100</b>, and harsh chemicals.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The transmitter <b>104</b> also may include a memory. The memory may include read/write functionality, which may allow certain stored information in the memory to be altered, re-evaluated, and read. The memory may have both locked and unlocked memory. Generally, the locked portion of the memory may be read only, and may not be changed without physically reprogramming the memory. The locked portion of the memory may store a unique identification number for identifying the transmitter <b>104</b> that corresponds to the tool <b>100</b>. The unique identification number may be used to index a database containing price, product name, manufacturer, and/or other information that may be used to track the tool <b>100</b> over its life cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The unlocked portion of the memory may store information on events occurring in the life cycle of the tool <b>100</b>. This information may include, but is not limited to, the number of times the tool has been used, identification numbers of the surgery in which the tool <b>100</b> was used, the number of times the tool <b>100</b> has been sterilized, the dates of inspection of the tool <b>100</b>, the operator who performed the inspection of the tool <b>100</b>, the name of the surgeon who performed surgery with the tool <b>100</b>, the location at which the tool <b>100</b> was last scanned, the names of the locations or hospitals where the tool <b>100</b> had been used, and/or other information that may be used to track the travel, usage, storage, and inspection of the tool <b>100</b> over its life cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a partial side view of an exemplary embodiment of the transmitter <b>104</b> within the slot of the tool <b>100</b>. During manufacturing of the tool <b>100</b>, the transmitter <b>104</b> may be inserted into the slot <b>108</b> after the slot <b>108</b> is formed in the tool <b>100</b>. In various exemplary embodiments, the transmitter <b>104</b> may have dual poles. A first of the dual poles of the transmitter <b>104</b> may be directly affixed to an inner wall <b>116</b> of the slot <b>108</b> with a conductive material or a conductive snap. The conductive material may be solder, a conductive epoxy, or any other suitable material to allow electrical current to flow between the body <b>102</b> of the tool <b>100</b> and the transmitter <b>104</b>. In an exemplary alternative embodiment, the transmitter <b>104</b> may be formed on a circuit board that has a pin that may be coupled to the inner wall <b>116</b> of the tool <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Attached at a second of the dual poles, the transmitter <b>104</b> may have a short, thin gauge, conductive antenna <b>106</b>. The antenna <b>106</b> may be adapted to radiate and/or emit a wireless signal generated by the transmitter <b>104</b>. The antenna <b>106</b> may be an antenna wire and may be circularly polarized or linearly polarized. In various exemplary embodiments, the antenna wire may be 30 aught magnetic wire. The antenna <b>106</b> may be made of a variety of conductive materials. Materials such as, but not limited to, conductive inks, wire trace (e.g., copper, silver, gold, etc.), and/or any conductive metal wire may be used as the conductive portion of the antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">During insertion of the transmitter <b>104</b>, the antenna <b>106</b> may be positioned within the slot <b>108</b> such that the antenna <b>106</b> is offset from contacting any metal surrounding the slot <b>108</b>. In other words, the antenna <b>106</b> may be positioned within the slot <b>108</b> so that no portion of the antenna <b>106</b> electrically contacts any wall of the slot <b>108</b>. A gap <b>110</b> may be located between the end of the antenna <b>106</b> and wall <b>112</b> of the slot <b>108</b>. The gap <b>110</b> may be a space between the end of the antenna <b>108</b> and the wall <b>112</b> so that the antenna <b>106</b> may not electrically contact the wall <b>112</b>. Thus, the only point of electrical contact of the transmitter <b>104</b> with the body <b>102</b> may be at the inner wall <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view along line A-A&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of an exemplary embodiment of the transmitter <b>104</b> embedded within the slot <b>108</b>. As depicted, the transmitter <b>104</b> may be positioned within the slot <b>108</b> of the body <b>102</b> of the tool <b>100</b> below the outer surface of the body <b>102</b>. The antenna <b>106</b> may be positioned within the slot <b>108</b> so that it does not contact side walls <b>404</b>A-B or base wall <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view along line A-A&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of an alternative exemplary embodiment of the transmitter <b>104</b> embedded within the slot <b>108</b>. As depicted, the transmitter <b>104</b> may be positioned within the slot <b>108</b> of the body <b>102</b> of the tool <b>100</b> below the outer surface of the body <b>102</b>. In this embodiment, the slot <b>108</b> may extends laterally through the body <b>102</b>, thus forming a hole through the body <b>102</b> of the tool <b>100</b> that is bounded by body halves <b>102</b>A and <b>102</b>B. The slot <b>108</b> may have other sizes and shapes, as will be appreciated by those of skill in the art. Forming the slot <b>108</b> laterally through the body <b>102</b> may permit the transmitter <b>104</b> to emit a wireless signal that is receivable over 360&#xb0; relative to a longitudinal axis of the tool <b>300</b>, which may not occur in the slot <b>108</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> because of base wall <b>402</b>. Additionally, having the slot <b>108</b> laterally formed through the body <b>102</b> may permit the transmitter <b>104</b> to be embedded deeper within the body <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The transmitter <b>104</b> may be quickly affixed within the slot <b>108</b> on the tool <b>100</b> prior to covering the transmitter <b>104</b> with a protective material. Once the transmitter <b>104</b> is inserted into the slot <b>108</b> and affixed to the body <b>102</b> at the inner wall <b>116</b>, the transmitter <b>104</b> and the antenna <b>106</b> then may be completely covered and/or sealed with a protective material, such as, but not limited to, a non-conductive material, such as, but not limited to, an epoxy, a silicone, a plastic, a rubber, or other non-conductive materials. The protective material may be visually clear, opaque, or be of a desired color, and may be adapted to withstand multiple sterilization cycles, such as, but not limited to, repeat autoclave cycles and citric passivation baths. The protective material also may protect the transmitter <b>104</b> from harsh chemicals during sterilization. Covering the transmitter <b>104</b> also may be referred to as overmolding or encapsulating. The protective material may cover the transmitter <b>104</b> such that the transmitter <b>104</b> may be embedded below the surface of the body <b>102</b> of the tool <b>100</b> and sealed. In an alternative exemplary embodiment, the transmitter <b>104</b> may not completely be embedded below the surface of the body <b>102</b> of the tool <b>100</b>. This may occur at an area of the tool <b>100</b> where there is low potential risk for the transmitter <b>104</b> being damaged or unintentionally removed or where the transmitter <b>104</b> does not interfere with an operator's use of the tool <b>100</b>. The protective material may protect the transmitter <b>104</b> as well as hold the transmitter <b>104</b> and the antenna <b>106</b> in place. Generally, the protective material may insulate the transmitter <b>104</b> and the dielectric properties of the protective material may permit energy from wireless signals to propagate through the protective material.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Once covered, the protective material may be processed so that the contour of the protective material substantially corresponds to the shape of the body <b>102</b> of the tool <b>100</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the body <b>102</b> having a substantially cylindrical shape. The slot <b>108</b> may be filled with the protective material to correspond to the contour of the cylindrical shape of the body <b>102</b> (also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-B</figref>). The protective material may be made from a material capable of being shaped after filling the slot <b>108</b> so that the contour matches the contour of the body <b>102</b>. The body <b>102</b> and the slot <b>108</b> may be of other geometric, asymmetrical, symmetrical, or other desired shapes, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Embedding the transmitter <b>104</b> in the tool <b>100</b> may provide advantages due to the conductive properties of the tool <b>100</b>. When the transmitter <b>104</b> emits a wireless signal, such as, but not limited to a UHF, RF, or, microwave signal, the transmitter <b>104</b> may utilize the metal in the tool <b>100</b> as an electrical ground plane, thus making the tool <b>100</b> a part of the antenna circuit. This may allow the antenna <b>106</b> to be much smaller than would typically be required to operate at UHF and microwave frequencies while still allowing the antenna <b>106</b> to resonate. Using the tool <b>100</b> as the ground plane minimizes detuning of the transmitter <b>104</b> as the tool <b>100</b> is held in differing ways during transmission by the transmitter <b>104</b>. Minimizing detuning may imply that the antenna <b>106</b> may be efficient and the electrical current flow may not be countering or cancelling out. The design of the antenna <b>106</b> may account for the effects of the dielectric properties of the protective material, the type of material selected for the antenna <b>106</b>, the overall size of the antenna <b>106</b>, the amount of protective material, the size of the tool <b>100</b>, and other properties and sizes of the components of the tool <b>100</b>. The antenna <b>106</b> also may allow for anti surface-current cancellation (same current direction), have a fully-radiated antenna design, have a dipole-like radiation pattern, and have a multiband return-loss response.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The design of the antenna <b>106</b> may depend upon the size of the tool <b>100</b>, the frequency of operation, and environmental conditions. The antenna <b>106</b> may be very small, less than one square inch or much larger, depending upon the operational requirements. For example, if the antenna <b>106</b> were placed in the slot <b>108</b> with an offset of approximately 0.010-0.020 inches from the walls of the slot <b>108</b> and the slot <b>108</b> filled with the protective material, the overall length of the antenna <b>106</b> at 915 MHz (UHF) may be 1.0-1.5 inches long, and at 2.45 Ghz (Microwave), the antenna <b>106</b> may be 0.5-1.0 inches long. In general, the length of the electromagnetic wave may affect the antenna design. The design may have the electrical length of the antenna <b>106</b> equal to the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. The length of the antenna <b>106</b> also may be a fraction of the length of the wavelength. For example, the length of the antenna <b>106</b> may be a quarter or an eighth of the wavelength. Other fractions of the length of the antenna <b>106</b> compared to the length of the wavelength may be used. Having the antenna <b>106</b> operating at RF, UHF, microwave, or other operating frequencies may allow a wireless reader device to wirelessly receive information from multiple transmitters <b>104</b> at the same time, may improve the distance over which wireless signals may be received from the transmitter <b>104</b>, and may prevent data collisions from multiple transmitters <b>104</b> simultaneously transmitting.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an exemplary embodiment of a system <b>500</b> communicating with tools <b>100</b>A-B having respectively embedded transmitters <b>104</b>A-B. In the depicted embodiment, the system <b>500</b> may include one or more tools <b>100</b>A-B, an Access Point <b>502</b>, a Network <b>504</b>, a Server <b>506</b>, and a Database <b>508</b>. In an alternative embodiment, the tools <b>100</b>A-B may be arranged on a tray, or may be placed within a container. The depicted number of components in the system <b>500</b> is exemplary. The system <b>500</b> may include more or less components, such as more or less tools <b>100</b>, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. The system <b>500</b> may respectively allow transmitters <b>104</b>A-B associated with the tools <b>100</b>A-B to wirelessly communicate information through the Access Point <b>502</b> and the Network <b>504</b> to the Server <b>506</b> and the Database <b>508</b>. The Access Point <b>502</b> may directly connect to the Network <b>504</b>, or may connect through a local area network (LAN), a wireless LAN (WLAN), an Internet Service Provider (ISP), or other methods for connecting to a network, which are known and are omitted for brevity.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The Access Point <b>502</b> may be a computing device that wirelessly communicates with the transmitters <b>104</b>A-B. In various exemplary embodiments, the Access Point <b>502</b> may be a wireless reader device and may include an RF field generator (reader) to wirelessly extract identification information, such as, but not limited to, a Universal Product Code (UPC), a product name, a unique identification number, or other information stored in the locked and unlocked portions of the memory of the transmitter <b>104</b>. The Access Point <b>502</b> also may comply with the regulatory standards of the host country. For example, in the United States and in North America, RF field generators may conform with Federal Communications Commission (FCC) unlicensed requirements, such as FCC Part 15. Europe sets similar standards, such as ETSI 300.400 869 MHz operation. Other countries may recognize either FCC or ETSI requirements or require the RF field generators to meet different requirements. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that it is within the scope of the various exemplary embodiments that the transmitter <b>104</b> and the Access Point <b>502</b> may be modified to meet various regulatory requirements of the host country.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In an exemplary embodiment in a surgical environment, tools <b>100</b>A-B may be placed on a tray and may be sent through a RF field generated by the Access Point <b>502</b>. Alternatively, the Access Point <b>502</b> may generate a RF signal. When the transmitters <b>104</b>A-B of the tools <b>100</b>A-B enter the RF field, the RF field may energize circuitry of the transmitters <b>104</b>A-B and may cause the circuitry to perform a data operation. In various exemplary embodiments, the data operation may cause the transmitter <b>104</b> to transmit a wireless response signal, such as, but not limited to, a RF or UHF signal, containing extraction data. The extraction data may include the identification information stored in the locked portion of the memory of the transmitter <b>104</b>, and/or may include information stored in the unlocked portion of the memory. Alternatively, the RF field generated by the Access Point <b>502</b> also may communicate update information to the transmitter <b>104</b> for storage in the unlocked portion of the memory of the transmitter <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">After the Access Point <b>502</b> receives the response wireless signal containing the identification information from the transmitter <b>104</b>, the Access Point <b>502</b> may communicate this information to the Server <b>506</b>, the Database <b>508</b>, or both. The identification information may be used to track the tool <b>100</b> to determine its location, to determine if the tool <b>100</b> has been placed on the wrong tray, to track the number of uses of the tool <b>100</b>, or other information about the tool over its life cycle. The Server <b>506</b> and/or the Database <b>508</b> may include a database table that stores information on each tool <b>100</b> similar to the information stored in the locked and unlocked portions of the memory of the transmitter <b>104</b>. Additionally, the database table also may store information for managing and tracking the tool <b>100</b> over its life cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a surgical environment, the Server <b>506</b>, the Database <b>508</b>, or both may review the identification information from one or more tools <b>100</b> communicated from the Access Point <b>502</b> to identify if the one or more tools <b>100</b> correspond to different manufacturers or sterilization processors. This may be beneficial since manufacturers or sterilization processors typically only service and sterilize their own tools. After reviewing the identification information from the one or more tools, the Server <b>506</b>, the Database <b>508</b>, or both, may, for example, communicate a signal for display to an operator at the Access Point <b>502</b> indicating that a tool is missing from the tray, that all tools are accounted for, that a tool is improperly included on the tray that belongs to a different manufacturer than the other tools, or other information that the operator may use to process the tool <b>100</b>. Thus, the transmitters <b>104</b>A-B embedded in the respective tools <b>100</b>A-B may prevent the one or more tools <b>100</b> from improperly being sent to the wrong manufacturers or sterilization processors. Moreover, this information may be used to identify if any tools are missing from the tray. Thus, the exemplary embodiments may save time in identifying tools and may prevent the loss of tools, while being able to withstand the processing rigors that the tools may experience.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Therefore, embedding the transmitter <b>104</b> in the toot <b>100</b> may not affect the physical appearance, aesthetics, function, or ergonomics of the instruments for users. When covered with the protective material, the transmitter <b>104</b> may be invisible or unobtrusive to the user of the tool <b>100</b>, but still allow for rapid, accurate, automatic, non-orientation restrictive identification and processing of the tool <b>100</b> in various processes of supply chain usages, as well as in tracking and managing use of the tool over its life cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The exemplary embodiments described herein are not to be limited in scope by the specific exemplary embodiments discussed. For example, although many of the embodiments disclosed herein have been described with reference to surgical instruments, the principles described herein are equally applicable to tracking and monitoring conductive instruments in other environments, such as, but not limited to, automotive, aviation, consumer, and other industries that track the use, maintenance, and location of instruments, tools, and utensils.
