<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">I. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a suspension rudder bar for an aircraft turbojet with fan hanger, as well as an engine suspension with fan hanger provided with such a rudder bar.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">II. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As illustrated in the side view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a fan turbojet comprises an air intake <b>10</b> extended with a large diameter front casing <b>11</b> housing the fan, such a casing being followed downstream with several primary flow casings <b>12</b> to <b>15</b>&#x2014;with substantially lower diameters&#x2014;accommodating the compression stages, the combustion chamber, the expansion stages in the turbines and the ejection nozzles. The diameters of the primary flow casings could overall increase slightly from upstream to downstream, that is from the compressors up to the ejection nozzles.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The incoming air is compressed in the fan, then divided in concentric flows, i.e. the primary flow surrounded with a secondary flow. The primary flow is compressed in the compression stages, mixed with a fuel in the combustion chamber for supplying hot gases, then expanded in the turbines so as to drive into rotation the fan and the compression stages, and then ejected for supplying a thrust. But most part of the thrust is formed by the secondary flow being directly ejected either in combination or separately from the primary flow. The flow rate ratio between the two secondary and primary flows, referred to as the dilution rate, enables to increase the engine power. Now, a high ratio between diameters of the fan casing <b>11</b> and the primary flow casings <b>12</b> to <b>15</b> helps to increase the dilution rate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An engine suspension, generally under a wing, allows the engine load to be transferred to the aircraft by an appropriate intermediary supporting structure. Conventionally, such a support is a rigid pylon <b>20</b> with an oblong shape, on which the engine hanging is made with external ferrules of the structural casings: one fastener <b>21</b> with the front casing <b>11</b> and one rear fastener <b>22</b> with the ejection casing <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Suspensions are generally designed so as to be &#x3c;&#x3c;fail-safe&#x3e;&#x3e;, that is able to prevent the aircraft engine from being detached. Such suspensions enable to manage different types of loads: vertical (weight of the engine), axial (thrust), lateral (wing buffeting) loads and torsions (induced by the engine rotating or by a turbine blade being lost). Such suspensions should be able to also accommodate thermal expansions and contractions of the engine, in particular at cruising speed. Such thermal variations induce a not insignificant change in the direction of loads acting on the suspensions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In &#x3c;&#x3c;fail-safe&#x3e;&#x3e; isostatic suspensions, the front <b>21</b> and rear <b>22</b> fasteners comprise rod links <b>23</b> and knee links <b>24</b> (also see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) on the casings <b>15</b> and <b>11</b>, operating in tension in vertical planes perpendicular to the rotation axis X&#x2032;X of the engine. The loads and the moments between the engine and the pylon are thus transmitted according to the operational reference plane&#x2014;formed by the rotation axis X&#x2032;X of the engine, a transversal axis Y&#x2032;Y and a vertical axis Z&#x2032;Z&#x2212;. Such a suspension is for example described in Patent FR 2,925,016.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The fail-safe suspension more specifically comprises connecting rods <b>30</b> or other thrust transmission frames between the hub <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the front casing <b>11</b> and the rear fastener <b>22</b> of the ejection casing <b>15</b> on the pylon <b>20</b>, or directly on such a pylon, in the vicinity of the rear fastener.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The top view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> more accurately shows the connecting rods <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>30</b><i>b </i>mounted by knee links <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>on a rudder bar <b>40</b>, being itself hinged by a knee link <b>41</b> on a central tongue <b>50</b> of a plate <b>51</b> fastened, as illustrated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, on the rear fastener <b>22</b>. In such architectures, the rudder bar <b>40</b> has a transversal width such that it also enables links <b>52</b><i>a</i>, <b>52</b><i>b</i>, beyond the connecting rod links <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, with lateral extensions <b>53</b><i>a</i>, <b>53</b><i>b </i>of the plate <b>51</b>. Should a connecting rod break, for example the connecting rod <b>30</b><i>b</i>, the plate <b>51</b> rotates anti-clockwise and the play between the extension <b>52</b><i>a </i>and the connecting rod <b>30</b><i>a </i>is consumed: forces will then be transmitted through the linking knee <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the remaining connecting rod <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">However, because of the large transversal width of the rudder bar, being needed for integrating all the links to the plate and to the connecting rods, a large master-couple could be generated in the case of a connecting rod break or of a tension on the fastener or the pylon. Moreover, such large transversal bulk solutions prohibit implementing thin aerodynamic lines.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">This invention aims at remedying such problems, in particular, it aims at achieving a rudder bar with a reduced master-couple and enabling to arrange thin aerodynamic lines.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">To this end, this invention proposes moving the contact areas toward the interior of the rudder bar and thereby reducing the transversal bulk thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">More precisely, the present invention aims at a suspension rudder bar for an aircraft turbojet, having the shape of a transversal axis bar&#x2014;symmetrical with respect to a plane of the turbojet crossing the engine rotation axis and parallel to a symmetry plane of the aircraft&#x2014;and comprising, on the one hand, links to thrust transmission connecting rods and, on the other hand, central link means to a fastening plate. Such a rudder bar extends perpendicular to the axis of the bar with spars on both sides of the central link means. Such spars have symmetry with respect to the transversal axis, and the sides of the spars extend along a male fork joint of the plate and are associated two by two for acting as a double abutment to the fork joint.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to particular embodiments:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0016">the spars of the rudder bar are substantially inscribed into triangles having an apex in the vicinity of the link to the transmission connecting rods;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0017">the rudder bar has a transversal bulk (TB) limited by the links to the transmission connecting rod links and an axial bulk (AB) limited by the spars inscribed in triangular apex (S) conformations located in the vicinity of the ends of the spars; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0018">the spars have a symmetry with respect to the transversal axis so that the rudder bar has a &#x3c;&#x3c;double arrow&#x3e;&#x3e; conformation.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0019">This invention also relates to an engine suspension for an aircraft turbojet with a fan hanger, provided with such a rudder bar, linked to a male fork joint of a plate for fastening to the pylon. In such a suspension, the spars of the rudder bar extend on a sufficient portion and at a determined distance from edges of the fork joint of the plate so as to be able to act as an abutment for the plate, with a suitable play, in the case of a torsion around the central link or should the connecting rod breaks.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0020">According to particular embodiments:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0021">the plate has an overall rectangular or isosceles trapezoid shape, drilled with holes crossed with means for fastening the plate to the pylon;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0022">the fork joint of the plate axially crosses the rudder bar so that the end of the fork joint appears on the side of the transmission connecting rods with respect to the transversal axis of the rudder bar;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0023">the fork joint of the plate has overall an isosceles trapezoid shape with a small base end beyond the rudder bar, between the two transmission connecting rods so that all the sides of the spars of the rudder bar extend along the male fork joint, the plate having a transversal bulk substantially similar to that of the rudder bar;</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0004" num="0024">the plate and the fork joint overall have the shape of an isosceles trapezoid.</li>

<p id="p-0023" num="0029">With reference to the views of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref><i>a </i>to <b>3</b><i>c</i>, the first exemplary embodiment is illustrated of a suspension rudder bar <b>140</b> for an aircraft turbojet according to this invention, in connection with a fastening plate <b>150</b> and transmission connecting rods <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b</i>, respectively in front, sideways and perspective views.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0030">This rudder bar <b>140</b> has the shape of a bar with a transversal axis Y&#x2032;Y, being symmetrical with respect to a plane P<sub>S </sub>of the turbojet intersecting the longitudinal rotation axis X&#x2032;X of the engine, parallel to the symmetry plane of the whole aircraft. Such a rudder bar is fastened, on the one hand, to the transmission connecting rods <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b </i>by knee links <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b </i>and, on the other hand, to a male fork joint <b>151</b> centrally extending&#x2014;in the symmetry plane P<sub>S</sub>&#x2014;the fastening plate <b>150</b>, also via a knee link <b>152</b> in a central position on the rudder bar <b>140</b>. The rudder bar <b>140</b> has a double wall <b>140</b>&#x2032;, <b>140</b>&#x2033; enabling to achieve the knee links <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b</i>, <b>152</b> on both sides of the connecting rods <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b </i>and of the fork joint <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0031">In this example, the connecting rods <b>130</b><i>a </i>and <b>130</b><i>b </i>provide the thrust transmission of the previously set forth type in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, i.e. between the hub <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the front casing <b>11</b> of the fan and the engine hanging pylon <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0032">According to this invention, the knee links <b>132</b><i>a </i>and <b>132</b><i>b </i>between the rudder bar <b>140</b> and the transmission connecting rods <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b </i>are arranged on the transversal ends <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the rudder bar <b>140</b>. The rudder bar does not extend according to the axis Y&#x2032;Y substantially beyond such links so that the transversal bulk (TB) thereof is reduced to a minimum. Such a reduced bulk enables to implement fine aerodynamic lines. The transversal bulk of the rudder bar is defined as the length of the rudder bar between its transversal ends <b>14</b><i>a </i>and <b>14</b><i>b</i>. Furthermore, in the case of a problem of a connecting rod torsion or breaking, the master-couple is reduced proportionally.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0033">From these transversal ends <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the rudder bar <b>140</b> extends according to both parallel walls <b>140</b>&#x2032; and <b>140</b>&#x2033; forming spars <b>141</b><i>a </i>and <b>141</b><i>b</i>, on each side of a median plane Pm containing the connecting rods <b>130</b><i>a</i>, <b>130</b><i>b </i>(see particularly <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>) along the fork joint <b>151</b>. Such extensions <b>141</b><i>a</i>, <b>141</b><i>b </i>are overall perpendicular to the transversal axis Y&#x2032;Y. They have a triangular shape (see in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>) with, for each, a side <b>141</b><i>c </i>joining the two walls <b>140</b>&#x2032; and <b>140</b>&#x2033; of the rudder bar along the male fork joint <b>151</b>, and an apex S coinciding with the ends <b>14</b><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b </i>in the vicinity of the knee links <b>132</b><i>a</i>, <b>132</b><i>b</i>. The axial bulk of the rudder bar is the maximum length of the rudder bar along the longitudinal X&#x2032;-X axis. The spars then define the axial bulk (AB) of the rudder bar.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0034">The side <b>141</b><i>c </i>of the rudder bar extends along the edges <b>151</b><i>c </i>of the male fork joint <b>151</b> on an extent and at a distance such that the rudder bar <b>140</b> can act as an abutment for the plate <b>150</b>, with a suitable play, in case of a torsion around the central link or a breaking of the connecting rod.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0035">The plate <b>150</b> has an overall rectangular shape drilled with holes <b>5</b> in ears <b>5</b><i>a </i>formed at each apex so that means for fastening the plate to the pylon (not shown) can cross it. The plate further comprises longitudinally, in the plane P<sub>S</sub>, a centering peg <b>6</b> for positioning the plate upon the fastening thereof, then resuming shearing the fastening screws.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0036">According to another exemplary embodiment, such as illustrated on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a </i>to <b>4</b><i>c</i>, respectively showing front, bottom, sideways and perspective views, the rudder bar <b>240</b> is in connection with a plate <b>250</b>, having an overall isosceles trapezoid shape, and transmission connecting rods <b>230</b><i>a</i>, <b>230</b><i>b</i>. As in the previous example, the knee links <b>232</b><i>a </i>and <b>232</b><i>b </i>with the connecting rods are formed substantially on the ends <b>240</b><i>a </i>and <b>240</b><i>b </i>of the rudder bar. In the present version, the spars of the rudder bar <b>241</b><i>a</i>, <b>241</b><i>b</i>, <b>241</b><i>c </i>and <b>241</b><i>d </i>are inserted into triangles, the apexes of which coincide with the ends <b>240</b><i>a</i>, <b>240</b><i>b </i>in the vicinity of the knee links <b>232</b><i>a</i>, <b>232</b><i>b </i>with the connecting rods <b>230</b><i>a</i>, <b>230</b><i>b</i>. The spars have a double symmetry with respect to the longitudinal symmetry plane P<sub>S </sub>and with respect to the transversal P<sub>T </sub>plane&#x2014;perpendicular to the plane P<sub>S </sub>and containing the transversal axis Y&#x2032;Y&#x2014;so that the rudder bar <b>240</b> has here overall a &#x3c;&#x3c;double arrow&#x3e;&#x3e; configuration, with the apexes S on the end of the opposite arrows. The transversal bulk (TB-<b>2</b>) of the rudder bar is defined as the length of the rudder bar between its transversal ends <b>240</b><i>a </i>and <b>240</b><i>b</i>. The axial bulk (AB-<b>2</b>) of the rudder bar is the maximum length of the rudder bar along the longitudinal X&#x2032;-X axis.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0037">The plate <b>250</b> is extended with a male fork joint <b>251</b> connected to the rudder bar by a central knee link <b>252</b>, the fork joint also extending the overall isosceles trapezoid shape of the plate <b>250</b> (see in particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>). The plate <b>250</b> is furthermore pierced with holes <b>7</b> in ears <b>7</b><i>a </i>formed at each apex of the trapezoid in order to enable means for fastening the plate to the pylon (not shown) to cross it. The plate <b>250</b> also comprises two shearing pegs <b>8</b> and <b>9</b> arranged in the longitudinal symmetry plane P<sub>S </sub>intended for resuming shearing the fastening screws for the plate <b>250</b> into the pylon. Such pegs, also taking part in centering the plate upon fastening, thereby ensure the mechanical hold of the fastening.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0038">The small end base <b>253</b> of the male fork joint <b>251</b> appears beyond the rudder bar, between the two connecting rods <b>230</b><i>a </i>and <b>230</b><i>b </i>so that the sides <b>242</b><i>a</i>, <b>242</b><i>b</i>, <b>242</b><i>c </i>and <b>242</b><i>d </i>of the spars <b>241</b><i>a </i>to <b>241</b><i>d </i>of the rudder bar <b>240</b> extend along the male fork joint <b>251</b>. The extension of these sides along the fork joint <b>251</b> and the distance to this fork joint are such that the rudder bar <b>240</b> can act as an abutment to the plate <b>150</b>, as in the previous example, doubling the number of spars and thus of abutments: according to the rotation direction of the rudder bar should a problem occur (breaking or torsion), either the sides <b>241</b><i>a </i>and <b>241</b><i>c </i>are associated together in abutment, or the sides <b>241</b><i>b </i>and <b>241</b><i>d </i>are associated together in abutment.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0039">This invention is not restricted to the described and represented embodiments. It is, for example, possible that the spars have another shape than triangular, for example convex, in particular concave. Furthermore, the plate and the fork joint could have other appropriate shapes, for example, polygonal for the plate and triangular for the fork joint. In addition, the fork joint forms with the plate in the symmetry plane P<sub>S </sub>an angle adapted to the tilt of the connecting rods with respect to the pylon. Moreover, the knee links could be substituted by any adapted linking type.</p>
