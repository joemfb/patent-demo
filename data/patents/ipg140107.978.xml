<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tracked vehicles are well known. They are generally used where the terrain is rough and unpredictable. Tracked vehicles are useful under user control, as well as for partially and fully autonomous mobile robots. One of the challenges with mobile robots is to provide a robot that can ascend and descend stairs, slopes, cross ditches, surmount certain obstacles, and generally operate over rough terrain whether moving forward or backward, turning on spot and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Motorized track unit for use with a wheelchair seating system or other undefined cargo systems, The Smart Trak device is capable of carrying its intended cargo across solid or loose surfaces such as grass, mud, dirt, sand or snow. It is also capable of traversing uneven or unsteady ground surfaces and having the abilities to scale incline/declines of approved stair sets, The device itself can be outfitted with a multitude of add-ons giving it the ability to allow handicapped persons the abilities to have a full function wheelchair system that allows them to go up/dawn stairs in both public and private settings. It can also be outfitted for use in the robotic fields, EOD/Military fields, commercial fields for cargo transportation, etc. Its use of an actuator to &#x201c;engage&#x201d; the track system and another to articulate the tracks to full length give it the ability to be useful in many different situations. It has, the ability to rotate the seat system/cargo forward and back to compensate for weight distributions and keep the inline cent of gravity in proportion to the angles of travel thus giving it the ability, to traverse stairs and other uneven terrain.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The invention is a tracked device, which includes (a) a main carrier frame; (b) a battery containment area carried on the main carrier frame; and (c) a motor controlled movement system for use with a seating system or for use with other implementable systems, which is attached to the main carrier frame.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a perspective view of the motorized track unit of this invention including a wheel chair mounted thereon. The device is carried on the main carrier frame for use in transporting persons or equipment (such as a wheelchair seat system or other structural device. This allows the movement of the system to articulate as needed to offset weight distributions and counter balance the devices movement during normal and off center axis operations (such as when going up/down stairs or across uneven ground). A pair of side motion units is used to raise/lower the attached track devices connected to the carrier frames. Each side has an actuator system that will allow the attached track device to articulate into a &#x201c;raised&#x201d; or &#x201c;lowered&#x201d; position in order to position the tracked unit into the needed position for use.</p>
