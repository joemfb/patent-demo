<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention was made in the course of research partially supported by a grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Bioscience and Engineering Institute, Grant No. NNC04AA21A, and from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR), Grant No. DE015384. The U.S. government has certain rights in the invention.</p>
<?GOVINT description="Government Interest" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates generally to delivery devices and a method for forming the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is a peptide hormone that is capable of exhibiting either anabolic or catabolic effects on bone, depending, at least in part, on the dosage and delivery pattern. Generally, a continuous high dose delivery of PTH leads to catabolic effects, while a continuous low dose or a pulsatile high dose delivery of PTH results in anabolic effects on bone. Daily injections may be an anabolic treatment, however, such treatment is less convenient and may not be favorable to patients. As such, controlled delivery of PTH, and other like substances, in an anabolic fashion is highly desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Attempts have been made to devise a successful system for pulsatile substance release. Such systems may be classified as stimulus-induced pulsatile release systems or self-regulated pulsatile release systems. In stimulus-induced delivery systems, drugs are triggered to release by external stimuli, such as temperature, pH, light, enzymes, electric and magnetic fields, and/or combinations thereof. While these stimulus-responsive devices have shown promising pulsatile release characteristics, many of the stimuli are not suitable or preferable for use in patients. In addition, most of the systems in this category are constructed using non-biodegradable polymers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In self-regulated pulsatile release systems, drugs are usually encapsulated within a barrier material, which is often composed of an erodible or biodegradable polymer. After the barrier material is dissolved, eroded or degraded, the drugs are rapidly released from the inner reservoir core. These systems are usually biocompatible and biodegradable, but multiple barriers or coatings may be required to achieve the desired multiple pulses of release. Multiple layers may, however, pose challenges in material properties and device fabrication technologies, often resulting in inconsistency.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Other attempts to devise a successful system for pulsatile substance release have included combining the self-regulated release reservoir design with a microfabrication technique. Disk-shaped biodegradable polymeric chips have been fabricated to achieve multi-pulse drug release. While this device may be useful, the reservoirs in the device are arranged parallel to each other, which potentially wastes space and limits the miniaturization capacity.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A delivery device includes a hollow container, and a plurality of biodegradable and/or erodible polymeric layers established in the container. A layer including a predetermined substance is established between each of the plurality of polymeric layers, whereby degradation of the polymeric layers and release of the predetermined substance occur intermittently. A method for forming the device is also disclosed herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Embodiments of the delivery device disclosed herein include a biodegradable polymer system with tunable erosion properties to enable controlled pulsatile release of one or more substances. The intervals between the pulses may be the same or different, and may advantageously be tailored for specific needs. Furthermore, the device may be configured in a variety of different ways, for example, to release the same substance over different pulses, to release a different substance or multiple substances at each pulse, to release the same or different amounts of the substance at least pulse, or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Such devices may be suitable for systemic and for local therapies. The device disclosed herein is biocompatible, and may be implanted in humans and animals to deliver therapeutics or other agents. As non-limiting examples, the device disclosed herein may be configured for osteoporosis treatment, bone regeneration, defective tissue treatment, ovulation induction, treatment of vasomotor symptoms, treatment of urogenital symptoms, endometrial hyperplasia treatment, allergic rash treatment, eczema treatment, and/or the like, and/or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1F</figref>, an embodiment of the method for forming an embodiment of the device <b>10</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> (a cross-sectional view) and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1F</figref> (a perspective view) is shown. Very generally, the method includes providing a hollow container <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), and establishing alternating layers of a biodegradable and/or erodible polymer <b>22</b> and a predetermined substance <b>24</b> in the hollow container <b>20</b>. In an embodiment, each of the alternating polymeric layers is a surface-erosion polymer.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A through 1D</figref> together depict the formation of the hollow container <b>20</b>. In an embodiment, the hollow container <b>20</b> is formed using a reverse solid free form fabrication technique. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a mold <b>30</b> having a desired shape for the hollow container <b>20</b> is formed having a bottom <b>26</b>, an interior layer <b>12</b>, an exterior layer <b>14</b> and an intermediate layer <b>16</b> between the layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. The configuration of the mold <b>30</b> (and the formed container <b>20</b>) may have any desirable size and/or shape. In an embodiment, the mold <b>30</b> and container <b>20</b> are substantially cylindrical. Generally, the thickness of the intermediate layer <b>18</b> is equal to the distance of the space between the layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> of the mold <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In an embodiment, the design of the mold <b>30</b> is created and converted into a stereolithography (STL) file using, for example, Rhinoceros software (Robert McNeel &#x26; Associates, Seattle, Wash.), and then imported into, for example, Modelworks software (Solidscape) to convert the file for three-dimensional (3D) printing. The mold <b>30</b> may be printed from two nozzles in a layer-by-layer fashion using a rapid prototyping machine (Modelmaker II, Solidscape). In a non-limiting example, different colored waxes may be used to form the layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> and the intermediate layer <b>16</b>. This enables one to easily distinguish the multiple layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>, <b>16</b> of the mold <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The computer-assisted design (CAD) and reverse solid free form fabrication technique may advantageously aid the accurate fabrication of devices <b>10</b> having various shapes and sizes, thereby ensuring repeatability of the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">After the mold <b>30</b> is printed, a solvent (e.g., ethanol) may be used to dissolve the intermediate layer <b>16</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). It is to be understood that the solvent is selected such that it dissolves the intermediate layer <b>16</b>, but does not dissolve layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. As such, the solvent selected will depend, at least in part, on the material used for the intermediate layer <b>16</b> and the materials used for the layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b>. Furthermore, the materials used for layers <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> may be different from that used for layer <b>16</b> so that selective dissolution of layer <b>16</b> is achievable. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the space from which the intermediate layer <b>16</b> is removed may be filled with a solution of a material <b>18</b> that will form the container <b>20</b>. The material <b>18</b> may be any material that maintains its structural integrity prior to completion of substance release from the device <b>10</b>. In an embodiment, the material <b>18</b> is poly(L-lactide) (PLLA). Non-limitative examples of other suitable materials <b>18</b> include polymeric materials selected from natural or synthetic polymers, degradable polymers, non-degradable polymers, or partially degradable polymers, proteins, polysaccharides, hydrocarbon polymers, artificial proteins, and combinations thereof. More specific non-limitative examples include poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), polyanhydrides, poly(ortho ethers), polycaprolactone, poly(hydroxy butyrate), poly(phosphoesters), poly(propylene fumarate), polyphosphazenes, polycarbonates, polyethylene, polyurethane, copolymers thereof, and/or combinations thereof. PLLA may be particularly suitable because of its biocompatibility and biodegradability, as well as its good mechanical properties. Such a material may be advantageous in that there is no need for retrieval of empty devices <b>10</b> after the completion of substance release.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">This material solution <b>18</b> may be cast into the mold <b>30</b>, whereby the material solution <b>18</b> takes the shape of the original intermediate layer <b>16</b>. The material solution <b>18</b> is allowed to dry.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the remaining mold <b>30</b> (interior layer <b>12</b>, exterior layer <b>14</b>, and bottom <b>26</b>) is removed, leaving hollow container <b>20</b>. The process by which the mold <b>30</b> is removed, depends, at least in part, on the material used to form the mold <b>30</b>. In an embodiment, the mold <b>30</b> is removed by dissolution. The container <b>20</b> may be washed, dried, and stored, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> depicts the incorporation of the layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> into the container <b>20</b>. Prior to such incorporation, the layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are formed. The polymer layer <b>22</b> (also referred to herein as isolation layer <b>22</b>) may be a copolymer of a sebacic acid anhydride precursor, a 1,3-bis(carboxyphenoxy) propane anhydride precursor, and a poly(ethylene glycol) anhydride precursor. Non-limiting examples of these copolymers and methods of forming the same are discussed in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/794,617, filed on Apr. 25, 2006, incorporated by reference herein. The PEG segments are incorporated into polyanhydride copolymers, at least in part, to modulate the erosion rate and to improve processing properties of the polyanhydride films/layers <b>22</b>. With increasing PEG content, the polyanhydride erosion rate increases. Without being bound to any theory, it is believed that the structural tunability of such polyanhydrides will advantageously enable a broad range of lag times (between substance release) and various device <b>10</b> sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Other non-limiting examples of suitable isolation layers <b>22</b> include polymeric materials selected from natural or synthetic degradable polymers, proteins, polysaccharides, hydrocarbon polymers, artificial proteins, and/or combinations thereof. Specific non-limiting examples include poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), polyanhydrides, poly(ortho ethers), polycaprolactone, poly(hydroxy butyrate), poly(phosphoesters), poly(propylene fumarate), polyphosphazenes, polycarbonates, polyurethane, copolymers thereof, and/or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">To form the layer <b>22</b>, the selected polymer(s) is/are heated until melted. The polymeric melt is then cooled down (e.g., to room temperature) and compressed into films of a desirable thickness. It is to be understood that the composition and/or thickness selected for the layer <b>22</b> depends, at least in part, on the desirable release characteristics (lag time and release pattern) for the device <b>10</b>. Upon formation, the layer <b>22</b> may be divided into any desirable shape for incorporation into the container <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The layer <b>24</b> including the predetermined substance may be formed by mixing the predetermined substance with a film forming material to form a solution, and casting the solution onto a removable substrate. Non-limiting examples of the film forming material include polymeric materials selected from natural or synthetic hydrophilic polymers, natural or synthetic amphophilic polymers, proteins, polysaccharides, hydrocarbon polymers, lipids, artificial proteins, and/or combinations thereof. More specific non-limitative examples include alginate, PEG, collagen, gelatin, hyaluronic acid, starch, glycogen, cellulose, caragena, dextran, chitin, chitosan, pectin, heparan, heparan sulfate, copolymers thereof, small water soluble molecules (such as sugars, salts), and combinations thereof. It is believed that alginate may be particularly suitable as a carrier for the selected substance, in part, because of its biocompatibility and suitable processing properties.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The solution is dried to form the substance layer <b>24</b>, which may be removed from the substrate and divided into any desirable shape for incorporation into the container <b>20</b>. N</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Non-limiting examples of suitable substances that are incorporated into layer <b>24</b> include drugs, vaccines, proteins, peptides, growth factors, hormones (e.g., PTH, luteinizing hormone release hormone (LHRH), 17&#x3b2;-estradiol, estriol, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol, etc.), DNAs, RNAs, other biological molecules, non-biological molecules, and/or combinations thereof. The thickness and substance content of the layer <b>24</b> may be selected, at least in part, on the desirable amount of substance to be released and the release time.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>, the layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are formed into disks having a shape configured to be introduced into the container <b>20</b>. In an embodiment, each of the polymeric layers <b>22</b> has an area that is equal to or larger than an area of each of the predetermined substance layers <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The inner portion of the container <b>20</b> may be pre-wet with a desirable liquid (e.g., ethanol), and the layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are alternately introduced into the container <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is to be understood that the layers <b>24</b> including the predetermined substance may be the same or different throughout the device <b>10</b>. For example, the substance loading may be higher in some layers <b>24</b> than in others <b>24</b>, or the type of substance may be different in two or more layers <b>24</b>. In a non-limiting example, the amount of substance loaded in each layer <b>24</b> is 50% higher than the substance loading in the layer <b>24</b> immediately above, in part, to overcome the potential adsorption and diffusive losses of the released substance in lower layers <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Once the layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> are established in the container <b>20</b>, the device <b>10</b> may be compressed under pressure for a predetermined time. Additional material (which may be the same as or different from the material <b>18</b> used to form the container <b>20</b>) may be added to the device <b>10</b> to fill any spaces between loaded layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, and any gaps between the stacked layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and the container <b>20</b>. In an embodiment, the additional material seals the layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> in the device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The device <b>10</b> may be air purged for a predetermined time to accelerate solvent evaporation. The device <b>10</b> may also be dried for a predetermined time.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts another embodiment of the device <b>10</b> fabrication method. Generally, the method includes forming an assembly or stack <b>40</b> of the alternating layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, as shown at reference numeral <b>200</b>, and then establishing an outer layer <b>42</b> on the assembly/stack <b>40</b> of layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>, as shown at reference numeral <b>202</b>. The assembly <b>40</b> may be formed by stacking a desirable number of layer <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> discs, which may be formed via the methods disclosed hereinabove. In another embodiment, the layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> may be stacked, and then the stack <b>40</b> may be configured into a desirable shape.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The outer layer <b>42</b> acts as a container <b>20</b> for the assembly/stack <b>40</b> of layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> (similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>). The outer layer <b>42</b> may be made up of material <b>18</b>. In some instances, the outer layer <b>42</b> is coated over the stack <b>40</b>, and in other instances, the outer layer <b>42</b> is a pre-formed hollow container (such as container <b>20</b>, described hereinabove) that receives the assembly/stack <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the outer layer <b>42</b> is coated on the stack <b>40</b>, any suitable deposition process may be used, including, but not limited to dip coating, spaying, or wrapping with a pre-fabricated film or sheet. It is to be understood that such coating processes enable the material of the outer layer <b>42</b> to conform to the layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b>. The outer layer <b>42</b> may be deposited to completely encapsulate the assembly <b>40</b>, or it may be deposited such that one of the layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> in the assembly <b>40</b> remains exposed (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The positioning and thickness of the outer layer <b>42</b> depends, at least in part, on the desirable release characteristics for the device <b>10</b>. For example, if immediate release of the substance in layer <b>24</b> is desirable, outer layer <b>42</b> will not be deposited on the outermost layer <b>24</b> of the stack <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">When the pre-formed hollow container <b>20</b> is used as the outer layer <b>42</b>, it is to be understood that the shape/configuration of the container <b>20</b> is selected or configured such that the interior hollow portion is able to receive the stack <b>40</b>. The stack <b>40</b> may also be configured during fabrication to fit into a desirable container <b>20</b>. It is to be understood that an additional material (which may be the same as or different from the material <b>18</b> used to form the outer layer <b>42</b>/container <b>20</b>) may be added to the device <b>10</b> to fill any spaces between the layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> of the stack <b>40</b>, and any gaps between the stack <b>40</b> and the outer layer <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It is to be understood that either layer <b>22</b> or <b>24</b> may form the outermost layer, for example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref> (layer <b>22</b> is the outermost layer of the stack) or in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> (layer <b>24</b> is the outermost layer of the stack). Yet further, it is to be understood that the outermost layer may be formed of a temporary protective layer configured to dissolve away after implantation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">To further illustrate embodiment(s) of the present disclosure, an example is given herein. It is to be understood that this example is provided for illustrative purposes and is not to be construed as limiting the scope of the disclosed embodiment(s).</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXAMPLE</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Embodiments of the delivery device <b>10</b> disclosed herein were fabricated. Some of devices <b>10</b> included isolation layers <b>22</b> of three-component polyanhydrides, and layers <b>24</b> with parathyroid hormone or bovine serum albumin as the predetermined substance. The three component polyanhydride isolation layers <b>22</b> were composed of sebacic acid (SA), 1,3-bis(p-carboxyphenoxy) propane (CPP), and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). These layers <b>22</b> were synthesized and characterized by NMR, GPC and FTIR. Lyophilized parathyroid hormone, PTH(1-34), was obtained from Bachem Bioscience Inc. (Torrance, Calif.), and bovine serum albumin (BSA, Fraction V) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo.). Poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA), with an inherent viscosity of approximately 1.6, was purchased from Boehringer Ingelheim (Ingelheim, Germany) and was used to form the container <b>20</b>. Sodium alginate was obtained from Pronova Biopolymer (Drammen, Norway), and dichloromethane and 1,4-dioxane were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, Wis.).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Examination of Erosion</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Rod-shaped polyanhydride specimens (2 mm in diameter and 4 mm in length) with various chemical compositions were placed in LoBind tubes (Eppendorf AG, Germany) containing 1.0 ml of phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 0.1 M, pH 7.4). The tubes were kept in an incubator at 37&#xb0; C. for 24 h. The specimens were then removed and vacuum-dried for 24 h. The specimens were cross-sectioned, gold-coated and examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Philips XL30 FEG) at 10 kV.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Device Frame Design and Fabrication</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A cylindrical mold (3.2 mm in inner diameter, and 3.7 mm in outer diameter) with one end sealed was designed and converted into a stereolithography (STL) file using Rhinoceros software (Robert McNeel &#x26; Associates, Seattle, Wash.). The STL file was imported into Modelworks software (Solidscape) to convert the file for 3D printing. To build the mold, red wax and green wax were printed from two nozzles in a layer-by-layer fashion using a rapid prototyping machine (Modelmaker II, Solidscape) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">After the cylindrical mold was printed, ethanol was used to dissolve the green wax of the mold (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). A PLLA solution (10% wt/v) was cast into the mold (taking the shape of the original green material), and was air dried for 3 days (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). The mold containing the polymer was washed in 37&#xb0; C. cyclohexane to dissolve the red wax mold (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>). The obtained PLLA cylinder was then washed with ethanol and water, and subsequently air-dried. The PLLA cylinder was stored in a desiccator before use.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Fabrication of PTH, BSA and Polyanhydride Films</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">PTH films: PTH (1-34) (0.3 mg) and alginate (250 mg) were mixed and dissolved in 8 ml Milli-Q water (18.2 M&#x3a9;&#xb7;cm) at 4&#xb0; C. The solution was cast on a hexagonal polystyrene weigh boat (Fisher Scientific, USA), and vacuum dried at 4&#xb0; C. for about 2 weeks. The thickness of the film was about 100 &#x3bc;m. The desired thickness may be achieved by controlling the amount of casting solution on the weigh boat. PTH/alginate disks with a diameter of 2.0 mm were punched out from the PTH/alginate films.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">BSA Films: The procedure used to prepare the PTH/alginate films was also used to prepare the BSA/alginate thin disks. Briefly, a BSA/alginate solution was prepared by mixing BSA (0.15 g) and alginate (0.25 g) in Milli-Q water (10 ml). The BSA/alginate solution was then cast into thin films and punched into BSA/alginate disks with a diameter of 2.0 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Polyanhydride films: SA, CCP and PEG anhydride precursors were charged into a pre-dried tube. Alternating cycles of vacuum and nitrogen purging were repeated three times, and the vacuum was maintained inside the tube at the end. The tube was then immersed into an oil bath and the vacuum was maintained under continuous pumping. The reaction mixture was stirred vigorously and purged with dry nitrogen for about 30 seconds every fifteen minutes. At the end of the reaction, the resulting polymer melt was stored in a vial filled with nitrogen at about &#x2212;20&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The newly synthesized polyanhydride copolymers were then heated until melted. The polyanhydride melt was then cooled down to room temperature, and compressed into films of various thickness with the pressure of 5&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>Pa for 5 min using Carver&#xae; Presses (Carver Inc., IN). The polyanhydride films were then punched into disks with a diameter of 3.0 mm.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Substance Delivery Device Fabrication</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The inner side of PLLA cylinder was first pre-wetted with ethanol. The PTH or BSA disks and polyanhydride disks were alternately introduced into the PLLA cylinder (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>). In those examples including the PTH layer, the loaded amount of PTH in each layer was 50% higher than that in the layer immediately above. After the PTH or BSA and polyanhydride layers were loaded, the device was compressed with a pressure of 5&#xd7;10<sup>7 </sup>Pa for about 10 min. A PLLA solution (10% wt/v) was carefully added to fill the spaces between loaded substance (PTH or BSA) layers and isolation layers (<b>24</b> and <b>22</b>, respectively, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>), and any gap between the stacked films and the PLLA cylinder. The device was then air purged for about 30 min to accelerate the solvent evaporation, and vacuum dried for 24 h.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">In vitro BSA/PTH Release</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The substance-loaded devices were immersed in 2 ml PBS (0.1 M, pH=7.4) and incubated at 37&#xb0; C. After designated times, the medium was collected and replaced with equal amount of fresh PBS. The collected medium was stored at about &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. until analysis. The concentration of PTH in the released medium was measured using PTH (1-34) ELISA assay (Immutopics Inc., San Clemente, Calif.). The amount of released BSA was measured using a MicroBCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, Ill.).</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">In vitro PTH (1-34) Bioactivity Assay</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The in vitro bioactivity of released PTH was determined by adenylate cyclase stimulation assay and cAMP binding protein assay. Briefly, rat osteosarcoma cells (ROS 17/2.8) were treated with PTH (1-34) of known concentrations, or with eluent from the PTH delivery device for designated times in calcium- and magnesium-free hanks' balanced salt solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.) containing 0.1% BSA and 1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX). After incubation of the treated cells at 37&#xb0; C. for about 10 min, the cAMP in cells was extracted by adding cold perchloric acid. The cAMP extracts were then neutralized by adding KOH solution, and were centrifuged to remove the precipitate. The [3H]-cAMP (ICN, Irvine, Calif.) was incubated with standards or unknowns and cAMP binding protein for 90 min on ice. The unbound [3H]-cAMP was removed by adding dextran-coated charcoal. The samples were then centrifuged and the supernatant of each tube was decanted to a scintillation tube. The radioactivity of the supernatants was determined using a liquid scintillation counter (Wallacs 1410; Wallac, Gaithersburg, Md.) and cAMP levels were calculated by the loglogit method using a standard curve.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Polyanhydrides Surface Erosion</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The three-component (SA, CPP and PEG) polyanhydrides showed surface erosion characteristics (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> series). Polyanhydrides containing PEG segments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGs. 3B and 3C</figref>) exhibited faster erosion rates compared to those without PEG (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). The erosion depth of the cylindrical polyanhydride without PEG segments (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) was about 100 &#x3bc;m after 24 h in PBS at 37&#xb0; C., while the erosion depths were about 380 &#x3bc;m and 650 &#x3bc;m for polyanhydrides with 2.5% and 7.5% PEG (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGs. 3B and 3C</figref>, respectively) in the copolymers, respectively. There were evident intervening spaces between the eroded and un-eroded portions of all surface-eroded samples. For polyanhydride with 2.5% PEG (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), a small portion of the particles from the eroded polyanhydride was found to be separated from the bulk of polyanhydride. As PEG content of the copolymer increased to 7.5% (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>), virtually the entire eroded portion was detached from the un-eroded portion of the cylindrical polyanhydride. The eroded surfaces were floppy and porous. The surface roughness increased with increasing PEG content of the polyanhydride.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Pulsatile Protein Release from the Device</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The release profile of the device including BSA layers was investigated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows four well-defined pulses with an interval of 24 h between two adjacent pulses. The released amount of BSA was almost the same for each pulse. As shown in the graph, the released amounts of BSA between pulses were very low.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">It is believed that the time interval between two pulses (lag time) is controllable by the thickness of polyanhydride films, which acted as isolation layers <b>22</b>. One device including BSA layers had polyanhydride films with varying thicknesses (230 &#x3bc;m, 310 &#x3bc;m, and 400 &#x3bc;m, respectively). The lag time increased approximately linearly with the thickness of the polyanhydride films (isolation layer <b>22</b>). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the lag time increased from about 24 h to about 40 h when the thickness of the polyanhydride layer (with 1.6% PEG in the polyanhydride) increased from 230 &#x3bc;m to 400 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The lag time may also be controlled by polyanhydride composition (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). The results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> were for devices including three BSA layers with isolation layers of the same thickness, but different PEG content, therebetween. Three pulses of BSA release were observed on each cumulative release curve. The lag times of BSA release were about 24 h and 32 h for the devices with PEG contents of 1.1% and 2.5%, respectively. As the PEG content was further increased to 7.5% and 10.0%, the substance was released much faster and the lag times were about 14 h and 12 h, respectively. At these two high PEG contents, the pulses became less defined to nearly un-identifiable. BSA was released almost at a constant rate when PEG content in the polyanhydride was about 10.0%.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The release of different substances at different time points was realized with one embodiment of the delivery device. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, both PTH and BSA were loaded in the same device (the first two layers were loaded with PTH, and the third and fourth layers were loaded with BSA). Two pulses of PTH were first released between 0 and 50 h, followed by two pulses of BSA released between 50 h and 100 h. The released pulses appeared at about every 24 h, as designed.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In vitro PTH Release and Bioactivity</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Multi-pulse release of PTH from the device was also examined. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> illustrates the amount of PTH released from each layer in the device (every pulse of release is associated with one PTH-containing layer). Similar amounts of PTH were released from each layer of the device. The bioactivity of PTH released from each layer was measured in vitro (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>). Based on the standard curve of PTH (positive control), the bioactivity of PTH released from the last layer was equivalent to 47.5 pg/&#x3bc;l PTH. Compared to the released amount of PTH from the last layer in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, it was calculated that 90.9% PTH was bioactive after it was released from the device. Similar results of released PTH from other layers were obtained. Therefore, it is believed that the released PTH from the delivery system retained high bioactivity.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">PTH and other therapeutic agents are well known for their catabolic action resulting in bone resorption and an increase of calcium concentration in the blood. Interestingly, PTH also has anabolic action to stimulate bone formation under certain conditions. The catabolic or anabolic action of PTH (and potentially other like therapeutic agents) depends on the pattern of delivery: continuous exposure to PTH results in bone resorption, whereas intermittent administration (pulsatile release) of PTH increases bone formation. Therefore, the device <b>10</b> disclosed herein may be particularly suitable because the release of the substance may be controlled and relatively precisely modulated.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The biocompatible materials used to form the device <b>10</b> render the device <b>10</b> suitable for implantation into a human or other animal. Furthermore, the configuration and fabrication techniques used result in relatively small device <b>10</b> sizes, and the potential for further miniaturization using such techniques also exists.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The device <b>10</b> disclosed herein also advantageously prevents device leakage. If the isolation layer <b>22</b> or sealant filling has defective pores connecting or increasing diffusion between substance layers <b>24</b>, body fluid (water) is likely to penetrate inside the substance layer <b>24</b> before the isolation layer <b>22</b> is eroded. This may lead to unpredictable substance release patterns. Embodiments of the device <b>10</b> aim to prevent such leakage. First, the size of substance layers <b>24</b> may be designed to be smaller than that of isolation layers <b>22</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1E</figref>), such that the contact area between the substance layers <b>24</b> and isolation layers <b>22</b> near the outer edges (i.e., areas of a higher defective probability) is decreased. Second, the sealant material is used to fill the gap between the layers <b>22</b>, <b>24</b> and the container <b>20</b>. Third, the device <b>10</b> may be continually compressed with constant pressure during the sealing process to reduce the possibility of air pocket formation.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The delivery device <b>10</b> disclosed herein includes, but it not limited to the following advantageous characteristics. All layers of materials (e.g., alginate, polyanhydride, PLLA) used to form the device <b>10</b> are biocompatible and biodegradable. As such, the device <b>10</b> may be implanted in vivo with minimal immuno-reaction. Furthermore, devices <b>10</b> of various shapes and sizes may be accurately fabricated using the reverse solid free form fabrication technique. Still further, embodiments of the device <b>10</b> are able to deliver more than one substance, and the substance loadings may be tailored over a broad range.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">While several embodiments have been described in detail, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the disclosed embodiments may be modified. Therefore, the foregoing description is to be considered exemplary rather than limiting.</p>
