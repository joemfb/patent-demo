<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Application No. 10-2010-0041935, filed on May 4, 2010, with the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a variable magnification device and a telescopic sight using the same, and more particularly, to a variable magnification device which is capable of easily adjusting a magnification of a telescopic sight under a condition where a shooter aims for a target with a telescopic sight, and a telescopic sight using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A telescopic sight refers to a sighting telescope which is a device which magnifies and aims for a remote target precisely with it attached to a firearm such as a rifle</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As used therein, the term &#x201c;rifle&#x201d; refers to a personal firearm which has a bored barrel loaded with bullets, shoots with it put on a shoulder of a shooter, and which is capable of hitting a target precisely with an elaborative sight</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Such sight of the rifle is generally obtained by alignment of a line of sight aimed at a target, which is an important step of determining precise shooting in which a front sight located at an end of barrel is aligned with a back sight located in a main body of the rifle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, since the front sight and the back sight are very small and their alignment may be in disorder due to small shaking, a shooter requires extreme concentration for alignment of the line of sight.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, as the shooter is excessively concerned about the alignment of the line of sight, the shooter's eyes are focused on the front sight and the back sight rather than the target and forward situations, which results in a narrow field of vision.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, the line-of-sight alignment takes a relatively long time, which is against the nature of shooting that a secured target has to be instantaneously hit.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, to overcome these problems, in the related art, a telescopic sight has been attached to a rifle.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Such a telescopic sight eliminates the need of separate line-of-sight alignment by adding coordinate lines or points to the telescopic principle and can aim at a remote target by increasing a magnification from low to high.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A structure of this telescopic sight will be described in brief below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A conventional telescopic sight may have a body consisting of a series of objective barrel <b>10</b>, middle barrel <b>20</b> and ocular barrel <b>30</b>. The objective barrel <b>10</b> includes an objective bunch <b>11</b>, the middle barrel <b>20</b> includes a creak bunch <b>21</b> and an internal bunch <b>23</b>, and the ocular barrel <b>30</b> includes an ocular bunch <b>31</b> and a reticle bunch <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Optical lenses are respectively mounted within the objective bunch <b>11</b>, the internal bunch <b>23</b> and the ocular bunch <b>31</b> and a zoom lens <b>25</b> is mounted within the internal bunch <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The zoom lens <b>25</b> is moved by a zoom front wheel rotated along the circumference of the middle barrel <b>20</b>, thereby changing a magnification of the telescopic sight.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">That is, the magnification of the telescopic sight is adjusted by the rotation of the zoom front wheel <b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, it is difficult for the zoom front wheel <b>27</b> to be rotated at an aiming posture.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">This is because it is not easy to find a position of the zoom front wheel <b>27</b> only with the feel of hands at the aiming posture at which the eye is concentrated on the inside of the ocular barrel <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition, it is difficult for the zoom front wheel <b>27</b> to turn with one hand since it is stiffly mounted such that it is not randomly rotated by shooting vibration of the rifle.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the end, the shooter has to turn the zoom front wheel <b>27</b> with one hand after the shooter takes his/her eye off the ocular barrel <b>30</b> and distracts his/her aiming posture.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Moreover, the zoom front wheel <b>27</b> has to be finely turned with one hand for an elaborate focus adjustment, which is not an easy work in the aiming posture.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the light of the above circumstances, it is an object of the present invention to provide a variable magnification device which is capable of easily adjusting a magnification of a telescopic sight with one hand of a shooter in an aiming posture where a rifle is put on a shoulder of the shooter, and a telescopic sight using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">It is another object of the present invention to provide a variable magnification device which is capable of easily adjusting a focus of a telescopic sight, and a telescopic sight using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">To achieve the above objects, according to an aspect of the invention, there is provided a variable magnification device including: a rotation bunch which has a ring shape conforming to the circumference of a barrel of a telescopic sight and includes a bent end formed on one side of the circumference of the rotation bunch; and a rod which is connected to the bent end and is bendable in the longitudinal direction of the barrel.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Preferably, the bent end includes a body which projects upwardly from the rotation bunch, provides a space in which a tail end of the rod is accommodated, and includes an opened upper portion and one opened lateral perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the barrel and a shaft which traverses both laterals adjacent to the one lateral, wherein the rod is adapted to be rotated around the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Preferably, an inner side of the body, which is perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the barrel, extends upwardly from the rotation bunch.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Preferably, the variable magnification device further includes an elastic means mounted within the bent end and a horizontal pushing end which is placed above the elastic means and contacts the tail end of the rod.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Preferably, an end edge of the rod is beveled.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to another aspect of the invention, there is provided a telescopic sight including: the above-described variable magnification device; a barrel mounted with the variable magnification device; and a zoom lens which is mounted within the barrel and is horizontally moved based on adjustment of the variable magnification device.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description of the present invention, concrete description on related functions or constructions which was shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be omitted if it is deemed that the functions and/or constructions may unnecessarily obscure the gist of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a variable magnification device <b>100</b> includes a rotation bunch <b>120</b> having a bent end <b>110</b> placed at one side of its circumference, and a rod <b>130</b> connected to the bent end <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the variable magnification device <b>100</b>, a zoom front wheel <b>27</b> is combined at the same position as the conventional zoom front wheel <b>27</b> in a barrel of a telescopic sight <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Accordingly, when the rotation bunch <b>120</b> is rotated, a zoom lens <b>25</b> within a barrel <b>210</b> is horizontally moved.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In this case, the rod <b>130</b> acts as a handle to rotate the rotation bunch <b>120</b> easily.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Accordingly, in the variable magnification device <b>100</b>, since the rotation bunch <b>120</b> can be easily rotated with the rod <b>130</b> held with one hand, a magnification of the telescopic sight <b>200</b> can be easily adjusted with one hand without distracting an aiming posture.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As a result, it is possible to quickly hit a target after magnification adjustment with aim at the target maintained when the magnification of the telescopic sight is adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In addition, the rod <b>130</b> is bent to face the barrel <b>210</b> of the telescopic sight <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Accordingly, the rod <b>130</b> is closely adhered to or similarly placed on the barrel <b>210</b>, which facilitates receipt of the telescopic sight <b>200</b> or a rifle (not shown) attached with the telescopic sight <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this embodiment, preferably, the variable magnification device <b>100</b> may be a part of the telescopic sight <b>200</b>, which is incorporated into the telescopic sight <b>200</b>, without separate attachment/detachment.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Details of the variable magnification device <b>100</b> will be described below.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The rotation bunch <b>120</b> is placed on the circumference of the barrel <b>210</b> in order to adjust the magnification of the telescopic sight <b>200</b>, like the conventional zoom front wheel <b>27</b>, and is rotated along the circumference to horizontally move the zoom lens <b>25</b> placed within the telescopic sight <b>200</b>. Preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the rotation bunch has a ring shape surrounding the circumference of the barrel <b>210</b> of the telescopic sight <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this case, the bent end is placed at one side of the circumference of the rotation bunch <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The rotation bunch <b>120</b> is tightly mounted on the circumference of the barrel <b>210</b> to prevent the rotation bunch <b>120</b> from being randomly rotated due to shooting vibration of the rifle.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The bent end <b>110</b> connects the rod <b>130</b> to the rotation bunch <b>120</b> in a bendable manner. Preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the bent end <b>110</b> includes a body which projects upwardly from the rotation bunch <b>120</b> and provides an internal space in which a tail end of the rod <b>130</b> is accommodated.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this case, the body <b>111</b> includes an opened upper portion, an opened lateral perpendicular to the longitudinal direction of the barrel <b>210</b>, and a shaft <b>112</b> traversing both laterals adjacent to the one lateral.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">To this end, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the body <b>111</b> includes first, second and third side walls <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> which are placed in three laterals except the one lateral and project upwardly by a predetermined length from one side of the circumference of the rotation bunch <b>120</b>, and a through hole <b>113</b> in which the shaft <b>112</b> is horizontally fixed to the first and third side walls <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Accordingly, the tail end of the rod <b>130</b> is accommodated between the first, second and third side walls <b>114</b>, <b>115</b> and <b>116</b> and the rod <b>130</b> is connected to the shaft <b>112</b> and is rotated to stand in the opened upper portion or lie in the one lateral.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In this case, preferably, the rod <b>130</b> is configured to have a predetermined length to allow it to be easily held and rotated with one hand, such that it does not project outwardly beyond the ocular barrel <b>30</b> when it lies along the longitudinal direction of the telescopic sight <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">As a result, the rod <b>130</b> acts as a handle to turn the rotation bunch <b>120</b> when it stands up, and is closely adhered to or similarly placed on the barrel <b>210</b> of the telescopic sight <b>200</b> for easy receipt when it lies down.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this case, preferably, the second side wall <b>115</b> provides an inner side extending upwardly from the rotation bunch <b>120</b>, so that the second side wall <b>115</b> can support the erected rod <b>130</b>, with one side of the erected rod <b>130</b> closely adhered to the inner side.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition, preferably, a gap between the first and third side walls <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> corresponds to a width of the rod <b>130</b>. Accordingly, when a force is exerted on the rod <b>130</b> to turn the rotation bunch <b>120</b>, a rotation force can be delivered to the rotation bunch <b>120</b> with no gap.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition, preferably, the shaft <b>112</b> passes through the first and third side walls <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> and the tail end of the rod <b>130</b> and the rod <b>130</b> is tightly connected to the shaft <b>112</b> to prevent the rod <b>130</b> from being randomly bent due to shooting vibration of the rifle.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Further, preferably, a pushing end <b>117</b> may be provided to prevent the rod <b>130</b> from being randomly rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The pushing end <b>117</b> is mounted and vertically moved in the inside of the bent end <b>110</b> and receives a pushing-up force from an elastic means <b>118</b> provided below the pushing end <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In this case, preferably, the elastic means <b>118</b> is a compression spring.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In correspondence, preferably, the tail end of the rod <b>130</b> has right-angled edges and an end face <b>131</b> or lateral face <b>132</b> of the tail end is closely adhered to the pushing end <b>117</b> when the rod <b>130</b> is rotated.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Accordingly, the pushing end <b>117</b> receives an elastic force from the elastic means <b>118</b>, pushes up the end face <b>131</b> when the rod <b>130</b> is erected, thereby fixing the erected rod <b>130</b>, and pushes up the lateral face <b>132</b> when the rod <b>130</b> is horizontally bent, thereby fixing the rod <b>130</b> horizontally.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, preferably, a running groove <b>119</b> may be formed in the inner side of the second side wall <b>115</b> such that the angled edges of the rod <b>130</b> are rotated without collision. Alternatively, without the running groove <b>119</b>, the angled edges of the rod <b>130</b> may be beveled with a predetermined width.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Accordingly, while the rod <b>130</b> is rotated around the shaft <b>112</b> by the pushing end <b>117</b>, the rod <b>130</b> can be fixed to take two horizontal and vertical postures and maintain these postures against the shooting vibration of the rifle.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Although it has been illustrated in the above that the bent end <b>110</b> is formed to project from the rotation bunch <b>120</b>, the rotation bunch <b>120</b> may be formed to be thick and the bend end <b>110</b> may be formed to be indented into one side of the rotation bunch <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Hereinafter, an operation state of the variable magnification device <b>100</b> and the telescopic sight <b>200</b> using the same will be described. The following description will be given with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 6</figref>, in which the like elements are denoted by the same reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">First, prior to putting the rifle on a shoulder for shooting, the rod <b>130</b> is rotated and erected t be closely adhered to the inner side of the second side wall <b>115</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Under this state, when a target is captured, an aiming posture aiming the target through the telescopic sight <b>200</b> with a neck of the rifle (not shown) grasped with one hand is taken, and then the rod <b>130</b> is rotated with the other hand to adjust the magnification and focus of the telescopic sight <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Thereafter, upon completion of the adjustment, a trigger is pulled to hit the target.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this case, if a different target is captured at a different position and a different distance, with the rifle (not shown) aimed at the different target, the rod <b>130</b> is again rotated with one hand to adjust the magnification and focus of the telescopic sight <b>200</b>, so that the different target can be immediately hit.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Accordingly, the shooter can immediately readjust the magnification and focus of the telescopic sight <b>200</b> based on a position and distance of a target for shooting by rotating the rod <b>130</b> with one hand with the rifle (not shown) put on the shoulder.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">After completion of shooting through this procedure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the rod <b>130</b> can be folded not to get in the way when the telescopic sight <b>200</b> or the rifle (not shown) attached with the telescopic sight <b>200</b> is moved or stored.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition, this facilitates receipt of the telescopic sight <b>200</b> or the rifle (not shown) attached with the telescopic sight <b>200</b> in a case.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. The exemplary embodiments are provided for the purpose of illustrating the invention, not in a limitative sense.
