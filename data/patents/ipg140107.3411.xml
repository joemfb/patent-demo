<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a spark plug used for igniting fuel through generating a spark electrically in an internal combustion engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A conventional spark plug typically has a metal shell that is fixed by caulking to an outer circumference of a ceramic insulator that holds a center electrode therein (See, for example, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (kokai) No. 11-345676). Such metal shell of the spark plug has a pair of flanges projecting in an outer circumference direction. During a &#x201c;caulking process,&#x201d; a cylindrical groove, bulging out in the outer circumference direction, is formed between the flanges. Examples of the flanges in the metal shell are a tool engagement portion assuming a polygonal-shape for engaging with a tool for mounting a spark plug to an engine head, or a trunk portion for compressing a gasket towards an engine head.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Recently, a reduction in size of a spark plug is considered as one of the various resolutions of fuel efficiency improvement in an internal combustion engine and of emission gas reduction. However, deterioration in strength of the metal shell has not been considered in connection with the miniaturization of the spark plug. For example, when the metal shell is miniaturized with the same reduction ratio as that of the spark plug, the strength of a groove in the metal shell could not fully be achieved, which may lead to a crack due to impact or stress corrosion.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In light of the above-described problems, an object of the present invention is to provide a technique capable of reducing the size of a spark plug while securing the integrity of the groove in the metal shell.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention has been conceived to solve, at least partially, the above problem and can be embodied in the following modes or application examples.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Aspect 1</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided a spark plug comprising: a rod-like center electrode; a ceramic insulator electrically insulating an outer circumference of the center electrode; and a metal shell fixed by caulking to an outer circumference of the ceramic insulator. The metal shell includes a cylindrical groove that bulges out in an outer circumference direction. A polygonal tool engagement portion adjoins one end of the groove and bulges out in the outer circumference direction with respect to the groove. A trunk portion adjoins another end (which is different to the one end) of the groove and bulges out in the outer circumference direction with respect to the groove. A ground electrode is joined to the metal shell and forms a spark gap with the center electrode, wherein an opposite side distance &#x201c;S&#x201d; between opposing two sides of the polygonal tool engagement portion is 12 mm or less, wherein a section modulus &#x201c;Z1&#x201d; and a section modulus &#x201c;Z2&#x201d; satisfy a relationship: Z1&#x3c;=Z2, where &#x201c;Z1&#x201d; represents a section modulus in the one end of the groove, and where &#x201c;Z2&#x201d; represents a section modulus in the other end of the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Aspect 2</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a spark plug according to Aspect 1, wherein the section modulus &#x201c;Z1&#x201d; preferably satisfy a relationship Z1&#x3e;=49 mm3.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Aspect 3</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a spark plug as described above according to Aspects 1 or 2, wherein a distance A, a distance B and the section modulus &#x201c;Z2&#x201d; preferably satisfy the following relationship:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>if <i>A&#x3e;B,Z</i>2&#x3e;=62 mm<sup>3</sup>,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">where the distance &#x201c;A&#x201d; represents a distance from the one end to an outermost portion having a largest outer diameter in the groove, and where the distance &#x201c;B&#x201d; represents a distance from the other end to the outermost portion.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Aspect 4</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a spark plug as described above according to any one of Aspects 1 to 3, wherein a thickness &#x201c;C&#x201d; preferably satisfy the relationship:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>C&#x3e;=</i>3 mm,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">where the thickness &#x201c;C&#x201d; represents a thickness of the trunk portion along an axis of the center electrode from a region adjoining the other end of the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Aspect 5</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a spark plug as described above according to any one of Aspects 1 to 4, wherein a distance &#x201c;D&#x201d; and a distance &#x201c;H&#x201d; preferably satisfy the following relationship:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(<i>H/D</i>)&#x3c;=0.17,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">where the distance &#x201c;D&#x201d; represents a distance from the one end to the other end of the groove, and</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">where the distance &#x201c;H&#x201d; represents a distance from the outermost portion to a straight line that connects the one end to the other end of the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Aspect 6</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a spark plug as described above according to any one of Aspects 1 to 5, wherein the metal shell may be plated with nickel.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Aspect 7</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a spark plug as described above according to any one of Aspects 1 to 6, wherein the fixation by caulking may be conducted through a cold caulking.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention can be implemented in various forms. For example, the present invention can be implemented not only in a spark plug but also, for example, in a metal shell of a spark plug, an internal combustion engine in which the spark plug is mounted, and in a method for manufacturing a spark plug. Further, the present invention is not limited to the above-described aspects, but may be embodied in various other forms without departing from the gist of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">According to a spark plug of Aspect 1, the impact resistance of the groove is securable, i.e., obtainable, even though the opposite side distance of the tool engagement portion is 12 mm or less. Therefore, the spark plug can be miniaturized while securing the strength of the groove of the metal shell.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to the spark plug of Aspect 2, the impact resistance of the groove is fully securable.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the spark plug of Aspect 3, the impact resistance of the groove is fully securable corresponding to the relationship between the distance A that is from the outermost portion to the one end of the groove and the distance B that is from outermost portion to the other end of the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the spark plug of Aspect 4, impact exerted on the groove can be alleviated.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to the spark plug of Aspect 5, resistance to stress corrosion cracking can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">According to the spark plug of Aspect 6, although the metal shell is plated by nickel that tends to cause cracks due to stress corrosion, the spark plug can be miniaturized while securing the intensity, i.e., strength, of the groove of the metal shell.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to the spark plug of Aspect 7, the spark plug can be miniaturized while maintaining the strength of the groove of the metal shell, even though the cold caulking, which tends to cause an asymmetry of the bulging of the groove across the outermost portion, is adopted for fixing the metal shell.</p>
