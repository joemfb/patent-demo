<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A free electron laser system includes an undulator having a first and second series of magnets. The first and second series of magnets are substantially parallel to and spaced apart from each other to define a laser cavity between the magnets. An electron source emits an electron beam through the laser cavity. The magnets in the first and second series can have varying polarities. The magnets can be electromagnets with random phase distribution.</p>

<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The word RADAR is an acronym derived from the phrase RAdio Detection And Ranging and applies to electronic equipment designed for detecting and tracking objects (targets) at considerable distances. The basic principle behind radar is simple&#x2014;extremely short bursts of radio energy (traveling at the speed of light) are transmitted, reflected off a target and then returned as an echo. The RADAR system correlates the return signal (appropriately corrected for gain) with the transmitted pulse to indicate the location of the target within a two or three dimensional framework. Among the various radar processing techniques, pulse compression is a signal processing technique mainly used not only in radar but also in sonar and echography to enhance the range resolution as well as the signal-to-noise ratio.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Various techniques for pulse compression of electromagnetic signals using variants of frequency modulation are known in the art. These include an AM-FM laser for improved accuracy of target range measurements and a LASER RADAR system which uses an optically linear modulated FM chirp signal (also known as a compressed high intensity radar pulse). Another method proposes a random FM scheme for mobile radios including a non-linear FM modulation which is carried out by driving an FM modulator with random or chaotic sequences and deriving theoretical expressions for the spectral properties of the FM waveforms.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The conventional FM chirp techniques mentioned above either use linear FM modulation or propose the use of random input sequences to create non-linear FM signals with the perfect auto correlation function properties. However, these techniques are either too complicated to implement in many applications or do not result in optimal pulse compression. Moreover, conventional pulse compression techniques may not result in a range resolution which is optimal for the application. Therefore, a non-linear FM pulse compression system and method which can result in an order of magnitude improvement in pulse compression and hence dramatically improve the resolution as well as the precision of range of detected targets in RADAR, LADAR and other applications is needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>

The non-linear FM transmitter is adapted to modulate the frequency of the output signal by at least one of the following: increasing the frequency of the output signal as a logarithmic function of the frequency of samples in the input signal; modulating the frequency of the output signal in an inversely proportional relationship to the frequency of samples in the input signal; and modulating the frequency of the output signal according to a random permutation of the frequency of the input signal. At least one antenna interfaces with the non-linear FM transmitter. The non-linear FM receiver is adapted to auto-correlate the output signal with a return signal.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The disclosure is further generally directed to a non-linear FM pulse compression method. An illustrative embodiment of the method includes providing an input signal; forming an output signal by modulating the frequency of the input signal by at least one of the following: increasing the frequency of the output signal as a logarithmic function of the frequency of samples in the input signal; modulating the frequency of the output signal in an inversely proportional relationship to the frequency of samples in the input signal; and modulating the frequency of the output signal according to a random permutation of the frequency of the input signal; transmitting the output signal against a target; receiving a return signal from the target; and auto-correlating the output signal with the return signal.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The disclosure is generally directed to an FM pulse compression system and method and in some embodiments to a non-linear FM pulse compression system. Some embodiments may include non-linear mapping of the time sequence which in a randomly frequency modulated signal. Some embodiments may accomplish the same result by random permutation of the carrier pulse signal.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In some embodiments, the frequency of the output non-linear FM chirp signal increases as a logarithmic function of the frequency of the samples in the input signal and is given by:

</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, the frequency changes in the non-linear FM chirp signal are inversely proportional to the frequency of the samples in the input pulse signal and are given by:

</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In some embodiments, the frequency changes of the non-linear FM chirp signal are produced by a random permutation of the input pulse signal to create a random sinusoid:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>P</i><sub>RandomFM</sub>(<i>t</i>)=Random Permutation{<i>A </i>exp(&#x2212;<i>j</i>2<i>&#x3c0;f</i><sub>c</sub><i>/t</i>)} <i>T/</i>2<i>&#x2266;t&#x3c;T/</i>2&#x2003;&#x2003;(5a)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In some embodiments, the random permutation may be performed on the input to the sinusoid rather than the output:

</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For some applications, however, performing the random permutation on the output of the sinusoidal pulse may be simpler.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings, a graph which illustrates various types of pulse waveforms is illustrated. The graph includes a square pulse waveform <b>1</b>, a linear FM pulse waveform <b>2</b>, a non-linear log FM pulse waveform <b>3</b>, a non-linear inverse pulse waveform <b>4</b> and a non-linear random sinusoid FM pulse waveform <b>5</b>. The non-linear log FM pulse waveform <b>3</b>, the non-linear inverse pulse waveform <b>4</b> and the non-linear random sinusoid FM pulse waveform <b>5</b> have a near-random appearance, which is the fundamental reason why the auto correlation functions of the signals <b>21</b>-<b>23</b> which correspond to these waveforms almost resemble a delta function as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, whereas the auto correlation function of the signal which corresponds to the linear waveform <b>20</b> does not.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the drawings, a graph is illustrated which shows autocorrelation functions of the pulse waveforms illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Reference numerals <b>10</b>-<b>14</b> respectively illustrate autocorrelation functions of the square pulse waveform <b>1</b>, the linear FM pulse waveform <b>2</b>, the non-linear log FM pulse waveform <b>3</b>, the non-linear inverse FM pulse <b>4</b> and the non-linear random sinusoidal FM pulse <b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. When the auto correlation functions <b>11</b>-<b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are compared, it is apparent that the auto correlation signal corresponding to the inverse FM chirp pulse <b>13</b> and the random sinusoidal chirp pulse <b>14</b> most resemble the delta function, a desired property for the optimally-compressed pulse. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the auto correlation functions of the various non-linear chirp signals <b>20</b>-<b>23</b>, respectively, with the corresponding pulse compression factors.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">It is possible to infer from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> that the auto correlation function of the non-linear log FM pulse <b>42</b> and the non-linear inverse FM pulse <b>43</b> are compressed versions of the auto correlation functions of the linear square pulse <b>40</b> and linear FM pulse <b>41</b>. If the compression ratio between the two sinc functions is 4*T/fc where T is the pulse width in terms of the number of samples in the pulse, and fc is the base frequency of the FM modulation of the pulse, the plot of the theoretical and computed compression factors versus the various values of fc are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and also in Table 1.</p>

By measuring the frequency of the return signal, the time delay between transmission and reception can be measured and therefore the range determined as before.

After the RF amplifier <b>119</b> amplifies the transmitted signal <b>124</b><i>a</i>, the transmitting antenna <b>120</b> transmits the transmitted signal <b>124</b><i>a </i>to a target (not illustrated).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0084">The receiving antenna <b>120</b><i>a </i>receives the reflected signal <b>124</b><i>c </i>from the target. The RF amplifier <b>119</b><i>a </i>amplifies the reflected signal <b>124</b><i>c</i>, and the frequency mixer <b>121</b> receives the amplified reflected signal <b>124</b><i>c</i>. At the frequency mixer <b>121</b>, the reflected signal <b>124</b><i>c </i>mixes with the reference signal <b>124</b><i>b</i>. A mixed signal <b>124</b><i>d</i>, which is a modulated low frequency sinusoidal signal the main frequency of which is equal to the frequency difference between the reference signal <b>124</b><i>b </i>and the reflected signal <b>124</b><i>c</i>, is obtained from the output of the frequency mixer <b>121</b> and passes through the low pass filter <b>122</b> and the IF amplifier <b>123</b>, respectively.

<p id="p-0082" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> of the drawings, a schematic diagram which illustrates implementation of an illustrative embodiment of the non-linear FM pulse compression system <b>100</b> in imaging targets on the ground <b>141</b> from an aircraft <b>140</b> via LIDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) is illustrated. LIDAR is an optical remote sensing technology that measures properties of scattered light to find range and/or other information of a distant target. The prevalent method to determine distance to an object <b>142</b> or surface <b>141</b> is to use laser pulses <b>143</b>. Like radar technology, which uses radio waves, the range to an object <b>142</b> is determined by measuring the time delay between transmission of a pulse <b>143</b> and detection of the reflected signal <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0086">A recent addition to a police officer's speed detection arsenal is LIDAR (Laser Infrared Detection And Ranging). To measure a vehicle's speed, LIDAR determines how long it takes a light pulse to travel from the LIDAR gun to the vehicle and back. From this information, LIDAR can quickly find the distance between the gun and the vehicle. By making several measurements and comparing the distance the vehicle traveled between measurements, LIDAR very accurately determines the vehicle's speed. LIDAR uses a laser beam of invisible infrared light. The beam reflects off any flat surface on the vehicle. Since the beam is very narrow, it is impossible for any laser detector to determine the distance between the LIDAR source and the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0087">Just as there are two types of RADAR, there are also two types of lasers: Pulsed Lasers and Continuous Wave (CW) Lasers, which are used in LIDAR applications. The present disclosure includes use of the non-linear FM pulse compression system <b>100</b> for use in ranging and Doppler measurement applications.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0088">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> of the drawings, a high-resolution medical ultrasound system <b>150</b> which utilizes an illustrative embodiment of the pulse compression system <b>100</b> is illustrated. The system <b>150</b> may include an ultrasound transducer <b>152</b> into which the pulse compression system <b>100</b> is installed. A CPU <b>151</b> may interface with the ultrasound transducer <b>152</b>. External devices may interface with the CPU <b>151</b>. The external devices may include transducer pulse controls <b>156</b>, a printer <b>157</b>, a disc storage device <b>158</b>, a keyboard/cursor <b>159</b> and a display <b>160</b>, for example and without limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0089">The pulse compression system <b>100</b> in the ultrasound transducer <b>152</b> transmits high frequency sound pulses <b>161</b> into a patient's body <b>162</b>. The sound pulses <b>161</b> travel through the patient's body <b>162</b>, passing through different types of tissue. Although the average speed of sound through human tissues is 1540 m/s, it does vary with exact tissue type. While the speed of sound through fat is 1459 m/s, it passes through bone at 4080 m/s. When sound encounters two adjacent tissue types with different acoustic properties, a proportion of the sound energy is reflected as reflected sound pulses <b>163</b>. These boundaries between different tissue types are called acoustic interfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0090">The amount of reflected sound pulses <b>163</b> reflected back from an acoustic interface depends on a property of the materials on either side of the interface called acoustic impedance. The acoustic impedance of a material is simply the density of the material multiplied by the speed at which sound travels through the material.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0091">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> of the drawings, a high resolution sonar system <b>164</b> which utilizes an illustrative embodiment of the pulse compression system <b>100</b> is illustrated. The pulse compression system <b>100</b> of the high resolution sonar system <b>164</b> can be used to power and drive the sonar beam generators <b>166</b> of the pulse compression system <b>100</b> to emit a sonar pulse <b>165</b> which may have a fan shape, as illustrated. The high resolution sonar system <b>164</b> uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect other vessels. There are two types of technology which share the name &#x201c;sonar&#x201d;: passive sonar is essentially listening for the sound made by vessels; active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes. Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of &#x201c;targets&#x201d; in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> of the drawings, a high resolution synthetic radar system <b>170</b> which utilizes an illustrative embodiment of the pulse compression system <b>100</b> is illustrated. The pulse compression system <b>100</b> may be provided in a spacecraft <b>171</b> and emits a high resolution synthetic radar pulse <b>175</b> against a target <b>174</b>. A reflected signal (not illustrated) is reflected from the target <b>174</b> back to the pulse compression system <b>100</b>. A data processor <b>172</b> interfaces with the system <b>100</b> and auto-correlates the reflected signal and the emitted high resolution synthetic radar pulse <b>175</b>. A high resolution image of the target <b>174</b> is shown on a display <b>173</b> which interfaces with the data processor <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093">Beginning with the launch of SESAT in 1978, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) have provided a wealth of information on such diverse phenomena as surface waves, internal waves, currents, upwelling, shoals, sea ice, wind and rainfall. SAR is the premier sensor for such phenomena because it is sensitive to small surface roughness changes of the order of Radar wavelength (1 millimeter down to several centimeters). It is also independent of solar illumination and is generally unaffected by cloud cover. Most modern RADARs (including SARs) transmit a pulse <b>175</b> known as linear modulated waveform and use the standard RADAR principles of range resolution and Doppler shift. Hence the linear FM pulse generator can be replaced with the pulse compression system <b>100</b> to produce higher solution in SAR images on the display <b>173</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0094">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A-18C</figref> of the drawings, a high resolution ground penetrating radar system <b>180</b> which utilizes an illustrative embodiment of the pulse compression system <b>100</b> is illustrated. Ground Penetrating RADAR (GPR) utilizes a very short burst of radio-frequency energy as a pulse <b>185</b> which is transmitted from the non-linear FM transmitter <b>101</b> via the transmit antenna <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>) of the pulse compression system <b>100</b> and radiated into the ground <b>181</b> to detect discontinuities in the ground <b>181</b>. The scattered pulse <b>186</b> is reflected from the ground <b>181</b> and detected by a receive antenna <b>104</b><i>a</i>. A signal processor and recorder <b>102</b> auto-correlates the scattered pulse <b>186</b> and the transmitted pulse <b>185</b> and records or displays a high-resolution image of the ground <b>181</b> or objects or discontinuities in the ground <b>181</b> on a display <b>107</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A</figref> and <b>18</b>B. Alternative applications of the pulse compression system <b>100</b> in implementation of the high resolution ground penetrating radar system <b>180</b> are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0095">The objects or discontinuities in the ground <b>181</b> can be cavities, voids, transitions between soil and rock, filled areas and/or buried objects. The performance of conventional GPRs is limited by attenuation of the transmitted pulse in moist soils, especially soils having high clay content. GPRs are used to detect a boundary between rock and air (a cave or cavity) or between one type of soil and another (for example undisturbed soil-to back-filled soil). The strength of the echo signal is dependent on the absorption of the signal to and from the radar to the target, the size and shape of the target, and the degree of discontinuity at the reflecting boundary.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0096">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> of the drawings, a high resolution air traffic control system <b>190</b> which utilizes an illustrative embodiment of the pulse compression system <b>100</b> is illustrated. The air traffic control system <b>190</b> may include a ground control <b>191</b> having a ground control tower <b>192</b>. The pulse compression system <b>100</b> may be provided in the ground control tower <b>192</b>. An antenna <b>104</b> of the pulse compression system <b>100</b> emits pulses <b>193</b> which are reflected from flying aircraft <b>194</b>. Return pulses (not illustrated) reflected from the aircraft <b>194</b> are received by the antenna <b>104</b> and processed as was heretofore described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> to generate a high-resolution image of the aircraft <b>194</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0097">Air traffic control systems are critically dependent on the use of RADAR technology for the safety of tens of thousands of aircrafts and millions of passengers every day. With the increase in air traffic, there is need for high resolution air traffic tracking systems. Currently, pulsed radars and FMCW radars are used for range measurement and Doppler measurements. With the use of the non-linear FM pulse compression system <b>100</b>, the performance of the air traffic systems <b>190</b> can be significantly improved with more accurate estimation and detection of aircraft <b>194</b>. In particular, the relative positions of those aircraft <b>194</b> which would otherwise come within dangerously close proximity to each other may be detected sufficiently early to prevent such close proximity and avert potential aviation accidents.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0098">A free electron laser (FEL) is a laser which shares the same optical properties as conventional lasers such as emission of an electron beam having coherent electromagnetic radiation which can reach high power but which uses some very different operating principles to form the beam. Unlike gas, liquid or solid-state lasers such as diode lasers, in which electrons are excited in bound atomic or molecular states, FELs use a relativistic electron beam as the lasing medium which moves freely through a magnetic structure (hence the term free electron). The free electron laser has the widest frequency range of any laser type and can be widely tunable, currently ranging in the wavelength from microwaves through terahertz radiation and infrared, to the visible spectrum, to ultraviolet, to X-ray.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0099">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> of the drawings, a free electron laser system <b>200</b> is illustrated. In the free electron laser system <b>200</b>, an FEL oscillator in the form of a &#x201c;wiggler&#x201d; or undulator <b>207</b> includes two parallel series of permanent magnets <b>201</b> having alternating poles <b>201</b><i>a</i>. A fullsilvered mirror <b>202</b> and a half-silvered mirror <b>203</b> may be placed at opposite ends of the undulator <b>207</b>. An electron source <b>205</b> is adapted to emit an electron beam <b>206</b> to almost light speed (relativistic speed) into a laser cavity <b>208</b> between the parallel series of magnets <b>201</b> and within a path of light <b>204</b> between the full-silvered mirror <b>202</b> and the half-silvered mirror <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0100">The array of magnets <b>201</b> of the undulator <b>207</b> forces the electrons in the electron beam <b>206</b> to follow a sinusoidal path. The acceleration of the electrons along the sinusoidal path of the electron beam <b>206</b> results in a release of a photon (synchroton radiation). Since the electron motion is in phase with the field of the light <b>204</b> already emitted, the fields add together coherently. Whereas conventional undulators would cause the electrons to radiate independently, instabilities in the undulators and the radiation they emit leads to bunching of the electrons, which continue to radiate in phase with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0101">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> of the drawings, a schematic diagram which illustrates implementation of an alternative illustrative embodiment of a free electron laser system <b>210</b> is illustrated. In the free electron laser <b>210</b>, each undulator <b>217</b> includes two parallel series of permanent magnets <b>211</b> each of which is a modified Halbach array (hereinafter referred to as a &#x201c;Ronbach&#x201d; array) in which the magnetic north pole <b>211</b><i>a </i>and the magnetic south pole <b>211</b><i>b </i>of alternating magnets face the same direction. A full-silvered mirror <b>212</b> and a half-silvered mirror <b>213</b> may be placed at opposite ends of the undulator <b>217</b>. An electron source <b>215</b> is adapted to emit an electron beam <b>216</b> to almost light speed (relativistic speed) into a laser cavity <b>218</b> between the parallel series of magnets <b>201</b> and within a path of light <b>214</b> between the full-silvered mirror <b>212</b> and the half-silvered mirror <b>213</b>. The Ronbach magnetic array of the undulator <b>217</b> may result in 71% increase of magnetic field as opposed to 41% increase of magnetic field for Halbach magnetic arrays.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0102">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> of the drawings, a schematic diagram which illustrates implementation of another alternative illustrative embodiment of a free electron laser system <b>220</b> is illustrated. The undulator <b>223</b> of the free electron laser system <b>220</b> may include two parallel series of electromagnets with random phase distribution <b>221</b>. A laser cavity <b>220</b> may be defined between the parallel series of electromagnets with random phase distribution <b>221</b>. Accordingly, the magnetic polarity of the electromagnets with random phase distribution <b>221</b> is changed at random, inducing a random modulation of the electron beam <b>222</b> as it is emitted through the laser cavity <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0103">Referring next to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> of the drawings, a schematic diagram which illustrates implementation of an illustrative embodiment of a free electron laser system <b>230</b> is illustrated. The undulator <b>234</b> of the free electron laser system <b>230</b> may include two parallel series of electromagnets with random phase distribution <b>231</b> and electromagnets with alternating north and south poles <b>232</b>. A laser cavity <b>235</b> may be defined between the parallel series of electromagnets with random phase distribution <b>221</b>. Accordingly, the free electron laser system <b>230</b> may be operated in a two-cycle operation in which the electromagnets with random phase distribution <b>221</b> are energized during the first cycle and the electromagnets with alternating north and south poles <b>232</b> are energized during the second cycle. This causes the electron beam <b>233</b> to undergo several oscillations, resulting in radiation of intense concentrated energy in narrow energy bands of the spectrum as it is emitted through the laser cavity <b>235</b>.</p>
