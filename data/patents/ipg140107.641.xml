<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a wall leveling device, and more particularly, to an adjustable stud adapter and a method for manufacturing and using the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Discussion of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In construction, studs function as structural members, providing a stable frame to which walls and ceilings are attached. A plurality of studs spaced apart from each other form a planar surface for securely receiving a wall or a ceiling. Studs are frequently constructed of wood. Irregularities and imperfections in the wood used to form a stud may result in a change in shape of the stud. For example, irregularities and imperfections in a wood stud may result in the wood stud not being straight, and thus, not being coplanar with adjacent studs. When studs are not coplanar, an attached wall or ceiling may not be flat, level, or plumb.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, an adjustable stud adapter includes a front surface, a side surface, a first positioning slot, and a second positioning slot. The side surface is substantially perpendicular to the front surface. The first positioning slot and the second positioning slot are formed on the side surface, have an elongated shape, and are substantially parallel to each other. The adjustable stud adapter is configured to attach to a stud.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The adjustable stud adapter may have an L-shape, the front surface forming one leg of the L-shape, and the side surface forming the other leg of the L-shape.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, a method of leveling a surface includes slidably attaching an adjustable stud adapter to a stud via a first positioning slot and a second positioning slot disposed on a side surface of the adjustable stud adapter by partially driving a first fastener into the stud through the first positioning slot, and partially driving a second fastener into the stud through the second positioning slot, adjusting a plumbness of a front surface of the adjustable stud adapter by slidably adjusting an angle of the adjustable stud adapter relative to the stud, wherein the angle of the adjustable stud adapter is adjusted by sliding edges of the first positioning slot and the second positioning slot on the first fastener and on the second fastener, respectively, wherein the front surface is substantially perpendicular to the side surface, and securely attaching the adjustable stud adapter to the stud via the first positioning slot and the second positioning slot by further driving the first fastener into the stud through the first positioning slot, and further driving the second fastener into the stud through the second positioning slot.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, a method of leveling a surface includes inserting a first fastener through a first positioning slot disposed on a side surface of an adjustable stud adapter and inserting a second fastener through a second positioning slot disposed on the side surface of the adjustable stud adapter to slidably attach the adjustable stud adapter to a stud, wherein the first and second positioning slots have an elongated shape and are substantially parallel to each other, slidably adjusting a position of the adjustable stud adapter relative to the stud about the first fastener and about the second fastener to adjust a plumbness of a front surface of the adjustable stud adapter, wherein the front surface is substantially perpendicular to the side surface, and tightening the first and second fasteners to securely attach the adjustable stud adapter to the stud.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The studs <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> function as structural members during construction, and provide a stable frame to which a wall or ceiling may be attached. For example, a wall or ceiling constructed from sheetrock or paneling may be attached to the studs <b>200</b>. If any of the studs <b>200</b> have irregularities or imperfections, such as, for example, warping or bowing, a change in the shape of the stud <b>200</b> may occur. For example, irregularities and imperfections in a stud <b>200</b> may result in the stud <b>200</b> not being straight, and thus, not being coplanar with adjacent studs <b>200</b>. When studs <b>200</b> are not coplanar with each other, an attached wall or ceiling will not be plumb (e.g., flat, straight or level). According to an exemplary embodiment, an adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> may be attached to a stud <b>200</b> that is not coplanar with adjacent studs <b>200</b>. The adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> is attached to the stud <b>200</b> such that the front surface <b>101</b> of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> is coplanar with adjacent studs <b>200</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>, the angle of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> with respect to the stud <b>200</b> is adjusted based on the irregularities of the stud <b>200</b> to make the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> plumb, and based on how the stud <b>200</b> sits in relation to other studs <b>200</b> on the same wall or ceiling. Thus, adjustable stud adapters <b>100</b> may be used to perform a method of leveling, plumbing, or flattening a wall.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The positioning slots <b>103</b> allow the position of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> to be adjusted while the plumbness of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> is being measured. That is, the positioning slots <b>103</b> allow for concurrent adjustment and measurement of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b>. Plumbness refers to the straightness of the front surface <b>101</b> of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to an embodiment, installation of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> may be described as including two phases. In a first phase, referred to herein as the adjustment phase, the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> is loosely secured to a stud <b>200</b> by placing at least one fastener <b>301</b> through at least one positioning slot <b>103</b> and into the stud <b>200</b>. Since the positioning slots <b>103</b> are parallel with each other and are elongated, a plurality of fasteners <b>301</b> may be placed in a plurality of positioning slots <b>103</b> to better maintain the position of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b>, while still allowing the plumbness of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> to be adjusted. For example, a fastener <b>301</b> may be placed in the uppermost positioning slot <b>103</b> and the lowermost positioning slot <b>103</b> to maintain the position of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> while adjusting the plumbness. The fastener <b>301</b> may be a nail or screw such as, for example, a metal dry wall screw, however the fastener <b>301</b> is not limited thereto. The size of the fastener <b>301</b> may vary, and should be chosen with respect to the size of the positioning slots <b>103</b>. For example, the fastener <b>301</b> should be small enough relative to the positioning slot <b>103</b> such that the fastener <b>301</b> does not catch the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> during tightening, and thus, change the position of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b>. In addition, the fastener <b>301</b> should not be too small relative to the positioning slot <b>103</b> such that the fastener <b>301</b> slips through the positioning slot <b>103</b> during tightening. In the adjustment phase, the fastener <b>301</b> is attached tight enough to maintain the position of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> on the stud <b>200</b>, but loose enough to allow the angle of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> with to be adjusted with respect to the stud <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Once the plumbness of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> has been adjusted and is satisfactory, the fastener <b>301</b> is tightened to securely attach the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> to the stud <b>200</b>. For example, the fastener <b>301</b> inserted through the positioning slot <b>103</b> in the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> may be tightened to secure the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> to the stud <b>200</b> so that the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> does not move. Additional fasteners <b>301</b> in a plurality of positioning slots <b>103</b> may be used to stabilize the position of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b>. This phase is referred to as the attachment phase.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The interior area of both the front surface <b>101</b> and the side surface <b>102</b> of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> (e.g., the area of the front surface <b>101</b> and side surface <b>102</b> that makes contact with the stud <b>200</b>) is substantially smooth, and does not have any rough edges or burrs. The smoothness of the interior areas allows the plumbness of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> to be adjusted while the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> is loosely secured to the stud <b>200</b> during the attachment phase. For example, the smoothness of the interior areas allows the person installing the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> to slide portions of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> towards and away from the stud <b>200</b> in order to adjust the plumbness. Rough edges or burrs present on the interior areas would hinder the installer's ability to slidably adjust the position of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> when adjusting the plumbness. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, smooth interior areas of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> allow an installer to slidably move the top portion of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> away from the uneven stud <b>200</b> about a horizontal axis, and slidably move the bottom portion of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> towards the uneven stud <b>200</b> about the horizontal axis when adjusting the plumbness of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b>. Similarly, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, smooth interior areas of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> allow an installer to slidably move the top portion of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> towards the uneven stud <b>200</b> about the horizontal axis, and slidably move the bottom portion of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> away from the uneven stud <b>200</b> about the horizontal axis when adjusting the plumbness of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Since the adjustable stud adapters <b>100</b> allow for concurrent adjustment and measurement, multiple adjustable stud adapters <b>100</b> may be simultaneously installed onto multiple studs <b>200</b>, and the plumbness and/or flatness of the multiple adjustable stud adapters <b>100</b> may be simultaneously adjusted with respect to each other. That is, the design and functionality of the adjustable stud adapters <b>100</b> in the current disclosure allow for multiple adjustable stud adapters <b>100</b> to be put in place and adjusted concurrently. For example, multiple adjustable stud adapters <b>100</b> may be attached to multiple studs <b>200</b> such that they are tight enough to maintain the position of the adjustable stud adapters <b>100</b> on the studs <b>200</b>, and loose enough to allow the plumbness of the adjustable stud adapters <b>100</b> to be adjusted. The ability to simultaneously adjust the plumbness of multiple adjustable stud adapters <b>100</b> is useful in situations where multiple studs <b>200</b> of the same wall or ceiling are not coplanar with adjacent studs <b>200</b>. In this situation, it is likely that the multiple adjustable stud adapters <b>100</b> will have to be re-adjusted a number of times, since the plumbness of each adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> depends on the plumbness of adjacent adjustable stud adapters <b>100</b>. The ability to slidably adjust each adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> before finally securing each adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> to its corresponding stud <b>200</b> aids the installer in a situation where multiple studs <b>100</b> are not plumb and require the installation of an adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> includes two surfaces&#x2014;a front surface <b>101</b> and a side surface <b>102</b>. As a result of this design, the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> may be attached to a stud <b>200</b> without the installer being required to have access to the entire stud <b>200</b>. For example, a stud <b>200</b> in the corner of a wall or in the corner of a ceiling (e.g., a corner stud) may not be straight, and may require an adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> to make the corner stud coplanar with adjacent studs. Since the corner stud is located in a corner, the user does not have access to both sides of the corner stud. Rather, the user only has access to the front surface of the corner stud (e.g., the surface to which a wall or ceiling is to be attached) and one side surface of the corner stud. The installer does not have access to the side surface opposite the accessible side surface. In this situation, the side surface <b>102</b> of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> may be attached to the accessible side surface of the corner stud, and the plumbness may be adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In addition to allowing for the installation of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> on a corner stud, the design of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> results in a cost-efficient manufacturing process. For example, since the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> includes only two surfaces (e.g. the front surface <b>101</b> and the side surface <b>102</b>), a single sheet of material (e.g., steel or aluminum) only has to be bent once to form the two surfaces <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b>. This results in a cost-efficient manufacturing process, since a minimal amount of material and a minimal amount of steps are required to form the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b>. The adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> may be manufactured using, for example, a hot-dip galvanizing process, and the manufacturing process may utilize the same type of machinery used to produce steel studs. The positioning slots <b>103</b> may be made using, for example, a grinder or a metal cutting blade.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to an embodiment, the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> includes a hemmed vertical joint for additional strength.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an adjustable stud adapter, according to an exemplary embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The adjustable stud adapter <b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is substantially similar to the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except that the adjustable stud adapter <b>400</b> also includes a plurality of securing holes <b>401</b>. In an exemplary embodiment, the securing holes <b>401</b> may be located about 1 inch away from the positioning slots <b>103</b>, however the location of the securing holes <b>401</b> is not limited thereto. The securing holes <b>401</b> are utilized during the attachment phase to further secure the adjustable stud adapter <b>400</b> to a stud <b>200</b>. The securing holes <b>401</b> provide an extra level of stability when attaching the adjustable stud adapter <b>400</b> to a stud <b>200</b>. For example, during the adjustment phase, the adjustable stud adapter <b>400</b> is loosely secured to a stud <b>200</b> by placing at least one fastener <b>301</b> through at least one positioning slot <b>103</b> and into the stud <b>200</b>. The fastener <b>301</b> is attached in a manner that is tight enough to maintain the position of the adjustable stud adapter <b>400</b> on the stud <b>200</b>, and loose enough to allow the plumbness of the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> to be adjusted. Once the plumbness of the adjustable stud adapter <b>400</b> has been adjusted and is satisfactory, a fastener may be inserted through at least one of the securing holes <b>401</b> and into the stud <b>200</b> during an attachment phase. The fastener inserted into the securing hole <b>401</b> may be a nail or a screw such as, for example, a metal dry wall screw, however the fastener is not limited thereto. The size of the securing hole <b>401</b> should correspond to the size of the fastener such that the fastener forms a tight fit with the securing hole <b>401</b>. The combination of the securing holes <b>401</b> and the corresponding fasteners maintains the position of the adjustable stud adapter <b>400</b> during the attachment phase once plumbness has been measured. For example, utilizing the securing holes <b>401</b> may prevent the adjustable stud adapter <b>100</b> from moving along a positioning slot <b>103</b> when a screw placed through the positioning slot <b>103</b> is tightened. The securing holes <b>401</b> may be used in conjunction with the positioning slots <b>103</b> to attach the adjustable stud adapter <b>400</b> during the attachment phase, or in place of the positioning slots <b>103</b> to attach the adjustable stud adapter <b>400</b> during the attachment phase.</p>
