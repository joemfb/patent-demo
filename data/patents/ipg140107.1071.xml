<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a higher viscosity personal care composition for use in combination with a foaming dispenser such that a desired foam profile is produced.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Desired foam characteristics for consumer products, such as personal care compositions, are dependent upon the end use and consumer expectations. If a consumer foamed product is expected to be applied to a surface other than the hands of the consumer, there are properties that define acceptable foam characteristics. Acceptable foam characteristics in personal care composition are exemplified by foam that holds its shape and stays in a consistent form in order to transfer from a consumer's hand to the desired location on the consumer's body (e.g., hair, face, arms, legs, etc.). If foam collapses prematurely and becomes a liquid, any movement of the consumer's hand, specifically the palm of the hand, from a horizontal position to a non-horizontal position for application causes the foam to run, drip or otherwise move from the consumer's hand before the foam reaches the desired location and is considered undesirable. This foam characteristic is especially undesirable when working with personal care compositions that can change the color or tint the surface it touches, such as hair dying composition or skin lightening or tinting compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Likewise, foam that is too &#x201c;airy&#x201d; cause consumers to apply the personal care composition at a higher frequency as the amount of personal care composition per dosage is diminished with a foam containing more air than composition.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Manually-actuable, non-aerosol dispenser useful herein includes squeeze foamers. The basic mechanism by which such foamers operate is that liquid from a container reservoir is pumped into a liquid/air mixing chamber where air is mixed with liquid held within the container. Foam is generated (air into liquid) and then passed through one or more screens to refine the foam which is then dispensed. Traditionally, liquids that were used in such foamers were described as having a &#x201c;high&#x201d; viscosity when the viscosity (at 25&#xb0; C.) is 100 cps (0.1 pascal seconds) or less. See US 2004/0254253 A1. Although viscosities (at 25&#xb0; C.) of up to 300 cps (0.3 pascal seconds) of liquids for such foamers has been discussed. See US 2004/0213752 A1. Use of polymers to increase the viscosity of a personal cleaning composition that is foamed is known, but with target viscosities of the composition are targeted to be less than 100 cps (0.1 pascal seconds). See WO 91/14759.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One drawback of the manner under which the manually-actuable, non-aerosol dispenser foamers operate to generate foam is that higher viscosity materials (higher than 300 cps or 0.3 pascal seconds) make squeezing too difficult as large amounts of work (an applied force moving an object in a distance) is required to expel higher viscosity liquids from such foaming containers.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additional benefits of the present invention include a desired foam specific volume of the resulting foamed personal care composition, reduction in force required to actuate the manually-actuable, non-aerosol dispenser, improved end results of the personal care composition such as improved color results and improved amount of personal care product delivered per dosage. The present disclosure includes foamers that reduce the amount of work required to expel a desired quantity of foam, while substantially preserving the desired foam specific volume, thereby improving the ease of dispensing foam personal care compositions.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The personal care article of the present application utilizes a personal care composition comprising certain rheological characteristics, such as having a desired low-shear viscosity and that the composition is shear-thinning (e.g. comprising a viscosity which decreases as shear is applied to the composition) during dispensing of the personal care composition.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The desired viscosity profile ensures a desired consumer experience when in contact with the personal care composition. The foam specific volume is impacted by the rheological properties and the liquid to air ratio. The rheology properties of the composition after it is foamed, and the foam collapsed, is selected such that the composition does not drip or run from the surface on which it is applied, such as hair.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As used herein &#x201c;foam&#x201d; means a personal care composition which after being passed through a manually-actuable, non-aerosol dispenser has bubbles that sustain their shape and give a volume independent of any type of container. It is preferably that the volume is a foam specific volume from about 6 ml/g to about 14 ml/g, such as about 7.5 ml/g to about 12 ml/g, such as from about 8 ml/g to about 11 ml/g. One embodiment is a foam specific volume of about 10 ml/g.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Manually-actuable, non-aerosol dispensers for foam generation are well known in the art. These foam dispensers comprise a reservoir for holding a liquid to be dispensed in the form of foam with an assembly which can be mounted on or in an opening of the reservoir. The assembly comprises a dip tube which extends into the reservoir and into contact with the personal care composition, then the dip tube extends in the opposite direction from the reservoir into a mixing chamber, a liquid pump for pumping the liquid from the reservoir and an air pump to mix air with the liquid in the mixing chamber in order to form foam. The foam is dispensed out of the mixing chamber and through a dispensing channel out of a dispensing head comprising a dispensing orifice. In the dispensing channel one or more porous elements such as sieves or screens that may be arranged to form homogeneous foam.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The amount of work required for dispensing the personal care composition with the higher viscosities described herein (higher than 300 cps (0.3 pascal seconds)) is unique verses known lower viscosity personal care compositions such as foam hand wash products. It is unique in that with lower viscosity personal care composition, more work is expended moving air than the liquid in such systems. For higher viscosity personal care compositions (higher than 300 cps (0.3 pascal seconds)), more work is expended to move the liquid than the air in such systems.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The use of higher viscosity personal care compositions and the amount of work required to move the higher viscosity personal care composition further poses unique problems relating the amount of shear generated in the manually-actuable, non-aerosol dispensers suitable for use herein. The use of higher viscosity personal care compositions further affects the ratio of liquid to air. The ratio of liquid (personal care composition) to air is from about 1:6 to about 1:15, preferably from about 1:8 to about 1:12, preferably 1:10.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The amount of work, shear generation, residence time of liquid in the shear and liquid to air ratio are aspects that can be attributed to the manually-actuable, non-aerosol dispenser structure. The portions of the manually-actuable, non-aerosol dispenser structure that have been found to affect the amount of work to dispense the manually-actuable, non-aerosol dispenser include the dimensions of the dip tube, dimensions of the air ingress into the mixing chamber, mixing chamber dimensions, including the ingress and egress orifices from the mixing chamber, dispensing channel dimensions, porous elements (such as screens or meshes) and dispensing head orifice.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The manually-actuable, non-aerosol dispenser comprises a reservoir. The reservoir comprises a volume such that the reservoir volume is larger than the volume of the personal care composition contained within the reservoir. The area of the reservoir that is not occupied by the personal care composition is the head space. The head space should remain relatively free of the personal care composition or bubbles of the personal care composition. If the reservoir is shaken or inverted while the personal care composition is contained therein, the head space should remain relatively free of the personal care composition or bubbles thereof. As used in this paragraph, &#x201c;relatively free&#x201d; means less than 50%, such as less than 75%, such as less than 90%, such as 75% to 100% of the head space volume is free from the personal care composition or bubbles thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The reservoir is selected to have enough volume to contain the personal care composition, any part of the mechanism for foaming the personal care composition (such as a dip tube) and still have head space.

Modification of the various orifice (<b>9</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>13</b>) areas (the two-dimensions of the indicating orifices that comprise part of the mixing chamber (<b>5</b>) exterior wall) can affect the foam specific density, particularly the correlation of the air ingress orifice (<b>9</b>) and the liquid ingress orifice (<b>11</b>) such that the liquid to air ratio is appropriate.</p>
