<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method for wireless communications where a control packet is not transmitted for all transmissions of a new data packet. A control packet is only sent with a retransmission of a data packet where the previously transmitted data packet is not completely received. The control packet contains information related to a previously transmitted data packet. The previously transmitted data packet and the retransmission data packet are derived from common data. The common data is derived based on the information related to the previously transmitted data packet, wherein the previously transmitted data packet and the retransmission data packet are associated with a series of data packets.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present disclosed aspects relates generally to communications, and more specifically to method and apparatus for low-overhead packet data transmission and control of reception mode.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Background</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A wireless multiple-access communication system may include many Node Bs (or base stations) that support communication for many user equipments (UEs). A Node B may communicate with multiple UEs on the downlink and uplink. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the Node Bs to the UEs, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the UEs to the Node Bs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the downlink, a Node B may transmit data to multiple UEs using dedicated data channels and/or a shared data channel. A dedicated data channel is a data channel that is assigned to a specific UE and is used to send data only to that UE. A shared data channel is a data channel that is shared by multiple UEs and can carry data for one or more UEs at any given moment. A data channel is a mechanism for sending data and may be dependent on the radio technology used by the system. For example, in a Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) system, a data channel may be associated with a specific channelization code, e.g., a specific Walsh code.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A Node B may use a shared data channel to achieve various benefits. The shared data channel may allow for better utilization of the available radio resources since each UE may be served as needed and using just enough radio resources to serve that UE. The shared data channel may also support higher peak data rates for the UEs since all radio resources available for the shared data channel may potentially be used for one UE. The shared data channel may also provide flexibility in scheduling the UEs for data transmission on the downlink.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A Node B may send signaling on a shared control channel in parallel with the shared data channel to convey how the shared data channel is used. For example, the signaling may convey which UE(s) are being served, the radio resources allocated to each UE being served, how data is sent to each UE, etc. Because of the dynamic nature of the shared data channel, the UEs that can potentially receive data on the shared data channel may continuously monitor the shared control channel in order to determine whether data is being sent for them. Each UE that receives signaling on the shared control channel may process the shared data channel based on the received signaling to recover the data sent to the UE. However, the shared control channel represents overhead for the shared data channel.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is therefore a need in the art for reducing the shared channel overhead.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Aspects disclosed herein address the above stated needs by providing a system that eliminates the transmission of control channel signaling for new transmissions and only transmits control channel signaling for retransmissions. Also, a discontinuous reception mode is created for the UE so that it can be powered down at predetermined intervals.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Various aspects of the disclosure are described below. For convenience, one or more aspects of the disclosure may be referred to herein simply as &#x201c;an aspect,&#x201d; &#x201c;aspects,&#x201d; or &#x201c;some aspects.&#x201d; It should be apparent that the teachings herein may be embodied in a wide variety of forms and that any specific structure, function, or both being disclosed herein is merely representative. Based on the teachings herein one skilled in the art should appreciate that an aspect disclosed herein may be implemented independently of any other aspects and that two or more of these aspects may be combined in various ways. For example, an apparatus may be implemented or a method may be practiced using any number of the aspects set forth herein. In addition, such an apparatus may be implemented or such a method may be practiced using other structure, functionality, or structure and functionality in addition to or other than one or more of the aspects set forth herein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a wireless communication system <b>100</b> with multiple Node Bs <b>110</b> and multiple UEs <b>120</b>. A Node B is generally a fixed station that communicates with the UEs and may also be referred to as a base station, an enhanced Node B (eNode B), an access point, etc. Each Node B <b>110</b> provides communication coverage for a particular geographic area and supports communication for the UEs located within the coverage area. A system controller <b>130</b> couples to Node Bs <b>110</b> and provides coordination and control for these Node Bs. System controller <b>130</b> may be a single network entity or a collection of network entities. For example, system controller <b>130</b> may comprise a Radio Network Controller (RNC), a Mobile Switching Center (MSC), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">UEs <b>120</b> may be dispersed throughout the system, and each UE may be stationary or mobile. A UE may also be referred to as a mobile station, a terminal, an access terminal, a subscriber unit, a station, etc. A UE may be a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a wireless modem, a laptop computer, and so on. A UE may actively communicate with a Node B or may only receive pilot and signaling from the Node B. The terms &#x201c;UE&#x201d; and &#x201c;user&#x201d; are used interchangeably herein.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block diagram of a Node B <b>110</b> and a UE <b>120</b>, which are one of the Node Bs and one of the UEs in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. At Node B <b>110</b>, a transmit (TX) data processor <b>210</b> receives traffic data from a data source (not shown) and signaling from a controller/processor <b>240</b>, processes (e.g., formats, encodes, interleaves, and symbol maps) the traffic data and signaling, and provides data symbols and signaling symbols. A modulator <b>220</b> processes the data and signaling symbols as specified by the system and provides output chips. A transmitter (TMTR) <b>222</b> processes (e.g., converts to analog, amplifies, filters, and frequency upconverts) the output chips and generates a downlink signal, which is transmitted from an antenna <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">At UE <b>120</b>, an antenna <b>252</b> receives the downlink signal from Node B <b>110</b> and provides a received signal to a receiver (RCVR) <b>254</b>. Receiver <b>254</b> conditions (e.g., filters, amplifies, frequency downconverts, and digitizes) the received signal and provides received samples. A demodulator (Demod) <b>260</b> processes the received samples in a manner complementary to the processing by modulator <b>220</b> and provides symbol estimates. A receive (RX) data processor <b>270</b> processes (e.g., symbol demaps, deinterleaves, and decodes) the symbol estimates and provides decoded data for UE <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">On the uplink, at UE <b>120</b>, data and signaling are processed by a TX data processor <b>290</b>, modulated by a modulator <b>292</b>, conditioned by a transmitter <b>294</b>, and transmitted via antenna <b>252</b>. At Node B <b>110</b>, the uplink signals from UE <b>120</b> and other UEs are received by antenna <b>224</b>, conditioned by a receiver <b>230</b>, demodulated by a demodulator <b>232</b>, and processed by an RX data processor <b>234</b> to recover data and signaling sent by the UEs. In general, the processing for uplink transmission may be similar to, or different from, the processing for downlink transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Controllers <b>240</b> and <b>280</b> direct the operations at Node B <b>110</b> and UE <b>120</b>, respectively. Memories <b>242</b> and <b>282</b> store data and program codes for Node B <b>110</b> and UE <b>120</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The techniques described herein may be used for various wireless communication systems such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) systems, Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA) systems, etc. The terms &#x201c;system&#x201d; and &#x201c;network&#x201d; are often used interchangeably. A CDMA system may utilize a radio technology such as Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA), cdma2000, etc. cdma2000 covers IS-2000, IS-856, and IS-95 standards. A TDMA system may utilize a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). These various radio technologies and standards are known in the art. W-CDMA and GSM are described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project&#x201d; (3GPP). cdma2000 is described in documents from an organization named &#x201c;3rd Generation Partnership Project 2&#x201d; (3GPP2). For clarity, the techniques are described below for downlink transmission in a W-CDMA system. However, it should be noted that techniques described herein could be implemented in compliance with other standards such as Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 802.11, 802.16 (WiMAX), and 802.20.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In W-CDMA, data for a UE is processed as one or more transport channels at a higher layer. The transport channels may carry data for one or more services, e.g., voice, video, packet data, gaming, etc. The transport channels are mapped to physical channels at a physical layer. The physical channels are channelized with different channelization codes and are orthogonal to one another in code domain.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">3GPP Release 5 and later supports High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA), which is a set of channels and procedures that enable high-speed packet data transmission on the downlink. For HSDPA, a Node B sends data on a High Speed Downlink Shared Channel (HS-DSCH), which is a downlink transport channel that is shared by all UEs in both time and code. The HS-DSCH may carry data for one or more UEs in a given transmission time interval (TTI). A TTI is equal to one subframe for HSDPA and is the smallest unit of time in which the UEs may be scheduled and served. The sharing of the HS-DSCH is dynamic and may change from TTI to TTI.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Table 1 lists some downlink and uplink physical channels used for HSDPA and provides a short description for each physical channel.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">For HSDPA, a Node B may use up to fifteen 16-chip channelization codes with spreading factor of 16 (SF=16) for the HS-PDSCH. The Node B may also use any number of 128-chip channelization codes with spreading factor of 128 (SF=128) for the HS-SCCH. The number of 16-chip channelization codes for the HS-PDSCH and the number of 128-chip channelization codes for the HS-SCCH are configurable. The channelization codes for the HS-PDSCH and HS-SCCH are orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes that may be generated in a structured manner. The spreading factor (SF) is the length of a channelization code. A symbol is spread with a channelization code of length SF to generate SF chips for the symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">A UE may be assigned up to fifteen 16-chip channelization codes for the HS-PDSCH and up to four 128-chip channelization codes for the HS-SCCH. The channelization codes for the HS-SCCH are assigned to the UE at call setup and signaled to the UE via upper layer signaling. The channelization codes for the HS-PDSCH are assigned dynamically and conveyed to the UE via signaling sent on the HS-SCCH using one of the assigned 128-chip channelization codes.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">HSDPA may also be considered as having (a) up to fifteen HS-PDSCHs, with each HS-PDSCH using a different 16-chip channelization code, and (b) any number of HS-SCCHs, with each HS-SCCH using a different 128-chip channelization code. In this case, a UE may be assigned up to four HS-SCCHs and up to fifteen HS-PDSCHs. In the following description, HSDPA is considered as having (a) a single HS-PDSCH with up to fifteen 16-chip channelization codes and (b) a single HS-SCCH with any number of 128-chip channelization codes. In the following description, references to channelization codes are for the HS-PDSCH unless noted otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a frame format in W-CDMA. The timeline for transmission is divided into radio frames. The radio frames on the downlink are defined relative to the timing of a Common Pilot Channel (CPICH). Each radio frame has a duration of 10 milliseconds (ms) and is identified by a 12-bit system frame number (SFN). Each radio frame is further partitioned into 15 slots, which are labeled as slot <b>0</b> through slot <b>14</b>. Each slot has a duration of 0.667 ms and includes 2560 chips at 3.84 megachips/second (Mcps). Each radio frame is also partitioned into five subframes <b>0</b> through <b>4</b>. Each subframe has a duration of 2 ms and spans 3 slots. The subframes of the HS-SCCH are time aligned with the radio frames of the CPICH. The subframes of the HS-PDSCH are shifted to the right (or delayed) by two slots relative to the subframes of the HS-SCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The HS-DSCH carries transport blocks for the UEs being served. A transport block is a block of data and may also be referred to as a data block, a packet, etc. Each transport block is encoded and modulated and then sent on the HS-PDSCH.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">HSDPA supports hybrid automatic retransmission (HARQ), which is also referred to as incremental redundancy (IR). With HARQ, a Node B sends a new transmission for a transport block and may send one or more retransmissions until the transport block is decoded correctly by a UE, or the maximum number of retransmissions has been sent, or some other termination condition is encountered. The Node B may thus send a variable number of transmissions for a transport block. The first transmission is referred to as a new transmission, and each subsequent transmission is referred to as a retransmission. HSDPA supports asynchronous IR, which means that a retransmission may be sent a variable amount of time after a prior transmission. In contrast, with synchronous IR, a retransmission is sent a fixed amount of time after a prior transmission. With both synchronous and asynchronous IR, there is a time gap between successive transmissions of a transport block. During this time gap, transmissions for other transport blocks may occur. Transmissions of different transport blocks may therefore be interleaved with HARQ.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For HARQ in HSDPA, a Node B generates a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for a transport block, appends the CRC to the transport block, and encodes the transport block and CRC based on a coding scheme or code rate to obtain a coded block. The CRC is used by a UE to detect errors after decoding. The Node B partitions the coded block into multiple redundancy versions. Each redundancy version may contain different encoded information (or code bits) for the transport block. The Node B may send one redundancy version for each transmission of the transport block. In HSDPA, the Node B may select the sequence of redundancy versions to send for the transport block.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The use of HS-SCCH signaling provides control information for all new transmissions and retransmissions. However, the control messages sent by the HS-SCCH signaling constitute overhead because they consume HS-SCCH codes (which are limited in number) as well as some power. To reduce the overhead by the use of HS-SCCH, it would be desirable to eliminate HS-SCCH signaling. In an aspect, the HS-SCCH signaling is eliminated for all new transmissions on the HS-PDSCH, and only used for retransmissions. The following description will first describe how transmissions using HS-SCCH is achieved for background purposes, and then describe how transmissions without HS-SCCH, also referred to as HS-SCCH-less transmissions, are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Where control signaling is used for each transmission on the HS-PDSCH, the Node B sends signaling on the HS-SCCH for each transmission sent on the HS-PDSCH. Table 2 gives the signaling sent on the HS-SCCH. The first column of Table 2 lists different fields or types of information included in the signaling, the second column gives the size of each field, and the third column gives a short description of what is conveyed by each field. The fourth and fifth columns, which describes the signaling when the HS-SCCH is sent (i.e., for all retransmissions) in the HS-SCCH-less transmission approach, are described below.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The signaling on the HS-SCCH includes transport format and resource related information (TFRI) and HARQ-related information (or HARQ information). The TFRI includes the channelization code set, modulation scheme, and transport block size. The HARQ information includes the HARQ process number, redundancy version, and new data indicator. The signaling is processed in two parts. Part <b>1</b> contains 8 bits for the channelization code set and modulation scheme. Part <b>2</b> contains 13 bits for the transport block size and HARQ information. A CRC is calculated over both parts <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>. Part <b>1</b> is encoded with a rate &#xbd; convolutional code, scrambled with the UE ID, and sent in the first slot of a subframe. Part <b>2</b> and the CRC are encoded with a rate &#xbd; convolutional code and sent in the last two slots of the subframe. This allows the UE to recover the time critical information of part <b>1</b> from the HS-SCCH prior to the data transmission on the HS-PDSCH.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows data transmission on the HS-DSCH with signaling. A UE periodically estimates its received signal quality based on a pilot and sends a channel quality indicator (CQI) on the HS-DPCCH. A Node B has data to send to the UE and schedules the UE for downlink transmission. The Node B sends signaling for the UE on the HS-SCCH and sends a first transmission of a transport block for the UE on the HS-PDSCH. The data transmission on the HS-PDSCH is delayed by two slots from the corresponding signaling transmission on the HS-SCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The UE processes the HS-SCCH and recovers the signaling sent to the UE. The UE then processes the HS-PDSCH based on the received signaling and recovers the transport block sent to the UE. The UE sends an acknowledgement (ACK) on the HS-DPCCH if the transport block is decoded correctly and sends a negative acknowledgement (NAK) otherwise. The UE also estimates the received signal quality and sends CQI along with the ACK or NAK on the HS-DPCCH. The feedback transmission on the HS-DPCCH is delayed by approximately 7.5 slots from the end of the corresponding data transmission on the HS-PDSCH.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The Node B may send a retransmission of the transport block if a NAK is received from the UE and may send a new transmission for another transport block if an ACK is received. The Node B sends signaling on the HS-SCCH and the retransmission or new transmission on the HS-PDSCH. The signaling indicates whether the HS-PDSCH carries a retransmission or a new transmission as well as other information. In general, the Node B may send a new transmission for a transport block and one or more retransmissions if necessary. The Node B may send multiple transport blocks in an interlaced manner, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows data transmission to multiple UEs in HSDPA. A Node B schedules UEs for data transmission on the HS-PDSCH in each TTI. The Node B sends signaling for the scheduled UEs on the HS-SCCH and sends transmissions for the scheduled UEs on the HS-PDSCH. Each UE that might receive data on the HS-PDSCH processes the HS-SCCH to determine whether signaling has been sent to that UE. Each scheduled UE processes the HS-PDSCH to recover the transport block sent to the UE. Each scheduled UE sends ACK/NAK and CQI feedback on the HS-DPCCH. UEs that are not scheduled in a given TTI may also send ACK/NAK for a prior transmission and CQI for the current TTI on the HS-DPCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, transmissions on the HS-PDSCH and signaling on the HS-SCCH for real-time services such as Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP), gaming, etc., are shown with solid shading. Transmissions on the HS-PDSCH and signaling on the HS-SCCH for other services such as best effort, etc., are shown with diagonal hashing. Each transmission on the HS-PDSCH is associated with corresponding signaling on the HS-SCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">HSDPA is designed and optimized for applications analogous to downloading large amounts of data. Many simulation results used in the design of HSDPA were generated based on a full-buffer traffic model. This premise leads to an HSDPA design that optimizes cell throughput rather than performance for delay sensitive applications, which may produce relatively small packets. Some of the consequences of the current HSDPA design are:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0064">1. The HS-SCCH carries many bits for signaling, as shown in Table 2,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0065">2. The HS-SCCH is encoded and transmitted in a sub-optimal manner,</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0066">3. The HS-PDSCH carries transport blocks that are relatively large for some real-time services, and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0067">4. The HS-DPCCH is continuously transmitted by each UE.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">The large amount of signaling on the HS-SCCH is used to support (a) flexible choice of assigned channelization codes for the HS-PDSCH, which can change on a transmission-by-transmission basis, (b) flexible choice of transport block size from 254 possible transport block sizes, (c) flexible choice of transmission and retransmission time for asynchronous IR, (d) flexible choice of redundancy version, and (e) flexible choice of modulation. All of these flexible features result in a large amount of overhead on the HS-SCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">Furthermore, the signaling on the HS-SCCH is split into two parts as described above to simplify UE implementation. The HS-PDSCH transmission is delayed relative to the HS-SCCH transmission, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, to also simplify UE implementation. Both of these characteristics are sub-optimal and cause the overhead due to the HS-SCCH to be even larger.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">The HS-PDSCH can carry transport blocks of different sizes to better match the data payloads of the UEs. HSDPA supports <b>254</b> transport block sizes ranging from 137 bits to 27,952 bits. The transport block sizes are dependent on the modulation scheme (e.g., QPSK or 16 QAM) and the number of channelization codes used for transmission on the HS-PDSCH. Different sets of transport block sizes are available for different numbers of channelization codes. For example, 103 transport block sizes ranging from 137 to 1871 bits may be used when one channelization code is assigned for the HS-PDSCH.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">The small transport block sizes may utilize too much channelization code space. Spreading factor of 16 is used for the HS-PDSCH because it reduces the amount of signaling to convey the assigned channelization code set while providing sufficient code space granularity for data. This choice of spreading factor results in small transport block sizes (which are seldom used for full-buffer traffic) having small effective code rates. For example, all transport block sizes from 137 to 449 bits with QPSK have a code rate of &#xbd; or less on the first transmission. For VoIP, a full-rate frame for 12.2 kilobits/second (kbps) adaptive multi-rate (AMR) speech contains 317 bits. A typical transport block size for this full-rate frame has a code rate of approximately &#x2153; on the first transmission. The excess capacity of this typical transport block size results in a low code rate for the first transmission, which may result in more radio resources being used for the full-rate frame than necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">Each UE that might receive data transmission on the HS-PDSCH continuously send feedback information (e.g., CQI) on the HS-DPCCH. The feedback information improves performance of data transmission on the downlink at the expense of uplink overhead and higher UE battery consumption. The flexible scheduling of UEs for data transmission on the HS-PDSCH requires the UEs to continuously monitor the HS-SCCH and continuously transmit on the HS-DPCCH.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">For the reasons noted above, the HSDPA design with HS-SCCH signaling provides good performance for applications resembling full-buffer traffic model but is inefficient for applications with low-throughput and/or delay-sensitive data. Furthermore, this HSDPA design does not consider issues related to continuous packet connectivity, such as uplink overhead and UE battery life.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">In an aspect, a Node B sends transmissions on a shared data channel (e.g., the HS-DSCH and HS-PDSCH) to a UE based on at least one parameter that is assigned to the UE prior to the transmissions. The Node B does not send signaling on a shared control channel (e.g., the HS-SCCH) for any new transmissions sent to the UE on the shared data channel (i.e., the Node B only sends HS-SCCH signaling on retransmissions on the shared data channel), which may greatly reduce overhead. The UE processes the transmissions received from the shared data channel based on the assigned parameters. A shared data channel may comprise channels at different layers (e.g., transport and physical channels) observed by a transport block or a data packet. As an example, for HSDPA, a shared data channel may comprise the HS-DSCH and HS-PDSCH. A shared data channel may comprise other channels for other radio technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0075">In general, any number of parameters and any type of parameter may be assigned to the UE. For example, the assigned parameters may include any one or any combination of the following:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0076">1. Channelization code parameters,</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0077">2. Coding and modulation parameters, and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0078">3. HARQ or retransmission parameters.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0079">The channelization code parameters may indicate the number of channelization codes and/or the specific channelization codes usable for transmissions to the UE. The assigned channelization codes may be any of the 16-chip channelization codes available for the HS-PDSCH and/or other channelization codes. For example, the UE may be assigned a channelization code with spreading factor of 32 or 64, which may occupy less code space than one 16-chip channelization code. The UE may process the shared data channel for only the assigned channelization codes and may ignore other channelization codes.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0080">The coding and modulation parameters may indicate how data is encoded and modulated. For example, the coding and modulation parameters may indicate one or more modulation schemes (e.g., QPSK and/or 16 QAM), one or more transport block sizes, one or more code rates, etc., usable for transmissions to the UE. The UE may process the shared data channel based on the assigned coding and modulation parameters. In an aspect, only QPSK is used, as shown in Table 2.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0081">The bits previously used for the HARQ parameters in the HS-SCCH mode of operation are repurposed to indicate parameters applicable for retransmissions to the UE such as with which previous transmission/retransmission the current transmission is associated (HS-SCCH-less Pointer). The number of the retransmission for a retransmission transport block (Retransmission ID) is also sent in the retransmission to indicate the previous transmission (if the current retransmission is a retransmission of a new transmission) or retransmission (if the current retransmission is a retransmission of a previous retransmission) with which the current retransmission transport block is associated. The redundancy versions for the transport block for each retransmission may be sent in a specific order that is known a priori by the Node B and UE. For example, a first redundancy version may be sent in a first retransmission for the transport block, a second redundancy version may be sent in a second retransmission, a third redundancy version may be sent in a third retransmission, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0082">In an aspect, if a UE supports the sending of ACK/NAK feedback, such that the ACK/NAK feedback setting may indicate whether to send both ACK and NAK feedback, only ACK feedback, etc., the UE will be set to only ACK feedback in the HS-SCCH-less mode of operation. For new transmissions when no signaling is sent on the HS-SCCH and where the UE encounters a decoding error, the UE may not be able to determine whether the decoding error resulted from (a) a transport block sent to the UE and decoded in error by the UE; (b) a transport block sent for another UE, where the UE is receiving the transport block being sent to another UE because the transport block is being sent over a shared channel (the decoding not being correct because the UE ID with which the transport block was coded was the UE ID of the other UE); or (c) no transport blocks sent to any UE. Therefore, a UE may not know when to send NAKs for its transport blocks. By sending only ACK feedback, extraneous and erroneous signaling for NAKs for such unrelated decoding errors due to transport blocks being sent to other UEs may be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0083">The assigned parameters may also include other types of parameters, which may be dependent on the system design. For example, in an OFDM-based system, the assigned parameters may indicate one or more specific subcarriers that can be used for transmissions to the UE. In a system that supports multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, the assigned parameters may indicate the number of data streams that can be sent to the UE, one or more pre-coding matrices that can be used for transmissions to the UE, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0084">The shared data channel may comprise transport and physical channels, e.g., the HS-DSCH and HS-PDSCH. Certain parameters (e.g., coding parameters) may be applicable for the transport channel portion of the shared data channel while other parameters (e.g., modulation and channelization code parameters) may be applicable for the physical channel portion of the shared data channel.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0085">In an aspect, one or more transmission formats may be defined and assigned to a UE. Each transmission format may be associated with one or more specific parameters to use for transmission. For example, a transmission format may be associated with a specific set of one or more channelization codes, a specific modulation scheme, a specific code rate or transport block size, etc. A Node B may send a transmission based on one of the transmission format(s) assigned to the UE. If the UE is assigned multiple transmission formats, then the Node B may use any one of the transmission formats for each transmission sent to the UE.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0086">In general, a parameter may be for anything pertinent for data transmission such as, e.g., block size, code rate, modulation scheme, HARQ parameter, etc. A transmission format may be associated with one or more specific parameters (e.g., a block size and a modulation scheme) and may be a convenient mechanism for conveying parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0087">Further, in general, assigned parameters may be used for any shared data channel in any wireless communication system. Assigned parameters may be used for HSDPA in order to avoid sending signaling on the HS-SCCH for new transmissions. A new subframe format or transmission mode for the HS-DSCH may be defined with one or more of the following characteristics:
<ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0006" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0006-0001" num="0088">1. Signaling is not sent on the HS-SCCH for a new transmission and only sent on retransmissions,</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0002" num="0089">2. One or more specific channelization codes are usable for transmissions to the UE,</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0003" num="0090">3. One or more specific modulation schemes are usable for transmissions,</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0004" num="0091">4. One or more specific transport block sizes are usable for transmissions,</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0005" num="0092">5. HARQ is set to asynchronous IR with a predetermined number of retransmissions, a reference to the previous transmission/retransmission with which the current retransmission is associated, and a predetermined sequence of redundancy versions based on the version of the retransmission (e.g., first retransmission, second retransmission, etc.), and</li>
        <li id="ul0006-0006" num="0093">6. A UE-specific CRC is used for each transport block send on the HS-PDSCH.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0094">Some of the parameters may be fixed while other parameters may be configurable. In an aspect, the channelization codes and transport block sizes are configurable parameters, and other parameters are fixed. For example, the modulation scheme may be fixed at QPSK, the number of retransmissions may be fixed at two, the sequence of redundancy versions may be fixed based on the retransmission version, etc. The fixed parameters are known a priori by the Node B and UE. The configurable parameters may be determined at the start of a call and may be changed during the call.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0095">One or more transmission formats may be defined for a UE. For example, a transmission format may be defined with the following:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0096">1. A specific channelization code for the HS-PDSCH;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0097">2. A specific modulation scheme (e.g., QPSK);</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0098">3. A specific transport block size;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0099">4. HARQ-type information set to asynchronous IR, with pointer information to previous transmissions/retransmissions, two retransmissions and a predetermined sequence of redundancy versions; and</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0100">5. A UE-specific CRC.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0101">Multiple transmission formats with different parameters may be defined for the UE. For example, two transmission formats may be defined for two different transport block sizes and the same channelization code, modulation scheme, etc. In general, a transmission format may be associated with any number of parameters and any type of parameter.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0102">The parameters that are conveyed via signaling on the HS-SCCH during retransmissions may thus be fixed or configured/assigned prior to transmission. In one design, all of the parameters conveyed via signaling on the HS-SCCH may be handled as shown in the last column of Table 2. In this design, many of the parameters are either fixed or configured/assigned so that signaling on the HS-SCCH is not needed for new transmissions. Further, in this design, a single channelization code and four transport block sizes are usable for transmissions to the UE. The four transport block sizes may be selected based on data requirements for a call. As an example, for a VoIP call, a transport block size of 353 bits may be used for a 12.2 Kbps AMR-NB speech frame or a 12.6 Kbps AMR-WB speech frame. A transport block size of 161 bits may be used for an AMR-NB or AMR-WB silence descriptor (SID) frame. Other transport block sizes and/or different numbers of transport block sizes may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0103">In an aspect, a UE may be assigned one or multiple channelization codes among the channelization codes available for the HS-PDSCH. In another aspect, a UE may be assigned a channelization code with spreading factor larger than 16. The UE may then de-spread a received transmission with a channelization code that is longer than the shortest channelization code for the shared data channel. The larger spreading factor reduces granularity in code space assignment and may improve channelization code utilization. For example, a UE with small data payload sizes (e.g., for VoIP or gaming) may be assigned a channelization code with spreading factor of 32 and may then occupy half of the code space. A transmission sent with this SF=32 channelization code may have a code rate that is two times higher than a comparable transmission sent with an SF=16 channelization code. HARQ can compensate for the higher code rate by sending retransmissions for transport blocks requiring lower code rates. In yet another aspect, a UE is assigned a time varying channelization code (which may vary over time in a predetermined manner) or different channelization codes in different time intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0104">The assigned parameters for a UE may be given by one or more transmission formats and/or in some other manner. The assigned parameters may be determined for the UE during call setup at the start of a call and may be based on requirements of the call. For example, the assigned transport block sizes may be selected based on data requirements, the assigned time intervals may be selected based on call type (e.g., VoIP or gaming), etc. The assigned parameters may also be modified during the call due to various reasons such as changes in data requirements, system loading, etc. Changes to the assigned parameters may be handled via reconfiguration mechanisms supported by the system. The assigned parameters may thus be static or semi-static and may be configurable for each UE. The assigned parameters may be sent to each UE via upper layer signaling or by some other means prior to transmissions on the shared data channel using the assigned parameters. For example, the assigned parameters may be sent at call setup using Layer 3 Radio Bearer Setup messages in W-CDMA or during reconfiguration using Radio Bearer Reconfiguration messages.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0105"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows data transmission on the HS-DSCH with assigned parameters. A UE periodically estimates its received signal quality and sends CQI on the HS-DPCCH. A Node B has data to send to the UE and schedules the UE for downlink transmission. The Node B processes a transport block based on the assigned parameters, e.g., an assigned transmission format. As this is a first (new) transmission, the Node B sends no signaling on the HS-SCCH and only sends the transmission of the transport block on the HS-PDSCH to the UE. The UE processes the HS-PDSCH based on the assigned parameters and recovers the transport block sent to the UE. The UE sends an ACK on the HS-DPCCH if the transport block is decoded correctly and sends nothing otherwise. The UE also estimates the received signal quality and sends CQI along with the ACK/nothing on the HS-DPCCH. The Node B may send a new transmission for another transport block if an ACK is received. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the UE does not send an ACK because it did not receive the transport block successfully (e.g., the UE either did not receive the transport block at all or the transport block was not correctly received). In an aspect, the Node B will send a retransmission if no ACK is received from the UE within a predetermined period of time. For example, the Node B will schedule a retransmission if the UE does not send back an ACK. Thus, the Node B sends new transmissions without any signaling on the HS-SCCH but will send retransmissions with signaling on the HS-SCCH as described in Table 2.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows data transmission to multiple UEs with assigned parameters. A Node B sends transmissions to UEs with assigned parameters (which are shown with solid shading) as well as transmissions to UEs without assigned parameters (which are shown with diagonal hashing) on the HS-PDSCH. The Node B sends signaling on the HS-SCCH only to the UEs without assigned parameters or for retransmissions to UEs with assigned parameters, which are shown with diagonal hashing. The Node B does not send signaling to the UEs with assigned parameters. As <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 7</figref> indicate, radio resources may be saved by not sending signaling to the UEs with assigned parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a block diagram of a design of TX data processor <b>210</b> and modulator <b>220</b> at Node B <b>110</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. For clarity, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows processing units to generate a transmission on the HS-PDSCH for one UE.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0108">Within TX data processor <b>210</b>, a CRC generator <b>810</b> generates a CRC for a transport block. A scrambler <b>812</b> may scramble the transport block, the CRC, or both the transport block and CRC based on a UE identifier (UE ID) for the recipient UE. This UE ID may be a MAC ID or some other type of ID that can uniquely identify the recipient UE. A UE-specific CRC may be generated in various manners that make this CRC specific for the recipient UE. For example, a CRC may be generated in the normal manner, and the CRC may then be made specific to the UE. This may be achieved by performing an exclusive OR (XOR) operation between the computed CRC and the UE ID. In general, UE-specific scrambling may be performed on all or any portion of a transmission and also anywhere along the transmit processing path.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0109">An encoder <b>814</b> encodes the scrambled block based on a coding scheme and provides a coded block having a selected transport block size. Controller <b>240</b> may select the transport block size based on the CQI received from the UE, the transport block sizes assigned to the UE, etc. An HARQ unit <b>816</b> partitions the coded block into multiple redundancy versions. For each transmission, HARQ unit <b>816</b> determines which redundancy version to send based on an HARQ control from controller <b>240</b> and provides the selected redundancy version. A channel interleaver <b>818</b> interleaves (or reorders) the code bits in the selected redundancy version. A symbol mapper <b>820</b> maps the interleaved bits to data symbols based on a modulation scheme selected for the UE. This modulation scheme may be fixed (e.g., to QPSK) when using assigned parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0110">Within modulator <b>220</b>, a spreader <b>822</b> spreads the data symbols based on a channelization code assigned to the UE and provides data chips. The data chips are further processed and transmitted to the UE. Controller/processor <b>240</b> may receive feedback (e.g., ACK/nothing, CQI, etc.) from the UE and may provide various parameters (e.g., the UE ID, transport block size, HARQ pointer&#x2014;the pointer to a previous transmission/retransmission if the current transport block is a retransmission, modulation scheme, channelization code, etc.) for each transmission sent to the UE.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a block diagram of a design of demodulator <b>260</b> and RX data processor <b>270</b> at UE <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Within demodulator <b>260</b>, a despreader <b>910</b> despreads the received samples for a received transmission based on a channelization code assigned to the UE and provides despread symbols to a symbol buffer <b>912</b> and an HARQ combiner <b>914</b>. Buffer <b>912</b> stores the despread symbols for possible combining with future transmissions. HARQ combiner <b>914</b> may (a) pass the despread symbols for the current transmission from despreader <b>910</b> without combining or (b) combine the despread symbols for the current transmission with despread symbols for one or more prior transmissions based on an HARQ control from controller <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0112">Within RX data processor <b>270</b>, a symbol demapper <b>920</b> demaps the despread symbols from HARQ combiner <b>914</b> based on the selected modulation scheme. For example, symbol demapper <b>920</b> may provide log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for code bits of the despread symbols. A channel de-interleaver <b>922</b> performs de-interleaving in a manner complementary to the interleaving performed by channel interleaver <b>818</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. A decoder <b>924</b> decodes the output of de-interleaver <b>922</b> based on a transport block size and provides a decoded transport block.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0113">If the Node B scrambles the CRC for the transport block, then a CRC generator <b>926</b> generates a CRC for the decoded transport block, and a descrambler <b>928</b> descrambles a received CRC, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. If the Node B scrambles the transport block, then descrambler <b>928</b> descrambles the decoded transport block, and CRC generator <b>926</b> generates a CRC for the descrambled transport block (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). In either case, a detector <b>930</b> compares the locally-generated CRC against the received or descrambled CRC and determines whether the transport block is decoded correctly or incorrectly based on the comparison result. In general, the UE-specific descrambling at the UE is performed in a manner complementary to the UE-specific scrambling at the Node B. Controller/processor <b>280</b> may provide various parameters (e.g., the channelization code, HARQ pointer&#x2014;the pointer to a previous transmission/retransmission if the current transport block is a retransmission, modulation scheme, transport block size, UE ID, etc.) for each transmission processed by the UE.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0114">The UE may perform blind decoding for a received transmission based on the assigned parameters. The UE may process the received transmission for each possible hypothesis until the transport block is decoded correctly or all hypotheses have been evaluated. The number of hypotheses is dependent on the unknown factors at the UE. For example, if four transport block sizes can be used for a transmission, then the UE may decode the received transmission for each of the four transport block sizes. If up to two retransmissions can be sent for a transport block and the UE has HARQ pointer information so as to determine the redundancy version, then the UE may process the received transmission for two hypotheses corresponding to the received transmission being a second transmission (i.e., first retransmission), and a third transmission (i.e., second retransmission). In this example, the UE may perform blind decoding for up to four hypotheses covering four possible transport block sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0115">The UE may evaluate the hypotheses in a sequential order that may be selected based on the likelihood of occurrence for each hypothesis. For example, the UE may perform decoding for the transport block size that is most likely, then decoding for the next most likely transport block size, etc. For example, if the UE is assigned four transport block sizes and the larger transport block size is used more often than the smaller transport block size, then the UE may perform decoding for the larger transport block size first before performing decoding for the smaller transport block size.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a process <b>1000</b> performed by a Node B for data transmission without HS-SCCH signaling in a first transmission of a transport block. The Node B assigns at least one parameter to a UE (block <b>1012</b>). The at least one parameter may comprise at least one of a channelization code, a block size, a modulation scheme, a transmission format, a retransmission parameter, etc. For example, the at least one parameter may comprise multiple transmission formats (e.g., multiple transport block sizes) usable for transmissions to the UE. The at least one parameter may be assigned during call setup at the start of a call to set up radio bearers for the UE, during reconfiguration to change radio bearers for the UE, etc. The Node B sends the at least one assigned parameter to the UE (block <b>1014</b>). The Node B thereafter processes a transmission for the UE based on the at least one assigned parameter (block <b>1016</b>). The Node B may scramble all or a portion of the transmission with an identifier for the UE. The Node B sends the transmission on a data channel shared by a plurality of UEs for processing by the UE based on the at least one assigned parameter (block <b>1018</b>). The Node B will send the transmission without HS-SCCH signaling if this is a first transmission, and with HS-SCCH signaling if this is a retransmission. Thus, the Node B may disable transmission of downlink control information/signaling corresponding to the transmission of new transport blocks on the shared data channel.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a process <b>1100</b> performed by a UE for data reception without HS-SCCH signaling on the transmission of new transport blocks. The UE receives at least one parameter assigned to the UE, e.g., during call setup, reconfiguration, etc. (block <b>1112</b>). The at least one parameter may comprise any of the parameters listed above. The UE thereafter receives a transmission on a data channel shared by a plurality of UEs (block <b>1114</b>). The UE processes the received transmission based on the at least one parameter assigned to the UE prior to receiving the transmission (block <b>1116</b>). The received transmission may comprise one or more packets of data (or transport blocks).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0118">The processing by the UE in block <b>1116</b> may include processing/decoding the received transmission based on different transmission formats (e.g., different transport block sizes) usable for the received transmission. The UE may select one transmission format at a time, process the received transmission based on the selected transmission format, terminate the processing of the received transmission if it is decoded correctly, and repeat the processing for another transmission format if it is not decoded correctly.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0119">If HARQ is used, then the UE may determine whether the received transmission is a new transmission or a retransmission because of the received HS-SCCH, e.g., based on decoding result for a prior transmission, and a prior transmission, the number of retransmissions allowed, etc. The UE may first process the received transmission as a new transmission to obtain a decoded packet and, if the decoded packet is in error, process the received transmission as a retransmission. Alternatively, the UE may first process the received transmission as a retransmission to obtain a decoded packet and, if the decoded packet is in error, process the received transmission as a new transmission. In both cases, the UE may process the received transmission for different hypotheses corresponding to different numbers of transmission sent prior to the received transmission, different transport block sizes, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0120">The processing in block <b>1116</b> may also include determining if the UE is an intended recipient of the received transmission. This determination may be achieved by checking the received transmission with an identifier for the UE, e.g., generating a CRC for the received transmission, descrambling a received CRC with the UE identifier, and comparing the descrambled CRC and the locally-generated CRC. This determination may also be achieved by descrambling the received transmission with the UE identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a block diagram of a controller <b>1200</b> that is usable to implement the techniques described herein on a Node B. The controller <b>1200</b> includes an integrated circuit <b>1202</b> for transmitting a control packet having information related to a previously transmitted data packet, the information not having been transmitted when the previously transmitted packet was transmitted; and an integrated circuit <b>1204</b> for transmitting a second data packet, wherein the previously transmitted data packet and the second packet are derived from common data.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a block diagram of a controller <b>1300</b> that is usable to implement the techniques described herein on a UE. The controller <b>1300</b> includes an integrated circuit <b>1302</b> for receiving a control packet, the control packet includes information related to a previously transmitted data packet; an integrated circuit <b>1304</b> for receiving a retransmission data packet, wherein the previously transmitted data packet and the retransmission data packet are derived from common data; and an integrated circuit <b>1306</b> for obtaining the common data based on the information related to the previously transmitted data packet, wherein the previously transmitted data packet and the retransmission data packet are associated with a sequence of data packets, the sequence of data packets including a first data packet. The first data packet does not have a control packet associated therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0123">The UE may receive additional transmissions on the shared data channel and may process each additional received transmission in similar manner based on the at least one parameter assigned to the UE. The UE may discontinuously receive transmissions on the shared data channel, referred to as the Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) or Reception (DRX). The discussion herein will refer to DRX, but the discussion applies reciprocally to DTX as well.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0124">The DRX operation has a shortcoming of reducing the maximum data rate that can be offered to a given user, as well as reducing the overall downlink capacity for delay sensitive services. The maximum data rate is reduced because the Node B can now only transmit sporadically to a given UE. For example, if the UE is sleeping 3 time intervals out of 4, then the maximum sustained data rate that can be served to the UE is &#xbc; of what it was when DRX was not used. This may be acceptable when little data is being transmitted (for example, when a user is reading a web page), but will become limiting when the user clicks on a link and requests the download of a new web page. Another drawback of DRX is that it decreases the overall downlink capacity for delay sensitive applications.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0125">In an aspect, the DRX and DTX modes on the UE is toggled through the transmission of a control sequence in the HS-SCCH signal, the HS-SCCH signaling having the form of Table 3, where an escape sequence of bits signals to the UE that a command for the toggling is being issued. Referring to Table 3, below, in one implementation the escape sequence is set to a predefined sequence of &#x201c;11100000,&#x201d; which is the eight bits of the channelization code set and the modulation scheme; the transport-block size information is also set to a predefined sequence of &#x201c;111101;&#x201d; the order type is set to the predefined sequences of &#x201c;000&#x201d; for signaling to the UE that a DRX/DTX mode control signal is being issued; and two bits are used to toggle the DRX/DTX modes, respectively. The DRX/DTX Toggling is set to &#x201c;0&#x201d; if the mode is to be turned off, or &#x201c;1&#x201d; if the mode is to be turned on.</p>
