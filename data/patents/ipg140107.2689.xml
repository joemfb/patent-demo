<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is directed in part to a lubricating oil composition containing an oil of lubricating viscosity, a N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetraalkyl-naphthalene-1,8-diamine and a lubricating oil additive. Particularly effective is a combination of a N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetraalkyl-naphthalene-1,8-diamine and a second antioxidant such as diarylamine which together provide superior oxidation inhibition.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Diarylamine antioxidants are known and have been widely used to improve the thermal-oxidative stability and/or light induced degradation in numerous products used in engineering; for example, they can improve the performance properties in lubricants, hydraulic fluids, metal working fluids, fuels or polymers, just to name a few.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Commonly, these diarylamines have been alkylated, see for example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,943,112 which discloses an improved process for alkylating diphenylamine and U.S. Pat. No. 3,655,559 which discloses alkylated diphenylamines as stabilizers. Alkaryl substituted diphenylamines and phenylnapthylamines (such as &#x3b1;-methylstyryl-diphenylamine) are disclosed for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,533,992; 3,452,056 and 3,660,290.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Synergist and antagonist combinations of antioxidants have been disclosed. Effective synergistic mixtures of antioxidants are typically compounds that intercept oxidation by two different mechanisms. For example, those in which one compounds functions as decomposer of peroxides and the other compound functions as an inhibitor of free radicals. Well known heterosynergism has been disclosed between sulfur and phosphorous containing compounds (such as sulfides, dithiocarbamates, phosphites and dithiophosphates) and aminic or phenolic antioxidants. U.S. Pat. No. 2,718,501 discloses a synergistic mixture of a sulfur-containing compound, such as a wax sulfide or dioctadecyl disulfide, and an aromatic amine compound having at least 2 aromatic rings, such as phenyl alpha-naphthyl amine, for use in preventing oxidation in lubricating oils. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,958,663 discloses an extreme pressure lubricant composition containing from 0.01 to 5 percent each of sulfurized oleic acid, C<sub>18</sub>-C<sub>22 </sub>alkenyl succinic acid, chlorinated paraffin wax containing from 20 to 60 percent chlorine, diphenylamine and N,N-salicylal-1,2-propylenediamine. U.S. Pat. No. 3,345,292 discloses stabilized alkyl substituted diaryl sulfides for use as functional fluids where the stabilizer can be diaryl amine or alkylated phenol. U.S. Pat. No. 4,032,462 discloses lubricants having improved antioxidancy having an oil soluble antimony compound and an oil soluble antioxidant selected from sterically hindered phenols and thiophenols, and aromatic amines, and mixtures of these antioxidants. U.S. Pat. No. 4,089,792 discloses lubricants having a an antioxidant mixture of a primary amine and an antioxidant selected from aromatic or alkyl sulfides and polysulfides, sulfurized olefins, sulfurized carboxylic acid esters and sulfurized ester-olefins. U.S. Pat. No. 4,102,796 discloses lubricants having an antioxidant mixture of aromatic and alkyl sulfides and polysulfides, sulfurized olefins, sulfurized carboxylic acid esters and sulfurized ester-olefins and a secondary aliphatic amine. U.S. Pat. No. 6,306,802 discloses of an antioxidant mixture containing a combination of an oil soluble molybdenum compound and an aromatic amine.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Commonly, antioxidant compounds which were intended to decompose hydroperoxides or peroxides (including sulfurized olefins, metal dithiocarbamates, dithiophospates, phosphites, thioesters, etc.) are increasingly difficult to incorporate into the finished lubricant due to the undesirable amounts of sulfur, phosphorous and ash content they add to the lubricating oil composition. It is known that sulfur, phosphorous and ash content may negatively impact pollution control devices (such as poisoning catalysts, etc.) which are finding increasing application. Thus, there is a need for new antioxidants and antioxidant systems which do not negatively impact pollution control equipment yet provide improved antioxidancy performance to handle the typical higher operating temperatures and longer service life desired. Synergistic antioxidant systems are particularly important since they reduce the overall additive impact. For example, some antioxidants such as diphenylamines cannot be used at relatively high concentrations since this may result in sedimentation or deposits in hot engine areas such as the diesel ring areas in diesel engines. Thus, one aspect of the invention is directed to an improved antioxidant system comprising a free radical antioxidant and an effective peroxide decomposer selected from an tetraalkyl-naphthalene-1,8-diamine.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present is directed in part to a lubricating oil composition which provides improved oxidation stability.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0018">Inhibition of free radical-mediated oxidation is one of the most important reactions in organic substrates and is commonly used in rubbers, polymers and lubrication oils; namely, since these chemical products may undergo oxidative damage by the autoxidation process. Hydrocarbon oxidation is a three step process which comprises: initiation, propagation and termination. Oxidative degradation and the reaction mechanisms are dependent upon the specific hydrocarbons, temperatures, operating conditions, catalysts such as metals, etc., which more detail can be found in Chapter 4 of Mortier R. M. et al., 1992, &#x201c;Chemistry and Technology of Lubricants Initiation&#x201d;, VCH Publishers, Inc.; incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Initiation involves the reaction of oxygen or nitrogen oxides (NO<sub>x </sub>) on a hydrocarbon molecule. Typically, initiation starts by the abstraction of hydrocarbon proton. This may result in the formation of hydrogen peroxide (HOOH) and radicals such as alkyl radicals (R.) and peroxy radicals (ROO.). During the propagation stage, hydroperoxides may decompose, either on their own or in the presence of catalysts such as metal ions, to alkoxy radicals (RO.) and peroxy radicals. These radicals can react with the hydrocarbons to form a variety of additional radicals and reactive oxygen containing compounds such as alcohols, aldehydes, ketones and carboxylic acids; which again can further polymerize or continue chain propagation. Termination results from the self termination of radicals or by reacting with oxidation inhibitors.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0019">The uncatalyzed oxidation of hydrocarbons at temperatures of up to about 120&#xb0; C. primarily leads to alkyl-hydroperoxides, dialkylperoxides, alcohols, ketones; as well as the products which result from cleavage of dihydroperoxides such as diketones, keto-aldehydes hydroxyketones and so forth. At higher temperatures (above 120&#xb0; C.) the reaction rates are increased and cleavage of the hydroperoxides plays a more important role. Additionally, at the higher temperatures, the viscosity of the bulk medium increases as a result of the polycondensation of the difunctional oxygenated products formed in the primary oxidation phase. Further polycondensation and polymerization reaction of these high molecular weight intermediates results in products which are no longer soluble in the hydrocarbon and form varnish like deposits and sludge.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0020">Since autoxidation is a free-radical chain reaction, it therefore, can be inhibited at the initiation and/or propagation steps. Typical oxidation inhibition by diarylamines, such as dialkyldiphenylamine and N-phenyl-&#x3b1;-napthylamine, also involves radical scavenging. The transfer of hydrogen from the NH group of the amine to the peroxide radicals results in the formation of a diarylamino radical which is resonance stabilized, thus prevents new chains from forming. A secondary peroxy radical or hydroperoxide can react with the diarylamino radical to form the nitroxy radical, which is also a very potent inhibitor. Hydroperoxide decomposers convert the hydroperoxides into non-radical products and thus prevent the chain propagation reaction. Traditionally organosulfur and organophosphorous containing additives have been employed for this purpose typically eliminating hydroperoxides via acid catalyzed decomposition or oxygen transfer. However as mentioned previously, increased concerns regarding total sulfur and/or phosphorous content in finished lubricating oil has led to efforts to find new hydroperoxide decomposers perhaps those that even react by a different mechanism. Also, increased demands have been placed on many functional fluids which have in-turn placed emphasis on new inhibitors.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0021">The present invention is directed in part to a lubricating oil composition having an suitable oil of lubricating viscosity and a first component a) is a N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetraalkyl-naphthalene-1,8-diamine compound which can serve as a particularly useful as a stabilizer and thus is typically employed with at least on other additive. Particularly applicable is component a) in combination with another antioxidant and moreover with component b) a secondary aryl amine, the combination has improved oxidation stability. Synergism has been suggested for combinations of different types of antioxidants also called heterosynergism due to the different mechanism of stabilizer, for example a combination of radical scavengers and peroxide decomposers. Additionally, it has been suggested even within the same class, compounds which act by a different reaction mechanism/rate may lead to synergistic results, for example combinations of hindered phenolics and alkylated diphenylamines has been studied. Heretofore, antioxidancy in lubricating oil had not be demonstrated for N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetraalkyl-naphthalene-1,8-diamine nor has synergism been demonstrated for a mixture of a) N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetraalkyl-naphthalene-1,8-diamine and b) a secondary aryl amine.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0024">wherein: R<sub>1 </sub>and R<sub>2 </sub>and R<sub>3 </sub>and R<sub>4 </sub>are each independently selected from the group consisting of alkyl from 1 to 20 carbon atoms, more preferably alkyl from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and even more preferably lower alkyl from 1 to six carbon atoms. The alkyl groups above, can have either a straight chain or a branched chain, which are fully saturated hydrocarbon chain; for example, methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, nonadecyl, and the like, and isomers and mixtures thereof An example of a suitable hindered amine that may be used in the present invention is N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetramethyl-naphthalene-1,8-diamine and sold by Sigma-Aldrich as Proton-sponge&#x2122;. The N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetramethyl-naphthalene-1,8-diamine is a strained molecule due to the close proximity to the dimethylamine groups. The free base is destabilized by the steric inhibition of resonance, van der Walls repulsions, and lone pair interactions. These strains are typically relieved by monoprotonation and formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond and thus can effectively alter the equilibrium constant of the hydroperoxide decomposition reaction. This imparts a high basicity relative to normal aliphatic amines or aromatic amines and which is necessary to deprotonate a hydroperoxide. Deprotonation of the peroxide would render the oxygen-oxygen bond more stable toward decomposition into radicals. The strong basicity of the N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetramethyl-naphthalene-1,8-diamine can be ascribed to the operation of several factors, e.g. the steric inhibition of conjugation in the free base, relief of nonbonded repulsions, including a little lone pair/lone pair repulsion, stabilization of the cation by the hydrogen bonding, etc. Clearly the N,N,N&#x2032;,N&#x2032;-tetramethyl-naphthalene-1,8-diamine structure is compromise involving several factors including a twist in the naphthalene ring system, favorable lone pair/&#x3c0; overlap, lone pair/methyl nonbonded interactions, and lone pair/lone pair repulsion.</p>

When used in combination with other types of antioxidants or additives used in oil formulations, synergistic and/or additive performance effects may also be obtained with respect to improved antioxidancy, antiwear, frictional and detergency and high temperature engine deposit properties. Such other additives can be any presently known or later-discovered additives used in formulating lubricating oil compositions. The lubricating oil additives typically found in lubricating oils are, for example, dispersants, detergents, corrosion/rust inhibitors, antioxidants, anti-wear agents, anti-foamants, friction modifiers, seal swell agents, emulsifiers, VI improvers, pour point depressants, and the like. Particularly preferred to a demonstrated synergy is the compounds of component a) with an additional antioxidant such as a free radical inhibitor antioxidant, even more preferably selected from diarylamines or hindered phenolic types and combinations thereof.</p>

Preferably the dispersant is a polyisobutenyl succinimide. The oxymolybdenum or sulfurized oxymolybdenum containing compositions may be generally characterized as a sulfur/molybdenum complex of a basic nitrogen dispersant compound preferably with a sulfur to molybdenum weight ratio of about (0.01 to 1.0) to 1 and more preferably from about (0.05 to 0.5) to 1 and a nitrogen to molybdenum weight ratio of about (1 to 10) to 1 and more preferably from (2 to 5) to 1. The precise molecular formula of these oxymolybdenum compositions are not known with certainty. However, they are believed to be compounds in which molybdenum, whose valences are satisfied with atoms of oxygen or sulfur, is either complexed by, or the salt of one or more nitrogen atoms of the basic nitrogen atoms of the basic nitrogen containing compound used in the preparation of these compositions. In one aspect, the oxymolybdenum complex is prepared at a reaction temperature at or below 120 degrees centigrade and if optionally sulfurized, it is also reacted at or below 120 degrees centigrade. Such a process yields a lighter color product when compared to higher temperature reaction conditions at equivalent pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0077">The molybdenum compounds used to prepare the oxymolybdenum and oxymolybdenum/sulfur complexes employed in this invention are acidic molybdenum compounds. By acidic is meant that the molybdenum compounds will react with a basic nitrogen compound as measured by ASTM test D-664 or D-2896 titration procedure. Typically these molybdenum compounds are hexavalent and are represented by the following compositions: molybdic acid, ammonium molybdate, sodium molybdate, potassium molybdate and other alkaline metal molybdates and other molybdenum salts such as hydrogen salts, e.g., hydrogen sodium molybdate, MoOCl<sub>4</sub>, MoO<sub>2</sub>Br<sub>2</sub>, Mo<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, molybdenum trioxide, bis(acetylacetonato)-dioxomolybdenum (VI) or similar acidic molybdenum compounds. Preferred acidic molybdenum compounds are molybdic acid, ammonium molybdate, and alkali metal molybdates. Particularly preferred are molybdic acid and ammonium molybdate.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0078">The basic nitrogen compound used to prepare the oxymolybdenum complexes have at least one basic nitrogen and are preferably oil-soluble. Typical examples of such compositions are succinimides, carboxylic acid amides, hydrocarbyl monoamines, hydrocarbon polyamines, Mannich bases, phosphoramides, thiophosphoramides, phosphonamides, dispersant viscosity index improvers, and mixtures thereof. Any of the nitrogen-containing compositions may be after-treated with, e.g., boron, using procedures well known in the art so long as the compositions continue to contain basic nitrogen. These after-treatments are particularly applicable to succinimides and Mannich base compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0079">The mono and polysuccinimides that can be used to prepare the molybdenum complexes described herein are disclosed in numerous references and are well known in the art. Certain fundamental types of succinimides and the related materials encompassed by the term of art &#x201c;succinimide&#x201d; are taught in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,219,666; 3,172,892; and 3,272,746, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The term &#x201c;succinimide&#x201d; is understood in the art to include many of the amide, imide, and amidine species which may also be formed. The predominant product however is a succinimide and this term has been generally accepted as meaning the product of a reaction of an alkenyl substituted succinic acid or anhydride with a nitrogen-containing compound. Preferred succinimides, because of their commercial availability, are those succinimides prepared from a hydrocarbyl succinic anhydride, wherein the hydrocarbyl group contains from about 24 to about 350 carbon atoms, and an ethylene amine, said ethylene amines being especially characterized by ethylene diamine, diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, and tetraethylene pentamine. Particularly preferred are those succinimides prepared from polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride of 70 to 128 carbon atoms and tetraethylene pentamine or triethylene tetramine or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0080">Also included within the term &#x201c;succinimide&#x201d; are the cooligomers of a hydrocarbyl succinic acid or anhydride and a poly secondary amine containing at least one tertiary amino nitrogen in addition to two or more secondary amino groups. Ordinarily this composition has between 1,500 and 50,000 average molecular weight. A typical compound would be that prepared by reacting polyisobutenyl succinic anhydride and ethylene dipiperazine.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0081">Carboxylic acid amide compositions are also suitable starting materials for preparing the oxymolybdenum complexes employed in this invention. Typical of such compounds are those disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,405,064, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. These compositions are ordinarily prepared by reacting a carboxylic acid or anhydride or ester thereof, having at least 12 to about 350 aliphatic carbon atoms in the principal aliphatic chain and, if desired, having sufficient pendant aliphatic groups to render the molecule oil soluble with an amine or a hydrocarbyl polyamine, such as an ethylene amine, to give a mono or polycarboxylic acid amide. Preferred are those amides prepared from (1) a carboxylic acid of the formula R&#x2032;COOH, where R&#x2032; is C<sub>12-20 </sub>alkyl or a mixture of this acid with a polyisobutenyl carboxylic acid in which the polyisobutenyl group contains from 72 to 128 carbon atoms and (2) an ethylene amine, especially triethylene tetramine or tetraethylene pentamine or mixtures thereof</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0082">Another class of compounds which are useful in this invention are hydrocarbyl monoamines and hydrocarbyl polyamines, preferably of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,574,576, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference. The hydrocarbyl group, which is preferably alkyl, or olefinic having one or two sites of unsaturation, usually contains from 9 to 350, preferably from 20 to 200 carbon atoms. Particularly preferred hydrocarbyl polyamines are those which are derived, e.g., by reacting polyisobutenyl chloride and a polyalkylene polyamine, such as an ethylene amine, e.g., ethylene diamine, diethylene triamine, tetraethylene pentamine, 2-aminoethylpiperazine, 1,3-propylene diamine, 1,2-propylenediamine, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0083">Another class of compounds useful for supplying basic nitrogen are the Mannich base compositions. These compositions are prepared from a phenol or C<sub>9-200 </sub>alkylphenol, an aldehyde, such as formaldehyde or formaldehyde precursor such as paraformaldehyde, and an amine compound. The amine may be a mono or polyamine and typical compositions are prepared from an alkylamine, such as methylamine or an ethylene amine, such as, diethylene triamine, or tetraethylene pentamine, and the like. The phenolic material may be sulfurized and preferably is dodecylphenol or a C<sub>80-100 </sub>alkylphenol. Typical Mannich bases which can be used in this invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,157,309 and 3,649,229; 3,368,972; and 3,539,663, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. The last referenced patent discloses Mannich bases prepared by reacting an alkylphenol having at least 50 carbon atoms, preferably 50 to 200 carbon atoms with formaldehyde and an alkylene polyamine HN(ANH)<sub>n</sub>H where A is a saturated divalent alkyl hydrocarbon of 2 to 6 carbon atoms and n is 1-10 and where the condensation product of said alkylene polyamine may be further reacted with urea or thiourea. The utility of these Mannich bases as starting materials for preparing lubricating oil additives can often be significantly improved by treating the Mannich base using conventional techniques to introduce boron into the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0084">Another class of composition useful for preparing the oxymolybdenum complexes employed in this invention are the phosphoramides and phosphonamides such as those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,909,430 and 3,968,157, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. These compositions may be prepared by forming a phosphorus compound having at least one P-N bond. They can be prepared, for example, by reacting phosphorus oxychloride with a hydrocarbyl diol in the presence of a monoamine or by reacting phosphorus oxychloride with a difunctional secondary amine and a mono-functional amine. Thiophosphoramides can be prepared by reacting an unsaturated hydrocarbon compound containing from 2 to 450 or more carbon atoms, such as polyethylene, polyisobutylene, polypropylene, ethylene, 1-hexene, 1,3-hexadiene, isobutylene, 4-methyl-1-pentene, and the like, with phosphorus pentasulfide and a nitrogen-containing compound as defined above, particularly an alkylamine, alkyldiamine, alkylpolyamine, or an alkyleneamine, such as ethylene diamine, diethylenetriamine, triethylenetetramine, tetraethylenepentamine, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0085">Another class of nitrogen-containing compositions useful in preparing the molybdenum complexes employed in this invention includes the so-called dispersant viscosity index improvers (VI improvers). These VI improvers are commonly prepared by functionalizing a hydrocarbon polymer, especially a polymer derived from ethylene and/or propylene, optionally containing additional units derived from one or more co-monomers such as alicyclic or aliphatic olefins or diolefins. The functionalization may be carried out by a variety of processes which introduce a reactive site or sites which usually has at least one oxygen atom on the polymer. The polymer is then contacted with a nitrogen-containing source to introduce nitrogen-containing functional groups on the polymer backbone. Commonly used nitrogen sources include any basic nitrogen compound especially those nitrogen-containing compounds and compositions described herein. Preferred nitrogen sources are alkylene amines, such as ethylene amines, alkyl amines, and Mannich bases.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0086">Preferred basic nitrogen compounds for use in this invention are succinimides, carboxylic acid amides, and Mannich bases. More preferred are succinimides having an average molecular weight of 1000 or 1300 or 2300 and mixtures thereof. Such succinimides can be post treated with boron or ethylene carbonate as known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0087">The oxymolybdenum complexes of this invention can also be sulfurized. Representative sulfur sources for preparing the oxymolybdenum/sulfur complexes used in this invention are sulfur, hydrogen sulfide, sulfur monochloride, sulfur dichloride, phosphorus pentasulfide, R&#x2033;<sub>2</sub>S<sub>x </sub>where R&#x2033; is hydrocarbyl, preferably C<sub>1-40 </sub>alkyl, and x is at least 2, inorganic sulfides and polysulfides such as (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>S<sub>y</sub>, where y is at least 1, thioacetamide, thiourea, and mercaptans of the formula R&#x2033;SH where R&#x2033; is as defined above. Also useful as sulfurizing agents are traditional sulfur-containing antioxidants such as wax sulfides and polysulfides, sulfurized olefins, sulfurized carboxylic and esters and sulfurized ester-olefins, and sulfurized alkylphenols and the metal salts thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0088">The sulfurized fatty acid esters are prepared by reacting sulfur, sulfur monochloride, and/or sulfur dichloride with an unsaturated fatty ester under elevated temperatures. Typical esters include C<sub>1</sub>-C<sub>20 </sub>alkyl esters of C<sub>8</sub>-C<sub>24 </sub>unsaturated fatty acids, such as palmitoleic, oleic, ricinoleic, petroselinic, vaccenic, linoleic, linolenic, oleostearic, licanic, paranaric, tariric, gadoleic, arachidonic, cetoleic, etc. Particularly good results have been obtained with mixed unsaturated fatty acid esters, such as are obtained from animal fats and vegetable oils, such as tall oil, linseed oil, olive oil, caster oil, peanut oil, rape oil, fish oil, sperm oil, and so forth. Exemplary fatty esters include lauryl tallate, methyl oleate, ethyl oleate, lauryl oleate, cetyl oleate, cetyl linoleate, lauryl ricinoleate, oleyl linoleate, oleyl stearate, and alkyl glycerides.</p>

<p id="p-0090" num="0090">Sulfurized olefins are prepared by the reaction of the C<sub>3</sub>-C<sub>6 </sub>olefin or a low-molecular-weight polyolefin derived therefrom with a sulfur-containing compound such as sulfur, sulfur monochloride, and/or sulfur dichloride.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0091">Also useful are the aromatic and alkyl sulfides, such as dibenzyl sulfide, dixylyl sulfide, dicetyl sulfide, diparaffin wax sulfide and polysulfide, cracked wax-olefin sulfides and so forth. They can be prepared by treating the starting material, e.g., olefinically unsaturated compounds, with sulfur, sulfur monochloride, and sulfur dichloride. Particularly preferred are the paraffin wax thiomers described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,346,156.</p>

Most preferred sulfur sources are sulfur, hydrogen sulfide, phosphorus pentasulfide, and inorganic sulfides and polysulfides.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0094">The polar promoter used in the preparation of the molybdenum complexes employed in this invention is one which facilitates the interaction between the acidic molybdenum compound and the basic nitrogen compound. A wide variety of such promoters are well known to those skilled in the art. Typical promoters are 1,3-propanediol, 1,4-butane-diol, diethylene glycol, butyl cellosolve, propylene glycol, 1,4-butyleneglycol, methyl carbitol, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, N-methyl-diethanol-amine, dimethyl formamide, N-methyl acetamide, dimethyl acetamide, methanol, ethylene glycol, dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethyl phosphoramide, tetrahydrofuran and water. Preferred are water and ethylene glycol. Particularly preferred is water. While ordinarily the polar promoter is separately added to the reaction mixture, it may also be present, particularly in the case of water, as a component of non-anhydrous starting materials or as waters of hydration in the acidic molybdenum compound, such as (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>6</sub>Mo<sub>7</sub>O<sub>24</sub>.H<sub>2</sub>O. Water may also be added as ammonium hydroxide.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0095">A method for preparing the oxymolybdenum complexes used in this invention is to prepare a solution of the acidic molybdenum precursor and a polar promoter with a basic nitrogen-containing compound with or without diluent. The diluent is used, if necessary, to provide a suitable viscosity for easy stirring. Typical diluents are lubricating oil and liquid compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen. If desired, ammonium hydroxide may also be added to the reaction mixture to provide a solution of ammonium molybdate. This reaction is carried out at a variety of temperatures, typically at or below the melting point of the mixture to reflux temperature. It is ordinarily carried out at atmospheric pressure although higher or lower pressures may be used if desired. This reaction mixture may optionally be treated with a sulfur source as defined above at a suitable pressure and temperature for the sulfur source to react with the acidic molybdenum and basic nitrogen compounds. In some cases, removal of water from the reaction mixture may be desirable prior to completion of reaction with the sulfur source. In a preferred and improved method for preparing the oxymolybdenum complexes, the reactor is agitated and heated at a temperature less than or equal to about 120 degrees Celsius, preferably from about 70 degrees Celsius to about 90 degrees Celsius. Molybdic oxide or other suitable molybdenum source is then charged to the reactor and the temperature is maintained at a temperature less than or equal to about 120 degrees Celsius, preferably at about 70 degrees Celsius to about 90 degrees Celsius, until the molybdenum is sufficiently reacted. Excess water is removed from the reaction mixture. Removal methods include but are not limited to vacuum distillation or nitrogen stripping while maintaining the temperature of the reactor at a temperature less than or equal to about 120 degrees Celsius, preferably between about 70 degrees Celsius to about 90 degrees Celsius. The temperature during the stripping process is held at a temperature less than or equal to about 120 degrees Celsius to maintain the low color intensity of the molybdenum-containing composition. It is ordinarily carried out at atmospheric pressure although higher or lower pressures may be used. The stripping step is typically carried out for a period of about 0.5 to about 5 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0096">If desired, this product can be sulfurized by treating this reaction mixture with a sulfur source as defined above at a suitable pressure and temperature, not to exceed about 120 degrees Celsius for the sulfur source to react with the acidic molybdenum and basic nitrogen compounds. The sulfurization step is typically carried out for a period of from about 0.5 to about 5 hours and preferably from about 0.5 to about 2 hours. In some cases, removal of the polar promoter (water) from the reaction mixture may be desirable prior to completion of reaction with the sulfur source.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0097">In the reaction mixture, the ratio of molybdenum compound to basic nitrogen compound is not critical; however, as the amount of molybdenum with respect to basic nitrogen increases, the filtration of the product becomes more difficult. Since the molybdenum component probably oligomerizes, it is advantageous to add as much molybdenum as can easily be maintained in the composition. Usually, the reaction mixture will have charged to it from 0.01 to 2.00 atoms of molybdenum per basic nitrogen atom. Preferably from 0.3 to 1.0, and most preferably from 0.4 to 0.7, atoms of molybdenum per atom of basic nitrogen is added to the reaction mixture.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0098">When optionally sulfurized, the sulfurized oxymolybdenum containing compositions may be generally characterized as a sulfur/molybdenum complex of a basic nitrogen dispersant compound preferably with a sulfur to molybdenum weight ratio of about (0.01 to 1.0) to 1 and more preferably from about (0.05 to 0.5) to 1 and a nitrogen to molybdenum weight ratio of about (1 to 10) to 1 and more preferably from (2 to 5) to 1. For extremely low sulfur incorporation the sulfur to molybdenum weight ratio can be from (0.01 to 0.08) to 1.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0099">The sulfurized and unsulfurized oxymolybdenum complexes of this invention are typically employed in a lubricating oil in an amount of 0.01 to 10 %, more preferably from 0.04 to 1 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0100">Additional components may be added to the synergist combination of component a) and component b) to further the resistance to oxidation of the organic substrate and which may add to the synergism. Particularly preferred is a component which operates as a peroxy radical scavenger. These hydroperoxide decomposers convert hydroperoxides into non-radical products thus preventing chain propagation reactions. Commonly organosulfur and organophophorous compounds have severed this purpose, and many suitable compounds have identified herein above with regard the oxymolybdenum component and need not be repeated again. Particularly preferred organophosphorous compounds are the oil-soluble, phosphorus-containing, anti-wear compounds selected from the group consisting of metal dithiophosphates, phosphorus esters (including phosphates, phosphonates, phosphinates, phosphine oxides, phosphites, phosphonites, phosphinites, phosphines and the like), amine phosphates and amine phosphinates, sulfur-containing phosphorus esters including phosphoro monothionate and phosphoro dithionates, phosphoramides, phosphonamides and the like. More preferably, the phosphorus-containing compound is a metal dithiophosphate and, even more preferably, a zinc dithiophosphate. Suitable phosphorous compounds are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,696,393, incorporated herein by reference.</p>
