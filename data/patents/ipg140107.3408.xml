<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to integrated circuit devices and, more particularly, to microelectromechanical resonator devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Frequency references provided by oscillators are required in every clocked electronic system, including communication circuits, microprocessors, and signal processing circuits. Oscillators frequently consist of high performance piezoelectric crystals, such as quartz oscillators. The advantages of quartz oscillators are their stable operating frequency and high quality factor. However, the disadvantages of quartz oscillators are their relatively large size and unsuitability for high integration with electronic circuitry (e.g., CMOS circuits).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Based on these limitations of conventional oscillators, there is a strong interest in the development of fully integrated silicon oscillators. Integration is important not only for reduced size but also reduced power consumption. It is possible to realize an integrated silicon oscillator using the mechanical properties of silicon devices. For example, silicon microelectromechanical (MEMs) resonators can provide small form factor, ease of integration with conventional semiconductor fabrication techniques and high f&#x2022;Q products. Accordingly, MEMs resonators are considered a desirable alternative to quartz resonators in real-time and other clock applications.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One example of a MEMs resonator includes lateral-mode piezoelectric resonators, such as thin-film piezoelectric-on-silicon (TPoS) resonators, which have been successfully incorporated in low-power and low-noise oscillators. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates a conventional MEMs resonator <b>10</b> containing a resonator body <b>12</b> that is suspended opposite a recess in a substrate <b>16</b> by a pair of opposing tethers <b>14</b>. This resonator body <b>12</b> may include a stack of multiple layers, including a semiconductor body, a bottom electrode on the semiconductor body, a piezoelectric layer on the bottom electrode and a plurality of top electrodes on the piezoelectric layer. The recess may be formed by selectively removing portions of a buried insulating layer within a semiconductor-on-insulator (SOI) substrate <b>16</b> containing a semiconductor device layer thereon. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is an SEM image of an 11th-order AlN-on-Si resonator fabricated on a 10 &#x3bc;m silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate. This resonator, which includes 11 interdigitated electrode fingers at a 20 &#x3bc;m pitch, includes three pairs of conventional beam supports (20 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;2 &#x3bc;m) that operate to tether a suspended main body of the resonator to a surrounding substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Other examples of these types of resonators are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,939,990 to Wang et al., entitled &#x201c;Thin-Film Bulk Acoustic Resonators Having Perforated Bodies That Provide Reduced Susceptibility to Process-Induced Lateral Dimension Variations,&#x201d; and in U.S. Pat. No. 7,888,843 to Ayazi et al., entitled &#x201c;Thin-Film Piezoelectric-on-Insulator Resonators Having Perforated Resonator Bodies Therein,&#x201d; the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Active frequency tuning techniques may also be utilized to improve MEMs resonator performance by, among other things, reducing the strength of spurious resonance modes that typically limit the quality factor (Q) of the resonator at a desired resonant frequency. Some examples of active frequency tuning in micromechanical resonators are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,639,105 and 7,843,284 to Ayazi et al., entitled &#x201c;Lithographically-Defined Multi-Standard Multi-Frequency High-Q Tunable Micromechanical Resonators,&#x201d; and in U.S. Pat. No. 7,924,119 to Ayazi et al., entitled Micromechanical Bulk Acoustic Mode Resonators Having Interdigitated Electrodes and Multiple Pairs of Anchor Supports,&#x201d; and in U.S. Pat. No. 7,800,282 to Ayazi et al., entitled Single-Resonator Dual-Frequency Lateral-Extension Mode Piezoelectric Oscillators, and Operating Methods Thereof,&#x201d; the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Unfortunately, while piezoelectric MEMs resonators may be interfaced with tuning and other oscillator electronics, such as transimpedance amplifiers, the appearance of sufficiently-strong low-Q spurious modes near the designed operation frequency of the resonator can cause degraded oscillator performance. For example, oscillator phase and gain conditions may cause a spurious mode to become preferred over a desired mode during start-up, causing an oscillator to lock into the spurious mode. In addition, feedthrough and coupling between the desired and spurious modes can degrade phase noise performance and increase frequency instability.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention now will be described more fully with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as being limited to the embodiments set forth herein; rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer (and variants thereof), it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer (and variants thereof), there are no intervening elements or layers present. Like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the present invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprising&#x201d;, &#x201c;including&#x201d;, having&#x201d; and variants thereof, when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof. In contrast, the term &#x201c;consisting of&#x201d; when used in this specification, specifies the stated features, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, and precludes additional features, steps, operations, elements and/or components.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the present invention are described herein with reference to cross-section and perspective illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, a sharp angle may be somewhat rounded due to manufacturing techniques/tolerances.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the present invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2F</figref> illustrate a plurality of linear acoustic bandgap (LAB) structures according to embodiments of the invention that may be used advantageously as low acoustic loss tethers to achieve increased Q and lower insertion loss (IL) when used with microelectromechanical resonators having suspended resonator bodies therein. Additional examples of these LAB structures are disclosed in articles by coinventors L. Sorenson, Jenna Fu and Farrokh Ayazi, entitled &#x201c;Linear-Acoustic Bandgap Arrays for Spurious Mode Suppression in Piezoelectric MEMS Resonators,&#x201d; 2011 Joint Conference of the IEEE International Frequency Control Symposium and European Frequency and Time Forum, San Francisco, Calif., May 2-5 (2011); and &#x201c;One-Dimensional Linear Acoustic Bandgap Structures for Performance Enhancement of AlN-on-Silicon Micromechanical Resonators,&#x201d; The 16th International Conference on Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems, Beijing, China, Jun. 7 (2011), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Although not wishing to be bound by any theory, the periodic nature of an LAB structure, which can operate as a one-dimensional (1D) phononic crystal (PC), combined with a relatively large acoustic mismatch at the tether/air interface creates acoustic bandgaps, or frequencies of no allowed acoustic propagation. Based on the creation of these bandgaps, LAB structures can be used as Q-enhancing support tethers by tailoring the tethers to confine acoustic energy within a resonator body at the desired operating frequency. This confinement of energy also enables an aggressive tethering approach using LAB structures, where one pair of tethers is used for each finger of an interdigitated piezoelectric-on-semiconductor transducer, to simultaneously improve the support loss component of Q and provide significant attenuation of spurious modes which lie outside of the designed bandgaps.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a coupled-ring linear acoustic bandgap (LAB) structure <b>20</b><i>a </i>is illustrated as including a plurality of piezoelectric-on-semiconductor rings connected together by a plurality of piezoelectric-on-semiconductor tether segments. Each of the piezoelectric-on-semiconductor rings (i.e., each basis) is shown as having an inner radius ri and an outer radius ro and each of the tether segments is shown as having a width &#x201c;w.&#x201d; The LAB structure <b>20</b>s is a periodic structure with a period &#x201c;a&#x201d; that also represents a center-to-center pitch between the coupled rings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates a periodic S-wave LAB structure <b>20</b><i>b </i>having a width &#x201c;w&#x201d; and curvature &#x201c;r.&#x201d; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> illustrates a periodic coupled-ring LAB structure <b>20</b><i>c </i>having circular and elliptical rings therein with the same center-to-center pitch &#x201c;x,&#x201d; which demonstrates an exponentially-scaled basis (in a y direction). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref> illustrates a non-periodic coupled-ring LAB structure <b>20</b><i>d </i>having unequally-sized circular rings therein with an increasing center-to-center pitch (e.g., y&#x3e;x), which demonstrates a linearly-scaled basis (in x and y directions). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref> illustrates a LAB structure <b>20</b><i>e </i>containing a series combination of a coupled-ring structure with an S-wave structure (i.e., an LAB structure having both coupled-ring bases and S-wave bases). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref> illustrates a periodic LAB structure <b>20</b><i>f </i>configured as a linear acoustic &#x201c;diode,&#x201d; which is configured to support a directionally-asymmetric phonon dispersion characteristic as a function of frequency and acoustic wavevector, which yields directions of preferential acoustic propagation (in 1D).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a graph conceptually illustrating how the different (but overlapping) acoustic bandgaps of LAB structures having different bases can be combined to yield a larger continuous acoustic bandgap when the different LAB structures are combined in series within a resonator tether. Based on this graph, the LAB structures <b>20</b><i>c</i>-<b>20</b><i>e </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C-2E</figref> can be expected to have larger acoustic bandgaps (i.e., larger frequency ranges of no acoustic propagation) than otherwise equivalent LAB structures having only a single basis therein.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a three-dimensional perspective view of a basis (i.e., single ring) of a coupled-ring LAB structure <b>20</b><i>a </i>(see, e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>) containing a piezoelectric-on-semiconductor stack (e.g., AlN-on-Si stack) and an upper electrode layer (e.g., Mo layer) on the piezoelectric layer. A bottom electrode layer (not shown) may also be provided between the piezoelectric layer and the underlying silicon layer in the event the conductivity of the silicon layer is insufficiently high. As described in the aforementioned L. Sorenson et al. articles, the period &#x201c;a&#x201d; of the basis may be 20 &#x3bc;m, an inner radius ri may be 4 &#x3bc;m, an outer radius ro may be 8 &#x3bc;m, a tether segment width &#x201c;w&#x201d; may be 2 &#x3bc;m, a silicon layer thickness (d<sub>Si</sub>) may be 10 &#x3bc;m, a piezoelectric layer thickness (d<sub>AlN</sub>) may be 1 &#x3bc;m and an electrode thickness (d<sub>Mo</sub>) may be 100 nm. This basis of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> may be utilized in the 11th-order AlN-on-Si resonator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, which was fabricated on a 10 &#x3bc;m silicon-on-insulator (SOI) substrate. This resonator of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, which includes 11 interdigitated upper electrode fingers at a 20 &#x3bc;m pitch, also includes 11 pairs of 6-period coupled-ring LAB tethers at the same pitch as the electrode fingers. These LAB tethers operate to anchor the suspended main body of the resonator to a surrounding substrate. In alternative embodiments of the invention, the LAB tethers of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> may be replaced by the LAB structures of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B-2F</figref>.</p>
