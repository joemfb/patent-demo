<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A plasma treatment system for treating a workpiece with a downstream-type plasma. The processing chamber of the plasma treatment system includes a chamber lid having a plasma cavity disposed generally between a powered electrode and a grounded plate, a processing space separated from the plasma cavity by the grounded plate, and a substrate support in the processing space for holding the workpiece. A direct plasma is generated in the plasma cavity. The grounded plate is adapted with openings that remove electrons and ions from the plasma admitted from the plasma cavity into the processing space to provide a downstream-type plasma of free radicals. The openings may also eliminate line-of-sight paths for light between the plasma cavity and processing space. In another aspect, the volume of the processing chamber may be adjusted by removing or inserting at least one removable sidewall section from the chamber lid.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to plasma processing, and more particularly to a plasma treatment system configured to treat embossed substrates.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Plasma treatment is commonly applied for modifying the surface properties of workpieces used in applications relating to integrated circuits, electronic packages, and printed circuit boards. Plasma treatment systems are configured to produce a direct plasma from a process gas and expose a surface of a substrate or workpiece with generated active species from the direct plasma to remove surface atoms by physical sputtering, chemically-assisted sputtering, or chemical reactions. The physical or chemical action may be used to condition the surface to improve properties such as adhesion, to selectively remove an extraneous surface layer of a process material, or to clean undesired contaminants from the surface. Plasma treatment is used in electronics packaging, for example, to increase surface activation and/or surface cleanliness for eliminating delamination and bond failures, improving wire bond strength, ensuring void free underfill, removing oxides, enhancing die attach, and improving adhesion for encapsulation.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Plasma treatment systems may be integrated into in-line and cluster systems or batch processes in which groups of workpieces are processed by successive plasma exposures or processing cycles. Workpieces may be supplied by various methods, including delivery in a magazine, individual delivery by a conveyer transport system, or manual insertion into the process chamber. Plasma treatment systems may also be provided with automated robotic manipulators that coordinate workpiece exchange into and out of the process chamber for plasma processing operations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional plasma treatment systems have failed to provide adequate process uniformity across the surface of individual workpieces. The plasma density must be precisely and accurately controlled at all positions on the surface of the workpiece so that it is substantially uniform across the surface. Critical parameters for controlling the uniformity of the plasma include the spatial uniformity of the excitation power and the dispersion of the process gas. A non-uniform plasma density at the surface of the workpiece degrades process reliability and reduces the process yield. To achieve workpiece-to-workpiece uniformity, the process gas must be evenly dispersed and uniformly ionized by the excitation power so that the flux of active species is spatially uniform across the surface of the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional plasma treatment systems have likewise failed to achieve adequate reproducibility of the plasma treatment between successive batches of workpieces. Batch-to-batch reproducibility depends on the precise control of process variables and parameters so that successive workpieces are exposed to substantially identical plasma conditions. Moreover, conventional plasma treatment systems are incapable of rapidly processing workpieces with a throughput amenable to automated process lines or fabrication requirements. System throughput and uniformity of the plasma treatment must be maximized for reducing production costs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Conventional in-line plasma treatment systems also lack the ability to generate a downstream-type plasma that is substantially free of ions, electrons and light in at least the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum. As is well-known, a direct plasma is a combination of multiple different species including ions and electrons that have a net charge and source gas molecules and free radicals that are neutral. Free radicals are gas molecules that are nearly ionized yet retain their full complement of electrons so they are neither positively nor negatively charged. Workpieces may be processed with a direct plasma containing all plasma species or with a downstream-type plasma including primarily free radicals. Processing workpieces with a direct plasma promotes treatment with both physical action due to ion and electron bombardment and chemical action arising from surface interaction of the free radicals. On the other hand, processing with the downstream-type plasma involves primarily chemical action.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Conventional plasma treatment systems generally include a fixed dimension plasma chamber and a substrate support in the plasma chamber that holds the workpiece at a fixed position between opposed treatment electrodes. Because the workpiece is located at a fixed position, the surface to be plasma treated is likewise spaced relative to the treatment electrodes. The fixed position is chosen to provide a spacing effective to provide an effective plasma treatment for workpieces of a given thickness. It follows that, as the thickness of the workpiece being treated in the system changes, the location of the surface is no longer at the desired fixed position so that the efficiency of the plasma treatment may be reduced. Therefore, conventional plasma treatment systems are ill equipped to accommodate changes in workpiece thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is thus a need for an in-line plasma treatment system that can provide a downstream-type plasma for treating workpieces in the plasma chamber and that can accommodate workpieces of differing thickness while maintaining an effective treatment efficiency.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention addresses these and other problems associated with the prior art by providing a plasma treatment system capable of performing a downstream-type plasma treatment. The plasma treatment system includes a vacuum chamber including a processing space, a chamber lid, and a plasma cavity defined in the chamber lid, a workpiece holder positioned in the processing space, a vacuum source coupled in fluid communication with the vacuum chamber, a process gas supply coupled in fluid communication with the vacuum chamber, and a first plasma excitation source. The plasma cavity and processing space are in fluid communication. The process gas supply is capable of providing process gas to at least the plasma cavity, the vacuum source is capable of evacuating the processing space and the plasma cavity, and the first plasma excitation source is operable for exciting process gas in the plasma cavity to generate a plasma. The plasma excitation source further includes a grounded plate positioned between the plasma cavity and the processing space. The grounded plate includes a plurality of openings capable of prohibiting or, at the least, substantially reducing the transfer of charged species, such as ions and electrons, from the plasma cavity to the processing space. However, the openings preferentially allow the transfer of free radicals from the plasma cavity to the processing space. According to this aspect of the invention, a downstream-type plasma free, or substantially free, of charged particles and photons can be generated at the workpiece for performing plasma treatments by the chemical action of the radicals without the physical action otherwise provided by the charged particles.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the principles of the invention, a method is provided for treating a workpiece with a plasma. The method includes placing the workpiece in a processing space of a plasma processing system, generating a direct plasma comprising charged species and free radicals, filtering charged species from the direct plasma to create a downstream-type plasma including free radicals, and exposing the workpiece in the processing space to the free radicals in the downstream-type plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to another aspect of the invention, a plasma treatment system includes a vacuum chamber having a chamber base and a chamber lid movable relative to the chamber base between a closed position that defines a processing space and an open position for transferring a workpiece into and out of the processing space, a vacuum source coupled in fluid communication with the vacuum chamber, a workpiece holder located in the processing space, a process gas supply in fluid communication with the vacuum chamber, and a plasma excitation source. The process gas supply is capable of providing process gas to the processing space, the vacuum source is capable of evacuating the processing space, and the plasma excitation source is operable to provide a plasma in the processing space generated from the process gas. The chamber lid further includes a first sidewall section capable of being removed from the chamber lid for changing a vertical dimension of the vacuum chamber. According to this aspect of the invention, the vertical dimension of the chamber may be varied to accommodate workpieces of differing thickness by compensating for substrate thickness by placing the exposed surface of the workpiece at a predictable distance from the treatment electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the principles of the invention, a method is provided for plasma treating a workpiece in a processing space of a vacuum chamber having a chamber lid. The method comprises placing a workpiece in the processing space, and varying a volume of the chamber lid to alter the distance from an exposed surface of the workpiece to a treatment electrode positioned in the chamber lid based upon a thickness of the workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In another embodiment, an apparatus is provided for treating first and second workpieces of differing thicknesses with plasma. The apparatus includes a vacuum chamber, a vacuum port in the vacuum chamber for evacuating the processing space, and a workpiece holder located in the processing space configured to hold either the first workpiece or the second workpiece in a horizontal plane. The vacuum chamber includes a chamber base and a chamber lid movable relative to the chamber base between a closed position that defines a processing space and an open position for transferring the first and second workpieces into and out of the processing space. The apparatus further includes a process gas supply port in the vacuum chamber for introducing a process gas to the processing space and a plasma excitation source positioned in the chamber lid including a powered electrode in a plane parallel to the plane of either the first workpiece or the second workpiece and operable to provide a plasma in the processing space from the process gas. The distance from the powered electrode to the exposed surface of the first workpiece having a first thickness defines a desired separation. The apparatus further includes a sidewall section capable of being removed from, or added to, the chamber lid for changing a vertical dimension of the vacuum chamber and for maintaining the desired separation when the second workpiece having a second thickness different than the first thickness replaces the first workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The plasma excitation source of the apparatus may include a grounded plate with a plurality of openings positioned below the powered electrode in a plane parallel to the plane of the powered electrode, and a plasma cavity formed between the powered electrode and the grounded plate. The plurality of openings connect the plasma cavity and the processing space, prohibit the transfer of at least a portion of ions in the plasma from the plasma cavity to the processing space, and allow the transfer of at least a portion of free radicals in the plasma from the plasma cavity to the processing space.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another embodiment, a method is provided for sequentially plasma treating first and second workpieces of differing thicknesses in a processing space of a vacuum chamber. The vacuum chamber has a chamber lid and a powered electrode positioned in the chamber lid in a horizontal plane. The method includes placing the first workpiece having a first thickness and an exposed surface in the processing space and in a plane parallel to the plane of the powered electrode wherein the distance from the powered electrode to the exposed surface of the first workpiece defines a desired separation distance. The method further includes creating a plasma in the processing space to treat the first workpiece. The method further includes removing the first workpiece from the processing space, placing a second workpiece having an exposed surface and a thickness different than the first workpiece in the processing space, and adding or removing at least one sidewall section to the chamber lid to maintain the distance between the powered electrode and the exposed surface of the second workpiece at the desired separation distance.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The present invention, in accordance with the principles and objectives herein, provides an apparatus and a method for processing a workpiece with a plasma. The present invention provides a plasma treatment system configured to provide a uniformly dense plasma, rapid pump-down and venting cycles, reproducible processing conditions, and simplified material handling. The system advantageously requires a reduced excitation power to initiate and sustain a uniformly dense plasma in the processing space, while employing a control algorithm that minimizes the cycle time required to process each successive workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A plasma treatment system <b>10</b>, in accordance with the principles of the present invention, is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>A-<b>2</b>C and <b>3</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, plasma treatment system <b>10</b> includes a processing chamber <b>12</b>, a loading station <b>20</b>, and an exit station <b>22</b>, which are situated on a substantially flat and mechanically stable surface <b>24</b> atop an instrument cabinet <b>26</b>. Processing chamber <b>12</b> includes a chamber lid <b>14</b> hingeably connected to a chamber base <b>18</b> by a hinge assembly <b>16</b>. Chamber lid <b>14</b> is selectively positionable between an open position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2A</figref>, and a closed position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. Chamber base <b>18</b> and chamber lid <b>14</b> are preferably formed of an electrically conductive material suitable for high-vacuum applications, such as an aluminum alloy or a stainless steel.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Chamber lid <b>14</b> includes a domed ceiling <b>28</b> and an integral sidewall <b>30</b> encircled by a flat rim <b>32</b>. A viewport opening <b>38</b> is provided in ceiling <b>28</b> for holding a viewport <b>34</b>. As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, viewport <b>34</b> is a substantially planar panel attached to chamber lid <b>14</b> by a frame <b>35</b> and fasteners <b>36</b>. An O-ring <b>40</b> is received within a groove <b>42</b> that circumscribes viewport opening <b>38</b>. Viewport <b>34</b> compressively engages O-ring <b>40</b> to create a vacuum-tight seal, where the sealing force is supplied collectively by the pressure differential between the interior and exterior of processing chamber <b>12</b> and by fasteners <b>36</b>. Viewport <b>34</b> is constructed of a dielectric ceramic, such as quartz, that has a low sputtering coefficient, is gas impermeable, and has a wide transmission range for optical wavelengths. O-ring <b>40</b> is preferably formed of an elastomer such as Viton&#xae;.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Chamber base <b>18</b> includes a floor wall <b>44</b> integral with a sidewall <b>46</b> which is encircled by a flat lip <b>48</b>. Lip <b>48</b> includes a circumferential groove <b>50</b> for receiving a conductive resilient sealing member or O-ring <b>51</b> that provides an electrically-conductive pathway and a substantially vacuum-tight seal between chamber lid <b>14</b> and chamber base <b>18</b>. The dimensions of groove <b>50</b> and O-ring <b>51</b> are selected for creating a vacuum-tight seal. It may be appreciated that O-ring groove <b>50</b>, and therefore O-ring <b>51</b>, may be positioned in either chamber lid <b>14</b> or chamber base <b>18</b> without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention. It is appreciated that particulates from the surrounding environment are less likely to attach to, and compromise the sealing ability of, O-ring <b>51</b> if positioned in chamber lid <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">O-ring <b>51</b> is a conductive elastomer gasket, preferably formed of a composite of a conductive fill powder impregnated in an elastomer binder, such as a powder of silver and aluminum in silicone. An exemplary O-ring <b>51</b> is formed of a conductive composite manufactured and marketed under the trade name Cho-seal&#xae; by EMI Shielding Products, a division of Parker Hannifin Corp. (Cleveland, Ohio).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another aspect, chamber base <b>18</b> further includes a workpiece holder or substrate support <b>64</b> configured to receive and support a part or workpiece <b>56</b>. Generally, workpiece <b>56</b> is a rectangular, planar structure that includes a periphery having opposed side edges <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> of a predetermined thickness, a leading edge <b>60</b>, and a trailing edge <b>62</b>. Opposed side edges <b>58</b>, <b>59</b> are separated by a predetermined maximum transverse width that is measured perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of workpiece <b>56</b>. Workpiece <b>56</b> may be a strip type part, such as a ball grid array (BGA) or a metal lead frame, singulated BGA's carried in an Auer boat, or a pallet carrying multi-chip electronic modules, integrated circuit chips, or the like. Workpiece <b>56</b> may also be any disk-shaped semiconductor wafer or substrate formed of silicon, gallium arsenide, and other semiconductor materials familiar to persons of ordinary skill in the art and may include patterned areas of metallization, contacts, insulating layers and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As best depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, substrate support <b>64</b> comprises opposed side rails <b>66</b><i>a, </i><b>66</b><i>b </i>that extend vertically from a substantially planar support platform <b>68</b>. Side rail <b>66</b><i>a </i>is in a spaced relationship relative to side rail <b>66</b><i>b </i>along the longitudinal axis of support platform <b>68</b> so that the maximum width between side edges <b>58</b> and <b>59</b> of workpiece <b>56</b> may be accommodated. For convenience, side rail <b>66</b><i>a </i>will be detailed below with the understanding that side rail <b>66</b><i>b </i>has an identical structure.

A second end of each brace <b>104</b> includes an aperture <b>114</b> that receives a connecting rod <b>116</b> that is also shared by both braces <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Connecting rod <b>116</b> is further attached to a rod end <b>118</b> that is threadingly carried by one end of a piston rod <b>120</b> of a bi-directional pneumatic cylinder or lid actuator <b>122</b>. Rod end <b>118</b> further includes an aperture (not shown but similar to, and collinear with, aperture <b>114</b>) with an inner diameter sized to slideably receive connecting rod <b>116</b> therein. Piston rod <b>120</b> is adapted for reciprocating linear, vertical motion so that brace <b>104</b> can pivot about hinge pin <b>110</b> to cantilever chamber lid <b>14</b> between an open position and a closed position. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the opposed end of lid actuator <b>122</b> is affixed via a mounting block <b>126</b> to a structural support (not shown) within instrument cabinet <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, in one aspect of the present invention, an obround bearing <b>128</b> is slidingly received within aperture <b>124</b> of nub <b>106</b>. Obround bearing <b>128</b> has an exterior, annular surface of an outer diameter chosen to frictionally fit within aperture <b>124</b> and an interior bore <b>130</b> that is dimensioned to receive hinge pin <b>110</b>. Bore <b>130</b> has a substantially oval cross-sectional profile with a vertical major axis, as viewed normal to the longitudinal axis of bore <b>130</b>. When chamber lid <b>14</b> is in an open position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a length of one end of hinge pin <b>110</b> will contact a lower interior surface of bore <b>130</b>. As chamber lid <b>14</b> is pivoted by the lid actuator <b>122</b>, hinge pin <b>110</b> rotates about a longitudinal axis thereof. During rotation, the outer surface of hinge pin <b>110</b> remains in contact with the lower interior surface of bore <b>130</b>. When lip <b>32</b> contacts the surface of O-ring <b>51</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, lid actuator <b>122</b> will continue to extend so that the chamber lid <b>14</b> moves downward to compress O-ring <b>51</b>. Due to the presence of obround bearing <b>128</b>, hinge pin <b>110</b> is free to translate vertically upward in bore <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, in which the chamber lid <b>14</b> resides in a closed position, the interior peripheral surface of the chamber lid <b>14</b> and chamber base <b>18</b> bounds processing space <b>102</b>. The vacuum seal is enhanced by the further compression of O-ring <b>51</b> between chamber base <b>18</b> and chamber lid <b>14</b>. The additional compression of O-ring <b>51</b> results from the pressure differential between atmospheric pressure acting on the exterior of chamber lid <b>14</b> and the vacuum within processing chamber <b>12</b> that applies a force that urges chamber lid <b>14</b> vertically downward towards chamber base <b>18</b>. Hinge pin <b>110</b> translates vertically and with minimal transverse motion due to the presence of obround bearing <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Bore <b>130</b> within obround bearing <b>128</b> affords an additional degree of vertical freedom for hinge pin <b>110</b>, as compared with a conventional bearing having a bore of a circular cross-sectional profile. Chamber lid <b>14</b> is free to move vertically in response to the forces that compress O-ring <b>51</b>. As a result, the vacuum-tight seal between lip <b>32</b> and O-ring <b>51</b> is uniform about the circumference of groove <b>50</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the presence of obround bearing <b>128</b> provides approximately 50 mils of vertical movement for hinge pin <b>110</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Vacuum pump <b>144</b> may comprise one or more vacuum pumps as would be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art of vacuum technology. A preferred vacuum pump <b>144</b> is a single rotary-vane vacuum pump of the type manufactured by, for example, Alcatel Vacuum Technologies Inc.

Vacuum distribution baffle <b>180</b> is a flat elongate plate <b>182</b> perforated by a plurality of orifices <b>184</b>. Orifices <b>184</b> restrict the flow of process gas toward the inlet of vacuum pumping system <b>134</b> so as to divert the pressure differential. As a result, the entire processed surface of workpiece <b>56</b> will be uniformly exposed to the plasma while simultaneously allowing high-speed evacuation of process gas and sputtered contaminant species during a plasma processing operation. Vacuum distribution baffle <b>180</b> also prevents gas flow to vacuum pump <b>144</b> from disturbing the position of workpiece <b>56</b> upon substrate support <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Preferably, vacuum distribution baffle <b>180</b> is formed of an electrically-insulating material, such as a machinable ceramic, having a minimal out-gassing potential.

Further, the configuration of powered and ground electrodes produce an electric field substantially perpendicular to a workpiece <b>56</b> residing on substrate support <b>64</b> such that ion trajectories are substantially perpendicular to the surface normal of the workpiece <b>56</b>.</p>

Relative to known plasma treatment systems, minimization of the volume of chamber <b>12</b> for a high pumping rate and precise positioning of workpiece <b>56</b> permit rapid plasma processing at a reduced power level.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the plasma treatment system <b>10</b> includes a gas flow control <b>300</b> and an RF generator <b>302</b> connected to the processing chamber <b>12</b>. A treatment system control <b>304</b> receives input signals from various devices within the plasma treatment system <b>10</b> and provides output signals to operate the gas flow control <b>300</b> and RF generator <b>302</b>. The control <b>304</b> is also connected to a programmable graphics user interface <b>306</b>. The interface provides user input devices, for example, pushbuttons, switches, etc., and further, has output devices, for example, lights and a display screen, thereby allowing the user to follow the status of the operation of the plasma treatment system <b>10</b> and control its operation. The control <b>304</b> may be any type of microprocessor based control having both logic and arithmetic capabilities. For example, a programmable logic controller such as Model Direct Logic 205 is manufactured by Koyo and commercially available from Automation Direct of Cummings, Ga. Further, the graphics user interface <b>306</b> is also manufactured by Koyo for the Direct Logic 205 and is also commercially available from Automation Direct.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Normally, during a plasma processing operation within the processing chamber <b>12</b>, a plurality of process gases are mixed within a manifold <b>308</b>. Exemplary process gases include Ar, He, CO<sub>2</sub>, N<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>2</sub>, CF<sub>4</sub>, SF<sub>6</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, and mixtures thereof. Each process gas has an independent gas supply system <b>309</b> comprised of a gas source <b>310</b>, a mass flow controller <b>312</b>, an isolation valve <b>314</b> and a solenoid valve <b>315</b>. In the example where two gases, for example, Ar and O<sub>2</sub>, are used, there would be two independent gas supply systems <b>309</b><i>a, </i><b>309</b><i>b </i>comprised of gas sources <b>310</b><i>a</i>, <b>310</b><i>b</i>, mass flow controllers <b>312</b><i>a</i>, <b>312</b><i>b</i>, isolation valves <b>314</b><i>a</i>, <b>314</b><i>b </i>and solenoid valves <b>315</b><i>a</i>, <b>315</b><i>b</i>. As will be appreciated, any number of additional gas supplies <b>309</b><i>n </i>may be connected to the manifold <b>308</b> and each additional gas will have its own gas source <b>310</b><i>n</i>, mass flow controller <b>312</b><i>n</i>, isolation valve <b>314</b><i>n </i>and solenoid valve <b>315</b><i>n. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition to independent gas supplies, the gas flow control <b>300</b> includes vacuum pump <b>144</b>, vacuum valve <b>140</b>, solenoid valve <b>341</b> and pressure gauge <b>52</b>. The plasma treatment system <b>10</b> is highly responsive to changes in processing parameters. Therefore, pressure gauge <b>52</b> is placed in close proximity to the chamber <b>12</b> and is fluidly connected to the chamber <b>12</b> with tube <b>55</b> of an advantageously large diameter, for example, a 0.500 inch diameter tube. The gas flow control <b>300</b> further includes bleed valve <b>54</b> and its solenoid <b>357</b> for bringing the processing chamber <b>12</b> back to atmospheric pressure at the end of a plasma processing cycle. Again, to minimize the depressurization process, bleed valve <b>54</b> is normally in close proximity to the processing chamber <b>12</b> and has a relatively large fluid communication opening therewith. Thus, the bleed valve <b>54</b> has the capability of returning the processing chamber <b>12</b> to atmospheric pressure in approximately one second.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The RF generator <b>302</b> is comprised of an RF power supply <b>318</b> providing RF power to an L-network tuner or impedance matching device <b>320</b>, for example, a pair of variable air capacitors. RF power supply <b>302</b> operates at a frequency between about 40 kHz and about 13.56 MHz, preferably about 13.56 MHz, and a power between about 0 watts and about 600 watts, preferably about 60 watts to about 400 watts. RF power from the variable air capacitors <b>320</b>, <b>324</b> is applied over an output <b>328</b> to substrate support <b>64</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) within the processing chamber <b>12</b>. A phase capacitor <b>320</b> includes a movable plate connected to a motor <b>321</b> and further has a phase control <b>322</b> that provides an analog feedback signal on an input <b>323</b> of the control <b>304</b>. A magnitude capacitor <b>324</b> has a movable plate connected to a motor <b>325</b> and further has a phase control <b>326</b> that provides an analog feedback signal on an input <b>327</b> of the control <b>304</b>. The control <b>304</b> utilizes a known PID control loop to provide analog command signals on outputs <b>328</b>, <b>329</b> to the respective motors <b>321</b>, <b>325</b> to move the plates of the variable air capacitors <b>320</b>, <b>324</b> in a known manner.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The PID control loop of the present invention utilizes a control algorithm that automatically provides a variable gain to improve performance at the boundary conditions. The magnitude of the feedback signal on the input <b>323</b> has a range of from &#x2212;5 volts to +5 volts; and with a constant gain system, as the magnitude of the feedback signal moves close to and through the zero crossing, accurate and stable system control is difficult. Traditionally, the gain is set to a fixed value that is a compromise between that needed to handle lower signal levels while not letting the control system saturate at higher signal levels. The result is a generally compromised or lower level of system responsiveness and performance, that is, the time required for the control system to stabilize is longer. The present invention continuously recalculates, and dynamically sets, a gain value as a function of the signal strength of the feedback signal on the input <b>323</b>. Thus, the PID loop is critically damped, that is, it reaches a stable state quickly with a minimum of overshoot. In other respects, the tuning network <b>320</b> functions in a known manner to match an impedance of an RF system comprised of an RF output of the RF power supply <b>318</b>, the tuning network <b>320</b> and the RF load presented by the RF circuit within the processing chamber <b>12</b> to a desired impedance value, for example, 50 ohms.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">As will be appreciated, various limit or proximity switches <b>330</b> are utilized in association with the operation of the processing chamber <b>12</b>. For example, limit switches are utilized to detect the respective opened and closed positions of chamber lid <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of the processing chamber <b>12</b> and provide a state feedback signal on a respective input <b>331</b> of the control <b>304</b>. Those limit switches may be connected to the lid actuator <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>) operating the lid <b>14</b>, may be mounted on the lid <b>14</b>, or otherwise detect the position of the lid <b>14</b>. A proximity switch is also used to detect the desired position of a workpiece <b>56</b> within the processing chamber <b>12</b>. There are many different commercially available limit switch devices that utilize magnetism, mechanical contact, light, etc., to detect the proximity or position of an object. The choice of a particular type of commercially available limit switch is dependent on the application and preference of the designer.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">An end point of a plasma processing cycle may be determined in several ways. The plasma treatment system of the present invention has a very high level of control; and therefore, the plasma processing cycle is highly repeatable. Hence, with the plasma treatment system of the present invention, the control <b>304</b> normally utilizes an internal timer to measure the duration of the plasma processing cycle. In some applications, an end point detector <b>334</b> is operatively connected with the processing chamber <b>12</b>. The end point detector <b>334</b> is normally a photoelectric switch that changes state in response to detecting a desired and particular wavelength of the light of the plasma generated within the processing chamber <b>12</b>. Visual communication between the end point detector <b>334</b> and the interior of the processing chamber <b>12</b> may be achieved by directing the end point detector <b>334</b> through the viewport <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) or mounting the end point detector <b>334</b> within an opening or hole (not shown) in a wall of the processing chamber <b>12</b>. Creation of the gas plasma within the processing chamber <b>12</b> produces light. Further, the wavelength of that light changes with the composition of the different materials within the gas plasma in the chamber <b>12</b>. For example, with an etching process, as the gas plasma etches different materials from the surface of the workpiece, the wavelength of the light created by the plasma will be a function of a combination of the gas plasma and atoms of those materials. After any coatings and impurities have been etched from the surface, continued etching will result in a combination of atoms of the native material of the workpiece and the gas plasma. That combination produces a unique wavelength of light which is detected by the end point detector <b>334</b>, and the detector <b>334</b> provides a binary feedback signal on an output <b>336</b> back to the control <b>304</b>. Thus the control <b>304</b> is able to detect when the plasma processing cycle is completed when that feedback signal changes state.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flowchart illustrating the operation of the control <b>304</b> in implementing a typical plasma processing cycle. At <b>602</b>, a part transfer cycle is initiated. During that process, the control <b>304</b> provides command signals to a controller (not shown) that causes the positioning lever <b>94</b> to move an unprocessed workpiece <b>56</b> into the chamber <b>12</b> between the side rails <b>78</b><i>a,b</i>. As the part <b>56</b> is moved into position, one of the limit switches <b>330</b> detects the loaded position of the part and provides a state feedback on a respective output <b>331</b> to the control <b>304</b>. Upon the control, at <b>604</b>, detecting a change in the switch state indicating that the part is loaded, the control <b>304</b> provides a command signal on an output <b>337</b> to open a solenoid valve <b>338</b>. The open solenoid <b>338</b> directs pressurized air from a pneumatic source, for example, shop air, <b>340</b> to the lid actuator <b>122</b> in a direction causing the lid actuator <b>122</b> to move the lid <b>14</b> to its closed position. One of the limit switches <b>330</b> detects the closed position, changes state and provides a state feedback signal on a respective input <b>331</b> to the control <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Upon detecting the lid closed position, at <b>608</b>, the control <b>304</b> then, at <b>610</b>, provides a signal over an output <b>342</b> commanding the solenoid <b>341</b> to open the vacuum valve <b>140</b>. Simultaneously, at <b>612</b>, the control <b>304</b> establishes a pressure set point equal to PR<sub>PROCESS </sub>and initiates operation of a process pressure monitor. Normally, in a plasma treatment system, the chamber <b>12</b> is evacuated to a desired and fixed partial vacuum pressure prior to the start of a plasma processing cycle. However, the initial evacuation of the chamber <b>12</b> is a time consuming process. Applicants discovered that high quality plasma processing can be undertaken within a range of pressures above and below a normally used processing pressure within the chamber <b>12</b>. The permissible pressure range has been determined by processing many parts under different conditions within the chamber <b>12</b>. Thus, with the plasma treatment system of the present invention an upper pressure boundary limit, for example, 250 mTorr, is determined by adding an offset pressure, for example, 50 mTorr, to the normally used processing pressure, for example, 200 mTorr. Further, a lower pressure boundary limit, for example, 150 mTorr, is determined by subtracting the offset pressure, for example, 50 mTorr, from the normally used processing pressure, for example, 200 mTorr. In this example, the pressure monitor system establishes the normally used processing pressure of 200 mTorr as the pressure set point, but the pressure monitoring system will not set an alarm or otherwise impact the operation of the plasma treatment process as long as the pressure remains between the upper and lower boundary limits of 250 mTorr and 150 mTorr, respectively. Therefore, as long as the vacuum pump <b>144</b> is running, the control <b>304</b> is monitoring the input <b>348</b> which is providing a pressure feedback signal from the pressure gauge <b>52</b>. When the control <b>304</b> detects that the chamber <b>12</b> is evacuated to 250 mTorr, the gas plasma is started.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Simultaneously with starting the pressure monitor at <b>612</b>, the control <b>304</b>, at <b>614</b>, provides command signals over the outputs <b>344</b>, <b>346</b> to operate respective mass flow controllers <b>312</b> and isolation valves <b>314</b>. Process gas is introduced through process gas inlet port <b>190</b> at a predetermined flow rate, such as 5-100 standard cubic centimeters per minute (&#x201c;sccm&#x201d;) for Ar. The flow rate of gas provided by the mass flow controllers <b>312</b> and the pumping rate of the vacuum pump <b>144</b> are adjusted to provide a processing pressure suitable for plasma generation so that subsequent plasma processing may be sustained. Processing pressures within the chamber <b>12</b> are typically on the order of 50 to 1000 mTorr and preferably in the range of 125 to 250 mTorr. In contrast to prior systems, the processing chamber <b>12</b> is continuously evacuated simultaneously with the introduction of the process gases which are initially used to purge ambient air from the chamber <b>12</b>. In one embodiment, the mass flow controllers <b>312</b> are operated to provide a flow rate of 30 sccm to the processing chamber which has a volume of approximately 0.50 liters. Thus, fresh gases are exchanged within the processing chamber <b>12</b> approximately four times per second. More traditional plasma treatment systems exchange the gas in the processing chamber approximately once every five seconds. The higher gas flow rate of the system of the present invention improves the removal of etched materials and other contaminants from the processing chamber and also minimizes the deposition of etched materials on the walls and tooling within the chamber <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The control <b>304</b> continuously monitors the feedback signal on the input <b>348</b> from the pressure gauge <b>54</b> which is continuously measuring the pressure or partial vacuum within the processing chamber <b>12</b>. At <b>616</b>, the control <b>304</b> detects when the pressure in the processing chamber <b>12</b> is equal to an initial pressure, that is, the normally used processing pressure plus the offset pressure value, which, in the example above is 250 mTorr. The control then, at <b>618</b>, provides a command signal on an output <b>350</b> to turn on the RF power supply <b>318</b>. However, instead of providing full power from the RF power supply <b>318</b>, the control <b>304</b> commands the RF power supply to supply only a minimum power level, for example, 30 watts. Traditional plasma treatment systems initially apply full power to the processing chamber <b>12</b> via the tuning network <b>320</b>. Creating the gas plasma at full power often results in plasma spikes, electric arcs, energy hot spots, other anomalies and a very unstable gas plasma. Further, since changes in the gas plasma result in a different RF load in the processing chamber <b>12</b>, the unstable gas plasma makes it very difficult for the tuning network <b>320</b> to match the impedance of the RF system to a desired value. Consequently, by initially creating the gas plasma at full RF power, a substantial amount of time is consumed waiting for the plasma to stabilize within the processing chamber <b>12</b> and thereafter, operating the tuning network <b>320</b> until the desired impedance match is established. With the plasma treatment system of the present invention, initially applying a lower or minimum level of power, for example, 30 watts, to the system permits the plasma in the chamber <b>12</b> to stabilize very quickly when compared to traditional systems.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">After turning on the RF power supply <b>318</b> to the minimum power level, the control <b>304</b>, at <b>620</b>, executes a 200 millisecond delay. This delay period permits the plasma at the minimum power level to stabilize. Thereafter, at <b>622</b>, the control <b>304</b> initiates the operation of an automatic tuning cycle or autotune control by which the variable air capacitors are used to match the RF impedance of the output of the power supply <b>318</b> and the RF impedance of the input of the processing chamber <b>12</b> to a desired impedance, for example, 50 ohms. During that process, analog feedback signals from the phase magnitude controls <b>322</b>, <b>326</b> are provided on respective inputs <b>323</b>, <b>329</b> of the control <b>304</b>. The control executes a PID control loop and provides command signals on the outputs <b>328</b>, <b>329</b> to operate the respective motors <b>321</b>, <b>325</b> such that the variable air capacitors <b>320</b>, <b>324</b> provide the desired impedance match.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The control then, at <b>624</b>, determines whether the tuning network <b>320</b> has achieved the desired impedance match. When that occurs, the control <b>304</b>, at <b>626</b>, begins to ramp the power from its minimum level to a maximum level; and as the power is increased, the control, at <b>628</b>, continues to operate the tuning network <b>320</b> with each successive power level. Thus, as the control moves from its minimum power level to the maximum power level, the variable air capacitor <b>320</b> is continuously adjusted so that the impedance presented to the RF power supply <b>318</b> remains matched to the desired <b>50</b> ohm load. Applicants have discovered that by maintaining the impedance match while ramping the RF power up to the maximum level, a stabilized gas plasma is achieved at full power in less time than if the RF power supply <b>318</b> were initially turned on to its maximum power level and the impedance matching operation executed.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">It should be noted that as the power is ramping up to its maximum level, the process gases are flowing through the processing chamber <b>12</b> at their desired flow rates and the vacuum pump <b>144</b> is continuing to depressurize the processing chamber. As previously described, a range of operating pressure was determined by processing many workpieces using different process parameters. Using similar empirical methods, the maximum rate at which RF power can be increased while maintaining a tuned RF system was also determined; and that maximum rate of RF power increase provides a reduced plasma treatment cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">If the control <b>304</b>, at <b>630</b>, determines the RF power is not at its maximum level, the control, at <b>628</b>, again increments the power level and operates the tuning network <b>320</b> to match the impedance to the desired value. If, at <b>630</b>, the control <b>304</b> determines that the power is now at its maximum value, the control then, at <b>632</b>, begins monitoring for an endpoint of the plasma treatment cycle while the power remains at its maximum value and the plasma treatment process continues. During a plasma treatment operation, contaminant species sputtered from the surface of workpiece <b>56</b> will be evacuated from processing space <b>102</b> via exhaust port <b>136</b> along with the flowing stream of process gas. Plasma treatment system <b>10</b> is optimized to enhance both the spatial uniformity of plasma treatment and system throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The control <b>304</b>, at <b>634</b>, checks the state of the feedback signal on the input <b>352</b> from the end point detector <b>334</b> to determine whether the plasma processing cycle is complete. In the described embodiment, the endpoint of the processing cycle is determined by the endpoint detector <b>334</b> detecting a particular wavelength of light of the plasma and providing a signal representing such to the control <b>304</b>. As will be appreciated, by processing a large number of workpieces using different processing parameters, the amount of time required to process a workpiece can be determined. In an alternative embodiment, the control <b>304</b> can start an internal timer at the same time that the autotune control is started at <b>622</b>. The timer is set to the amount of time required to process a workpiece as was empirically determined. Therefore, when the internal timer expires indicating an end of the plasma processing cycle, the control at <b>304</b> detects the expiration of the timer as the endpoint of the plasma treatment cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Upon the control, at <b>634</b>, detecting a state of the end point feedback signal on the input <b>352</b> representing an end of the plasma treatment cycle, the control <b>304</b>, at <b>636</b>, provides a command signal on its output <b>350</b> to cause the RF power supply <b>318</b> to decrement or ramp down the RF power from its maximum level to its minimum level. Normally, the power is ramped down from its maximum level to its minimum level at the same rate and thus, over an identical time period, as is required to ramp the power up from its minimum level to its maximum level. Upon the control <b>304</b> detecting, at <b>638</b>, that the RF power supply <b>318</b> is providing power at the minimum level, the control <b>304</b> then, at <b>640</b>, the control <b>304</b> checks that the RF system is tuned at the minimum power level. Thereafter, at <b>642</b>, the control <b>304</b> turns off the autotune control and executes a 200 millisecond delay which permits the plasma at the minimum power level to stabilize.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Traditional plasma processing cycles simply turn the RF generator off at the end of a processing cycle, and the tuning network is in a state corresponding to a processing power output from the RF power supply. Hence, when the next cycle is started, which may be at a different power level, some time is required for the tuning network <b>320</b> to match the impedance. In contrast, with the present invention, at the end of a cycle, the tuning network is tuned to minimum power. Thus, at the start of the next processing cycle, when the RF power supply <b>318</b> is turned on to minimum power, the tuning network <b>320</b> is in a state such that, either, the desired impedance match already exists, or it can be quickly tuned to a match. Minimizing tuning of the RF system can result in cycle time savings of up to 15 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Next, the control <b>304</b>, at <b>644</b>, stops the operation of the pressure monitor <b>15</b> and provides command signals on the outputs <b>342</b> and <b>346</b> to cause respective solenoid valves <b>341</b> and <b>315</b> to close the respective vacuum valve <b>140</b> and isolation valves <b>314</b>. Further, the control <b>304</b> provides a command signal on output <b>344</b> to terminate the flowrate of gases through the appropriate mass flow controllers <b>312</b>. In addition, the control <b>304</b> provides a command signal over an output <b>356</b> to cause solenoid valve <b>357</b> to open the bleed valve <b>54</b>, thereby depressurizing the processing chamber <b>12</b>. At <b>646</b>, the control <b>304</b> determines that the pressure within the processing chamber <b>12</b> is substantially equal to atmospheric pressure. This determination is normally made by the control using an internal timer to measure a period of time required to depressurize the processing chamber <b>12</b> with the bleed valve <b>54</b>. Thereafter, at <b>648</b>, the control <b>304</b> provides a command signal on the output <b>337</b> causing the solenoid valve <b>338</b> to change state and reverse the operation of the lid actuator <b>122</b>. Thereafter, at <b>650</b>, the control <b>304</b> detects that the lid <b>14</b> is raised to its opened position and initiates a successive part transfer cycle <b>602</b>. The above process is then repeated for successive workpieces.</p>

The sidewall sections <b>404</b> and <b>408</b> and the domed ceiling section <b>406</b> are formed of a material that has a relatively high electrical conductivity, such as an aluminum or aluminum alloy. A compressible elastomeric O-ring seal <b>401</b> is provided between a circumferential upper rim of the medial sidewall section <b>408</b> and a circumferential lower rim of the upper domed section <b>406</b>.

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Provided in a dividing wall <b>406</b><i>a </i>of the domed ceiling section <b>406</b> separating plasma cavity <b>442</b> from a radio-frequency (RF) cavity <b>472</b> is a gas port <b>409</b>. The gas port <b>409</b> is configured with a gas fitting <b>411</b> that couples a plasma cavity <b>442</b> in fluid communication with a gas line <b>405</b> extending to a source <b>407</b> of a process gas. The gas fitting <b>411</b> is coupled with plasma cavity <b>442</b> by a gas distribution path including a process gas passageway <b>413</b>, a pair of process gas passageways <b>415</b><i>a,b </i>coupled with process gas passageway <b>413</b>, and multiple gas passageways <b>417</b> extending from gas passageways <b>415</b><i>a,b </i>so as to terminate proximate the upper planar surface of a ceramic insulator plate <b>416</b>. Any suitable process gas or process gas mixture may be provided that is capable of providing free radicals and other reactive species, when excited by RF energy to generate a plasma, appropriate to perform a downstream-type plasma treatment of workpieces <b>56</b>, as described herein. Typical process gases include O<sub>2</sub>, CF<sub>4</sub>, N<sub>2 </sub>and H<sub>2 </sub>and may be mixed with an inert gas, such as Ar, to provide a process gas mixture. A gas flow rate suitable for downstream-type plasma treatment in processing chamber <b>400</b> generally ranges from about 1 sccm to about 300 sccm and an appropriate pressure in plasma cavity <b>442</b> ranges from about 50 mTorr to about 1000 mTorr.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">A mass-flow-controlled flow of ambient air from the surrounding environment of processing chamber <b>400</b> may be used as a process gas and has been found to be particularly effective in certain applications for removal of surface contamination. Such a downstream-type plasma is expected to contain free radicals, including oxygen-based and nitrogen-based free radicals, derived from hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen and other primary constituents of air.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-12</figref>, the domed ceiling section <b>406</b> of chamber lid <b>402</b> is provided with a grounded plate <b>412</b> and a powered electrode <b>414</b> that defines a powered plane opposite and generally parallel to grounded plate <b>412</b>. The grounded plate <b>412</b> and the portions of the domed ceiling section <b>406</b> surrounding plasma cavity <b>442</b> collectively define a ground plane. A rectangular, planar ceramic electrode insulator <b>416</b> electrically isolates the powered electrode <b>414</b> from the domed ceiling section <b>406</b>, including grounded plate <b>412</b>. Plasma cavity <b>442</b> is defined in the domed ceiling section <b>406</b> as a volume enclosed between the grounded plate <b>412</b> and the powered electrode <b>414</b>. The grounded plate <b>412</b> and the powered electrode <b>414</b> are each formed of a material having a high electrical conductivity, such as aluminum or an aluminum alloy.</p>

The throughholes <b>421</b> allow the preferential transmission of free radicals, and other process gas species lacking a net charge, from a direct plasma created in plasma cavity <b>442</b> to the processing space <b>102</b> and prohibit or prevent the transfer of charged species, such as ions and electrons, from the direct plasma residing in plasma cavity <b>442</b> to processing space <b>102</b>. Typically, the grounded plate <b>412</b> is effective for removing a significant percentage of the charged species from the plasma admitted from plasma cavity <b>442</b> into the processing space <b>102</b>. The throughholes <b>421</b> may present tortuous paths having no line-of-sight paths from the plasma cavity <b>442</b> to the processing space <b>102</b>. The plasma in processing space <b>102</b> is a downstream-type plasma that is free, or substantially free, of charged particles for performing plasma treatments of the workpiece <b>56</b> by the chemical action of the radicals without the physical action otherwise provided by the charged particles.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The throughholes <b>421</b> may be arranged in an array or matrix or may be arranged with non-periodic center-to-center hole spacings. The areal density of throughholes <b>421</b> in the grounded plate <b>412</b> may range from about ten (10) holes per square inch to about two hundred (200) holes per square inch. The diameter of individual throughholes <b>421</b> may range from about 0.001 inches to about 0.125 inches.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, the chamber lid <b>402</b> may be reconfigured using other grounded plates, such as grounded plate <b>418</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) and grounded plate <b>420</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Grounded plates <b>418</b>, <b>420</b> are interchangeable with grounded plate <b>412</b> for varying the distribution or pattern of free radicals delivered from the direct plasma in plasma cavity <b>442</b> to processing space <b>102</b> and, ultimately, delivered to an exposed surface <b>56</b><i>a </i>of workpiece <b>56</b> supported on substrate support <b>64</b>. The throughholes <b>419</b> in grounded plates <b>418</b> and <b>420</b> differ in configuration, dimension and/or arrangement from grounded plate <b>412</b> for varying the spatial distribution of free radicals admitted from plasma cavity <b>442</b> into processing space <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Grounded plate <b>418</b> includes a plurality of throughholes <b>419</b> arranged inside the circular outer periphery of a disk-shaped hole pattern. Grounded plate <b>418</b> may be used, for example, to treat semiconductor wafers, such as 300 mm silicon wafers, with a downstream-type plasma. Grounded plate <b>420</b> includes two frame plates <b>422</b>, <b>424</b> having a rectangular central opening and a screen or grid <b>426</b> captured between frame plates <b>422</b>, <b>424</b> so as to partially occlude the central opening. The screen <b>426</b> is a fine wire mesh made from a material with relatively high electrical conductivity, such as aluminum or an aluminum alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The ability to select from among various grounded plates <b>412</b>, <b>418</b> and <b>420</b> permits tailoring of the geometrical pattern of radicals delivered from the plasma to the workpiece <b>56</b>. To that end, the hole pattern of throughholes, such as throughholes <b>421</b> of grounded plate <b>412</b>, can be adjusted to correspond to the geometry of the workpiece <b>56</b> being plasma treated with the downstream-type plasma. For example, the throughholes <b>421</b> in the grounded plate <b>412</b> can be arranged in a disk-shaped hole pattern for processing round workpieces, a square-shaped hole pattern for square workpieces, a rectangular hole pattern for rectangular workpieces, and other geometrical arrangements apparent to persons of ordinary skill in the art as necessary to correspond with the geometrical shape of the workpiece <b>56</b>. Typically, the throughholes <b>421</b> are positioned in the grounded plate <b>412</b> so that the peripheral extent of the hole pattern corresponds substantially to the outer peripheral rim or circumference of the workpiece <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-12</figref>, the chamber lid <b>402</b> further includes a radio-frequency (RF) bulkhead fitting <b>428</b>, a pair of ceramic caps <b>430</b><i>a,b</i>, a pair of annular ceramic spools <b>432</b><i>a,b</i>, a pair of power feedthroughs <b>434</b><i>a,b</i>, a power distribution bar <b>436</b>, and a radio-frequency (RF) lid closure element <b>438</b>. A radio-frequency (RF) power supply <b>439</b> is electrically coupled by a transmission line <b>440</b> with the RF bulkhead fitting <b>428</b>. The RF power supply <b>439</b> and the components of the chamber lid <b>402</b> collectively provide a plasma excitation source capable of exciting process gas in the plasma cavity <b>442</b> to generate a plasma. Power feedthroughs <b>434</b><i>a,b </i>transfer RF power from the RF bulkhead fitting <b>428</b> and power distribution bar <b>436</b> to the powered electrode <b>414</b>. The RF power supply <b>439</b> typically operates at a frequency between about 40 kHz and about 13.56 MHz, preferably about 13.56 MHz, and a power between about 0 watts and about 600 watts, typically about 50 watts to about 600 watts.</p>

Ceramic spools <b>432</b><i>a,b </i>also maintain a small gap in the vertical dimension between the ceramic insulator plate <b>416</b> and the dividing wall <b>406</b><i>a </i>so that gas flow can occur therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In use and with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-12</figref>, process gas enters the chamber lid <b>402</b> through the gas fitting <b>411</b> and is directed through gas passageways <b>413</b>, <b>415</b><i>a,b </i>to the multiple gas passageways <b>417</b> terminating on the upper side of the ceramic insulator plate <b>416</b>. The process gas flows or seeps around the periphery or perimeter of the powered electrode <b>414</b> and the ceramic insulator plate <b>416</b> so the flow of process gas is directed toward the outer edges of the domed ceiling section <b>406</b>. The process gas is attracted laterally by vacuum forces in the processing space <b>102</b> about the edges of the ceramic insulator plate <b>416</b> and toward the throughholes <b>421</b>, which promotes uniform process gas distribution in the plasma cavity <b>442</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The RF energy applied between the grounded plate <b>412</b> and the powered electrode <b>414</b> ignites and sustains a plasma from the process gas residing in plasma cavity <b>442</b>. The plasma in plasma cavity <b>442</b> is a full direct plasma containing ions, electrons, free radicals and molecular species. Because the flow of process gas in the plasma treatment system <b>10</b> is generally conducted toward exhaust port <b>136</b> in bottom wall <b>44</b>, the various components of the direct plasma in plasma cavity <b>442</b> will be attracted by a suction or vacuum force toward the throughholes <b>421</b> of grounded plate <b>412</b>. The electrons and ions have a tendency to recombine inside throughholes <b>421</b> because grounded plate <b>412</b> is grounded relative to earth ground. As a result, the ions and electrons are significantly less likely to enter processing space <b>102</b>. The grounded plate <b>412</b> permits plasma species lacking a net charge, such as free radicals and neutral molecules, to be transported through throughholes <b>421</b> into the processing space <b>102</b>. Typically, the grounded plate <b>412</b> is effective for removing substantially all of the charged species from the plasma transferred or admitted from plasma cavity <b>442</b> into the processing space <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The vacuum or the pumping action of vacuum pump <b>144</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) urges the free radicals and neutral molecules toward the workpiece <b>56</b> to perform the downstream-type plasma treatment. The workpiece <b>56</b> to be treated with the downstream-type plasma is supported by the side rails <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b </i>of substrate support <b>64</b>. Free radicals admitted into processing space <b>102</b> contact with the exposed surface <b>56</b><i>a </i>of workpiece <b>56</b> and react chemically with the material forming the workpiece <b>56</b> to perform the surface treatment. Excess free radicals, unreactive process gas molecules, and contaminants removed from the workpiece <b>56</b> are exhausted from the processing space <b>102</b> by the pumping action of vacuum pump <b>144</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Chamber lid <b>402</b> provides the plasma processing system <b>10</b> with various different capabilities in addition to the ability to generate a downstream-type plasma for surface treatments. Because the grounded plate <b>412</b> provides a ground plane, substrate support <b>64</b> may be energized by RF generator <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to generate a direct plasma in processing space <b>102</b>. It follows that a plasma treatment system, such as plasma treatment system <b>10</b>, which is equipped with chamber lid <b>402</b>, may be used to selectively plasma treat workpieces <b>56</b> with either a direct plasma or a downstream-type plasma, as required by the process, so that both capabilities are available in a single system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In an alternative mode of operation, the plasma treatment system <b>10</b> can be configured to provide an inverted direct plasma by removing the grounded plate <b>412</b>, grounding the substrate support <b>64</b> to earth ground, and energizing the powered electrode <b>414</b> to generate a direct plasma in processing space <b>102</b> and plasma cavity <b>442</b>. With the grounded plate <b>412</b> removed, the chamber configuration changes so that the powered plane is provided by powered electrode <b>414</b> and the ground plane is provided by the substrate support <b>64</b>. The inverted direct plasma configuration reduces the process time, under certain circumstances, for improving the plasma treatment of the upper exposed surface <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the workpiece <b>56</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In another mode of operation, the plasma treatment system <b>10</b> can be configured to power the powered electrode <b>414</b> with the grounded plate <b>412</b> removed and, in addition, to energize the substrate support <b>64</b>, as described herein. In this mode of operation, the RF power provided by RF power supply <b>439</b> to electrode <b>414</b> is driven 180 degrees out of phase relative to the RF power provided by generator <b>302</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to the substrate support <b>64</b>. As a result, the voltage potential providing the driving force for ionizing the process gas in processing space <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) is effectively doubled for an equivalent overall amount of RF power. One potential benefit of this mode of operation is that the RF power applied to substrate support <b>64</b> is reduced due to the direct plasma electrons and ions supplied when the powered electrode <b>414</b> is energized.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In yet another mode of operation, the plasma treatment system <b>10</b> can be configured to power the powered electrode <b>414</b> with the grounded plate <b>412</b> installed and, in addition, to energize the substrate support <b>64</b>, as described herein. In this operational mode, the workpiece <b>56</b> will be exposed to direct plasma generated in the processing space <b>102</b> infused with free radicals from the direct plasma in plasma cavity <b>442</b> admitted after filtering of charged particles by grounded plate <b>412</b> into processing space <b>102</b>. According to the principles of the invention, the process gas flowing from process gas source <b>407</b> into the plasma cavity <b>442</b> may differ from the process gas flowing directly into processing space <b>102</b> from an independent process gas source (not shown) so that the free radicals transferred to the processing space <b>102</b> through the grounded plate <b>412</b> from plasma cavity <b>442</b> differ from the species in the direct plasma generated in processing space <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">According to the principles of the invention and with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-12</figref>, medial sidewall section <b>408</b> is operative for increasing the chamber dimension of the chamber lid <b>402</b> in the vertical direction. The chamber dimension in the vertical direction may be reduced by removing the medial sidewall section <b>408</b> from the chamber lid <b>402</b>. Additional medial sidewall sections <b>408</b> may be added or stacked between the original medial sidewall section <b>408</b> to further increase the height of the chamber lid <b>402</b> and to further expand the chamber dimension in the vertical direction. It is further contemplated by the invention that the vertical dimension of the chamber lid <b>402</b> may be varied in any of multiple different manners, such as by constructing the medial sidewall section <b>408</b> as an expandable vacuum bellows. The lower sidewall section <b>404</b> and a domed ceiling section <b>406</b> are always present in the assembly forming chamber lid <b>402</b> and, when assembled in the absence of the medial sidewall section <b>408</b>, the dimensions of sections <b>404</b> and <b>406</b> define a minimum separation between the powered electrode <b>414</b> and the exposed surface <b>56</b><i>a </i>of workpiece <b>56</b> confronting the powered electrode <b>414</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The medial sidewall section <b>408</b> is removably mounted to the lower sidewall section <b>404</b>. Guides <b>444</b> are provided to aid in positioning the medial sidewall section <b>408</b> relative to the lower sidewall section <b>404</b> during installation. Similarly, guides <b>444</b> aid the positioning of domed ceiling section <b>406</b> relative to the medial sidewall section <b>408</b> during installation. Guides <b>444</b> may also be used for positioning the domed ceiling section <b>406</b> relative to the lower sidewall section <b>404</b> if the medial sidewall section <b>408</b> is removed from the assembly. Fasteners <b>448</b> are utilized for securing the medial sidewall section <b>408</b> with the lower sidewall section <b>404</b> and for applying a compression force to O-ring <b>403</b> to create a vacuum-tight seal. Similarly, fasteners <b>450</b> are utilized for securing the domed ceiling section <b>406</b> with the medial sidewall section <b>408</b> and for applying a compression force to O-ring <b>401</b> to create a vacuum-tight seal.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The ability to vary the chamber dimension of processing chamber <b>400</b> in the vertical direction by inserting and removing one or more of the medial sidewall sections <b>408</b> permits the plasma treatment system <b>10</b> to accommodate workpieces <b>56</b> of differing thickness. Specifically, a reproducible or predictable distance or separation can be maintained between the powered electrode <b>414</b> and the exposed surface <b>56</b><i>a </i>of the workpiece <b>56</b> held by the substrate support <b>64</b>. To that end, the vertical dimension of each medial sidewall section <b>408</b> may be selected to provide a desired separation between powered electrode <b>414</b> and exposed surface <b>56</b><i>a</i>. For example, configuring the chamber lid <b>402</b> with two one-inch thick medial sidewall sections <b>408</b> will separate the exposed surface <b>56</b><i>a </i>of a two-inch thick workpiece <b>56</b> from powered electrode <b>414</b> by the same distance as a one-inch thick workpiece <b>56</b> in a process chamber configuration in which the chamber lid <b>402</b> has a single one-inch medial sidewall section <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The separation between the treated surface of the workpiece <b>56</b> and the powered electrode <b>414</b> is a fundamental variable that must be controlled for effective plasma treatment with either a direct plasma or a downstream-type plasma in which the treatment uniformity is adequate.

The powered electrode <b>514</b> defines a powered plane in the plasma cavity <b>542</b> that is opposite and generally parallel to the grounded plate <b>512</b>. The grounded plate <b>512</b> has a good electrical contact with sidewall <b>501</b> that electrically grounds grounded plate <b>512</b> as the chamber lid <b>502</b> is grounded. The grounded plate <b>512</b> and the portions of the domed ceiling section <b>504</b> surrounding plasma cavity <b>542</b> collectively define a ground plane.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref>, grounded plate <b>512</b> is an assembly that includes an upper slotted plate <b>516</b>, a center slotted plate <b>518</b>, and a lower slotted plate <b>520</b>. The plates <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, and <b>520</b> are of substantially equal thickness, although the invention is not so limited. The upper slotted plate <b>516</b> is perforated with multiple openings or slots <b>522</b> having a major axis extending transversely to a machine direction, into and out of the plane of the page of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, in which workpieces <b>56</b> are transported from loading station <b>20</b> to substrate support <b>64</b> and from substrate support <b>64</b> to exit station <b>22</b>. Similarly, the center and lower slotted plates <b>518</b>, <b>520</b> are each perforated with multiple openings or slots <b>524</b>, <b>526</b>, respectively, each having a major axis extending transversely to the machine direction for workpiece transport. The cross-sectional profile of each of the slots <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>, <b>526</b>, when viewed vertically, may be any shape having a major axis aligned transverse to the machine direction and, in particular, may be either rectangular or oval.</p>

The slots <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>, and <b>526</b> permit a fluid flow of process gas and radicals from the plasma cavity <b>542</b> to the processing space <b>102</b>, but present a tortuous or labyrinthine path that substantially eliminates all line-of-sight paths from the processing space <b>102</b> to the plasma cavity <b>542</b> in cooperation with the relative inter-plate spacings between slotted plates <b>516</b> and <b>518</b> and between slotted plates <b>518</b> and <b>520</b>. The elimination of line-of-sight paths prevents light, typically in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, generated by the direct plasma in plasma cavity <b>542</b>, from entering the processing space <b>102</b>, other than light redirected by reflection.</p>

Similarly, lower slotted plate <b>520</b> is spaced from the center slotted plate <b>518</b> by a plurality of, for example, four peripherally-arranged spacers <b>551</b> that provide a good electrical contact between plates <b>518</b> and <b>520</b>. Spacers <b>550</b> are dimensioned for separating plates <b>516</b> and <b>518</b> by a uniform gap and, similarly, spacers <b>551</b> are dimensioned for separating plates <b>518</b> and <b>520</b> by a uniform gap that may differ from the gap between plates <b>516</b> and <b>518</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">It is contemplated by the invention that the slots <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> and <b>526</b> may have any relative spatial arrangement that, in cooperation with the inter-plate spacings, eliminates, prohibits, or at least substantially reduces, line-of-sight paths between the plasma cavity <b>542</b> and the processing space <b>102</b>. The invention also contemplates that the slots <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>, <b>526</b> may have a configuration, dimension, and/or arrangement compliant with the geometrical shape of the workpiece <b>56</b>. In one embodiment, the slots <b>522</b>, <b>524</b> and <b>526</b> are rectangular in cross-sectional profile viewed in a direction extending between processing space <b>102</b> and plasma cavity <b>542</b> and have a dimension along their major axis of approximately two (2) inches, a dimension along their minor axis of approximately 3/16 inches, a spacing between adjacent slots of about 3/32 inches, and the slots <b>524</b> are offset from slots <b>522</b> and slots <b>526</b> by 3/16 inches. The upper and center plates <b>516</b> and <b>518</b> are separated by a distance approximately equal to the plate thickness and the center and lower plates <b>518</b> and <b>520</b> are separated by a distance approximately equal to 1.5 times the plate thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The grounded plate <b>512</b> prohibits the transfer of charged species, including ions and electrons, from the direct plasma in the plasma cavity <b>542</b> to the processing space <b>102</b> and allows the transfer of free radicals, and other process gas species lacking a net charge, from the plasma cavity <b>542</b> to the processing space <b>102</b>. Specifically, the charged species are captured by the material of the slotted plates <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, <b>520</b> surrounding the slots <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>, <b>526</b>, respectively, which are grounded. The pumping action of vacuum pump <b>144</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) attracts the free radicals and neutral molecules through the slots <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>, <b>526</b> from plasma cavity <b>542</b> into the processing space <b>102</b> and toward the workpiece <b>56</b> to perform the downstream-type plasma treatment. The plasma in processing space <b>102</b> is a downstream-type plasma that is free, or substantially free, of charged particles and light for performing plasma treatments of the workpiece <b>56</b> by the chemical action of the radicals without the physical action otherwise provided by the charged particles. Typically, the grounded plate <b>512</b> is effective for removing substantially all of the charged species from the portion of the direct plasma transferred or admitted from plasma cavity <b>542</b> into the processing space <b>102</b>.

<p id="p-0133" num="0132">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref>, the chamber lid <b>502</b> further includes a radio-frequency (RF) bulkhead fitting <b>528</b>, a pair of electrically-insulating caps <b>530</b><i>a,b</i>, a pair of dielectric spools <b>532</b><i>a,b</i>, a pair of power feedthroughs <b>534</b><i>a,b</i>, a power distribution bar <b>536</b>, a removable radio-frequency (RF) lid closure element <b>538</b> that affords access to RF chamber <b>543</b>, and a pair of annular ceramic spacers <b>540</b><i>a,b</i>. A radio-frequency (RF) power supply <b>539</b> is electrically coupled by a transmission line <b>540</b> with the RF bulkhead fitting <b>528</b>. The RF power supply <b>539</b> and the components of the chamber lid <b>502</b> collectively provide a plasma excitation source capable of exciting process gas in the plasma cavity <b>542</b> to generate a plasma.

<p id="p-0135" num="0134">With continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref>, the powered electrode <b>514</b> is positioned within the plasma cavity <b>542</b> such that its planar upper surface <b>514</b><i>a</i>, planar lower surface <b>514</b><i>b </i>and side edge <b>514</b><i>c </i>are positioned substantially equidistantly from adjacent surrounding surfaces of the domed ceiling section <b>504</b> and the grounded plate <b>512</b> that are electrically grounded. Specifically, upper surface <b>514</b><i>a </i>is separated vertically from, and in a generally parallel relationship with, a downwardly-facing planar surface <b>546</b><i>a </i>of gas distribution baffle <b>546</b> by approximately the same distance that lower surface <b>514</b><i>b </i>is separated from an upwardly-facing planar surface <b>516</b><i>a </i>of the upper slotted plate <b>516</b>. The surfaces <b>514</b><i>b </i>and <b>516</b><i>a </i>have a generally parallel relationship. In addition, the transverse distance between the side surface <b>514</b><i>c </i>and adjacent portions of an inwardly-facing surface <b>501</b><i>a </i>of side wall <b>501</b> is approximately equal to the separations between surfaces <b>514</b><i>a </i>and <b>546</b><i>a </i>and surfaces <b>514</b><i>b </i>and <b>516</b><i>a</i>. It follows that the powered electrode <b>514</b> is symmetrically positioned relative to and equidistant from surfaces <b>501</b><i>a</i>, <b>546</b><i>a </i>and <b>516</b><i>a</i>. In one specific embodiment that provides a particularly uniform plasma in plasma cavity <b>542</b> and, consequently, a particularly uniform downstream-type plasma in processing space <b>102</b>, the separations between the powered electrode <b>514</b> and surfaces <b>501</b><i>a</i>, <b>546</b><i>a </i>and <b>516</b><i>a </i>are each approximately one (1) inch. The equidistant spacing and the magnitude of the spacing cooperate to permit application of full power, without ramping, from RF power supply <b>539</b> to the powered electrode <b>514</b> without inducing plasma spikes, arcing, energy hot spots, or plasma instability.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">In use and with continued reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref>, process gas enters the chamber lid <b>502</b> through the gas port <b>509</b> and is directed through gas passageways <b>513</b> to the upper side of gas distribution baffle <b>546</b>. Gas flows from the upper side of gas distribution baffle <b>546</b> through gas outlets <b>517</b> into the plasma cavity <b>542</b>, which promotes uniform process gas distribution in the plasma cavity <b>542</b>. The RF energy applied between the grounded plate <b>512</b> and the powered electrode <b>514</b> ignites and sustains a plasma from the process gas residing in plasma cavity <b>542</b>. The plasma in plasma cavity <b>542</b> is a full direct plasma containing ions, electrons, free radicals and molecular species. Because the flow of process gas in the plasma treatment system <b>10</b> is generally conducted toward exhaust port <b>136</b> in bottom wall <b>44</b>, the various components of the direct plasma in plasma cavity <b>542</b> will be attracted by a suction or vacuum force toward the slotted plates <b>516</b>, <b>518</b>, and <b>520</b> that collectively constitute the grounded plate <b>512</b>. Charged species, such as electrons and ions, recombine inside slots <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>, and <b>526</b> because grounded plate <b>512</b> is grounded relative to earth ground. As a result, ions and electrons are significantly less likely to enter processing space <b>102</b>. The grounded plate <b>512</b> permits plasma species lacking a net charge, such as free radicals and neutral molecules of process gas, to be transported through slots <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>, and <b>526</b> into the processing space <b>102</b>. The relative arrangement of slots <b>522</b>, <b>524</b>, and <b>526</b> and the spatial relationship between the upper and center slotted plates <b>516</b>, <b>518</b> and the center and lower slotted plates <b>518</b>, <b>520</b> eliminates, or substantially eliminates, line-of-sight paths from the plasma cavity <b>542</b> to the processing space <b>102</b> so that light generated by the direct plasma in the plasma cavity <b>542</b> is not visible in processing space <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The vacuum or the pumping action of vacuum pump <b>144</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) urges the free radicals and neutral molecules toward the workpiece <b>56</b> to perform the downstream-type plasma treatment. The workpiece <b>56</b> to be treated with the downstream-type plasma is supported by the side rails <b>66</b><i>a</i>, <b>66</b><i>b </i>of substrate support <b>64</b>. Free radicals admitted into processing space <b>102</b> contact with the exposed surface <b>56</b><i>a </i>of workpiece <b>56</b> and react chemically with the material forming the workpiece <b>56</b> or contamination covering the exposed surface <b>56</b><i>a </i>to perform the surface treatment.
