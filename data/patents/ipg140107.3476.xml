<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a driving apparatus and, more particularly, to a driving apparatus for switching energization of a coil in accordance with an output from a detection unit for detecting a magnetic pole of a rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. H09-331666 (corresponding to U.S. Pat. No. 5,831,356) discloses such a technique that a sensor as a Hall device (hereinbelow, abbreviated to &#x201c;sensor&#x201d;) is provided for a stepper motor (hereinbelow, abbreviated to &#x201c;motor&#x201d;) to detect a rotational position of a rotor magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to such a technique, together with an ordinary step driving, a feed back driving for switching energization of a coil at proper timing according to a desired speed or load can be performed. Thus, the motor can be used in a wide speed region from a low speed region to a high speed region and, at the same time, a high output torque can be attained.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a diagram for describing an example of controlling an energization switching timing of each coil on the basis of sensor outputs in a motor having two sensors and coils for two phases. Such energization switching timing control can be achieved by, for example, a motor driving circuit (not shown). A description will be made hereinbelow on the assumption that the two sensors are an A sensor and a B sensor and the coils for two phases are an A-phase coil and a B-phase coil. When it is detected that an output of the A sensor has changed from a Low level (hereinbelow, abbreviated to &#x201c;L&#x201d;) to a High level (hereinbelow, abbreviated to &#x201c;H&#x201d;) at timing denoted by T<b>1</b> in the diagram, the A-phase coil is subsequently energized in a + direction at timing denoted by T<b>2</b> in the diagram, which is reached after the elapse of a preset time Ta<b>1</b>. After that, when it is detected that an output of the B sensor has changed from L to H at timing denoted by T<b>3</b> in the diagram, the B-phase coil is subsequently energized in the + direction at timing denoted by T<b>4</b> in the diagram which is reached after the elapse of a preset time Tb<b>1</b>. After that, such control that times (Ta<b>2</b>&#x2dc;Ta<b>4</b>) and (Tb<b>2</b>&#x2dc;Tb<b>4</b>) which are required until the energization switching of the coil is performed after an H/L inversion of the sensor happened are increased or decreased or are held to be constant is continuously made. According to this, it is possible to cause the motor to rotate acceleratedly, deacceleratedly, or at a constant speed against a rapid load change.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail in accordance with the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">First, the fact that an output voltage of a sensor fluctuates depending on a switching of energization of a coil will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a side elevational view of a motor illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and a casing member, coils, and wiring members for energizing the coils are omitted therein. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an A-phase yoke <b>1</b> is arranged such that a magnetic pole is excited by energizing the A-phase yoke and a B-phase yoke <b>2</b> is arranged such that a magnetic pole is excited by energizing the B-phase yoke. A north pole and a south pole are magnetized alternately on a peripheral surface of a rotor magnet <b>4</b>. The rotor magnet <b>4</b> and a rotational axis <b>3</b> are integrated. A sensor <b>5</b> is arranged so as to face the peripheral surface of the rotor magnet <b>4</b> and detects a rotation of the rotor magnet <b>4</b>. When the motor is miniaturized, the sensor <b>5</b> is arranged in close vicinity to the A-phase yoke <b>1</b> and the B-phase yoke <b>2</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Thus, an output voltage of the sensor <b>5</b> fluctuates by magnetic fields generated at the A-phase yoke <b>1</b> and the B-phase yoke <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Although a rectangular wave obtained by binarizing the output voltage of the sensor is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, since a Hall device which is used as a sensor <b>5</b> has an output voltage which varies in an analog manner, the analog-like output voltage is binarized by a binarization circuit. Each curve in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a change in the output voltage of the sensor <b>5</b>, in which an axis of abscissa indicates a time and an axis of ordinate indicates the output voltage. A curve shown by an alternate long and short dash line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> indicates an output voltage variation of the sensor <b>5</b> in a case where the rotor magnet <b>4</b> is rotated without being affected by the magnetic fields generated at the A-phase yoke <b>1</b> and the B-phase yoke <b>2</b>. The binarized rectangular wave in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a wave obtained by binarizing such an analog-like output voltage by using a reference voltage (not shown) as a threshold value.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A curve shown by a broken line to which a notation &#x201c;A+B+&#x201d; is allocated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> indicates an output voltage variation of the sensor <b>5</b> in a case where the A-phase coil and the B-phase coil are energized in the + (plus) direction, respectively. A curve shown by a broken line to which a notation &#x201c;A&#x2212;B+&#x201d; is allocated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> indicates an output voltage variation of the sensor <b>5</b> in a case where the A-phase coil is energized in the &#x2212; (minus) direction and the B-phase coil is energized in the + (plus) direction, respectively. A curve shown by a broken line to which a notation &#x201c;A+B&#x2212;&#x201d; is allocated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> indicates an output voltage variation of the sensor <b>5</b> in a case where the A-phase coil is energized in the + direction and the B-phase coil is energized in the &#x2212; direction, respectively.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, when the A-phase coil and the B-phase coil are energized in the same direction, the output voltage of the sensor <b>5</b> is largely affected. That is, when the A-phase coil and the B-phase coil are energized to A+B+, the output voltage largely fluctuates to the plus side. When they are energized to A&#x2212;B&#x2212;, the output voltage fluctuates largely to the minus side. Since the output voltage is more largely affected by the A-phase yoke <b>1</b> arranged at the position which is closer to the sensor <b>5</b>, when they are excited to A+B&#x2212;, the output voltage fluctuates slightly to the plus side and when they are excited to A&#x2212;B+, the output voltage fluctuates slightly to the minus side. In this manner, the direction and magnitude of the fluctuation of the output voltage of the sensor <b>5</b> differ depending on a combination of the energization directions of the A-phase coil and the B-phase coil and there are four kinds of fluctuation as shown by the broken lines illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the actual motor, since the rotor magnet is rotated while continuously switching the four combinations of excitation of the yokes, the actual output voltage of the sensor fluctuates continuously in four different manners depending on the influence of the excitation of the yokes. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a diagram for describing the output voltage fluctuation of the sensor <b>5</b> at the time when the motor is driven. In a manner similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a curve shown in an upper portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> by an alternate long and short dash line indicates the output voltage of the sensor <b>5</b> in a case where the rotor magnet <b>4</b> is rotated without being affected by the magnetic fields generated at the A-phase yoke <b>1</b> and the B-phase yoke <b>2</b>, and it is the ideal output voltage showing the correct rotational position of the rotor magnet <b>4</b>. Total four dotted lines illustrated on the plus side and the minus side of the ideal output voltage indicate the fluctuated output voltages of the sensor <b>5</b> in a case where the A-phase coil and the B-phase coil are energized to A+B+, A+B&#x2212;, A&#x2212;B+, and A&#x2212;B&#x2212;, respectively, in a manner similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The reasons why the output voltage fluctuates are as mentioned above. Further, two rectangular waves illustrated in the middle portion in the diagram indicate the energization switching of the A-phase coil and the B-phase coil, respectively. In the diagram, they are energized to A+B&#x2212;, A&#x2212;B&#x2212;, A&#x2212;B+, and A+B+ in time ranges denoted respectively by T<b>1</b>, T<b>2</b>, T<b>3</b>, and T<b>4</b> in the diagram.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Thus, the actual output voltage of the sensor changes as shown by a solid line in an upper portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. That is, in the time range denoted by T<b>1</b> in the diagram when the A-phase coil and the B-phase coil are energized to A+B&#x2212;, the output voltage fluctuates slightly from the ideal output voltage to the plus side as shown by the dotted line. However, in the time range denoted by T<b>2</b> in the diagram when they are energized to A&#x2212;B&#x2212;, the output voltage fluctuates largely from the ideal output voltage to the minus side as shown by the dotted line. Similarly, in the time range denoted by T<b>3</b> in the diagram, the output voltage fluctuates slightly from the ideal output voltage to the minus side as shown by the dotted line. In the time range denoted by T<b>4</b> in the diagram, the output voltage fluctuates largely from the ideal output voltage to the plus side as shown by the dotted line. In this manner, the output voltage of the sensor <b>5</b> always fluctuates depending on the combinations of the energization directions of the coils and the ideal output voltage shown by an alternate long and short dash line is not output. After that, for simplicity of description, a curve shown in an upper portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> by an alternate long and short dash line indicates the output voltage of the sensor <b>5</b> in a case where the rotor magnet <b>4</b> is rotated without being affected by the magnetic fields generated at the A-phase yoke <b>1</b> and the B-phase yoke <b>2</b>, and this output voltage is expressed by &#x201c;ideal output voltage (alternate long and short dash line)&#x201d;. A curve shown in an upper portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> by a dotted line indicates the output voltage of the sensor <b>5</b> which fluctuates in four different manners in a case where the rotor magnet <b>4</b> is rotated with being affected by the magnetic fields generated at the A-phase yoke <b>1</b> and the B-phase yoke <b>2</b>, and this output voltage is expressed by &#x201c;fluctuated output voltage (dotted line)&#x201d;. Further, a curve shown in an upper portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> by a solid line indicates the actual output voltage of the sensor <b>5</b> which is output while it is switched to one of the four fluctuated output voltages (dotted lines) in accordance with the switching of the energization of the A-phase coil and the B-phase coil, and this output voltage is expressed by &#x201c;actual output voltage (solid line)&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As described above, the sensor <b>5</b> outputs only the actual output voltage (solid line) instead of the ideal output voltage (alternate long and short dash line). Therefore, as illustrated in a lower portion in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, when the ideal output voltage (alternate long and short dash line) is binarized, it becomes a rectangular wave shown by an alternate long and short dash line in the diagram. However, when the actual output voltage (solid line) is binarized, it becomes a rectangular wave shown by a solid line in the diagram. Thus, the correct rotational position of the rotor magnet cannot be obtained and the proper driving control cannot be attained in this state.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described hereinbelow with reference to the accompanying drawings. Although an example in the case where the invention is applied to the motor illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> will be described hereinbelow, the invention is not limited to it. Naturally, the invention can be also applied to another motor having the above-described problem of the related art, which lies in relationship between the position detection of the rotor magnet and the excitation timing of the yoke. That is, the present invention is an invention which can be used in the driving apparatus having the detection unit for detecting the rotational position of the rotor magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">First Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram of the driving apparatus according to the first embodiment. The driving apparatus of the first embodiment is constructed by a motor <b>101</b> and a motor control circuit <b>110</b> for controlling the motor <b>101</b>. The motor <b>101</b> in the embodiment is a stepper motor and can be applied to, for example, a motor for driving a zoom lens of an image pickup apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The motor <b>101</b> is constructed by a rotor <b>103</b>, an A-phase coil <b>104</b><i>a </i>(first coil), a B-phase coil <b>104</b><i>b </i>(second coil), an A sensor <b>105</b><i>a</i>, and a B sensor <b>105</b><i>b</i>. A cylindrical magnet <b>102</b> is fixed to the rotor <b>103</b>. Different magnetic poles (a north pole and a south pole) are alternately magnetized on a peripheral surface of the magnet <b>102</b> in a circumferential direction. As each of the A sensor <b>105</b><i>a </i>and the B sensor <b>105</b><i>b</i>, a Hall device whose output voltage changes in an analog manner depending on a magnetic flux which passes through the Hall device is used. The A sensor <b>105</b><i>a </i>and the B sensor <b>105</b><i>b </i>are arranged oppositely to the north and south poles magnetized on the peripheral surface of the magnet <b>102</b>, so that a rotation of the rotor <b>103</b> induces an analogue variation of the output voltages of the sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">That is, the A sensor <b>105</b><i>a </i>functions as a first detection unit for alternately detecting the magnetic poles (the north pole and the south pole) of the rotor <b>103</b> and outputting a signal when the rotor <b>103</b> is rotated. The B sensor <b>105</b><i>b </i>functions as a second detection unit for alternately detecting the magnetic poles (the north pole and the south pole) of the rotor <b>103</b> and outputting a signal of a phase different from that of the signal which is output from the A sensor <b>105</b><i>a </i>when the rotor <b>103</b> is rotated. The motor control circuit <b>110</b> is constructed by a detection unit <b>106</b>, a time measurement unit <b>107</b>, and an energization control unit <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The detection unit <b>106</b> binarizes the analog-like voltage signals which are output from the A sensor <b>105</b><i>a </i>and the B sensor <b>105</b><i>b </i>into two values H and L and outputs rectangular waves, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The time measurement unit <b>107</b> measures a time which is required from after the rectangular wave which is output from the detection unit <b>106</b> is H/L inverted until an H/L inversion happens.

The A timer measures and outputs a time A which is required from after the rectangular wave of the A sensor <b>105</b><i>a </i>is H/L inverted until an H/L inversion happens. The B timer measures and outputs a time B which is required from after the rectangular wave of the B sensor <b>105</b><i>b </i>is H/L inverted until an H/L inversion happens.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">That is, the time measurement unit <b>107</b> functions as a time measurement unit for measuring a time, as a first time, which is required from after the A sensor <b>105</b><i>a </i>detects the first magnetic pole of the rotor <b>103</b> until the A sensor <b>105</b><i>a </i>detects a second magnetic pole (for example, a south pole) different from a first magnetic pole (for example, a north pole) of the rotor <b>103</b>. The time measurement unit <b>107</b> also functions as a time measurement unit for measuring a time, as a second time, which is required from after the B sensor <b>105</b><i>b </i>detects the first magnetic pole (for example, the north pole) until the B sensor <b>105</b><i>b </i>detects the second magnetic pole (for example, the south pole).</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The energization control unit <b>108</b> controls energization switching timing of the A-phase coil <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the B-phase coil <b>104</b><i>b </i>on the basis of the elapse times (from the H/L inversion of the A sensor <b>105</b><i>a </i>and the B sensor <b>105</b><i>b</i>) which are measured by the time measurement unit <b>107</b>. The energization control unit <b>108</b> has a determination unit <b>108</b><i>a </i>for discriminating whether or not the H/L inversion has happened in the A sensor <b>105</b><i>a </i>or the B sensor <b>105</b><i>b </i>substantially at the same time as the energization switching of the A-phase coil <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the B-phase coil <b>104</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A correction value output unit <b>109</b> has a memory.

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">That is, the energization control unit <b>108</b> corrects the differences between the outputs from the sensors <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>obtained when the coils <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>are not energized and the outputs from the sensors <b>105</b><i>a </i>and <b>105</b><i>b </i>obtained when the coils <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>are energized.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> are diagrams enlargedly illustrating the output voltages of the sensors in a boundary portion (denoted by P in the diagram) between the time range denoted by T<b>3</b> and the time range denoted by T<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Meanings of an alternate long and short dash line, a dotted line, and a solid line are similar to those described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. However, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a diagram in a case where the actual output voltage (solid line) occurs in the time range denoted by T<b>3</b> where a threshold value becomes the reference voltage (hereinbelow, abbreviated to &#x201c;zero-crossing&#x201d;). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a diagram in a case where the actual output voltage (solid line) occurs in the time range denoted by T<b>4</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, each of notations Pa and Pb indicates an occurrence point of the zero-crossing of the actual output voltage (solid line), and a notation Q indicates an occurrence point of the zero-crossing of the ideal output voltage (alternate long and short dash line). Since &#x394;Ta as a difference between Q and Pa illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> and &#x394;Tb as a difference between Q and Pb illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> are equal to fixed values, they have previously been stored in the memory of the correction value output unit <b>109</b>. The correction value output unit <b>109</b> outputs the correction values &#x394;Ta and &#x394;Tb to the energization control unit <b>108</b>. Thus, the energization control unit <b>108</b> can indirectly obtain the timing of Q by making time correction of &#x394;Ta and &#x394;Tb to the timings of Pa and Pb and can obtain the correct rotational position of the rotor magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">When the zero-crossing occurs in the time range denoted by T<b>4</b> in the diagram as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a time obtained by adding &#x394;Ta to the time Pa of the zero-crossing of the actual output voltage (solid line) is regarded as a time Q of the zero-crossing of the ideal output voltage (alternate long and short dash line). The energization switching timing of the A-phase coil <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the B-phase coil <b>104</b><i>b </i>is controlled on the basis of the time obtained by adding &#x394;Ta to the time Pa of the zero-crossing of the actual output voltage (solid line).

The energization switching timing of the A-phase coil <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the B-phase coil <b>104</b><i>b </i>is controlled on the basis of the time obtained by subtracting &#x394;Tb from the time Pb of the zero-crossing of the actual output voltage (solid line).</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram enlargedly illustrating the output voltages of the sensors in the boundary portion between the time range denoted by T<b>3</b> and the time range denoted by T<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> in a manner similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. Meanings of an alternate long and short dash line, a dotted line, and a solid line are similar to those described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref>, <b>4</b>A, and <b>4</b>B. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a notation Pc indicates an occurrence point of the zero-crossing of the actual output voltage (solid line) and a notation Q indicates an occurrence point of the zero-crossing of the ideal output voltage (alternate long and short dash line). A notation Pa indicates an occurrence point of the zero-crossing in a case where the time ranges T<b>3</b> and T<b>4</b> are set into the energization pattern of A+B+. A notation Pb indicates an occurrence point of the zero-crossing in a case where the time ranges T<b>3</b> and T<b>4</b> are set into the energization pattern of A&#x2212;B+.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A difference between <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 4A</figref> and <b>4</b>B is that the zero-crossing of the actual output voltage (solid line) occurs on a boundary between the time range denoted by T<b>3</b> and the time range denoted by T<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, that is, the zero-crossing occurs at the same time as the energization switching from A&#x2212;B+ to A+B+. In the case where the zero-crossing occurs after the energization switching of the coil as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, by adding &#x394;Ta to the time Pa of the zero-crossing of the actual output voltage (solid line), the time Q of the zero-crossing of the ideal output voltage (alternate long and short dash line) can be obtained. Similarly, even in the case where the zero-crossing occurs before the energization switching of the coil as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, by subtracting &#x394;Tb from the time Pb of the zero-crossing of the actual output voltage (solid line), the time Q of the zero-crossing of the ideal output voltage (alternate long and short dash line) can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">However, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the zero-crossing occurs due to the energization switching of the coil. As mentioned above, &#x394;Ta (=from Pa to Q) or &#x394;Tb (=from Pb to Q) as a difference between the zero-crossing of the fluctuated output voltage (dotted line) and the zero-crossing of the ideal output voltage (alternate long and short dash line) is equal to a fixed value as mentioned above. However, a difference (=from Pc to Q) between the zero-crossing of the actual output voltage (solid line) and the zero-crossing of the ideal output voltage (alternate long and short dash line) is equal to a value which varies depending on the point of time when the energization patterns of the coils is switched. Therefore, in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, according to the foregoing time correction, the time Q of the zero-crossing of the ideal output voltage (alternate long and short dash line) cannot be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a timing chart at the time when the motor <b>101</b> is controlled acceleratedly in the driving apparatus according to the first embodiment. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the energization switching of the A-phase coil <b>104</b><i>a </i>is performed after the first elapse time (&#xb1;&#x394;Ta+Ta<b>11</b>)&#x2dc;(&#xb1;&#x394;Ta+Ta<b>31</b>) elapses from the H/L inversion of the A sensor <b>105</b><i>a</i>. Similarly, the energization switching of the B-phase coil <b>104</b><i>b </i>is performed after the first elapse time (&#xb1;&#x394;Tb+Tb<b>11</b>)&#x2dc;(&#xb1;&#x394;Tb+Tb<b>31</b>) elapses from the H/L inversion of the B sensor <b>105</b><i>b</i>. That is, the energization switching of the A-phase coil <b>104</b><i>a </i>is performed at the timing when the elapse time (after the rectangular wave of the A sensor <b>105</b><i>a </i>is H/L inverted) which is output from the time measurement unit <b>107</b> is equal to (&#xb1;&#x394;Ta+Ta<b>11</b>)&#x2dc;(&#xb1;&#x394;Ta+Ta<b>31</b>). The energization switching of the B-phase coil <b>104</b><i>b </i>is performed at the timing when the elapse time (after the rectangular wave of the B sensor <b>105</b><i>b </i>is H/L inverted) which is output from the time measurement unit <b>107</b> is equal to (&#xb1;Tb+Tb<b>11</b>)&#x2dc;(&#xb1;Tb+Tb<b>31</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Each of (&#xb1;&#x394;Ta) and (&#xb1;&#x394;Tb) as a first term of the first elapse time is a correction time term which is given by the above-described time correction. That is, it is a correction term for correcting the actual output voltage (solid line) of the sensor to the ideal output voltage (alternate long and short dash line). As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the above correction term has a positive sign in the case of an additional correction and has a negative sign in the case of a subtractive correction. Each of (+Ta<b>11</b>)&#x2dc;(+Ta<b>31</b>) and (+Tb<b>11</b>)&#x2dc;(+Tb<b>31</b>) as a second term of the first elapse time is a time term which specifies a timing relation between the rotational position of the magnet <b>102</b> and the energization switching of the coil. A rotation speed of the motor is controlled by controlling a value of such a time term. That is, according to the motor of the present embodiment, the output voltages of the sensors are binarized, and the rotational position of the magnet <b>102</b> is detected from the level inversion of the binarized output signals of the sensors, thereby controlling and the energization switching of the coil.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It is now assumed that each of (+Ta<b>11</b>)&#x2dc;(+Ta<b>31</b>) and (+Tb<b>11</b>)&#x2dc;(+Tb<b>31</b>) as a second term of the first elapse time which is required until the energization switching from the H/L inversion of the sensors is controlled to be constant by a proper value. Thus, a relation between the rotational position of the magnet <b>102</b> and the energization switching timing of the coil becomes constant. If a load which is applied to the motor is constant, the rotation speed can be controlled to be constant. However, if each of (+Ta<b>11</b>)&#x2dc;(+Ta<b>31</b>) and (+Tb<b>11</b>)&#x2dc;(+Tb<b>31</b>) as a second term of the first elapse time is controlled so as to be decreased step by step, the energization switching timing of the coil is made earlier step by step to the rotational position of the magnet <b>102</b>. In this case, if the load which is applied to the motor is constant, the rotation speed of the motor can be accelerated.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As mentioned above, by reducing each of (+Ta<b>11</b>)&#x2dc;(+Ta<b>31</b>) and (+Tb<b>11</b>)&#x2dc;(+Tb<b>31</b>) as a second term of the first elapse time, the motor is accelerated. In the acceleration step, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the times Tc<b>1</b> to Tc<b>3</b> which are required until the H/L inversion of the A sensor <b>105</b><i>a </i>happens after the energization switching of the B-phase coil <b>104</b><i>b </i>are gradually shortened and soon become substantially the same time. That is, the reason why the H/L inversion of the A sensor <b>105</b><i>a </i>happens at the timing shown by an arrow T<b>4</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is that the energization switching of the B-phase coil <b>104</b><i>b </i>is performed at the timing shown by an arrow T<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As mentioned above, in the H/L inversion of the sensor which happened due to the energization switching of the coil, the time of the zero-crossing of the ideal output voltage (alternate long and short dash line) can be obtained by the foregoing time correction.</p>
