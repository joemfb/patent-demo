<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates generally to home systems, and more particularly to an energy management system and method.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Current energy management systems take a passive role to residential energy management. For example, consumers lack energy awareness and are typically left with having to evaluate a monthly bill to determine how much energy was consumed. Additionally, consumers lack transparency into what the leading causes of energy consumption are at their residences. Some utility companies are providing energy display only technologies that will allow consumers to see what the current price of energy may be. However, such displays take a passive role to conservation, and leaving it up to the consumer to manually curtail their use.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In certain regions, information infrastructure is lacking to enable utility companies and customers to access real-time energy consumption. For example, some regions have smart meters that are capable measuring and reporting consumption data. However, there is a lack of communication and analytical infrastructure to allow utility companies to analyze future demand and schedule energy production. For example, some utilities are providing demand response systems that react to load levels, and force curtailment on residential, industrial, and commercial customers. Such programs have not been well received as they typically inconvenience the end user.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The method begins generally at block <b>300</b>. At decision block <b>302</b>, the method detects whether an energy network has been established. For example, a wireless energy network can be established and can include one or more networks that can be used to manage energy use at a site. According to an aspect, a wireless energy network can be established using a wireless enabled controller located at a residence. At decision block <b>302</b>, a detection of an energy network, AMI enabled network, WIFI enabled network, Zigbee enabled network, WiMAX network, or any other type of energy network, or any combination thereof can be detected. If at decision block <b>302</b>, one or more networks may not be detected, the method can proceed to decision block <b>304</b>. At decision block <b>304</b>, the method can detect if there is an AMI network available. If at decision block <b>304</b> there is an AMI network available, the network can proceed to block <b>306</b> and the AMI network can be joined. For example, the AMI network can include a specific protocol and security level to establish communication or allow a joining of the network. For example, the AMI network may require an encryption key-based security that can require specific keys, certificates, etc. to enable access. According to another aspect, the AMI network may include a smart grid based security described in Smart Grid standards. As such, various combinations of joining the AMI network can be deployed. Upon joining the AMI network, the method can proceed to decision block <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In some forms, an AMI network may be available and the method can be modified to determine whether to join the AMI network. If at decision block <b>304</b>, an AMI network may not be detected (or may not be joined), the method can proceed to decision block <b>308</b>. At decision block <b>308</b>, the method can detect if a WIFI network (e.g. 802.11 based network) may be available. If a WIFI network is not detected or is not available, the method can proceed to block <b>310</b> and a WIFI network can be established. For example, a controller, network device, smart appliance, or various other types of energy consuming devices can include a WIFI communication device capable of initiating a WIFI network. As such, at block <b>310</b> a WIFI network can be established and the method can proceed to block <b>312</b>. If at decision block <b>308</b> a WIFI network exists, or if a WIFI network should not be established, the method can proceed to block <b>312</b>. In some forms, an additional WIFI network can be established at block <b>310</b> and the method can be modified to allow a bridging between the two WIFI networks.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">According to an aspect, at block <b>312</b> an energy network can be established to manage one or more network devices. For example, an energy network can include a wireless energy network that is based on a Smart Grid standards and protocols such as a Zigbee based protocol. Various other types of communication can also be used to establish an energy network. An energy network can be established by outputting a wireless network at a site to enable a network device to join the energy network.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Upon establishing an energy network, the method can proceed to block <b>314</b> a network device capable of connecting to the energy network can be detected. For example, a network device can include a Zigbee enabled communication device capable of joining a Zigbee enabled energy network. A unique identifier of the network device can be detected and a profile can be obtained at block <b>316</b>. In some forms, a unique identifier can be previously obtained by a controller deploying the energy network. For example, a unique identifier can be obtained from a server accessible to a controller, via a WIFI or other network accessible to a controller, or any combination thereof. In other forms, an external information source can be capable of providing a unique identifier, or a list of unique identifiers to identify a valid network device that can be joined to the energy network. A controller can then use the unique identifier, and the profile, to establish or join the network device to the energy network.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In another form, a profile of a network device may not be immediately available, or may have been revised. As such, a profile can be obtained using a WIFI network, an AMI network, an Internet or broadband network, or any combination thereof. For example, a unique identifier, a model number, a serial number, a device class identifier, or any combination thereof that can be communicated to an external source or information network to obtain a profile can be used. A profile can then be identified and used to join the network device to the energy network.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">According to a further aspect, obtaining a profile at block <b>316</b> can include initiating a request using a controller and an information network accessible to a mobile device capable of communicating with a WIFI network at a site. For example, a profile can be provided by connecting a mobile device to a wireless information network such as a 3G data network, 4G data network, or other subscriber based wireless information network. The mobile device and then communicate the profile to the controller using the WIFI network at the site. The controller can then receive the profile and use at least a portion of the profile within the energy network.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">According to an aspect, upon obtaining a profile, the method can proceed to block <b>318</b> and the network device can be joined to the energy network. For example, the network device can be joined at a security level that is different than required by an AMI network, or other secure network. In some forms, the network device can be joined to multiple networks or combination of networks while joined to the energy network. In other forms, the network device can be joined to only the energy network. In still other forms, an AMI network connection can be established to enable an AMI network to access the network device, and the network device can unjoin or disconnect the AMI network and join the energy network. In another form, information received from the AMI network can be used to alter an operating condition of the network device using the energy network. Various other permutations of joining a network device to an energy network or other networks can also be realized as needed or desired.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">According to a further aspect, a network device can join the energy network using a standardized profile, such as a Zigbee profile. In addition, a network device can be joined using a profile modifier that can extend the functionality of the Zigbee profile associated with a specific network device. For example, a controller establishing the energy network can access profile modifiers to enhance use of a specific network device.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">According to a further aspect, an AMI network can be joined during a period of time, and then the energy network can be joined during a separate time period. As such, various combinations of joining a network device to one or more networks can be used as needed or desired to manage energy use of a network device. Additionally, the method can be modified to join additional network devices to one or more networks as needed or desired. Upon joining one or more network devices, the method can proceed to block <b>320</b> and then to decision block <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">At decision block <b>322</b>, the method can detect whether a proximity mode associated with a site and energy network is enabled or disabled. For example, proximity mode can include associating a mobile device with a residential site, and automatically controlling a network device based on detecting a location the mobile device may be from the residential site. One or more mobile devices associated with a site can include a location reporting device capable of outputting a location report. The location reporting device can use various technologies to report location including GPS, GPRS, cell tower triangulation, or various other location reporting technologies. In another form, a location reporting device of a mobile device can also include a WIFI radio capable of being connected to a WIFI network. As such, a mobile device can be connected to a WIFI network at the site using a WIFI connection, and as a WIFI connection is established or lost, a proximity mode can be enabled and disabled accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">According to an aspect, at block <b>322</b> if proximity mode is enabled, the method can proceed to block <b>344</b> as described below. If at decision block <b>322</b> proximity mode may not be enabled, the method can proceed to decision block <b>324</b> to detect if a user schedule is available. For example, a user schedule can include an event schedule to control one or more network devices. According to an aspect, one or more user's can create a schedule that can be accessed by a controller, and used to control one or more wireless thermostats or other network devices that can be joined to the energy network. According to a further aspect, a user schedule can be linked to a mobile device of the user. In some forms, the mobile device can include a location detection device configured to report locations of the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">According to an aspect, if a user schedule may not be detected, the method can proceed to block <b>356</b> and an event can be identified. For example, an event can include one or more programmed events that can be created and accessed at a specific time, date, period, or other to alter an operating condition of a network device. For example, a user may not have provided a user schedule to schedule energy use of a hot water system at a residence. As such, a default schedule can be accessed to identify an event and schedule or manage use of the hot water heater. For example, an event can include decreasing a hot water heater ten (10) degrees at midnight. Another event can include increasing a hot water heater fifteen (15) degrees at five (5) A.M. In another form, a network device can include a wireless thermostat that can be used to control an HVAC system based on a time of day or other attribute. For example, a weather forecast can be determined, and an event can be scheduled to adjust a wireless thermostat accessible to the energy network. Various other environmental conditions, grid conditions, user profiles, device profiles, energy pricing, or any combination of energy management information can be used to schedule or create an event.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Upon identifying an event, the method can proceed to decision block <b>326</b> and detect whether to schedule the event. For example, if an event is configured to be scheduled at a specific time of day, the method can detect the event at decision block <b>326</b>. If an event may not be detected, the method can proceed to decision block <b>322</b> and repeats.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">According to an aspect, if at decision block <b>326</b> an event should be scheduled, the method can proceed to block <b>328</b> and the event can be scheduled. For example, a network device can be identified, an operating condition to be altered can be identified, a time of day to alter the operating condition can be identified, a period of time to alter an operating condition can be identified, a device profile can be used, or any combination of data that can be used to schedule an event can be used. According to another aspect, the method can include initiating a scheduled event at block <b>328</b> using a portion of a programming schedule stored within a memory of the controller associated with the energy network. For example, portions of event data can be communicated from a remote server to the controller, and used with a programming schedule stored within the controller to schedule an event. In this manner, one or more sources can be used alone or in combination to schedule events.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">According to a further aspect, upon scheduling the event, the method can proceed to block <b>330</b> and a control action can to be communicated to a network device. For example, a control action can include control action data or device data sufficient to alter an operating condition of a network device. In some forms, data formatted according to a standard profile, such as a Zigbee Home Automation profile, Zigbee Energy Profile, and the like. In other forms, control action data can include a device identifier, a message format to output a message, a parameter or feature of a network device to alter, an updated set-point or operating condition of the network device, a network or security key, a date and time, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">According to an aspect, the method can proceed to block <b>332</b> and the control action can be output to the energy network as an outgoing message and received by the network device as an incoming message. For example, the network device can detect the outgoing message communicated within the energy network using a unique identifier of the network device.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">At block <b>334</b>, upon the network device receiving the incoming message, a control action can be extracted from the incoming message and the operating condition at the network device can be altered using the control action data. For example, an dishwasher may be turned on, a clothes washer or dryer turned on, lights within a home can altered, a thermostat can be adjusted, a hot water hear can be adjusted, or various other types of control actions can be initiated as needed or desired.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">At block <b>336</b>, network device data can be obtained from the network device using the energy network. For example, a network device can receive a request to output operating status information as network device data to the energy network. In other forms, the network device can be enabled to periodically publish status information to the energy network and received by the controller. Upon outputting the network device data, the method can then proceed to block <b>338</b> and a site report can be generated. For example, a site report can include network device data received from one or more network devices accessible to the home energy network. Site report data can be stored locally to the controller, and processed to confirm an updating of the control action. The site report data can be stored within a site report and communicated to a remote server configurable to receive and process the site report data within a site report. According to an aspect, a site report can be communicated to a remote server configurable to receive site reports from the controller using a broadband connection initiated by the controller. Other forms of communication can also be used to communicate a site report as needed or desired. Upon generating a site report, the method can proceed to decision block <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">According to an aspect, if at decision block <b>322</b> proximity detection may be enabled, the method can proceed to block <b>344</b> and a location report can be received. For example, a location report can include location data output from a location reporting device such as a mobile device. In other forms, a location report can be generated in response to a detection that a mobile device having a WIFI radio may be within range, or out of range, of the WIFI network at the site. As such, the method can be used to alter an operating condition of the network device using the energy network in response to detecting the location reporting device establishing or losing a WIFI connection to the WIFI network.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">According to an aspect, the method can proceed to decision block <b>346</b> and can detect if a location change has occurred. If a location change has not occurred, the method can proceed to block <b>348</b> and detects whether to alter an operating condition. If an operating condition of one or more network devices may not be altered, the method can proceed to block <b>350</b>, and to block <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">According to another aspect, if at decision block <b>346</b> a location change may be detected, the method can proceed to block <b>350</b> and detects a distance a location reporting device may be from an associated site. The method can then proceed to block <b>352</b> and detects the direction of the mobile device. For example, if the distance has increased from a previous location reported, the method can detect that a user may be moving away from a site. In other forms, a detected direction can include moving toward a site, moving away from a site, or not moving at all.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Upon detecting a direction, the method can proceed to decision block <b>348</b> and detects whether to alter an operating condition of a network device. For example, in addition to detecting a distance and direction a user may be from a residence, various other types of information can also be used to alter an operating condition. For example, data such as real time velocity data, average velocity data, estimated length of time a user may take to return to a site, thermostat scheduling data, network device scheduling data, site report data, real-time weather condition data, traffic condition data, user driving pattern data, daily driving pattern data, GPS mapping data, home energy efficiency ratings, demand response data, curtailment data, energy pricing data, grid condition data, various other types of EMI, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Upon detecting an operating condition to alter, the method can proceed to block <b>354</b> and initiates a control action. For example, a server remote to a site can be used to generate a control action that can be included within a control action report and communicated to the controller at the site. In a form, the control action report can be communicated in association with an upload of a site report. According to another aspect, a control action can be generated by the controller. For example, a location and direction of a mobile device can be identified and communicated to the controller. The controller can then determine whether to generate a control action using the location data and direction data, and possible other data as needed or desired. The method can then proceed to block <b>328</b> as generally described above. If at decision block <b>348</b> an operating condition of a network device should not be altered, the method can proceed to block <b>350</b> and to block <b>322</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">According to an aspect, the method can be provided to detect a distance between the location reporting device and the site using a previously stored location of the residence and a new location of the location reporting device. At decision block <b>354</b> altering an operating condition can include altering an operating condition of the network device in response to detecting the location reporting device is traveling away from the residence. Further, altering an operating condition of the network device in response to detecting the location reporting device is traveling toward the residence.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">According to another aspect, the method can be provided to detect a location reporting device at a first distance at block <b>350</b>, and at decision block <b>348</b> initiate a control action. As the location reporting device may be detected at a second distance, a second control action can be initiated. For example, a control action can include setting a first temperature set-point of a thermostat in response to detecting the first distance. The method can further be provided to detect the location reporting device at a second distance different from the first distance, and set the temperature set-point to a second value.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">According to a further aspect, the method can be modified to detect an upper and lower thermostat set-point limits of a network device. For example, an upper set-point limit can include a maximum a temperature that should be reached within a site during a warm season. A set-point of a thermostat can then be determined by determining the difference between a previous set-point and the maximum set-point. In some forms, a percentage adjustment, such as 30%, 50%, 75%, etc. of the resulting difference between a maximum set-point and a base set point can be used to determine a new set-point. For example, if a thermostat is set to seventy (70) degrees and has a maximum set-point of eighty (80) degrees, the delta between the two being ten (10) degrees. A new set-point can then be generated by multiplying this delta by a percentage, such as 50%, and adding it to the current set point. In this example, a new setting of seventy five (75) degrees would be the resulting set-point. In other forms, the method can use the maximum and minimum set-points, resulting or current set-points, in association with a time of day, a distance or distances a user may be from a site, or various other data that can be used to determine a set-point using maximum and minimum set-point values.</p>

<p id="p-0270" num="0269">At decision block <b>1604</b>, the method can detect whether an acquisition interval may be updated. For example, an acquisition interval can be set to a first interval (such as 1 minute, 2 minutes, 10 minutes etc.), and can then be altered to another interval. According to an aspect, an acquisition interval can be altered in response to a distance a mobile device may be from a site. For example, as a user moves away from a site, an acquisition interval can be increased (e.g. changed from 1 minute to 3 minutes). Similarly, as a mobile device move towards a site, an acquisition interval can be decreased (e.g. changed from 3 minutes to 1 minute). Various combinations of intervals can be used as needed or desired. If at decision block <b>1604</b> an acquisition interval has been updated, the method can proceed to block <b>1606</b> and an updated interval can be obtained. If at decision block <b>1604</b> an acquisition interval has not been changed, the method can proceed to block <b>1608</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">According to an aspect, at block <b>1608</b>, device data can be acquired. For example, device data can be obtained by sending a request to one or more network devices joined to a wireless energy network. For example, multiple devices can be accessed at an acquisition interval to obtain device data. Device data can be provided in various forms and types of information. According to an aspect, device data can include a device identifier, a network identifier, operation data, security data, various other types of data that can be used to manage energy use, or any combination thereof.

<p id="p-0272" num="0271">According to another aspect, the method can be modified to detect an availability of one or more network devices. For example, a first network device may be accessible to a wireless energy network and may use a first device profile to communicate information using the wireless energy network. Additionally, a second network device may be accessible to the wireless energy network and may use a second device profile that may be different from the first.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">Upon acquiring device data from one or more network devices, the device data can be translated at step <b>1610</b>. For example, the device data may be formatted using a device profile, communication protocol, or various other formats to communicate device data using a wireless energy network. At block <b>1610</b>, device data can be translated into another format to use by another system, process, device, etc. other than the wireless energy network. For example, Zigbee formatted data can be translated into XML encoded data. According to another aspect, device data can be translated to a data object, such as a Java object and the like. Various other translations can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">The method can then proceed to block <b>1612</b> and a report interval can be detected. According to an aspect, a report interval can include an interval that may be the same as the acquisition interval, greater than the acquisition interval, or less than the acquisition interval. According to a particular aspect, the report interval can be twice as long as the acquisition interval. As such, exact timing of when to acquire device data can be obviated as at least one data acquisition may be available to generate a report.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">At decision block <b>1614</b>, if a report interval should not be updated, the method can proceed to block <b>1618</b> as described below. If a report interval should be updated, the method can proceed to block <b>1616</b> and an updated report interval may be obtained. According to an aspect, a report interval can be provided using a data acquisition interval. For example, a report interval can be updated in association with an acquisition interval being updated. In other forms, a report interval can be provided and updated without an acquisition interval being updated. Various combinations of updating a report interval, acquisition interval, or any combination thereof can be used. Upon updating a report interval, the method can proceed to block <b>1618</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">According to an aspect, at block <b>1618</b> report data can be generated. For example, report data can include data that can be provided within a site report and can be formatted in various ways. For example, report data can include a XML encoded data, Java objects, textual data or various combinations thereof. According to an aspect, network device data can be converted to a binary representation.

According to a further aspect, report data can be stored on a device basis until a site report can be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Upon generating report data, the method can proceed to block <b>1620</b> and generates a site report. For example, a site report can include data received from one or more network devices. In another form, site report data can include data from another source, device, network, or any combination thereof capable of providing data that can be used within a site report. For example, a home controller may include a data and time setting based on a current time zone. A network device may not have a current or updated date and time stamp provided with the network device data. As such, a current date and time stamp can be provided with the site report data. In other forms, data obtained from another source (e.g. WIFI network, AMI network, WiMax network, etc.) can be provided within a site report. For example, a site report can include network device data that includes a thermostat or HVAC system being placed in an &#x2018;on&#x2019; condition. Additionally, an AMI network can be accessed to detect a current energy consumption level, rate, price, savings or various other types of information that can be provided using an AMI network. The AMI network data can be combined with the network device data within a site report. As such, subsequent processing of site reports can include additional information that can be processed into a site report to manage and report energy use at a site. Other types and combinations of EMI data from various network locations can be included within a site report as needed or desired.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Upon generating a site report, the method can proceed to block <b>1622</b> and a network connection can be initiated. For example, a rested web services approach to making a network connection can be deployed to realize increased network security at a site. For example, a home controller can be used to initiate a network connection using a LAN, broadband network, wireless data network, WiMax network, WIFI network, or various other networks or combinations of networks. A specific network location can be accessed on a secure basis using SSL or other encryption methods. At decision block <b>1624</b>, if a network may not be available, the method can proceed to block <b>1626</b> and store the site report until the network may become available. The method can then proceed to block <b>1608</b> as described herein. If at decision block <b>1624</b> a network location may be available, the method can proceed to block <b>1630</b> and initiates a transfer of a site report. According to an aspect, if multiple site reports are available, the method can initiate a transfer of the multiple site reports.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Upon initiating transfer of the site reports, the method can proceed to block <b>1632</b> and can initiate processing site report data at a network location. For example, a network location can include a server configured to process site report data and store site report data within a database. Additional processing of the data can be realized as needed or desired. For example, server <b>602</b> described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes several modules that can be used to process site report data.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Upon initiating processor of site report data, the method can processed to decision block <b>1634</b> to detect if a control action may be available. For example, a control action field or flag associated with a specific site and one or more network devices can be provided within a database or other storage location. In another form, one or more binary values can be used to indicate if control action data be available. If control action may be available, the method can proceed to block <b>1636</b> and a control action can be received. For example, a control action can be communicated during a session and can include one or more actions associated with a network device accessible at a site. According to an aspect, a control action can be encoded based on a profile, (e.g. Zigbee Profile, Smart Energy Profile, Home Automation, etc.). In other forms, a control action can be formatted as XML encoded data, HTML encoded data, proprietary data format, or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Upon receiving a control action at block <b>1636</b>, or if a control action may not be available, the method can proceed to decision block <b>1638</b> and detects if an interval should be updated. For example, a acquisition interval, report interval, or any combination thereof can be available. If an interval should be updated, the method can proceed to block <b>1640</b> and one or more intervals can be received and updated. According to an aspect, if an interval may be updated, an update flag can be set to indicate a new or updated interval can be used.

Upon a user or agent installing controller <b>626</b>, an identifier of controller <b>626</b>, thermostat <b>628</b>, or any combination thereof, can be communicated to server <b>602</b> to authenticate site <b>604</b> and enable energy management at site <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">According to another aspect, an installation can include controller <b>626</b> requesting a list of valid identifiers of one or more network devices that can be installed at site <b>604</b>. For example, controller <b>626</b> can receive a list of one or more valid network devices that may be installed at site <b>604</b>, and can validate one or more installed devices. For example, controller <b>626</b> can detect a network device accessible using an energy network deployed at site <b>604</b>. A network device can communicate an identifier and controller <b>626</b> can detect whether the communicated identifier may be within the list communicated by server <b>602</b>. As such, an agent that may have an inventory of network devices, controllers, or any combination thereof can install a controller and a network device without having to determine a valid serial number.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">According to a further aspect, an installation can include using a mobile device including installation logic, one or more applications, settings, or any combination thereof. For example, mobile device <b>632</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> or other mobile devices or systems can be used to install portions or all of an energy management system at site <b>604</b>. For example, a user can deploy an energy management application on mobile device <b>632</b> and can input a serial number or other identifier to into an energy management application. In this manner, a user may modify network devices installed at site <b>604</b> by for example, adding new devices, updating new devices, deleting current devices, receiving software updates using a serial number of an installed device, or various combinations thereof. According to a further aspect, an installation, settings, and the like can include prompting a user to use a GPS location in connection with an installation and site <b>604</b>. As such, a user need not type in an address and can just select a current location to associate mobile device <b>632</b> and site <b>604</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">According to another aspect, an installation can include using RFID, bar code, network scan, or various other hands-free identification processes. For example, mobile device <b>632</b> can include an energy management application that can include an installation or set-up that includes reading a bar code label of controller <b>626</b>, TSTAT <b>628</b>, various other network devices, or any combination thereof. For example, a user can scan a barcode that can include a unique identifier of controller <b>626</b>, TSTAT <b>628</b>, or any combinations thereof. According to an aspect, a bar code label can be affixed to a portion of a housing (not expressly illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In other forms, a bar code can be accessed using a display, such as a display of TSAT <b>626</b> or other network devices or systems that can display one or more bar codes (e.g. outputting multiple at a single system, network device, installation sheet or stickers, etc.). Upon a user scanning a bar code label, the installation process can use a network connection, such as WIFI or other wireless data networks to communicate unique data and authenticate a system. An server, such as server <b>602</b> can authenticate the data and activate a user's account. According to an aspect, a user can also set a location using a current GPS location of mobile device <b>632</b> at site <b>604</b>. In this manner, and installation process that can include authenticating or activating software on a mobile device, a home controller, a network device, and a server account can be coordinated in an efficient manner thereby reducing the need to have an installation technician or other third party activate an account. Various combinations of associating devices, systems, controllers, mobile devices, etc. can be used to activate portions or all of an energy network using hands-free RF, optical scanning devices, or any combination thereof. According to a further aspect, an installation can be modified to allow a third party technician install a system and can include scanning one or more bar codes that may be affixed to a network device, controller, etc. In other forms, a third party technician can scan bar code labels or other devices and affix the labels to a device, controller, system, etc. in association with an installation. As such, inventory management can also be maintained in association with installing a controller, network device, system, etc.</p>
