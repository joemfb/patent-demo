<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">With reference now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref> thereof, a new windshield wiper device embodying the principles and concepts of an embodiment of the disclosure and generally designated by the reference numeral <b>10</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 5</figref>, the spraying windshield wiper assembly <b>10</b> generally comprises a wiper arm <b>12</b> having a first end <b>14</b> and a second end <b>16</b>. The first end <b>14</b> may have a circular receiver <b>18</b> configured for coupling to a vehicle <b>20</b>. The first end <b>14</b> is part of a connection portion <b>68</b> that is pivotally coupled to an elongated main body <b>70</b> of the wiper arm <b>12</b> that includes the second end <b>16</b>. A spring <b>60</b> is coupled to the wiper arm <b>12</b> between the connection portion <b>68</b> and the main body <b>70</b> and positioned in an interior space <b>62</b> of the main body <b>70</b> of the wiper arm <b>12</b>. The spring <b>60</b> is configured for urging the second end <b>16</b> of the wiper arm <b>12</b> towards a windshield <b>66</b> of the vehicle <b>20</b>. An elongated blade housing <b>22</b> is coupled to the second end <b>16</b> of the wiper arm <b>12</b>. The blade housing <b>22</b> is constructed of a resilient material <b>24</b> such as plastic or rubber. A channel <b>26</b> extends through the blade housing <b>22</b>. The channel <b>26</b> may have a rectangular cross-sectional shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. A supply tube <b>28</b> is coupled to the wiper arm <b>12</b>. The supply tube <b>28</b> may extend through the spring <b>60</b>. The supply tube <b>28</b> is fluidly coupled to the channel <b>26</b> whereby the supply tube <b>28</b> is configured for delivering a fluid <b>30</b> to the channel <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">An inlet port <b>32</b> is coupled to the blade housing <b>22</b>. The inlet port <b>32</b> may be positioned on a top surface <b>34</b> of the blade housing <b>22</b> for facilitating access to the inlet port <b>32</b>. The inlet port <b>32</b> is in fluid communication with the channel <b>26</b>. A first end <b>36</b> of the supply tube <b>28</b> is configured for environmental communication with a fluid reservoir <b>38</b> of the vehicle <b>20</b>. A second end <b>40</b> of the supply tube <b>28</b> is in environmental communication with the inlet port <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A plurality of nozzles <b>42</b> is coupled to the wiper arm <b>12</b>. Each nozzle <b>42</b> is fluidly coupled to the channel <b>26</b> whereby each nozzle <b>42</b> is configured for dispensing the fluid <b>30</b> from the channel <b>26</b>. Each nozzle <b>42</b> may have a pair of spaced arcuate surfaces <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A stiffening member <b>48</b> is coupled to the blade housing <b>22</b>. The stiffening member <b>48</b> may be positioned in the blade housing <b>22</b> between the channel <b>26</b> and a wiper blade <b>46</b> coupled to the blade housing <b>22</b>. A groove <b>50</b> extends into a bottom surface <b>52</b> of the blade housing <b>22</b>. The wiper blade <b>46</b> has a tongue <b>54</b> extending from a narrow neck <b>56</b>. The tongue <b>54</b> has a shape complementary to the groove <b>50</b> including spaced edges <b>58</b> that surround the neck <b>56</b> when the tongue <b>54</b> is positioned in the groove <b>50</b>. Thus, the wiper blade <b>46</b> is coupled to the blade housing <b>22</b>. End caps <b>74</b> may be coupled to the blade housing <b>22</b> to prevent disengagement of the wiper blade <b>46</b> from the blade housing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Either a single reflector <b>72</b> or a plurality of reflectors <b>72</b> may be coupled to the wiper arm <b>12</b>. The reflectors <b>72</b> may be positioned in spaced relationship along a length of the wiper arm <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In use, the wiper arm <b>12</b> is attached to the vehicle <b>20</b> and the blade housing <b>22</b> and wiper blade <b>46</b> are coupled to the wiper arm <b>12</b>. The supply tube <b>28</b> is connected to deliver fluid <b>30</b> through the channel <b>26</b> and out through the nozzles <b>42</b> directly onto the windshield <b>66</b> of the vehicle <b>20</b> from a relatively short distance compared to conventional spray nozzles located at the base of a windshield adjacent a hood of a car.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With respect to the above description then, it is to be realized that the optimum dimensional relationships for the parts of an embodiment enabled by the disclosure, to include variations in size, materials, shape, form, function and manner of operation, assembly and use, are deemed readily apparent and obvious to one skilled in the art, and all equivalent relationships to those illustrated in the drawings and described in the specification are intended to be encompassed by an embodiment of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, the foregoing is considered as illustrative only of the principles of the disclosure. Further, since numerous modifications and changes will readily occur to those skilled in the art, it is not desired to limit the disclosure to the exact construction and operation shown and described, and accordingly, all suitable modifications and equivalents may be resorted to, falling within the scope of the disclosure.</p>
