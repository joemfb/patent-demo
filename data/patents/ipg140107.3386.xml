<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2010-0139974, filed on Dec. 31, 2010, entitled &#x201c;Linear Vibration Motor&#x201d; which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a linear vibration motor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A general vibration motor, which is a component that uses a principle of generating electromagnetic force and converts electrical energy into mechanical vibrations, is mounted in mobile communication terminals, portable terminals, or the like, to silently notify a call to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Recently, a linear vibration motor has been generally used as a vibration motor. The linear vibration motor is generally disposed at a corner portion of a device to generate vibrations in a direction vertical to an object receiving vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the linear vibration motor may be configured to include a fixed part <b>10</b>, a vibrator part <b>20</b>, and an elastic member <b>25</b> coupled with the fixing fixed part <b>10</b> to elastically support the vibrator part <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, the fixed part <b>10</b> may be configured to include a bracket <b>11</b>, a coil <b>12</b>, a printed circuit board <b>13</b>, and a case <b>14</b> and the vibrator part <b>20</b> may be configured to include a yoke <b>21</b>, a weight body <b>22</b>, a magnet <b>23</b>, and a plate yoke <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The linear vibration motor may be generally changed according to a design, but has a dimension of about 10 mm in outer diameter and 4 mm in thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, the linear vibration motor designed to be vibrated in a vertical direction has a limitation in thickness in that it is not linearly vibrated until a space of about 4 mm in thickness in which the weight body installed in the vibrator may move up and down in order to generate vibrations.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Further, in order to increase vibration volume, increasing the thickness of the linear vibration motor restricts the space where the components can be mounted in the device.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In detail, the coil <b>110</b> is coupled with the upper portion of the printed circuit board <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The printed circuit board <b>130</b> is provided with circuit patterns (not shown) in order to apply external power to the coil <b>110</b> and includes a connection terminal <b>131</b> protruded to one side to connect to external components.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The inner upper portion of the bracket <b>120</b> is fixedly coupled with the printed circuit board <b>130</b> and the upper thereof is formed with an inner space and is coupled with the case <b>140</b> to cover the upper portion of the bracket <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The bracket <b>120</b> is formed with sides <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> corresponding to the vibration motion direction of the vibrator part that vibrates in a horizontal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The case <b>140</b> is formed with a step part <b>141</b> corresponding to the connection terminal <b>131</b> in order to expose the connection terminal <b>131</b> formed on one side of the printed circuit board <b>130</b> to the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The polarities of the plurality of magnets <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b> generating electromagnetic force by the electromagnetic induction with the coil <b>110</b> are disposed to be opposite to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In more detail, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the preferred embodiment of the present invention uses three magnets <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b>, which are disposed to have polarities opposite to each other in an arrangement order of N-S, S-N, and N-S.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Further, the arrangement order of polarities of the plurality of magnets <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b> is not limited thereto. However, the polarities should be disposed to be opposite to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Therefore, the magnetic flow is induced in a right direction to current in the coil <b>110</b> according to the magnetic repulsive force generated among the plurality of magnets <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b> and it is possible to prevent the sagging phenomenon of the elastic member <b>220</b> due to the attraction of the plurality of magnets <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When the material of the bracket <b>120</b> is made of a magnetic material, it is possible to prevent uniform straightness of the vibrator part and non-generation of the vibration motion due to the magnetic force that may be generated between the bracket <b>120</b> and the plurality of magnets <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In order to increase the magnetic flux collection, a plurality of yokes <b>241</b> and <b>242</b> are coupled among the plurality of magnets <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In more detail, the plate yoke <b>241</b> is coupled between the magnet <b>211</b> and the magnet <b>212</b> and the plate yoke <b>242</b> is coupled between the magnet <b>212</b> and the magnet <b>213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Therefore, the number of plate yokes installed between the magnets is increased with the number of magnets of which polarities are disposed to be opposite to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The weight body <b>230</b> is coupled with the plurality of magnets <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b>. In more detail, the center of the weight body <b>230</b> is provided with a receiving groove <b>231</b>, such that the plurality of magnets <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b> coupled with the plate yokes <b>241</b> and <b>242</b> are coupled in the weight body <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, the weight body <b>230</b> has a round (R) shape on a surface corresponding to the bending parts <b>224</b> and <b>228</b> of the elastic member <b>220</b> coupled with the outer side thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In this configuration, the coil <b>110</b> and the plurality of magnets <b>211</b>, <b>212</b>, and <b>213</b> are disposed to be opposite to each other and generates the electromagnetic force by the electromagnetic induction, thereby horizontally vibrating the weight body <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The elastic members <b>221</b> and <b>225</b> are coupled with the outer side of the weight body <b>230</b>. In more detail, the elastic members <b>221</b> and <b>225</b> are each coupled with one side of the weight body <b>230</b> and the other side of the first elastic member <b>221</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The first elastic member <b>221</b> and the second elastic member <b>225</b> elastically support the sides <b>122</b> and <b>123</b> of the bracket <b>120</b> to be opposite to the vibration direction of the vibrator part.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Therefore, the first elastic member <b>221</b> and the second elastic member <b>225</b> elastically support the vibration part in a horizontal direction, thereby making it possible to prevent the sagging phenomenon caused by the load of the vibration part.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In addition, the first elastic member <b>221</b> and the second elastic member <b>225</b> are integrally formed to be symmetrical left and right and are made of the same material.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Therefore, it is possible to prevent assembling eccentricity between the first elastic member <b>221</b> and the second elastic member <b>225</b> and constantly maintain the spring constant.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As shown, the first elastic member <b>221</b> may be configured to include a coupling part <b>222</b>, an elastic support part <b>223</b>, and a bending part <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In more detail, the coupling part <b>222</b> is fixedly coupled with one side of the weight body <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition, the elastic support part <b>223</b> is formed in the shape of a &#x201c;U&#x201d;-letter to elastically support one side <b>122</b> and the other side <b>123</b> of the bracket <b>120</b> opposite to the vibration direction of the vibrator part.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The bending part <b>224</b> connects the coupling part <b>222</b> with the elastic support part <b>223</b> and is formed in a round shape.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The structure and shape of the second elastic member <b>225</b> is the same as those of the first elastic member <b>221</b> and therefore, the description of the second elastic member <b>225</b> will be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Therefore, the vibration stress applied to the first elastic member <b>221</b> and the second elastic member <b>225</b> is reduced in the bending parts <b>224</b> and <b>228</b>, such that it is possible to prevent fatigue failure of the first elastic member <b>221</b> and the second elastic member <b>225</b> due to vibration stress.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Therefore, the lifespan of the first elastic member <b>221</b> and the second elastic member <b>225</b> can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The angle of the round-shaped bending parts <b>224</b> and <b>228</b> is variously changed, such that the design range of the resonance frequency can be increased according to the design of the horizontal vibrator.</p>

<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In detail, the coil <b>410</b> is connected with the printed circuit board <b>350</b> to be applied with power from the outside.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">As shown, since the printed circuit board <b>350</b> is coupled with the inner top surface of the bracket <b>320</b>, the fixed part <b>300</b> includes a conducting member <b>360</b> of which one end is fixedly coupled with the coil <b>410</b> and the other end is fixedly coupled with the printed circuit board <b>350</b> in order to apply power to the coil <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In addition, the outer side of the conducting member <b>360</b> may be made of a material having a non-conductor nature in order to prevent a short-circuit phenomenon occurring when the conducting member <b>360</b> contacts the plurality of magnets <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>, and <b>313</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In addition, the plurality of magnets <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>, and <b>313</b> of which polarities are disposed to be opposite to each other is coupled with the fixed part <b>300</b> to be opposite to the coil <b>410</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The top surface of the printed circuit board <b>350</b> may be provided with the circuit patterns (not shown). In more detail, since the short phenomenon occurs when the circuit patterns directly contact the plurality of magnets <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>, and <b>313</b>, the circuit patterns may be formed to avoid contact by bypassing an area in which the circuit patterns are coupled with the plurality of magnets <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>, and <b>313</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Therefore, the plurality of magnets <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>, and <b>313</b> may be coupled with the top surface of the printed circuit board <b>350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In addition, the printed circuit board <b>350</b> may include a hollow part (not shown) formed larger than the shape in which the plurality of magnets <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>, and <b>313</b> are coupled.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">By this configuration, it is possible to prevent the circuit patterns formed on the printed circuit substrate <b>350</b> from directly contacting with the plurality of magnets <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>, and <b>313</b> by directly installing the plurality of magnets <b>311</b>, <b>312</b>, and <b>313</b> on the inner top surface of the bracket <b>320</b>.</p>
