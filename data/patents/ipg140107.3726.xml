<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an antenna device for transmitting and receiving electromagnetic signals as are employed, for example, in navigation systems, in particular in satellite navigation systems such as GPS, GLONASS and Galileo.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Navigation systems have spread considerably over the last few years. Currently, satellite-assisted navigation systems are utilized very intensively, and have already opened up the home consumer market. For example, the American satellite system GPS (global positioning system) or the Russian GLONASS (global navigation satellite system), which is equivalent to the internationally used umbrella term GNSS (global navigation satellite system), are already being used all over the world. The European system Galileo will also be put to use during the course of the next few years. It is expected that the Galileo system will be fully serviceable in four to five years' time.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The satellite navigation systems predominantly use a frequency range between 1 and 2 GHz. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the currently used frequency plan of the so-called lower L-band, the upper L-band and the C-band. In this context, the frequency ranges used are plotted across a frequency axis, which is indicated in units of MHz. The upper part of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> represents the lower L-band, wherein all three navigation systems have frequencies associated with them. The individual frequency bands are employed for realizing open services (OS) as well as emergency applications (SOL, safety of life), commercial services (CS) and public services (PRS, public regulated services). In addition, the individual bands have identification codes associated with them, for example in the range from 1,164 MHz to 1,188 MHz, which is associated with the GPS system under the identification code L5, and with the Galileo system under the ID code E5A. In the bottom left area, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> further shows the upper L-band, which is also used for navigation systems and is subdivided in a similar manner as the lower L-band. On the right-hand side of the bottom area, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the C-band, which is employed in the uplink of the Galileo system and which is within a frequency range of around 5 GHz. This frequency range is used for transmitting information from an earth station to a satellite.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">To establish communication within said frequency ranges, antennas may be used which allow correspondingly precise localization of the satellites, and thus of the receiver. For precision applications, which, e.g., have accuracy requirements of less than five meters, attempts have been made to develop antennas which may be operated in all three frequency bands as far as possible. These antennas are currently offered, for example, by the Russian company Javad, www.javad.com, and by North American companies, www.novatel.com and www.sanav.com.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Mostly, antennas are available in one-band versions, such as GPS-L1, or in two-band variations, such as GPS-L1+L2. The current systems have the disadvantage that they are very costly. For example, multi-band systems are only available from a price level above 1,000 euros. Said systems mostly use planar structures on very expensive ceramic substrates, which play a decisive role in the high cost.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In addition, less costly antennas have been conventionally known, which, however, exhibit substantial disadvantages with regard to their levels of accuracy. For example, less costly antenna systems exhibit considerable drawbacks, e.g., with regard to their phase centers and their bandwidths. For example, fluctuations of the phase center in dependence on the angle of incidence are considerable, they comprise several centimeters, for example, and therefore turn out to be far larger than is allowed within the level of accuracy strived for. A further problem manifests itself in the compact design of such systems, which adversely affects their bandwidths and clearly reduces same. Such systems are therefore mostly one-band systems and thus only offer the possibility of receiving one frequency range; for example, only the reception of GPS signals is ensured.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to an embodiment, an antenna device for transmitting and receiving electromagnetic signals may have: a ground plane; a radiator arranged at a distance above the ground plane; and a plurality of parasitic elements arranged, on the ground plane, around the radiator in a radially symmetric manner, the parasitic elements being electrically connected to the ground plane and being arranged such that a beamwidth of the irradiation characteristic of the antenna device is enlarged.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to another embodiment, a production method of producing an antenna device for transmitting and receiving electromagnetic signals may have the steps of: arranging a radiator at a distance above a ground plane; and arranging a plurality of parasitic elements, on the ground plane, around the radiator in a radially symmetric manner, the parasitic elements being electrically connected to the ground plane and being arranged such that a beamwidth of the irradiation characteristic of the antenna device is enlarged.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The core idea of the present invention is to influence the irradiation characteristic of an antenna by means of parasitic metallic elements surrounding same. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention are based on the finding that the irradiation characteristic&#x2014;in this context, the term beamwidth is also used&#x2014;of antennas may be matched by means of parasitic metallic elements. In this context, the parasitic elements are arranged around a radiator on a ground plane, as a result of which the irradiation characteristic is influenced, among other things, such that, within the frequency range of the navigation systems, a larger beamwidth of the irradiation characteristic may be achieved at the same antenna gain. This advantage is achieved by the described geometric arrangement of a ground plane, a radiator and of parasitic elements, so that said antenna systems may be realized at very low cost, which constitutes a further major advantage of embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The inventive production method enables the setting up of antenna devices which realize circularly polarized broadband antennas having stable phase centers, almost constant antenna gains within, e.g., the frequency range of the navigation systems, and large beamwidths even at relatively high frequencies. What is advantageous about these systems is their low weight and the cheap production. This advantage is achieved since utilization of stacked microstrip line radiators on very expensive, brittle and heavy ceramic substrates may be dispensed with.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows an antenna device <b>100</b> for transmitting and receiving electromagnetic signals. The antenna device <b>100</b> comprises a ground plane <b>110</b> and a radiator <b>120</b> which is arranged at an radiator distance <b>150</b> above the ground plane <b>110</b>. The antenna device <b>100</b> further comprises a plurality of parasitic elements <b>130</b> arranged, on the ground plane <b>110</b>, around the radiator <b>120</b> in a radially symmetric manner, the parasitic elements <b>130</b> being electrically connected to the ground plane <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows the side view of an antenna device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>shows a top view of the antenna device <b>100</b>. The antenna device <b>100</b> comprises the ground plane <b>110</b> and the radiator <b>120</b>, which is arranged at an radiator distance <b>150</b> above the ground plane <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>also shows the plurality of parasitic elements <b>130</b>, which are arranged, on the ground plane <b>110</b>, around the radiator <b>120</b> in a radially symmetric manner, the parasitic elements <b>130</b> being electrically connected to the ground plane <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In one embodiment, the ground plane <b>110</b> comprises a surface area which falls below the square of a wavelength of the electromagnetic signals. The radiator <b>120</b> may comprise an radiator distance <b>150</b> which falls below a wavelength of the electromagnetic signals. In addition, in embodiments of the present invention, two parasitic elements <b>130</b> of the plurality of parasitic elements <b>130</b> may comprise, among themselves, an element distance <b>140</b> of less than one wavelength of the electromagnetic signals, and in an advantageous embodiment the element distance <b>140</b> is less than a quarter of the wavelength of the electromagnetic signals.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Embodiments of the present invention advantageously relate to antenna devices operating within a wavelength range of 0.15-0.3 m and are thus configured for a frequency range between 1 GHz and 2 GHz. However, embodiments of the present invention are not limited to said frequency range, for, in principle, the electromagnetic fields and, therefore, the antenna characteristics of any antenna may be influenced, in accordance with the invention, by parasitic elements.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It is only advantageously that embodiments of the present invention are employed in the GPS, Galileo or GLONASS systems, and, as a result, they are configured accordingly in embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In embodiments of antenna devices <b>100</b>, the ground plane <b>110</b> may be made of metallic material and may comprise a circular, oval, square or rectangular shape. The radiator <b>120</b>, for its part, may be formed, in embodiments, to be circular, oval, square or rectangular. In addition, the radiator <b>120</b> may be realized by a microstrip line radiator. In embodiments, the radiator <b>120</b> comprises a contacting which is passed through the ground plane <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Embodiments may comprise various parasitic elements <b>130</b>. For example, rod-shaped, cubic or sector-shaped elements are conceivable. In one embodiment, for example, parasitic elements <b>130</b> might be implemented as elements which are partly worked from the ground plane <b>110</b>. In this context it is conceivable, for example, that corresponding contours are worked from or released from the ground plane <b>110</b> by means of a laser. Thus, the parasitic elements <b>130</b> are initially part of the ground plane <b>110</b>. Once the contours have been worked from the ground plane <b>110</b>, the parasitic elements <b>130</b> may be bent away from the ground plane <b>110</b>, or may be erected. In embodiments, the antenna device <b>100</b> may comprise more than four parasitic elements <b>130</b>. In an advantageous embodiment, the antenna device <b>100</b> comprises six to twelve, advantageously eight or more parasitic elements <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, the antenna further exhibits the following properties:

    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0043">Simulation results which have been achieved with the above properties or settings will be presented below. In the simulation, care was taken to ensure, above all, a 10 dB beamwidth of at least 150&#xb0; across the entire frequency range.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0044">It shall be noted at this point that another possible measure that may be taken in order to enlarge the beamwidth would be to use an electrically small radiator, which, however, has the disadvantage that the antenna gain decreases sharply within the lower frequency range once the desired beamwidth is attained.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0045">In accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, an enlargement of the beamwidth at relatively high frequencies is achieved, in addition to increasing the antenna gain at relatively low frequencies, by introducing the parasitic metallic elements <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>shows an embodiment of an antenna device <b>100</b> comprising a ground plane <b>110</b> and a radiator <b>120</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>further shows the parasitic elements <b>130</b> which are arranged, on the ground plane <b>110</b>, around the radiator <b>120</b> in a radially symmetric manner and are electrically connected to the ground plane <b>110</b>. In this embodiment, the parasitic elements <b>130</b> are realized as parallelograms or flaps. In one embodiment, the element distance <b>140</b> between two parasitic elements <b>130</b> amounts to less than a wavelength of the electromagnetic signals, in an advantageous embodiment the element distance <b>140</b> amounts to less than a quarter of said wavelength. In addition, in an advantageous embodiment the radiator distance <b>150</b> may amount to less than a wavelength of the electromagnetic signals. In this context, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a </i>shows an implementation of the parasitic elements <b>130</b> as metallic ribs.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>b </i>shows an alternative embodiment of an antenna device <b>100</b>, wherein the parasitic elements <b>130</b> are implemented as metallic rods.

<p id="p-0043" num="0064">In one embodiment, an inventive antenna device <b>100</b> is further used for generating circular polarization. To generate the circular polarization, the radiator <b>120</b> is excited at four points by a matching or feed network, which is located, in one embodiment, on the underside of the printed circuit board, or ground plane <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>shows an embodiment of such a matching or feed network <b>300</b>. The matching/feed network <b>300</b> comprises five feed points <b>301</b> to <b>305</b>. A signal to be transmitted is fed in at point <b>301</b>, is manipulated accordingly by a phase shifter, and is fed in at the sides of a radiator <b>120</b>, which are connected to the feed points <b>302</b> to <b>305</b>. A signal to be received may be tapped at the feed point <b>301</b> in an analogous manner.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0065">In this embodiment, the matching/feed network <b>300</b> further comprises a phase shifter and four matching networks <b>320</b>. In this embodiment, the phase shifter is implemented by a rat-race divider <b>312</b> and two Wilkinson dividers <b>314</b> and <b>316</b>. The phase shifter composed of the rat-race divider <b>312</b> and the two Wilkinson dividers <b>314</b> and <b>316</b> provides for a corresponding phase shift for controlling the radiator <b>120</b> so as to achieve circular polarization. In this embodiment, the rat-race divider <b>312</b> is designed to be oval, but in other embodiments it may be circular, as it is usually implemented. The matching networks <b>320</b> serve to match the impedance of the antenna in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0066">The feed network <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a </i>implements a scattering matrix S of the embodiment, said scattering matrix S being depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>. In accordance with the five feed points <b>301</b> to <b>305</b> of the matching/feed network <b>300</b>, the matrix has a 5&#xd7;5 dimension. The circular polarization property of the feed network <b>300</b> manifests itself, in the scattering matrix S, in the scattering factors, which are shifted by 90&#xb0; in each case, between the feed points <b>301</b> to <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0067">To match the impedance of the antenna device <b>100</b>, four identical matching networks <b>320</b> in accordance with this embodiment are used in the feed network <b>300</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> once again shows the feed network <b>300</b> comprising the four matching networks <b>320</b>. In this embodiment, each of the four matching networks <b>320</b> comprises a non-quarter-wave transformer <b>322</b> and two idling stubs <b>324</b> and <b>326</b>. The antenna device <b>100</b> and the radiator <b>120</b> may therefore be matched in a broadband manner without using short-circuited stubs, which, in combination with a transformer, would be another method of broadband matching. By means of the selection of the radiator dimensions, i.e. its width and its radiator distance <b>150</b>, the position of the impedance characteristic within a Smith diagram may be influenced. In one embodiment, the impedance characteristic may be optimized to such an extent that all of the admittance values lie within a vicinity of a circle of the conductance G=1. By correctly selecting the parameters of the two parallel closed idling stubs <b>324</b> and <b>326</b>, and by correctly selecting the transformer <b>322</b>, there is then the possibility, in this embodiment, of moving the admittance values to the center of the Smith diagram and to achieve optimum matching.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0068">Therefore, embodiments of the present invention may comprise a matching or feed network <b>300</b> on the opposite side of the ground plane <b>110</b>. The matching/feed network <b>300</b> may further comprise a rat-race divider <b>312</b> or a Wilkinson divider <b>314</b>; <b>316</b>. In a further embodiment, the matching/feed network <b>300</b> may further comprise a stub <b>326</b>, a transformer <b>322</b> or a transformation line <b>322</b>. Thus, embodiments of the present invention may also be configured to transmit or receive circularly polarized signals.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0069">For example, embodiments of the present invention offer the advantage that they have stable phase centers. In addition, they have larger bandwidths and larger beamwidths than conventional systems. In addition, they are characterized by their low mass and their low production cost, which is why they may advantageously be employed as GNSS antennas. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>shows a table representing a comparison of various parameters of different antenna systems. The parameters of an embodiment of the present invention are represented in the last line and are compared to three conventional systems of the companies Javad, Novatel and SanJose-Navigation. The table of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a </i>reveals that the embodiment of the present invention in this comparison has the largest 10 dB beamwidth, has the lowest mass, covers the entire frequency range of the navigation systems and can be produced at the lowest cost.</p>

<p id="p-0050" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c </i>shows a Smith diagram which represents the measured curve of the reflection coefficient S<b>11</b> of the GNSS antenna of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>.

The matching of the antenna in the upper frequency range may be further optimized in embodiments. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>shows a horizontal antenna diagram, the outer curve <b>600</b> corresponding to right-handed circular polarization, the inner curve <b>610</b> corresponding to left-handed circular polarization. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>shows the curve at a vertical angle of 0&#xb0;, i.e. into the direct horizontal direction orthogonal to the ground plane <b>110</b> of the antenna device <b>100</b> at a frequency of 1.16 GHz. One may clearly see that the 10 dB beamwidth is clearly larger than 150&#xb0;. For the same frequency, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>shows a nearly vertical antenna diagram for an angle of 70&#xb0; around the direct horizontal direction. The curve depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>was determined for right-handed circular polarization and clearly shows that the antenna gain comprises a high level of uniformity in all directions.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>c </i>shows two diagrams, a diagram <b>620</b> for right-handed circular polarization, and a diagram <b>630</b> for left-handed circular polarization. Both diagrams were taken at a frequency of 1.61 GHz and detected in a direct horizontal direction. One may recognize that the 10 dB beamwidth is larger than 150&#xb0;. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d</i>, in turn, shows a nearly vertical antenna diagram for an angle of 70&#xb0; from the horizontal direction, at a frequency of 1.61 GHz. The curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d </i>was determined for right-handed circular polarization and also depicts a high level of uniformity of the antenna gain across all directions of incidence.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0074">The table depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>e </i>comprises a combination of the maximum antenna gains, which have been determined at the various frequencies, and of 10 dB beamwidths. Here, too, one may see that with embodiments of the present invention, an increase in the 10 dB beamwidth may be achieved across a broad frequency range.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0075">In accordance with the inventive production method it is possible, in embodiments, to produce an antenna device such that the parasitic elements <b>130</b> are initially partly released from a ground plane <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> schematically shows an embodiment of such a method step. The circular ground plane <b>110</b> is initially processed, for example using a laser or a saw, such that the contours of the parasitic elements <b>130</b> are released. Subsequently, a step of bending up the parasitic elements is performed, so that a structure in accordance with the antenna device depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0076">In addition, the inventive production method of producing a radiator <b>120</b> may comprise a step of bending a radiator <b>120</b> from a square shape. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows such a radiator <b>120</b>, which initially is present in a square or grid-square shape. The corners are now bent, or adapted, such that the inner square results. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b </i>shows an embodiment of an inventive antenna device comprising a ground plane <b>110</b> and parasitic elements <b>130</b> in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, and a radiator <b>120</b> in accordance with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0077">Embodiments of the present invention offer the advantage that with antenna devices, a larger beamwidth of the radiation characteristic may be achieved, in the frequency range of navigation systems, with the same antenna gain. This advantage is achieved by means of a geometric arrangement of a ground plane, a radiator and parasitic elements, so that these antenna systems may be implemented at very low cost, which represents a further major advantage of embodiments of the present invention.</p>
