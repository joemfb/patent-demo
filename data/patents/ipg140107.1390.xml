<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention generally relates to a system and method for driving LED arrays when used in a light beam producing luminaire. More particularly the invention relates to a system and method for driving an array of such Luminaires to generate images or light patterns. The invention also relates to preventing spill light and controlling the beam angle of an LED array. Additionally, the invention relates to a system and method for maximizing the light output from the LEDs while maintaining them at or below their optimum operating temperature and uniformity across the LED array or a plurality of LED arrays.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">High power LEDs are commonly used in luminaires for example in the architectural lighting industry&#x2014;in stores, in offices and businesses; as well as in the entertainment industry&#x2014;in theatres, television studios, concerts, theme parks, night clubs and other venues. In such applications LED arrays are frequently used to present images to an audience. It is common when projecting large images for the images to be divided into parts and then the parts transmitted to portions of the array. The transmission of these images can require significant bandwidth. In such applications the LED arrays are also frequently used to project a beam of light.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In these applications it is a common requirement to obtain the maximum light possible out of the LEDs without exceeding their operating temperature. LEDs are highly temperature sensitive and running them at too high a temperature will both reduce their output and shorten their life. In such applications, it is also frequently desirable to have the appearance of the image, light beam or plurality of light beams from a plurality of LED arrays be of consistent luminosity.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is well known in the art to include a temperature sensor in an LED system to measure the temperature of the LEDs and use that information to control the operating current and voltage so that the LED always operates within safe operating parameters. However, the critical temperature is that of the LED semiconductor die itself and such temperature probes are often situated to measure the LED package or the heat sink rather than directly measuring the temperature of the die. To compensate for this many manufacturers include a safety band or dead space in the operating parameters to ensure that the temperature never rises too high. This safety band means that the LEDs are never achieving maximum possible brightness.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is also known to consider the total power and heat dissipation of a bank of LEDs rather than that for each individual LED. If, for example, the luminaire has Red, Green and Blue LEDs mounted on a single circuit board or heat sink then if only the Red LEDs are illuminated it is possible to run those Red LEDs at a higher power than if all three groups, Red, Green and Blue were illuminated simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These LED array fixtures are also used to project color light beams. For color control it is common to use an array of LEDs of different colors. For example a common configuration is to use a mix of Red, Green and Blue LEDs. This configuration allows the user to create the color they desire by mixing appropriate levels of the three colors. For example illuminating the Red and Green LEDs while leaving the Blue extinguished will result in an output that appears Yellow. Similarly Red and Blue will result in Magenta and Blue and Green will result in Cyan. By judicious control of the LED controls by color the user may achieve any color they desire within the color gamut defined by the LED colors employed in the array. More than three colors may also be used. For example it is well known to add an Amber or White LED to the Red, Green and Blue to enhance the color mixing and improve the gamut of colors available.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The differently colored LEDs may be arranged in an array in the luminaire where there is physical separation between each LED, and this separation, coupled with differences in die size and placement for each color, may affect the spread of the individual colors and results in objectionable spill light and color fringing of the combined mixed color output beam. It is common to use a lens or other optical device in front of each LED to control the beam shape and angle of the output beam; however these optical devices are commonly permanently attached to the luminaire requiring tools and skilled labor to change and may additionally need to be individually changed for each LED or pixel individually. It would be advantageous to be able to simply and rapidly change such optical devices for the entire array simultaneously without the use of tools.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There is a need for an inexpensive LED driving system which can maximize the output of connected LEDs in a luminaire while making the luminosity consistent across an array of LED array luminaires. There is also a need for a system and method that allows for the display of images or light patterns across an array of luminairs the display of which is controlled with conventional relatively low bandwidth control protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There is also a need for a beam control system for an LED array luminaire which can be quickly and easily changed and provide improvements in spill light reduction and beam angle control.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplar curve <b>40</b> on a temperature versus power graph <b>42</b> for an LED, or LED array. In this case the temperature rises increasingly with power. As we near the point where the heat sink is incapable of dissipating the heat generated <b>44</b> the array may go into a thermal runaway situation where the temperature rises rapidly and the LEDs are permanently damaged. It is important to avoid such a result. In the embodiment illustrated a single probe is used. This probe may consist of a single sensor or it may consist of a temperature sensor with thermal connection to receive temperature signals from one or more sections or locations on the circuit board <b>22</b> and or heat sink(s). In other embodiments, the temperature probe may have several sensors located in different sections of the circuit board <b>22</b> and/or heat sink(s) (not shown). In other embodiments several individual sensors or probes may be employed to provide temperature information to the LED driver software described below.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the major software components of the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. User input <b>50</b> to a control desk (not shown) is processed <b>52</b> on the control desk before transmitting through the data link <b>54</b> to the electronics <b>56</b> onboard the luminaire (not shown). The data stream is initially processed in the onboard electronics <b>56</b> and split into its major components. Luminaire movement data passes to the movement processing section <b>58</b> and thence to the motor drivers <b>60</b>. Another major component is the image or light pattern data for the desired output of the LED array (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">One of the routines performed by the LED driver hardware (<b>48</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and software drivers <b>66</b> is as follows:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0037">a. Set the LED power to a known value;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0038">b. Measure the temperature of the substrate or circuit board using a temperature probe;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0039">c. Measure and establish the rate of rise curve for Temperature with Time as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0040">d. Increase the Power a known amount and repeat (b) and (c) to establish the rate of rise curve for Temperature with Power as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0005" num="0041">e. Take as many measurements as necessary to complete this data throughout the nominal range of operations.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0042">The curves established may be extrapolated back to allow both the prediction of final steady state die temperature from any desired input power and the time that will be taken to achieve that temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0043">Now, when it is desired to maximize the output of any particular LED or sub-group of LEDs in the luminaire for continuous operation, we may take the power needed to illuminate that sub-group of LEDs, compare that with the known data for the entire set of LEDs and the known rate of rise curves for Power and Temperature of those LEDs as well as the current temperature returned by the temperature probe and derive a total power possible for the sub-group. For example, if the total power capacity for the entire luminaire is 300 W when all R, G and B LEDs are illuminated and the user wishes to only illuminate the R and G LEDs. Assuming all three groups are equal in nominal consumption and efficiency then the simple solution when running two groups out of three would be to supply &#x2154; of the full capacity power or 200 W. However by taking note of the temperature rise and the relationship between Power and Temperature for the luminaire as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> we may increase the power to, for example, 250 W and still maintain acceptable temperatures on all LEDs.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0044">In a further embodiment we may increase the power supplied to an LED when the use is intermittent, such as when being used as a strobe. In this case we can use our knowledge of the temperature/time relationship as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> as well as the temperature/power relationship as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to apply power at much increased levels when the LED is on in the knowledge that the LED will then be off for a period of time thus allowing heat to dissipate.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0045">In a further embodiment we apply compensation to the temperature reported by temperature probe to compensate for any thermal lag that might be present between the LED die and the position of thermal probe. In one embodiment this compensation takes the form of increasing the value of the measured temperature. In a preferred embodiment this compensation increases the value of the measured temperature as a function of the rate of change of temperature based on the known values that the LEDs in the array are being driven.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0046">In a further embodiment a fan (not shown) may be used to assist with cooling the LEDs. In some entertainment venues such as theatres or opera houses it is important to minimize the noise produced by luminaires and running any fans at as low a speed as possible can assist with this need. The speed of the fan may be controlled to provide the right amount of cooling while keeping the fan speed as low as possible so as to minimize noise produced by the luminaire. The luminaire may optimally control the fan speed to minimize noise using knowledge of (i) the temperature reported by temperature probe <b>24</b>, (ii) the power and thus heat load required by the LEDs and, (iii) the current ambient temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0047">In a single LED array the routine may be used to control the entire array in unison so that the adjustment of the control signals to the LEDs is consistent. In alternative embodiments it may be used only to control a subset of the array, particularly when multiple temperature sensors or temperature probes are used. In the later case, if the fixture is being used to provide light, it might be desirable to maximize light output from each subsection. If the fixture is being used to project an image it might be desirable to maximize the consistence of adjustment across the entire LED array.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates another embodiment of the invention. In this embodiment, a series of yoke mounted automated LED luminaires <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, and <b>54</b> connected together through a serial daisy chain signal and cable <b>56</b>, <b>58</b>, and <b>60</b>. In the embodiment employing DMX512, input cable <b>56</b> carries the DMX512 signal from a control desk to first luminaire <b>50</b> and thence in a daisy chain manner through cable <b>58</b> to luminaire <b>52</b> and cable <b>60</b> to luminaire <b>54</b>. Each automated LED luminaire <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, and <b>54</b> may be addressed such that it responds to data on the DMX512 signal that is specific to said luminaire. Each LED luminaire <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, and <b>54</b> may contain a media server capable of outputting pixel mapped images under command of a DMX512 signal that control the LEDs in its associated LED array. Through the common DMX512 signal such a series of luminaires may behave in a coordinated manner. For example, the luminaires may share there temperature information with each other and the control desk so that if desired, the luminaries may coordinate so that the drivers drive the LEDs so that the correction to color and intensity as a result of the above described routine of the LED drivers is uniform across the array of LED luminairs rather than just for individual LEDs, or individual LED arrays or sub-arrays. Such coordination may also be employed so that a single image may appear across all the LED arrays, portion <b>1</b> on luminaire <b>50</b>, portion <b>2</b> on luminaire <b>52</b> and portion <b>3</b> on luminaire <b>54</b> as is described in greater detail below. When an array of LED luminairs is employed to project a single image, it might be desirable to have the light color and output adjustments be uniform from fixture to fixture. If the array of luminaries is being used to provide light rather than display an image it may be desirable that the total output from each array be consistent across the array of luminaries.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a problem posed by prior art LED array luminaries. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates two LEDs as may be used in an LED array luminaire causing light spill and or color fringing. LED <b>422</b> and LED <b>424</b> may be of differing colors and, due to the different optical properties and construction of the LED dies, produce light beams <b>432</b> and <b>434</b> respectively that differ in beam spread. The differing beam spreads mean that the light beams from LEDs <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> will impinge on an illuminated object <b>440</b> in such a way that areas <b>444</b> and <b>446</b> of the object are illuminated by a single LED only rather than the desired mix of both. This results in areas <b>444</b> and <b>446</b> being colored differently from the central mixed area and appearing as colored fringes. Two LEDs only are illustrated here for clarity and simplicity however the same problem exists with systems incorporating more than two colors of LED.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a single cell of the beam control array <b>414</b>. The light output from the same LEDs <b>442</b> and <b>424</b> with differing beam angles as used in the prior art system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> are impinging on object <b>440</b>. However, in the disclosed device the light from LEDs <b>442</b> and <b>424</b> is modified by optical element <b>450</b> and louver mask <b>416</b> such that the beam angles from each LED are constrained to be very similar and the areas of color fringing <b>444</b> and <b>446</b> are significantly reduced in size. Optical element <b>450</b> is an optional component in the system and may be a lens, lens array, micro-lens array, holographic grating, diffractive grating, diffuser, or other optical device known in the art. It can be seen that changing the height of louver mask <b>416</b> will alter the constrained beam angle of the output beam. A taller louver <b>416</b> will produce a narrower beam and a shorter louver will produce a wider beam. The louver mask <b>416</b> may be of fixed height or may be adjustable. Louver mask <b>416</b> may preferably be non-reflective so as to avoid spill light, this may be achieved by painting or coating the louver mask with a matte black paint, anodizing or other coating as known in the art to preferably absorb or scatter rather than reflect light. LEDs <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> may be of a single color and type or may be, as shown here, of multiple colors. In the example illustrated two colors of LEDs are used. The invention is not limited by the number, colors, or types of LEDs used and is applicable with any layout of any number of any type and any color of LEDs or OLEDs. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows both LEDs <b>422</b> and <b>424</b> within the same louver mask <b>416</b> however other embodiments may utilize separate louver masks for each LED. In alternative embodiments rather than increasing the height <b>419</b> of the louvers <b>416</b> the width <b>418</b> of the louver(s) may be increased for a similar result.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates an exploded diagram of an embodiment of the beam control array <b>414</b>. Beam control array <b>414</b> comprises a louver mask array <b>462</b> containing multiple cells <b>420</b>. Mounted onto the louver mask array <b>462</b> are optical element carriers <b>452</b> which clip into the cells <b>420</b> of the louver array <b>462</b>. Each optical element carrier <b>452</b> may in turn contain an optical element <b>450</b>. Optical elements <b>450</b> are here illustrated as micro lens arrays; however, the invention is not so limited and optical elements <b>450</b> may be any optical beam control device as known in the art. Each optical element <b>450</b> is clipped into an associated optical element carrier <b>452</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0059">In one embodiment of the beam control array, every optical element <b>450</b> is identical but in further embodiments the optical elements <b>450</b> may differ across the beam control array <b>414</b>. For example, alternating optical elements <b>450</b> may be of two different beam angles. In a yet further embodiment, the optical elements <b>450</b> around the periphery of the beam control array <b>414</b> may be of one beam angle that differs from the beam angle of the optical elements <b>450</b> in the center of the beam control array <b>414</b>. In yet further embodiments, the height of louver mask array <b>462</b> may be varied to effect different controlled beam angles for the emitted light. Such combinations of differing optical elements and louver array height may be advantageously chosen so as to allow fine control of the beam shape and quality. Notwithstanding the above and the various combinations of optical elements the entire beam control array <b>414</b> may be installed or removed from the luminaire as a single easily replaced item. When installed on the luminaire the beam control array is adjacent to the LEDs <b>482</b> mounted on the LED Circuit board <b>478</b>, reduces color fringing or halation and controls the beam angle to provide the lighting designer with a well controlled and defined beam of a single homogeneous color.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0060">In one embodiment optical elements and louver arrays are provides such that symmetrical beams with angles of 12&#xb0;, 25&#xb0;, and 45&#xb0; are available. In further embodiments an asymmetrical optical element may be used that provides an elliptical beam such as one that is 15&#xb0; in one direction and 45&#xb0; in an orthogonal direction. The beam angles given here are examples only and the invention is not so limited. Any beam angle or combination of beam angles is possible within a beam control array without departing from the spirit of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0061">Beam control array <b>414</b> may further provide mechanical protection and dust exclusion for the LEDs <b>404</b>. To allow for such protection without the optical element affecting the beam angle an optical element comprising a clear, flat window may be used. Such a window has no effect on the beam while still providing protection and dust exclusion.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0062">The control array <b>414</b> may also be of different shaped cells than those shown. For example the cells be me round or hexagonal or other regular or non-regular shapes.</p>
