<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An earpiece that substantially lacks a lower lobe is disclosed. In one example, the earpiece can have a generally arcuate rib having upper and lower ends. A lobe can be formed at the upper end of the arcuate rib. No lobe is formed at the lower end of the arcuate rib. An extension can extend from the earpiece and can be configured to extend into the ear canal. Eliminating the lower lobe mitigates discomfort during use and also reduces the likelihood of tissue damage and infection. The extension can enhance communication of desired sound, e.g., from a two-way radio, to an eardrum while mitigating communication of undesirable ambient noise to the eardrum. Other implementations and related methods are also disclosed.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention relates generally to earpieces such as those used by security, law enforcement, and military personnel to facilitate listening to two-way radios, and those used by consumers in headsets for used with mobile phones, music devices, and other devices. The present invention relates more particularly to an ergonomic earpiece and attachments for the ergonomic earpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Earpieces for use by security, law enforcement, and military personnel are well known. Such earpieces fit into the concha bowl of the ear and facilitate listening to two-way radios and the like. Contemporary earpieces typically comprise a generally arcuate rib connected to a generally vertical rib so as to define a D shape. A top lobe is formed at the top, near where the generally arcuate rib and the generally vertical rib intersect. Similarly, a bottom lobe is formed at the bottom, near where the generally arcuate rib and the generally vertical rib intersect.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In many instances, when the generally arcuate rib is too large for the concha, the generally arcuate rib bends and forces the lower lobe against the ear. The lower lobe can rub the ear, causing pain and sometimes even tissue damage and/or infection. Such contemporary earpieces also suffer from various disadvantages regarding their effectiveness and their ability to fit a wide range of ear sizes and configurations. For example, contemporary earpieces are not as effective as desired with respect to delivering desired sounds to the eardrum while preventing other sounds (ambient sounds such as noise) from reaching the eardrum.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In view of the foregoing, it is desirable to provide an earpiece and attachments for the earpiece that enhance its fit while providing a secure engagement with the user's ear. It is also desirable to provide an earpiece and attachments for the earpiece that enhance the ability of the earpiece to deliver desired sounds to the eardrum while preventing other sounds from reaching the eardrum.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to an embodiment, an earpiece substantially lacking a lower lobe is disclosed. The earpiece can have a smooth bend instead of the lower lobe of contemporary earpieces. That is, the lower lobe can be either completely or partially absent. In this manner, disadvantages associated with the lower lobe can be mitigated, while still providing an earpiece that functions as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to an embodiment, the earpiece can have a generally arcuate rib having upper and lower ends. A lobe can be formed at the upper end of the rib, while no lobe is formed at the lower end of the rib. An extension can extend from the earpiece some distance into the user's ear canal.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to an embodiment, a method can comprise providing an earpiece generally comprising a generally arcuate rib having upper and lower ends. A lobe can be formed at the upper end of the rib, while no lobe is formed at the lower end of the rib. The method can further comprise attaching an extension to the earpiece such that the extension protrudes from the earpiece and extends into the user's ear canal.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to an embodiment, a method can comprise placing an earpiece in the concha of a user's ear. The earpiece can comprise a generally arcuate rib having upper and lower ends, with a lobe formed at the upper end of the rib. No lobe is formed at the lower end of the rib. The method can further comprise placing an extension attached to the earpiece into the user's ear canal.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">One or more embodiments of an earpiece can enhance comfort during use by eliminating or substantially reducing the lower lobe. Thus, a potential source of discomfort, irritation, pain, tissue damage, and even infection is mitigated. The scope of the invention is defined by the claims, which are incorporated into this section by reference. A more complete understanding of embodiments of the present invention will be afforded to those skilled in the art, as well as a realization of additional advantages thereof, by a consideration of the following detailed description of one or more embodiments. Reference will be made to the appended sheets of drawings that will first be described briefly.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Embodiments of the present invention and their advantages are best understood by referring to the detailed description that follows. It should be appreciated that like reference numerals are used to identify like elements illustrated in one or more of the figures.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The discomfort associated with wearing contemporary earpieces can be a substantial disadvantage. Not only can the discomfort be a motivation for removing the earpiece, but it can be a dangerous distraction. Because of the discomfort, a wearer may consciously or unconsciously manipulate the earpiece in an attempt to relieve the discomfort that it causes. In doing this, the wearer can be distracted. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, such a distraction can be very dangerous to security, law enforcement, and military personnel. Many times, it is important that such people give their full attention to their environment, since their lives may very well depend upon their ability to do so. Any distraction can have severe consequences.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">For example, if an earpiece is used that is too large for the ear, then the generally arcuate rib can collapse as the oversized earpiece is forced into the ear. When the generally arcuate rib collapses, then the lower lobe can torque, twist, bend or otherwise move or deform in a manner that can cause discomfort, pain, and/or tissue damage, particularly with prolonged usage. It is desirable to provide an earpiece that does not rub the ear, even when the generally arcuate rib bends substantially because the generally arcuate rib is too large for the ear.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Furthermore, contemporary earpieces can be ineffective at providing a secure fit within the user's ear and at providing desired sounds to the eardrum. Contemporary earpieces can also be ineffective at reducing the level of undesired sound before it reaches the eardrum.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Methods and systems are described herein for providing earpieces that better fit the user's ear, are more comfortable, better provide desired sounds to the eardrum, and better prevent undesired sounds from reaching the eardrum Embodiments of various earpieces are discussed herein with reference to the figures. In one embodiment, an earpiece can be configured to be captured by protrusions of the concha. For example, the earpiece can be configured to be captured at least partially by the antihelix of the ear and/or other anatomical structures of the ear that are proximate or within the concha bowl. In this manner, the earpiece is held securely in place during use.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In the present disclosure, various earpieces and other features are described and set forth with regard to several embodiments. It is contemplated that features of the disclosed embodiments may be combined in any manner as may be desired for various applications and implementations.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a contemporary earpiece <b>10</b> comprises a generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> and a generally vertical rib <b>12</b>. An upper lobe <b>15</b> (e.g., also referred to as a top lobe) is formed at the top, near where the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> and the generally vertical rib <b>12</b> intersect. Similarly, a lower lobe <b>16</b> (e.g., also referred to as a bottom lobe) is formed at the bottom, typically near where the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> and the generally vertical rib <b>12</b> intersect. This lower lobe <b>16</b> is captured between the tragus <b>505</b> and the antitragus <b>504</b>, while the top lobe is captured by the crus <b>506</b> of the helix <b>507</b> and the antihelix <b>510</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>). A protrusion <b>20</b> (also referred to as a stem) extends away from the generally vertical rib <b>12</b> and is configured to enter the ear canal <b>509</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>). A bore <b>21</b> formed in the protrusion <b>20</b> transmits sound to a point proximate the eardrum. Acoustic tubing attaches to the contemporary earpiece <b>10</b> such that a generally contiguous sound channel is formed by the acoustic tubing and bore <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">As mentioned above, in many instances, the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> can be too large for the concha. In such instances generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> bends and thereby urges lower lobe <b>16</b> against the ear. The pressure of lower lobe <b>16</b> against the ear as it presses between the tragus <b>505</b> and the antitragus <b>504</b> can cause discomfort. During extended wear, this generally constant pressure can become substantially painful. It can result in tissue damage that can cause further pain. Infection can even result.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">It has previously been thought that lower lobe <b>16</b> was necessary to maintain an earpiece, such as contemporary earpiece <b>10</b>, securely within the wearer's ear. However, as discussed herein, the present disclosure provides various embodiments in which an earpiece may be provided that lacks the lower lobe, yet remains securely within the wearer's ear even during intense physical activity.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>, according to one or more embodiments, an earpiece <b>13</b> may be provided wherein the lower lobe (such as lower lobe <b>16</b> of the contemporary earpiece <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), is omitted. Rather, instead of such a lower lobe, a smooth rounded surface <b>17</b> (e.g., a smooth bend) may be provided in earpiece <b>13</b>. The smooth rounded surface <b>17</b> does not extend substantially away from the intersection of the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> and the generally vertical rib <b>12</b> in the manner that a lower lobe does, and thus does not extend substantially into the space between the tragus <b>505</b> and the antitragus <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">According to an embodiment, when earpiece <b>13</b> is used in an ear where the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> is too large for the ear (does not fit within the concha without substantial deformation), the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> merely bends or collapses without adverse affect. Since there is no lower lobe, there is consequently no pressure on the antitragus <b>504</b> and the tragus <b>505</b>, no rubbing, and no cause of discomfort.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Thus, in an exemplary embodiment the earpiece <b>13</b> can comprise a generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> having upper and lower ends, a generally vertical rib <b>12</b> extending substantially between the upper and lower ends, and an upper lobe <b>15</b> formed at the upper end of the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b>. A smooth rounded surface <b>17</b> can be formed at the lower end of the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b>. The earpiece <b>13</b> can be configured to be generally shaped like a D. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other embodiments are likewise suitable. For example, either the generally vertical rib <b>12</b> or the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> can be modified substantially or omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The earpiece <b>13</b> can further comprise a protrusion <b>20</b> having a bore <b>21</b> formed therethrough. The protrusion <b>20</b> can be configured to extend at least partially into the ear canal <b>509</b>. The bore can transmit sound, such as from a two-way radio, to the wearer's eardrum.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The earpiece <b>13</b> can be formed of a resilient polymer. For example, in one embodiment, the earpiece <b>13</b> can be formed of a resilient polymer having a Shore A durometer of between 35 and 45. More particularly, the earpiece <b>13</b> can be formed of a resilient polymer having a Shore A durometer of approximately 40. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the earpiece <b>13</b> can be formed of a more rigid material.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In various exemplary embodiments, the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> can bend to accommodate a wide range of ear sizes. For example, the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> can collapse so as to accommodate a range of ear sizes. Such collapsing of the earpiece <b>13</b> is made substantially more comfortable by the lack or partial lack of the lower lobe. That is, as the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> collapses, there is no lower lobe or not enough lower lobe to torque, twist, bend, or otherwise move or deform in a manner that can cause discomfort.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">One embodiment of the earpiece <b>13</b> can be configured to fit at least extra large sized ears. Similarly, one embodiment of the earpiece <b>13</b> can be configured to fit at least extra large sized ears and large sized ears. Moreover, a single embodiment of the earpiece <b>13</b> can be configured to fit most adult ears. For example, the earpiece <b>13</b> can be configured to fit at least 70% of ears of men between 19 and 40 years old. Bending of the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> and lack of the lower lobe cooperate to facilitate the fitting of such a large range of sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">At least one embodiment comprises a portable communication system comprising a radio and also comprising earpiece <b>13</b> having a smooth rounded surface <b>17</b> instead of a lower lobe, as described above. Further, one or more embodiments can be used in applications other than security, law enforcement, and military applications. For example, one or more embodiments can be used with cellular telephones, portable music devices (such as iPods&#xae;, CD players, MP3 players, cassette players, or other types), and other mobile devices. In such applications, a speaker can be in acoustic communication with the bore <b>21</b> of the earpiece <b>13</b> via acoustic tubing or the like. Alternatively, a speaker can be attached directly to the earpiece <b>13</b>, such as by mounting the speaker to the earpiece <b>13</b> or by placing the speaker inside or partially inside of the earpiece <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The earpiece <b>13</b> can also be used as a sound attenuating earplug, such as by configuring the protrusion <b>20</b> to seal or partially seal the ear. Alternatively, a member that seals or partially seals the ear can be added to the earpiece <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Since less material is used (because a portion of the earpiece <b>13</b> is reduced in size or eliminated), the earpiece <b>13</b> can be less expensive to manufacture. Since such earpieces <b>13</b> may be frequently purchased in bulk, such cost savings can be substantial. Further, since a single earpiece <b>13</b> fits a greater range of ear sizes, fewer earpieces <b>13</b> need to be inventoried by law enforcement departments and the like. Such reduction in inventory may save such agencies substantial money.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the earpiece <b>13</b> can be attached to acoustic tubing <b>32</b>, such as via a barbed fitting <b>31</b>. A strap <b>33</b> can be used to secure acoustic tubing <b>32</b> to a wearer's clothing, such as via a clip <b>34</b>. A speaker <b>35</b> converts electrical signals received via electrical cable <b>37</b> from a two-way radio <b>41</b> into sound that is transmitted to the eardrum via acoustic tubing <b>32</b> and via bore <b>21</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref>) of the earpiece <b>13</b>. A plug <b>38</b> can be used to connect electrical cable <b>37</b> to two-way radio <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">According to various embodiments, an earpiece assembly can have a flanged extension that is suitable for use as hearing protection, is suitable for facilitating listening to a two-way radio or the like, or is suitable for providing a combination of hearing protection and such listening. One or more embodiments can comprise a solid extension so as to substantially attenuate ambient sound. Alternatively, one or more embodiments can comprise a hollow or partially hollow extension to allow at least some ambient sound or sound from a radio to pass therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">According to one embodiment, an earpiece is held in place by anatomical structures of the ear and the earpiece holds the extension in place within the ear canal <b>509</b>. That is, the earpiece prevents the extension from loosening or falling out of the ear canal <b>509</b>. According to one embodiment, the earpiece positions a sound port at the distal end of the extension near the eardrum so that the volume of a two-way radio can be reduced. That is, the earpiece determines how far into the ear the extension extends.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Various combinations of sound attenuation and sound transmission may be provided. For example, a hollow or partially hollow extension may be configured so as to substantially attenuate some ambient sound (such as potentially harmful loud noise), while allowing some ambient sound (such as voices) to be heard. Optionally, the extension can comprise one or more openings that allow a substantial portion of ambient sound to be heard, while also allowing radio communications to be heard. Optionally, a filter may be used to selectively allow sounds to be heard.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>9</b>, and <b>10</b>, one exemplary embodiment comprises an earpiece <b>111</b> to which an extension <b>112</b> (also referred to as an insert and an ear insert) is attached. Earpiece <b>111</b> is configured to be disposed in the concha of the outer ear. Extension <b>112</b> is configured to be disposed within the ear canal <b>509</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In one embodiment, earpiece <b>111</b> can have a generally D shaped configuration. Earpiece <b>111</b> can comprise a generally arcuate rib <b>113</b> that has upper and lower ends. Generally arcuate rib <b>113</b> can be attached to a generally vertical rib <b>114</b> at the upper and lower ends of generally arcuate rib <b>113</b>. An upper lobe <b>116</b> can be formed proximate where generally arcuate rib <b>113</b> and generally vertical rib <b>114</b> join at the top of earpiece <b>111</b>. A smooth curve <b>117</b> can be formed proximate where generally arcuate rib <b>113</b> and generally vertical rib <b>114</b> join at the bottom of earpiece <b>111</b>, or if necessary a lower lobe could be formed to engage the tragus <b>505</b> and antitragus <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Earpiece <b>111</b> is configured to be disposed and held in place within the concha of a human ear. More particularly, the crus <b>506</b> of the helix <b>507</b> and the antihelix <b>510</b> of a wearer's ear cooperate to capture upper lobe <b>116</b>. The antihelix <b>510</b> and the antitragus <b>504</b> cooperate to capture generally arcuate rib <b>113</b>. Thus, earpiece <b>111</b> is configured to be captured by protrusions of the concha. In this manner, earpiece <b>111</b> is held firmly in place within the concha and can therefore maintain extension <b>112</b> in a desired position within the ear canal <b>509</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Extension <b>112</b> can be either removably or permanently attached to earpiece <b>111</b>. Extension <b>112</b> can be removably attached to earpiece <b>111</b> by friction fit, by detents, by threads, or by any other desired means. For example, extension <b>112</b> can be friction fit to earpiece <b>111</b> by sizing a proximal portion <b>121</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) of extension <b>112</b> so as to fit tightly within an aperture <b>161</b> (also referred to as an opening or a hole) of earpiece <b>111</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Extension <b>112</b> can be permanently attached to earpiece <b>111</b> by adhesive bonding, ultrasonic welding, or by any other desired means. Alternatively, extension <b>112</b> can be integrally formed to earpiece <b>111</b>, such as by injection molding earpiece <b>111</b> and extension <b>112</b> within a common mold cavity. Thus, earpiece <b>111</b> and extension <b>112</b> can be formed either integrally or separately.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Earpiece <b>111</b> and extension <b>112</b> can be formed of a soft, resilient material to enhance comfort during use. Both earpiece <b>111</b> and extension <b>112</b> can be formed of the same material. For example, earpiece <b>111</b> and extension <b>112</b> can be formed of a resilient polymer, such as silicon rubber. For example, in one embodiment, earpiece <b>111</b> and extension <b>112</b> can be formed of a material having a Shore A durometer of between 35 and 45, such as a Shore A durometer of approximately 40. Alternatively, in another embodiment, the earpiece <b>13</b> can be formed of a more rigid material.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In one embodiment, earpiece <b>111</b> functions as a stop to prevent extension <b>112</b> from being inserted too far into the ear. In one embodiment, earpiece <b>111</b> also prevents extension <b>112</b> from being inadvertently removed or loosened from the ear. In one embodiment, the length of extension <b>112</b> determines, at least in part, how close the tip thereof is positioned with respect to the eardrum.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, according to one embodiment the extension <b>112</b> comprises a stem <b>115</b> and two flanges, <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> (e.g., also referred to as flanged members). Extension <b>112</b> can comprise any desired number of flanges, including no flanges at all, as discussed in further detail herein. Stem <b>115</b> can either be solid (so as to substantially block sound) or hollow (so as to substantially transmit sound). Stem <b>115</b> can also be partially hollow (so as to selectively transmit sound).</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Stem <b>115</b> can bend such that it angles upwardly to conform to the upward angle of the ear canal <b>509</b>. For example, in one embodiment, stem <b>115</b> can bend such that it angles upwardly at an angle, angle A, of approximately 30&#xb0;. In one embodiment, the distance between the proximal end of extension <b>112</b> and the distal end of outer flange <b>119</b>, dimension B, can be approximately 0.545 inch. In one embodiment, the distance between the proximal end of extension <b>112</b> and the point where a filter (such as a Hocks filter) ends, dimension C, can be approximately 0.304 inch. In one embodiment, the distance between the proximal end of extension <b>112</b> and the bend in stem <b>115</b>, dimension D, can be approximately 0.680 inch. In one embodiment, the distance between the proximal end of extension <b>112</b> and a distal end of inner flange <b>118</b>, dimension E, can be approximately 0743 inch. In one embodiment, the distance between the proximal end of extension <b>112</b> and the distal end of inner flange <b>118</b>, dimension F, can be approximately 0.870 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In one embodiment, the diameter of stem <b>115</b> can be approximately 0.189 inch. Stem <b>115</b> can optionally have a bore <b>122</b> formed therethrough. In one embodiment, bore <b>122</b> can have a diameter of approximately 0.094 inch. In one embodiment, outer flange <b>119</b> can have a radius of approximately 0.241 inch. Similarly, in one embodiment, inner flange <b>118</b> can have a radius of approximately 0.193 inch. Thus, the radius of inner flange <b>118</b> can be substantially less than the radius of outer flange <b>119</b>, so as to better accommodate the manner in which the ear canal <b>509</b> becomes narrower as it gets deeper.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The exemplary angle and dimensions discussed above provide a single extension <b>112</b> that is suitable for use with a large number of individuals. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other dimensions are likewise suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The distal end <b>125</b> of bore <b>122</b> defines a sound output port <b>126</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 12</figref>). Extension <b>112</b> is configured such that sound output port <b>126</b> is positioned proximate the wearer's eardrum. That is, extension <b>112</b> can be configured so as to position a distal end <b>125</b> thereof proximate the eardrum. In this manner, sound transmitted through bore <b>122</b> (such as sound from a two-way radio), is brought close to the eardrum such that the volume of the sound required can be substantially reduced. For example, the extension can position sound output port <b>126</b> within one, two, or three millimeters of the eardrum. In one embodiment, the extension can have a length of approximately &#xbd; inch. In one embodiment, the extension can have a length of &#x215d; inch or more.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Adjustment of the position of the distal end <b>125</b>, as well as of the flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b>, facilitates enhanced fitting of the earpiece <b>111</b>. In this manner, comfort is enhanced. Because comfort is enhanced, a user is more likely to wear the earpiece <b>111</b>. A better fit allows earpiece <b>111</b> to be worn for longer periods of time for both communications and hearing protection. A better fit also substantially reduces the likelihood of tissue damage to the ear caused by the earpiece <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">A head <b>123</b> can be formed upon the proximal end of stem <b>115</b> so as to enhance friction with respect to aperture <b>161</b> of earpiece <b>111</b> and/or so as to define detents that tend to keep extension <b>112</b> attached to earpiece <b>111</b>. Bevels <b>124</b> can optionally be formed upon head <b>123</b> to better facilitate insertion of head <b>123</b> through aperture <b>161</b>. The head <b>123</b> can be positioned within the aperture <b>161</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>) of the earpiece <b>111</b> or can be pushed entirely therethrough and thus be position on the outward side of earpiece <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The extension <b>112</b> may comprise a flanged extension, having flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref> and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b>, or may be a non-flanged extension. In one embodiment, the flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> generally fill (close off) the ear canal <b>509</b> and tend to block ambient sound. Although sometimes it is desirable to block ambient sound, other times, it is desirable for the user to hear ambient sound. Thus, the flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> can have one or more openings <b>131</b> formed therein, as discussed herein. Although two flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> are shown, the extension <b>112</b> may comprise more or less flanges. For example, the extension <b>112</b> may comprise three, four, five, six, or more flanges, or no flanges. The flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> need not be identical, but rather may vary in size, shape, orientation and/or positions of attachment to the stem <b>115</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The extension <b>112</b> can have a bore <b>122</b> formed therethrough to facilitate the transmission of sound from a speaker (such as via acoustic tubing connected to the speaker) to the user's eardrum. Alternatively, the extension <b>112</b> can lack such a bore, so as to define an earplug, such as for attenuating ambient sound. Indeed, the bore <b>122</b> and/or openings <b>131</b> in the stem <b>115</b> and/or flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> can be configured so as to selectively transmit and block desired sounds. Such selectivity can be based upon the frequency and/or intensity of the sound.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">A user can wear one earpiece <b>111</b> having an extension <b>112</b> with a bore <b>122</b> and one earpiece <b>111</b> lacking a bore <b>122</b>. The earpiece having an extension <b>112</b> with a bore <b>122</b> facilitates listening to a radio, while the earpiece <b>111</b> having an extension <b>112</b> without a bore <b>122</b> at least partially blocks distracting and/or potentially harmful ambient sound.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, flanges, <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> of extension <b>112</b> can optionally have one or more openings <b>131</b> formed therein. For example, each flange, <b>118</b> and <b>119</b>, can have one, two, three, or four openings <b>131</b> formed therein. Openings <b>131</b> can be holes. Alternatively, the openings <b>131</b> can be cutouts, such as notches formed in the flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b>. The openings <b>131</b> allow at least some ambient sound to better reach the user's eardrum.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Such openings <b>131</b> may be desirable when an embodiment is intended to facilitate listening to a two-way radio and when it is also desirable to hear ambient sound. For example, such openings <b>131</b> may be desirable in police applications where a police officer is required to hear both the two-way radio and face-to-face conversations.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, one or more openings <b>141</b> can be formed in stem <b>115</b>, such as intermediate or proximate flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b>. A curable polymer material suitable for use in the ear canal <b>509</b> can be injected into the tube such that it substantially fills the tube and/or at least some space between the flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b>. That is, the injected polymer material extrudes from the openings <b>141</b> and tends to fill in the space intermediate the flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b>. This injection may be accomplished with the extension inserted into a wearer's ear canal <b>509</b>, so as to provide a custom fit. Alternatively, this injection may be performed using an artificial ear canal, such as for mass production.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Silicon rubber may be used as the extrudable material. Generally, any extrudable material suitable for use as earplugs can be used. In this fashion, attenuation of ambient sound is enhanced. Such earplugs are suitable for use in gun ranges and noisy industrial environments.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">The opening at the distal end of the tube can optionally be closed to prevent leakage of the injected polymer material therefrom. A skin may be formed over the flanged extension to trap the polymer material and/or to facilitate easier insertion into the ears. Alternatively, the openings <b>141</b> can be omitted and the central bore of the tube can still be filled with polymer material to attenuate sound.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a filter <b>151</b> can be inserted into bore <b>122</b> to selectively mitigate sound exposure. For example, a Flocks filter can be used to mitigate exposure to louder sounds, while still allowing a wearer to hear quieter sounds, such as speech.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, an earpiece <b>111</b> that is configured for use in the left ear is shown with the extension <b>112</b> removed therefrom. Generally arcuate rib <b>113</b> and generally vertical rib <b>114</b> generally define a D shape. When a mirror image of generally arcuate rib <b>113</b> and generally vertical rib <b>114</b> are configured for use in the right ear, a reverse (mirror image) generally D shape is similarly defined.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In one embodiment, for a medium size earpiece, the height, dimension G, can be approximately 1.087 inch and the width, dimension H, can be approximately 0.802 inch. In one embodiment, for a large size earpiece, the height, dimension G, can be approximately 1.150 inch and the width, dimension H, is approximately 0.850 inch.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In various embodiments, an earpiece <b>111</b> can optionally be used without an extension <b>112</b>. The number of flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b>, as well as the configuration of the flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b>, can be varied to provide a desired balance of intensity of ambient sound and sound from the radio. The configuration of the flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> can include the thickness thereof and the presence of openings <b>131</b> therein. This balance can depend upon the environment in which the earpiece <b>111</b>/extension <b>112</b> is being used and can also depend upon the wearer's preference.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>, outer flange <b>119</b> can optionally be omitted. Indeed, as mentioned above, extension <b>112</b> can comprise any desired number of flanges, including no flanges. In some instances, a single flange may perform adequately. This is particularly true when it is desirable to allow the wearer to hear ambient sound. Omitting the other flange(s) better allows ambient sound to be heard. In some applications, the primary reason for wearing the earpiece <b>111</b> may be to allow the wearer to better hear radio communications. Positioning output port <b>126</b> close to the eardrum accomplishes this goal.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, an acoustic tube <b>1100</b> can be attached to earpiece <b>111</b> and/or extension <b>112</b> such that a generally continuous bore is defined through which sound can travel from a speaker to the eardrum. A barbed metal or plastic fitting can be used to accomplish such attachment. Other methods of attachment, such as the use of adhesive bonding and/or ultrasonic welding, are likewise suitable.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Since the distal end <b>125</b> of extension <b>112</b> can be placed close to a wearer's eardrum, the volume of a two-way radio or other device (such as a cellular telephone, music device, or other device) can be substantially reduced. With the volume reduced, sound advantageously cannot be as easily heard by others. Thus, during covert operations, for example, the likelihood of someone other than the wearer undesirably hearing sound from a two-way radio is substantially mitigated. By reducing the sound volume, smaller, less powerful, and/or less expensive speakers can be used. Placing the sound closer to the eardrum can make it easier for the hearing impaired to hear.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Sound transmissive embodiments (such as those embodiments having a bore <b>122</b> formed through stem <b>115</b>) can similarly be used with a variety of personal electronic devices that produce sound, including two-way radios, cellular telephones, music devices, personal digital assistants (PDAs), desktop computers, laptop computers, notebook computers, pocket PCs, hearing aids, and other devices.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, according to another embodiment the extension <b>112</b> comprises one or more flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> (similar to those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, <b>8</b>, <b>11</b>, <b>12</b>, and/or <b>13</b>), having a skin or covering <b>1111</b> formed thereover. Covering <b>1111</b> can be formed of a thin resilient material, such as rubber, such as that of which common balloons are formed. Optionally, foam or gel <b>1112</b> can be disposed between the covering <b>1111</b> and flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b>. Foam or gel <b>1112</b> can comprise a biocompatible material, such as a silicon. Foam or gel <b>1112</b> can extend proximal of flange <b>119</b> if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Foam or gel <b>1112</b> can be injected between covering <b>1111</b> and flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> through openings <b>141</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), as discussed herein. Such a covering <b>1111</b> can be used with extension <b>112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, where an extrudable substance (which can be a foam or gel) is injected into bore <b>122</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>) and passes through holes <b>141</b> to fill the void between the flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Thus, according to at least one exemplary embodiment the extension <b>112</b> can comprise a tube (such as stem <b>115</b>) and a skin or covering <b>1111</b> (e.g., a rubber skin in one example), wherein foam or gel <b>1112</b> or some other resilient substance is disposed between the tube and the skin or covering <b>1111</b>. The tube can be formed of a flexible polymer material. However, the tube may alternatively be formed of a rigid polymer or metal material. The tube, foam or gel <b>1112</b>, and skin or covering <b>1111</b> can be attached to one another via any desired combination of friction fitting, adhesive bonding, and ultrasonic welding. The extension <b>112</b> can be tapered to facilitate easy insertion into the ear canal <b>509</b> and to provide a good fit therein.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Any desired combination of flanges, foam, fiber, and fabric can be used to at least partially block the ear canal <b>509</b> and thereby mitigate the transmission of sound therethrough. For example, the flange <b>118</b> of the extension <b>112</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> could be replaced with a section of foam or gel similar to the foam or gel <b>1112</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In various embodiments, the extension <b>112</b> can be bent as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref> and <b>11</b>-<b>14</b> so as to better conform to the shape of the ear canal <b>509</b>. Alternatively, extensions can be provided that are generally vertical (e.g., straight) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-18</figref> further discussed herein. If an extension is generally vertical, it can be formed of a material that is bendable, so that the extension can conform, at least somewhat, to the shape of the ear canal <b>509</b> when inserted therein.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">The aperture <b>161</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) in earpiece <b>111</b> can be configured such that the extension <b>112</b> is positioned at the top of the ear canal <b>509</b>, at the bottom of the ear canal <b>509</b>, at one side of the ear canal <b>509</b>, or is approximately centered in the ear canal <b>509</b>. In one embodiment, configuring the aperture <b>161</b> such that the extension <b>112</b> is not approximately centered causes the extension <b>112</b> to be biased toward an inner surface of the ear canal <b>509</b> and can help to keep the earpiece <b>111</b> and extension <b>112</b> in the ear. In one embodiment, if the earpiece <b>111</b> and/or the flanges <b>118</b> and <b>119</b> of the extension <b>112</b> are sufficient to keep the earpiece <b>111</b> and the extension <b>112</b> in the ear, then the extension <b>112</b> can be positioned approximately in the center of the ear canal <b>509</b>. Positioning the extension <b>112</b> approximately in the center of the ear canal <b>509</b> may be more comfortable for some wearers.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Any of the extensions disclosed herein that employ flanges can either be ambidextrous (formed to fit either the right or left ear), or can be dedicated to fit only one ear. Thus, the flanges can be either radially symmetric for use with either ear, or can be asymmetric such that they tend to be optimized for a particular ear (left or right). They can also be optimized in configuration so as to better fit a particular person's ear.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In certain embodiments, any of the flanges disclosed herein may be formed integrally with the stem of an associated extension. In other embodiments, the flanges may be formed separate from the stem and may be formed of a different material with respect thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">In various embodiments, an extension may be provided with multiple flanges to advantageous effect over implementations employing fewer flanges. For example, in one embodiment, multiple flanges may permit an earpiece to be better secured in the ear. In another embodiment, multiple flanges may mitigate ambient sound before such sound reaches a wearer's eardrum, particularly if the flanges do not have holes formed therein. In another embodiment, multiple flanges may better prevent the sound of a radio or other sound device from escaping from the ear and thus prevent such sound from being undesirably heard by others, particularly if the flanges do not have holes formed therein.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-20</figref> illustrate several extensions that may be used with the various earpieces of the present disclosure. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, an extension <b>1118</b> can have three flanges <b>1121</b> formed upon stem <b>115</b> thereof. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, the use of more flanges generally provides better sound reduction. The use of more flanges can also better secure the extension <b>1118</b> within the ear canal <b>509</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, an extension <b>1119</b> can have four flanges <b>1121</b> formed upon stem <b>115</b> thereof. Indeed, the extension <b>1119</b> can have any desired number of flanges formed upon stem <b>115</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref>, an extension <b>1120</b> may include a stem <b>115</b> covered with a resilient substance <b>1141</b> such as foam, fiber, or fabric. Foam, such as a polymer foam, can be used to define a portion of the extension <b>1120</b>. In one embodiment, the foam is compressed before or as it enters the ear canal <b>509</b> and then expands so as to effectively block at least a portion of the ear canal <b>509</b>. In a similar manner, fiber, such as cotton, can be used to define a portion of the extension. For example, cotton can cover a portion of the extension in a manner similar to the way that cotton covers the end of a cotton swab. Cotton fiber is sufficiently compressible and resilient so as to function in a manner similar to foam. Fabric, such as woven cotton, can similarly be used to cover a portion of the extension <b>1120</b>. Any desired combination of foam, fiber, and fabric may be used. For example, cotton fabric can be used to cover cotton fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the resilient substance <b>1141</b> can be tapered. In one embodiment, tapering the resilient substance <b>1141</b> makes it conform better to the shape of the ear canal <b>509</b>. In one embodiment, tapering the resilient substance <b>1141</b> can make insertion thereof into the ear canal <b>509</b> easier.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">The resilient substance <b>1141</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17-19</figref> can be formed over stem <b>115</b>, as discussed above. Alternatively, the resilient substance <b>1141</b> can be attached to head <b>123</b> or the like without being formed over a stem. For example, the resilient substance <b>1141</b> can be attached to a shorter stem that does not pass substantially therethrough. As a further example, the resilient substance <b>1141</b> can be attached directly to head <b>123</b> or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, an extension <b>1122</b> is shown with a portion <b>1171</b> that is inserted into the ear canal <b>509</b> and can be formed such that it does not substantially enter the ear canal <b>509</b>. The portion <b>1171</b> can be formed of a rigid material or of a resilient substance. It can also be formed by providing a resilient layer over a substantially rigid material. It need only enter the ear canal <b>509</b> far enough so as to be effective in mitigating the level of ambient sound reaching the eardrum.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, a lanyard <b>1181</b> can be used to interconnect earpieces <b>1182</b> (each having an extension <b>1183</b>) to each other and/or to any other item. For example, lanyard <b>1181</b> can be used to connect earpieces <b>1182</b> to the wearer's clothing, e.g., shirt, jacket, hat, helmet, etc. Lanyard <b>1181</b> can interconnect earpieces <b>1182</b> that are both configured as earplugs (both lack bores and are intended to mitigate sound exposure). Alternatively, one or both earpieces <b>1182</b> can be configured to transmit some sound, such as via the use of a bore for transmitting sound from a two-way radio or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">In various exemplary embodiments, the stem of any of the extensions set forth in the present disclosure can be attached to any of the earpieces set forth in the present disclosure in a variety of different ways that facilitate adjustment of the length of the extension within the ear canal <b>509</b> of a user. For example, the stem of the extension can be slidably attachable to the earpiece such that the length of the extension that extends inwardly (into the ear canal <b>509</b>) from the earpiece can be adjusted by sliding the extension within the earpiece. One or more detents can also be formed upon the extension and/or the earpiece so as to inhibit undesirable movement of the extension with respect to the earpiece once the length of the extension has been set. The detents can comprise bumps, rings, or any other desired structures. The detents can inhibit movement of the stem of the extension through the earpiece so as to tend to cause the extension to remain in place with respect to the earpiece and thereby maintain a desired length adjustment of the extension.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">Alternatively, friction can maintain a desired length adjustment of the extension with or without the use of detents. For example, the outer diameter of the stem of the extension can be sized with respect to the diameter of the opening within the earpiece through which the extension moves so as to provide the desire amount of friction and thus the desired ability of the extension to resist movement with respect to the earpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The extension and/or the earpiece can have threads formed thereon such that adjustment of the length of the extension extending inwardly away from the earpiece can be adjusted by turning the extension with respect to the earpiece. Thus, the extension can threadedly engage the earpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">In one embodiment, it is desirable to position the distal end of the extension between approximately two and approximately four millimeters from the eardrum. In one embodiment, it may be desirable to position the distal end of the extension closer to the eardrum (such as approximately 1 millimeter therefrom) and in another embodiment it may be desirable to position the distal end of the extension farther from the eardrum.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Once the length adjustment of the extension has been performed, then the extension can be permanently attached to the earpiece such as by adhesive bonding, ultrasonic welding, or by any other desired means. In this manner, inadvertent changes to the adjustment of the extension can be mitigated. Alternatively, no such permanent attachment can be performed. In this manner, subsequent re-adjustment of the length of the extension can be performed if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the distal end <b>125</b> of bore <b>122</b> defines a sound output port <b>126</b> of extension <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Extension <b>112</b> is configured such that sound output port <b>126</b> is positioned proximate the wearer's eardrum. That is, extension <b>112</b> can be configured so as to position a distal end <b>125</b> thereof proximate the eardrum. In this manner, sound transmitted through bore <b>122</b> (such as sound from a two-way radio), is brought close to the eardrum such that the volume of the sound required can be substantially reduced. The distance between the output port <b>126</b> and the eardrum can be varied. For example, the extension <b>112</b> can position sound output port <b>126</b> within one, two, or three millimeters of the eardrum. The extension <b>112</b> can have a length of approximately &#xbd; inch. The extension can have a length of &#x215d; inch or more. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the distal end <b>225</b> of bore <b>222</b>, sound output port <b>226</b>, and extension <b>212</b> may be similarly configured.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-25</figref> illustrate various embodiments of an extension <b>212</b> that may be a configuration of extension <b>112</b> used with earpiece <b>111</b>. For example, extension <b>212</b> may include a stem <b>215</b>, flanges <b>218</b> and <b>219</b>, a head <b>223</b>, bevels <b>224</b>, an output port <b>226</b>, and dimensions D and F similar to corresponding structures of extension <b>112</b>. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, one or more rings <b>221</b> can be formed upon the stem <b>215</b> to define detents. The earpiece <b>111</b> can have similar rings formed in the aperture <b>161</b> thereof. The earpiece <b>111</b> can have grooves that are complimentary to rings <b>221</b> formed in the aperture <b>161</b> thereof. The grooves can thus receive rings <b>221</b> so as to retain the stem <b>215</b> in a desired position with respect to the earpiece <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the stem <b>215</b> can have threads <b>241</b> formed thereon. The threads <b>241</b> can engage complimentary threads formed within aperture <b>161</b> to facilitate adjustment of the length of stem <b>215</b> within a user's ear canal <b>509</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, one or more bumps <b>251</b> can be formed upon the stem <b>215</b> to define detents. The earpiece <b>111</b> can have similar bumps formed in the aperture <b>161</b> thereof. The earpiece <b>111</b> can have depressions that are complimentary to bumps <b>251</b> formed in the opening thereof. The depressions can thus receive bumps <b>251</b> so as to retain the stem <b>215</b> in a desired position with respect to the earpiece <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">A filter <b>252</b> can be inserted into bore <b>122</b> to selectively mitigate sound exposure. For example, a Hocks filter can be used to mitigate exposure to louder sounds, while still allowing a wearer to hear quieter sounds, such as speech.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Any desired combination of detents, e.g., rings, threads, and bumps, can be used on the stem <b>215</b> and/or the earpiece <b>111</b> to facilitate adjustment of the length of the stem <b>215</b> within a user's ear canal <b>509</b> and/or to help maintain the position (such as the adjusted position) of the extension <b>212</b> with respect to the earpiece <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Outer flange <b>219</b> (shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-24</figref>) can optionally be omitted. Indeed, extension <b>212</b> can comprise any desired number of flanges, including no flanges. In some applications, the primary reason for wearing the earpiece <b>111</b> may be to allow the wearer to better hear radio communications. In one embodiment, positioning output port <b>226</b> close to the eardrum accomplishes this goal.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">According to an embodiment, an extension can have a variable fit so that the extension can be adjusted in a manner that accommodates the particular configuration of a user's ear canal <b>509</b>. Thus, the extension can better seal the ear so as to inhibit the undesirable leakage of sound through the ear canal <b>509</b> and can consequently mitigate hearing damage due to such sound.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">More particularly, the size of the extension can be changed by adding and/or removing attachments. By changing the size of the extension, it can be made to better seal the ear while being comfortable to wear for extended periods of time. Further, a properly sized extension is less likely to loosen or fall out.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">The extension can comprise a stem that is configured to be inserted into a user's ear canal <b>509</b>. One or more attachments can be configured to attach to the stein in a manner that at least partially defines a fit of the extension within an ear canal <b>509</b>. Each attachment can individually vary the size, e.g., diameter, of the extension at a particular location along the length thereof so as to accommodate variations in the size, e.g., diameter, of the ear canal <b>509</b> of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The attachments can have a minor cross-section that is either generally circular in configuration or is non-circular in configuration. Thus, the attachments can have a minor cross-section that is generally square, rectangular, or elliptical in configuration, for example. The attachments can have any desired minor cross-section. The minor cross-section of the extension can be defined herein as a cross-section that has a diameter of dimension C of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>. Minor cross-sections are shown with cross-hatching in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 32 and 33</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">The attachments can have a major cross-section that is either generally circular in configuration or is non-circular in configuration. The major cross-sectional configuration of the attachments can be matched to the cross-sectional configuration of the user's ear canal <b>509</b> at the locations where the attachments are to be placed when the extension is worn. Any desired combination of major cross-sections can be provided on a single extension. For example, one attachment can have a circular major cross-section and another attachment can have a non-circular major cross-section. The major cross-section of the extension can be defined herein as a cross-section that has a diameter of dimension A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>. The major cross-section of an attachment will generally conform to the cross-section of the ear canal <b>509</b> at the location where the attachment is disposed when the extension is worn.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The stem can have one or more flanges formed thereon. The attachments can be placed on the stem proximate the flanges. For example, the attachments can be placed upon the stem such that the attachments are substantially covered by the flanges. The flanges can curve outwardly (away from the eardrum) so as to substantially cover the attachments.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Alternatively, the flanges can not extend sufficiently far from the extension so as to substantially cover the attachments. For example, the flanges can comprise bumps upon the extension or rings around the extension that do not extend substantially far therefrom and that define detents that tend to hold the attachments in a desired position.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Alternatively, the extension can have no flanges. In this instance, the attachments can be placed in any desired position upon the stem. Whether or not the extension has flanges, the attachments can fit within grooves and/or indentations in the extension and/or can be adhesively bonded in place.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, an embodiment can comprise an earpiece <b>311</b> to which an extension <b>312</b> is attached. Earpiece <b>311</b> includes a generally arcuate rib <b>313</b>, a generally vertical rib <b>314</b>, an upper lobe <b>316</b>, a smooth curve <b>317</b>, and a bore <b>322</b> as similarly provided in earpiece <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Earpiece <b>311</b> is configured to be disposed in the concha of the outer ear. Extension <b>312</b> is configured to be disposed within the ear canal <b>509</b>. The outer or major diameter of at least portions of the extension <b>312</b> can be varied so as to vary the fit of the extension <b>312</b> within the ear canal <b>509</b>. The major diameter of the extension <b>312</b> is the major diameter of an attachment thereof and is indicated as dimension A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">For example, attachments <b>320</b> can be added to the extension <b>312</b> at desired locations along the length thereof so as to vary the major diameter of the extension <b>312</b> at these locations. In this manner, a desired fit of the extension <b>312</b> to the ear canal <b>509</b> can be obtained at these locations. Often, a snug but comfortable fit is desired. The fit can be tight enough so as to substantially mitigate sound leakage around the extension <b>312</b> without causing discomfort. Such a fit tends to cause the extension <b>312</b> to maintain its desired position within the ear canal <b>509</b>, with or without the use of the earpiece <b>311</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Thus, the extension <b>312</b> can be used either with or without the earpiece <b>311</b>. When the extension <b>312</b> is used without the earpiece <b>311</b>, it can extend far enough out of the ear so as to facilitate grasping and manipulation thereof. A small string or lanyard can extend from the proximal end of the extension <b>312</b> to facilitate such handling and manipulation.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">The attachments <b>320</b> can be either substantially resilient or substantially rigid. For example, the attachments <b>320</b> can be formed of a resilient polymer such as rubber or silicone rubber. In one embodiment, the attachments <b>320</b> can have a Shore A durometer of between approximately 35 and approximately 45. For example, the attachments <b>320</b> can have a Shore A durometer of approximately 40.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">According to an embodiment, extension <b>312</b> comprises a stem <b>315</b> and two flanges <b>318</b> and <b>319</b>. Extension <b>312</b> can comprise any desired number of flanges, including no flanges at all. Stem <b>315</b> can either be solid (so as to substantially block sound) or hollow (so as to substantially transmit sound). Stem <b>315</b> can also be partially hollow (so as to selectively transmit sound).</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, the attachments <b>320</b> can comprise o-rings <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b>. The o-rings <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> are shown separated from the extension <b>312</b> and ready for attachment thereto. The o-rings <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b> can be attached to extension <b>312</b> by sliding the o-rings <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b> over the inner flange <b>318</b> and/or the outer flange <b>319</b>. A readily removable lubricant, such as liquid soap, can facilitate such sliding.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">With particular reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the o-rings <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b> can be disposed upon extension <b>312</b> such that the o-rings <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b> are next to and substantially covered by the flanges <b>318</b> and <b>319</b>. Thus, the o-rings <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b> can maintain the flanges <b>318</b> and <b>319</b> in a generally fully opened or extended configuration and thereby mitigate collapse of the flanges.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">As discussed above, the two o-rings <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> can be slid over the extension <b>312</b> so as to be positioned substantially under the flanges <b>318</b> and <b>319</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>. The o-ring attachments <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b> can have different inner diameters (dimension B of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>) so as to fit upon portions of the extension <b>312</b> having different diameters. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, o-ring <b>3121</b> has slightly smaller inner and outer diameters than o-ring <b>3122</b>. The o-rings <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b> can have different outer diameters (dimension A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>) so as to better fit the ear canal <b>509</b> in portions thereof having different diameters.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the extension <b>312</b> and/or earpiece <b>311</b> can be used with a cable assembly to facilitate communication, such as via a two-way radio or a cellular telephone. The extension <b>312</b> and/or earpiece <b>311</b> can similarly be used with a cable assembly to facilitate listening to music from a music device. The cable assembly can comprise an upper portion <b>3100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> and a lower portion <b>31300</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. Upper portion <b>3100</b> can be connected to lower portion <b>31300</b> to form the complete cable assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">The upper portion <b>3100</b> can comprise an earpiece <b>311</b> that is configured to fit within the concha of a user's ear so as to transmit sound (such as incoming cellular telephone transmissions, music, or other sound) to the user's eardrum.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Earpiece <b>311</b> can be attached to acoustic tubing <b>3102</b>, such as via barbed fitting <b>3103</b>. Acoustic tubing <b>3102</b> can be curved so as to facilitate easy routing thereof behind the ear. Speaker <b>3200</b> can be worn directly behind the ear, behind the ear at the neck, in front of the ear, in the ear, or at any other desired location. Either acoustic tubing <b>3102</b> from speaker <b>3200</b> or electrical cable <b>3106</b> to speaker <b>3200</b> can pass by or behind the ear. Barbed fitting <b>3103</b> can be an elbow fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">Acoustic tubing <b>3102</b> can be attached to speaker <b>3200</b>, such as via a barbed fitting <b>3202</b>. Speaker <b>3200</b> can comprise upper <b>3500</b> and lower <b>3800</b> housings. A multi-conductor electrical cable <b>3106</b> can extend from speaker <b>3200</b> to a connector, such as female connector <b>3300</b> that electrically connects upper portion <b>3100</b> of the cable assembly to lower portion <b>31300</b>. For example, electrical cable <b>3106</b> can comprise two conductors that facilitate operation of speaker <b>3200</b>. Strain relief <b>3108</b> can be provided for electrical cable <b>3106</b> at connector <b>3300</b>. Electrical cable <b>3106</b> can comprise coils <b>3107</b> that allow it to stretch as necessary to fit a particular individual.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Electrical cable <b>3106</b> can provide electrical signals to speaker <b>3200</b>. Speaker <b>3200</b> can convert such electrical signals into acoustic signals representative thereof (and generally representative of speech or music such as that received from a cellular telephone, music device, or the like).</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>, lower cable assembly <b>31300</b> can comprise a microphone <b>31400</b> that is configured to attach to the user's clothing, such as proximate the user's mouth. For example, microphone <b>31400</b> can clip to the user's lapel. A connector, such as male connector <b>31301</b>, can facilitate electrical connection of lower cable assembly <b>31300</b> to upper portion of cable assembly <b>3100</b> to define a complete cable assembly, as mentioned above. The microphone <b>31400</b> can be omitted for applications that do not require it, such as listening to a music device.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">A connector <b>31302</b>, such as a stereo phono plug, can be used to connect lower cable assembly <b>31300</b> (and consequently the complete cable assembly) to a personal electronic device.

<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Cable <b>31303</b> facilitates electrical connection between microphone <b>31400</b> and connector <b>31302</b>. Similarly, cable <b>31304</b> facilitates electrical connection between upper portion of cable assembly <b>3100</b> and connector <b>31302</b>. Cable <b>31303</b> and cable <b>31304</b> can join at Y-joint <b>31306</b> to form single cable <b>31305</b>. Y-joint <b>31306</b> can comprise a housing similar in construction to the speaker housing. Cable <b>31303</b> can be omitted for use with a music device.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">More particularly, an upper Y-joint housing portion <b>31311</b> and a lower Y-joint housing portion <b>31312</b> can be formed of a durable, substantially rigid material. For example, upper Y-joint housing portion <b>31311</b> and lower Y-joint housing portion <b>31312</b> can be formed of a metal or alloy, such as a metal or alloy comprised of aluminum (anodized aluminum, for example), titanium, magnesium, or steel. Alternatively, upper Y-joint housing portion <b>31311</b> and lower portion <b>31312</b> can be formed of a polymer, such as ABS, polycarbonate, or high density polyethylene. Upper portion <b>31311</b> can attach to lower portion <b>31312</b> via threads, friction fit, adhesive bonding, ultrasonic welding, or by any other desired method. A push to talk (PTT) switch <b>31904</b> can optionally be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Microphone <b>31400</b> can be removably attachable to lower cable assembly <b>31300</b>, such as via a connector.

<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>, the attachments <b>320</b> can be provided in a variety of sizes, i.e., outer diameters and/or cross-sectional configurations, so as to facilitate fitting of the extension to a variety of sizes and configurations of ear canals <b>509</b>. For example, an attachment can be one of o-rings <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b>. O-rings <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b> can have an outer diameter, dimension A, that is between approximately 4 mm and approximately 12 mm. The o-rings <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b> can have an inner diameter of between approximately 2 mm and approximately 4 mm. The o-rings <b>3121</b> and <b>3122</b> can have a minor diameter of between approximately 1 mm and approximately 6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">As used herein, the term &#x201c;minor diameter&#x201d; can be defined as the diameter of a cross-section of the material of the attachment or o-ring, as designated by dimension C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>, the cross-sectional configuration of the attachment <b>320</b> can alternatively be non-circular. For example, the cross-sectional configuration of the attachment can be more rectangular or square. The attachments <b>320</b> can have any desired cross-sectional configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>, an attachment <b>3110</b> can have two substantially flat surfaces. For example, the surface <b>3101</b> that contacts the stem <b>315</b> and the surface <b>3111</b> that is opposite the flange <b>318</b> can be flat. The surface <b>3104</b> that contacts the flange <b>318</b> can be rounded so as to better conform to the shape of the flange <b>318</b>. By making the surface <b>3101</b> that contacts the stem <b>315</b> flat, the attachment <b>3110</b> is less likely to move undesirably upon the stem <b>315</b>. Making the surface <b>3111</b> opposite the flange <b>318</b> flat provides a better fit of the attachment <b>3110</b> to the extension <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>, the attachment <b>3110</b> is shown installed upon the extension <b>312</b>. Surface <b>3101</b> encircles and generally contacts stem <b>315</b>. Surface <b>3111</b> is opposite flange <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">A method of fitting an extension can comprise attaching at least one attachment to a stem. The attachments can be selected from a plurality of available attachments of various sizes, shapes, and/or material. The sizes, shapes, and/or materials can be selected so as to compliment the size and shape of the user's ear canal <b>509</b>. That is, larger attachments (those having larger outer diameters) can be selected for positions upon the stem corresponding to larger (larger inner diameter) portions of the user's ear canal <b>509</b>. The attachments can be selected such that when the stem is disposed within the ear canal <b>509</b>, then the attachment contacts tissue of the ear canal <b>509</b> about a substantial portion of the periphery thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Attachments can be selected during the fitting process by either the use of measurements or by trial and error. The ear canal <b>509</b> can be measured, either quantitatively or qualitatively, and the size of the attachment can be determined from such measurements. Either alternatively or in combination with such measurements, attachments can be tried and used or not used based upon their comfort and effectiveness.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">One or more embodiments can be used to mitigate exposure to ambient sound. For example, one or more embodiments can be used alone, e.g., without an electronic device. Alternatively, one or more embodiments can be used with an electronic device such as a two-way radio, a cellular telephone, a computer, a music device, or the like. When used with an electronic device, the extension can still mitigate exposure to ambient sound.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">In one embodiment, an earpiece assembly (e.g., including an earpiece and an extension in this embodiment) can further include a housing within which the speaker is disposed and via which the speaker is attached to the earpiece. The housing can be formed of a metal such as aluminum. Alternatively, the housing can be formed of a polymer such as ABS or polycarbonate. Indeed, the housing can comprise any desired combination of materials. For example, the body of the housing can comprise aluminum and the cap of the housing can comprise ABS.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">According to an embodiment, the earpiece assembly can comprise a microphone either in addition to or in place of the speaker. The use of a microphone facilitates the use of the earpiece assembly in two way communications, such as via a cellular telephone or a two-way radio. A single transducer can function as both a microphone and a speaker.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">The microphone and speaker can be disposed within the same housing. Alternatively, the microphone and speaker can be disposed within separate housings. The microphone can be disposed upon a boom. For example, the microphone can be disposed upon a boom that extends from the housing to a point proximate a corner of the user's mouth. The microphone can be disposed at a point approximately one half of the way between the housing and the corner of the user's mouth.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">One or more cables can extend from the housing so as to effect electrical communication with the microphone and/or speaker. For example, an electrical cable containing two pairs of wires can extend from the housing to a two-way radio. One pair of wires can communicate received voice from the radio to the speaker and the other pair of wires can communicate voice from the microphone to the radio.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The speaker can comprise a balanced armature speaker. Alternatively, the speaker can be any other desired type of speaker.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">According to an embodiment, the earpiece assembly can comprise an extension attached to one side of the earpiece via a friction fit and a housing having a barbed fitting attached to another side of the earpiece by inserting the barbed fitting through the earpiece and into the insert. Thus, the barbed fitting of the housing can attach the housing, earpiece, and extension to one another. Adhesive bonding, ultrasonic welding, and/or any other method can be used to enhance such attachment.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The earpiece and the extension can be integrally formed with one another. The earpiece and the extension can be formed of the same material. Similarly, the earpiece, the extension, and the housing can be integrally formed with one another. The earpiece, the extension, and the housing can be formed of the same material.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>, an earpiece assembly may include an earpiece <b>4101</b> with a microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> (e.g., a microphone, a speaker, and/or electronic circuitry, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 37</figref>) attached thereto. The earpiece <b>4101</b> can be configured to fit within a concha of a user's ear. The microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> can be disposed within a housing <b>4102</b> and can be attached to the earpiece <b>4101</b> via the housing <b>4102</b>. The housing <b>4102</b>, and consequently the microphone/speaker <b>4201</b>, can be disposed within the concha, outside of the concha, or partially inside and partially outside of the concha. Optionally, the housing <b>4102</b> can be omitted and the microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> can be attached more directly to the earpiece <b>4101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Optionally, an extension <b>4103</b> can be attached to the earpiece <b>4101</b>. The extension can be configured to extend into a user's ear canal <b>509</b>. The extension <b>4103</b> can be configured so as to direct sound from the microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> through the ear canal <b>509</b> to the eardrum of a user. For example, sound from the microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> can travel through a bore (<b>4501</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref>) of the housing <b>4102</b>, through a bore (<b>4301</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 37 and 38</figref>) in the earpiece <b>4101</b>, and through a bore (<b>4401</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>) in the extension <b>4103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">An electrical cable <b>4110</b> can extend from housing <b>4102</b>. The cable <b>4110</b> can comprise a plurality of conductors for communicating electrical signals representative of sound with the microphone and/or speaker of the earpiece assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">Electronic circuitry of microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> can comprise an attenuator, amplifier, filter, or other sound processing circuitry. Such circuitry can comprise a microprocessor and/or digital sound processing circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> can comprise a wireless microphone that receives a radio signal and converts the radio signal into sound. The radio signal can be received from a local source and/or a remote source. The radio signal can be received from a local source such as the user's own two-way radio. For example, the speaker output of the user's two-way radio can be re-modulated and transmitted to the microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> so as to define a wireless link between the two-way radio and the microphone/speaker <b>4201</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The radio signal can be received from a remote source such as a remotely located two-way radio (someone else's two-way radio). In this manner, someone else can communicate covertly with the user (the user does not need to carry a two-way radio).</p>

<p id="p-0224" num="0223">One or more apertures <b>4511</b> and <b>4512</b> facilitate the introduction of conductors, e.g., electrical cables, into the housing <b>4102</b> so as to provide electrical communication between the microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> and a radio or the like. Apertures <b>4511</b> and <b>4512</b> can be used to mount boom microphone <b>4602</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">The housing <b>4102</b> containing the microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> can be attached to the earpiece <b>4101</b> and the extension <b>4103</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>. Alternatively, the housing <b>4102</b> can be attached to the earpiece <b>4101</b> and the extension <b>4103</b> can be omitted. As a further alternative, the housing <b>4102</b> can be attached to the extension <b>4103</b>, and the earpiece <b>4101</b> can be omitted.</p>

For example, the microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> can be attached to or embedded within the earpiece <b>4101</b> and/or the extension <b>4103</b>. The microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> can be attached to or embedded within the earpiece <b>4101</b> and the extension <b>4103</b> can be omitted. The microphone and/or speaker <b>4201</b> can be attached to or embedded within the extension <b>4103</b>, and the earpiece <b>4101</b> can be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">One or more barbs <b>4503</b> can be formed upon tube <b>4502</b>, such as upon the inner end thereof, so as to facilitate secure attachment of housing <b>4102</b> to earpiece <b>4101</b> and/or extension <b>4103</b>. The barb(s) <b>4503</b> can engage the bore <b>4401</b> of extension <b>4103</b>. Other means for facilitating secure attachment of the housing <b>4102</b> to the tube <b>4502</b> can be used. For example, threads can be formed upon the tube <b>4502</b> for securely attaching the tube <b>4502</b> into the bore <b>4401</b> of extension <b>4103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, a boom microphone <b>4602</b> can be mounted to the distal end of boom <b>4601</b>. The boom <b>4601</b> can be attached to housing <b>4102</b>, such as via one of the apertures <b>4511</b> and <b>4512</b>. The boom <b>4601</b> can be attached to housing <b>4102</b> via threads, adhesive bonding, or any other desired method.

<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Boom microphone <b>4602</b> can be used with or instead of the microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> disposed within housing <b>4102</b>. Thus, either microphone can be used alone or both microphones can be used together.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">The microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> disposed within housing <b>4102</b> can be used to provide processed, e.g., amplified and/or filtered, ambient sound to the user (in a manner similar to that of a hearing aid) and the boom microphone <b>4602</b> can be used to provide voice from the user to a two-way radio or cellular telephone. The microphone/speaker <b>4201</b> disposed within housing <b>4102</b> can be used to provide voice from the user to a two-way radio or cellular telephone.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">The boom <b>4601</b> can be a telescoping boom. The use of a telescoping boom readily facilitates changes in the length thereof, so as to facilitate desired placement of the boom microphone <b>4602</b>. The boom <b>4601</b> can be a bendable boom.

<p id="p-0232" num="0231">According to an embodiment, a method for assembling an earpiece assembly comprises inserting an outer end of a flanged extension into an aperture on an inner side of an earpiece and inserting a barbed fitting of a housing through an aperture on an outer side of the earpiece and into a bore of the flanged extension.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">One or more embodiments eliminate the use of acoustic tubing so as to provide enhanced audio quality to the user. Elimination of acoustic tubing tends to provide a higher intensity audio signal to the user because sound is not attenuated by the acoustic tubing. Thus, the volume of the radio, cellular telephone, music device or the like can be reduced. A smaller, lower wattage speaker can be used since the speaker does not require the additional power necessary to compensate for attenuation caused by acoustic tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">The elimination of acoustic tubing also facilitates the construction of a smaller, lighter, more comfortable, and less conspicuous earpiece assembly. The earpiece assembly is smaller and lighter because it does not have the extra weight and bulk of the acoustic tubing.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">The earpiece assembly is more comfortable because the electrical cable that passes over the ear to communicate a signal representative of sound is substantially smaller than acoustic tubing. In one embodiment, acoustic tubing can be one eighth of an inch in outer diameter. In one embodiment, an electrical cable can be one thirty-second of an inch to one sixteenth of an inch in outer diameter, or even smaller. The use of such smaller electrical cable in place of the larger acoustic tubing makes the earpiece assembly substantially less obtrusive and conspicuous.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref>, a left human ear or pinna <b>500</b> typically has anatomical structures such as a cymba concha <b>501</b>, a concha bowl <b>508</b>, a ridge <b>502</b> of the concha bowl <b>508</b>, a cavum concha <b>503</b>, an antitragus <b>504</b>, a tragus <b>505</b>, a helix <b>507</b>, a crus <b>506</b> of helix <b>507</b>, and an antihelix <b>510</b>. The right pinna (not shown) is generally similar to the left pima <b>500</b> and can be substantially a mirror image thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">According to an embodiment, examples of grab points <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> are provided by at least some of the various anatomical structures of the pinna <b>500</b>. The grab points <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> and/or anatomical structures of the ear proximate the grab points <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> can grab or otherwise hold, capture, and/or maintain the earpiece <b>111</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, for example) within the pinna <b>500</b>, e.g., within the concha bowl <b>508</b> thereof. For example, the grab points <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> can define detents, grabbers, locks, fingers, tabs, or other structures or features that engage the earpiece <b>111</b> and mechanically limit undesirable movement of the earpiece <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">Thus, the grab points <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> can tend to resist movement of the earpiece <b>111</b>. More particularly, the grab points <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> can tend to resist movement of the earpiece <b>111</b> that would result in separation of the earpiece <b>111</b> from the pinna <b>500</b>. The grab points <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> can capture the earpiece <b>111</b> substantially within the concha bowl <b>508</b>. The grab points <b>1</b>-<b>7</b> can tend to resist other movement of the earpiece <b>111</b>. For example, the grab points can tend to resist translational or rotational movement of the earpiece <b>111</b> that would move the earpiece <b>111</b> away from a desired position substantially within the concha bowl <b>508</b>. The earpiece <b>111</b> can be configured to complement a portion of the pinna <b>500</b>, so as to facilitate the use of the grab points <b>1</b>-<b>7</b>. For example, the earpiece <b>111</b> can be substantially a mirror image of one or more portions of the pinna <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">According to an embodiment, a first grab point <b>1</b> can be at a forward and uppermost end of the cymba concha <b>501</b>.

<p id="p-0240" num="0239">According to an embodiment, a second grab point <b>2</b> can be located where a top rim <b>172</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the earpiece <b>111</b> fits snugly under or puts pressure against a top part of the ridge <b>502</b> of the concha bowl <b>508</b>. According to an embodiment, a third grab point <b>3</b> can be the underneath lower portion <b>173</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the earpiece <b>111</b> when the earpiece <b>111</b> is placed within the concha bowl <b>508</b>. The lower portion <b>173</b> of the earpiece <b>111</b> can be captured beneath the crus <b>506</b> of helix <b>507</b>. According to an embodiment, a middle front part <b>174</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the earpiece <b>111</b> can go over the crus <b>506</b> of helix <b>507</b> and slightly into the ear canal <b>509</b> to define a fourth grab point <b>4</b> on top of and underneath the crus <b>506</b> of helix <b>507</b>. According to an embodiment, a fifth grab point <b>5</b> can extend from where a top part of the cavum concha <b>503</b> splits into the narrow flexible ring that forms itself to the backside of the concha bowl <b>508</b>. The fifth grab point <b>5</b> can grab the back side <b>175</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the earpiece <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">According to an embodiment, a sixth grab point <b>6</b> can be defined at the bottom of the pinna <b>500</b>. The sixth grab point <b>6</b> can grab the earpiece <b>111</b> at the flare <b>176</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) of the earpiece <b>111</b>. The flare <b>176</b> can continue around to the underside of the antitragus <b>504</b> and the rim of the outer portion of the ear canal <b>509</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">According to an embodiment, a seventh grab point <b>7</b> can be defined. The seventh grab point can be defined by the underside of the tragus <b>505</b>. The seventh grab point <b>7</b> can grab the lower portion <b>173</b> of the earpiece <b>111</b>. According to some embodiments, a structure such as the top of the protrusion <b>20</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref>) and/or a structure such as the top of the extension <b>112</b> or <b>212</b>, or stem <b>115</b>, <b>215</b>, or <b>4402</b>, can contact the ear proximate grab point <b>4</b> and/or a structure such as the bottom of the protrusion <b>20</b> and/or a structure such as the bottom of the extension <b>112</b> or <b>212</b>, or stem <b>115</b>, <b>215</b>, or <b>4402</b>, can contact the ear proximate grab point <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">According to various embodiments, additional grab points can be provided. For example, an eighth grab point (not shown) and a ninth grab point (not shown) can be provided within the ear canal <b>509</b> by using an ergonomically shaped extension (such as extension <b>112</b> or <b>212</b>) or stem (such as stem <b>115</b>, <b>215</b>, or <b>4402</b>). By use of the term ergonomic, it can be meant that the extension or stem substantially conforms to the direction of a first bend of the ear canal <b>509</b>. Thus, the extension or stem can slide into the ear canal <b>509</b> more easily and can tend to center itself into the central portion of the ear canal <b>509</b>. The extension or stem can apply pressure to the bottom of the ear canal <b>509</b> or to all of the ear canal <b>509</b> so as to seal the ear canal <b>509</b> and thus provide sound attenuation.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">According to an embodiment, the extension or stem can be short and have no flanges. The extension or stem can push up against the top part of the ear canal <b>509</b> to fault yet another grab point. The ergonomic aspects of the extension or stem can keep an opening (such as from which sound is directed toward the ear drum) formed in the extension or stem generally centered within the ear canal <b>509</b>. Thus, the extension or stem can be configured such that the distal end of the extension or stem does not undesirably abut a wall of the ear canal <b>509</b> in the manner that a straight earplug does.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">In another embodiment, a further grab point may be provided by the tragus <b>505</b> and the antitragus <b>504</b>. In this regard, in an embodiment where an earpiece (e.g., earpiece <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) is provided with a lower lobe (e.g., lower lobe <b>16</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), such a lower lobe may be positioned between the tragus <b>505</b> and the antitragus <b>504</b> which may press against the lower lobe to assist in holding the earpiece in place and resist movement thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">The configuration and size of the anatomical structures and features of the human ear can vary substantially from one individual to another. Not all of the described grab points will necessarily limit the motion of the earpiece <b>111</b> in every instance. In some ears, only a portion of the grab points will limit the motion of the earpiece <b>111</b>. Other anatomical structures or features of the ear can function as grab points. Thus, the discussion and illustration of grab points is by way of example only, and not by way of limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">There is a common problem associated with the use of contemporary earplugs, whereby the earplugs can be pushed further and further into the ear canal <b>509</b>. Over time, as the earplugs are worn, the ear becomes desensitized to the presence of the earplugs. Because of this desensitization, a user can tend to push the contemporary earplugs further into the ear canal <b>509</b> with each subsequent use. Of course, it is not desirable to push the earplugs further and further into the ear canal <b>509</b>. When pushed in too far, an earplug can cause substantial discomfort and damage to the eardrum.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">According to an embodiment, the earpiece <b>111</b> keeps the extension <b>112</b> from being pushed past the second turn of the ear canal <b>509</b>. A contemporary earplug (which lacks the earpiece <b>111</b>) can be undesirably pushed past the second turn of the ear canal <b>509</b> after the ear canal <b>509</b> has become desensitized to the earplug, as discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">Further, there are situations in which a person wearing earplugs is subjected to rapid compression. For example, the person can be descending while scuba diving, flying, or skydiving. In such situations, contemporary earplugs can be undesirably pushed further into the ear canal <b>509</b>, potentially to the point of contacting and/or damaging the eardrum.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">According to various embodiments, the Hocks filter <b>151</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and/or the bore <b>122</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) allow air to pass through the earpiece <b>111</b> and/or the extension <b>112</b>. When air passes through the earpiece <b>111</b> and/or the extension <b>112</b>, pressure within the ear canal <b>509</b> can tend to equalize with respect to pressure outside of the ear canal <b>509</b>. Thus, the extension <b>112</b> can be inhibited from being pushed further into the ear canal <b>509</b> by such increasing external pressure. The earpiece <b>111</b> also inhibits the extension <b>112</b> from being pushed further into the ear canal <b>509</b> by such increasing pressure, for example. According to an embodiment, the earpiece <b>111</b> can be configured such that at least one grab point of an ear tends to hold the earpiece <b>111</b> within the ear. More particularly, the earpiece <b>111</b> can be configured such that the grab points are defined by anatomical structures as discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43-48</figref>, various views of an earpiece <b>4300</b> are shown, according to an embodiment. As with the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref>, the lower lobe (such as lower lobe <b>16</b> of the earpiece <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), is omitted. Rather, instead of such a lower lobe, a smooth rounded surface <b>17</b> is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">The generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> can have an upper end <b>4304</b> and a lower end <b>4305</b>. A generally vertical rib <b>12</b> can extend substantially between the upper end <b>4304</b> and the lower end <b>4305</b>, and an upper lobe <b>15</b> can be formed at the upper end of the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b>. A smooth bend <b>17</b> can be formed at the lower end of the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b>. The earpiece can be configured to be generally shaped like a D. However, those skilled in the art will appreciate that other embodiments are likewise suitable. For example, either the generally vertical rib <b>12</b> or the generally arcuate rib <b>11</b> can be modified substantially or omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">Similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-C</figref>, the earpiece <b>4300</b> can further comprise a protrusion <b>20</b> having a bore <b>21</b> formed therethrough. The protrusion <b>20</b> can be configured to extend at least partially into the ear canal <b>509</b>. The bore <b>21</b> can transmit sound, such as from a two-way radio, to the wearer's eardrum. Alternatively, the bore <b>21</b> can be occluded or omitted so as to facilitate hearing protection.</p>

<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 49-57</figref> and <b>63</b>-<b>65</b>, an earpiece <b>4900</b> can comprise a generally arcuate rib <b>4901</b>. Earpiece <b>4900</b> includes an upper lobe <b>4904</b>. An upper end <b>4911</b> of the generally arcuate rib <b>4901</b> can be connected to a lower end <b>4912</b> of the generally arcuate rib <b>4901</b> via a generally vertical rib <b>4903</b> and/or annulus <b>4902</b>. The annulus <b>4902</b> can have a cover <b>4905</b>. The cover <b>4905</b> can be either partial, as shown, or can be substantially complete such that the cover substantially closes the annulus <b>4902</b>. The cover <b>4905</b> can be formed on the inboard (toward the head) side of the annulus <b>4902</b> and/or on the outboard (away from the head) side of the annulus <b>4902</b>. The annulus <b>4902</b> can be approximately centered with respect to the outer opening of the ear canal <b>509</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 58-65</figref>, an attachment <b>5800</b> can be configured to mate with the earpiece <b>4900</b>. For example, the attachment <b>5800</b> can have a generally cylindrical protrusion <b>5801</b> that is configured to be received within the annulus <b>4902</b> such that the attachment <b>5800</b> can rotate with respect to the earpiece <b>4900</b>. The protrusion <b>5801</b> can define a male member and the annulus <b>4902</b> can define a female member.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">The attachment <b>5800</b> can have a speaker. For example, the protrusion <b>5801</b> can either be a speaker and/or can contain a speaker. The attachment <b>5800</b> can have an extension <b>5802</b>. The extension <b>5802</b> can be connected to the protrusion <b>5801</b> via a neck <b>5803</b>, for example. The extension <b>5802</b> can be oriented, e.g., rotated, to extend generally downwardly from the earpiece <b>4900</b>. The extension <b>5802</b> can have a microphone <b>5804</b> disposed proximate the distal end thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">The extension <b>5802</b> can be a portion of a communications cable, a wireless telecommunications device (e.g., a wireless audio headphone or a Bluetooth&#xae; headset with headphone and microphone), an audio headphone (e.g., an earbud), an earplug, or other type of device configured to mate with the earpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">The terms &#x201c;stem,&#x201d; &#x201c;protrusion,&#x201d; &#x201c;extension,&#x201d; &#x201c;insert,&#x201d; &#x201c;ear insert,&#x201d; and the like can refer to a structure that protrudes from the earpiece and that can be configured to extend into the ear canal <b>509</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">One or more embodiments of the present invention provide an earpiece that is more comfortable, less costly, easier to inventory, and more effective with respect to contemporary earpieces.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">Although described herein as being for use in human ears, one or more embodiments can also be used in non-human ears. For example, an embodiment can be configured for canine ears, so as to mitigate noise exposure and or facilitate communication with police or military dogs. As those skilled in the art will appreciate, such dogs are commonly exposed to noisy environments, such as those environments sometimes encountered in police work and on the battlefield. Further, it is frequently desirable to communicate with such dogs. Their ability to respond to radio commands has been established.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">Although both communications and hearing protection embodiments are disclosed, it is worthwhile to appreciate that both embodiments can possess attributes of one another and that the distinction between the embodiments is not always clear. For example, communication embodiments can have features and functions of hearing protection. Communication embodiments can substantially mitigate exposure to ambient sound. Features discussed herein in conjunction with one embodiment may be used in the other embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">In view of the foregoing, embodiments provide sound protection and/or communications facilitation in a manner that is comfortable, unobtrusive (and thus suitable for covert use), and effective. The earpiece is less likely to loosen or fall out as compared to contemporary earpieces or earplugs.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">Embodiments described above illustrate but do not limit the invention. Thus, it should also be understood that numerous modifications and variations are possible in accordance with the principles of the present invention. Accordingly, the scope of the invention is defined only by the following claims.</p>
