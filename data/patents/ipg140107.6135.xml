<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention is generally in the field of semiconductors. More specifically, the present invention is in the field of fabrication of capacitors in semiconductor wafers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Various types of capacitors, such as composite capacitors comprising several interconnected capacitors, are used in circuits in semiconductor devices, such as mixers and amplifiers, and are required to provide high capacitance density without consuming a large area on a semiconductor die (also referred to simply as a &#x201c;die&#x201d;). A composite capacitor can include multiple stacked layers, where each layer of the capacitor can reside in a different metal layer of a die and be electrically connected to other capacitor layers by vias. During a typical design cycle, a circuit layout design including a capacitor, such as a composite capacitor, can be verified by fabricating the circuit including the capacitor in a small-scale engineering or pilot foundry. After the layout design has been verified, the circuit including the capacitor can be mass produced in a production foundry to reduce manufacturing cost.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, for a variety of reasons, the process parameters utilized to fabricate a capacitor in one foundry may not match the process parameters utilized to fabricate the capacitor in another foundry, thereby causing the capacitor to have a different capacitance value in each foundry. For example, a process parameter, such as a dielectric constant value of a dielectric material, can be higher in a production foundry as compared with the dielectric constant in a small-scale engineering foundry. As a result, the capacitance value of the capacitor needs to be adjusted in the production foundry to match the capacitance value of the capacitor in the small-scale engineering foundry.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a conventional approach, the layout of the capacitor can be manually redesigned to cause the capacitance value of the capacitor in the production foundry to match the capacitance value of the capacitor in the small-scale engineering foundry. However, manually redesigning the layout of the capacitor can undesirably increase manufacturing cost and requires the data files, such as such as Graphic Data System (GDS) data files including the layout of the capacitor, to be regenerated for &#x201c;tape-out&#x201d; to the production foundry. Moreover, according to conventional approaches, redesigning the capacitor layout usually causes an undesirable change in the die area consumed by the capacitor.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The present invention is directed to a method for adjusting capacitance of capacitors without affecting die area. The following description contains specific information pertaining to the implementation of the present invention. One skilled in the art will recognize that the present invention may be implemented in a manner different from that specifically discussed in the present application. Moreover, some of the specific details of the invention are not discussed in order not to obscure the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The drawings in the present application and their accompanying detailed description are directed to merely exemplary embodiments of the invention. To maintain brevity, other embodiments of the present invention are not specifically described in the present application and are not specifically illustrated by the present drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a top view of capacitor <b>102</b> in standard cell <b>104</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Capacitor <b>102</b>, which can be a composite capacitor comprising several interconnected capacitors, includes conductive segments <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> and conductive fingers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, and <b>120</b> (hereinafter &#x201c;conductive fingers <b>110</b> through <b>120</b>&#x201d;). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, capacitor <b>102</b> resides in standard cell <b>104</b>, which can be repeated in multiple metal layers in die to form a composite capacitor having multiple stacked capacitor layers. For example, standard cell <b>104</b> can be repeated in a first metal layer (i.e. M<b>1</b>), a second metal layer (i.e. M<b>2</b>), and so forth to form a composite capacitor having multiple stacked layers. Each of the stacked layers of capacitor <b>102</b> can be substantially identical in geometry, orientation, and dimensions. For example, if conductive finger <b>114</b> is situated in a third metal layer (i.e. M<b>3</b>) in the die, conductive finger <b>114</b> can be situated directly above and in alignment with a corresponding conductive finger in M<b>2</b> and/or situated directly below and in alignment with a corresponding conductive finger in a fourth metal layer (i.e. M<b>4</b>) in the die. In an embodiment of the invention in which capacitor <b>102</b> is situated in a die having seven metal layers, for example, standard cell <b>104</b> can be repeated in M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, M<b>3</b>, M<b>4</b>, a fifth metal layer (i.e. M<b>5</b>), a sixth metal layer (i.e. M<b>6</b>), and the seventh metal layer (i.e. M<b>7</b>) in the die. In one embodiment, standard cell <b>104</b> can be repeated horizontally in one metal layer of a semiconductor die to form a single layer composite capacitor. Capacitor <b>102</b> can be utilized in mixers, amplifiers, or other semiconductor devices that utilize analog circuits. However, capacitor <b>102</b> can be generally utilized in any semiconductor device that utilizes a capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, conductive fingers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>114</b> are electrically connected to connective segment <b>108</b>, conductive fingers <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, and <b>120</b> are electrically connected to conductive segment <b>108</b>, and conductive fingers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>114</b> are interlaced with conductive fingers <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, and <b>120</b>. One electrode of capacitor <b>102</b> can include conductive segment <b>106</b> and conductive fingers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, and <b>114</b> and another electrode of capacitor <b>102</b> can include conductive segment <b>108</b> and conductive fingers <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, and <b>120</b>. In the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, capacitor <b>102</b> includes three conductive fingers electrically connected to each conductive segment. In other embodiments, capacitor <b>102</b> can include more than three or less than three conductive fingers electrically connected to each conductive segment. Conductive segments <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> and conductive fingers <b>110</b> through <b>120</b> can each comprise, for example, a metal or metal stack. In one embodiment, conductive segments <b>106</b> and <b>108</b> and conductive fingers <b>110</b> through <b>120</b> can comprise a conductive material other than metal.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment of the invention, the geometry of capacitor <b>102</b> can be adjusted to adjust the capacitance value of the capacitor by changing a length of one or more conductive fingers of the capacitor. For example, the geometry of capacitor <b>102</b> can be adjusted to change its capacitance value by reducing the length of conductive finger <b>116</b> from length <b>126</b> to length <b>128</b> while leaving conductive fingers <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b>, <b>118</b>, and <b>120</b> at length <b>126</b> in one embodiment. One or more conductive fingers of capacitor <b>102</b> can be trimmed in steps to achieve a desired decrease in the capacitance value of capacitor <b>102</b>. For example, conductive finger <b>116</b> can be trimmed to length <b>128</b> in two steps to achieve a 4.0 percent reduction in capacitance, where each step represents a 2.0 percent reduction in capacitance.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">To maintain the effectiveness of the conductive fingers, each conductive finger in capacitor <b>102</b> can be limited to a maximum reduction in length of approximately 50.0 percent in one embodiment. Thus, conductive fingers <b>110</b> through <b>120</b> can each be trimmed to approximately one half of length <b>126</b> (i.e. an untrimmed length of each conductive finger), which is indicated by dashed line <b>130</b>. In one embodiment, a 10.0 percent reduction in capacitance value of capacitor <b>102</b> can be achieved by trimming conductive finger <b>116</b> to one half of its length to achieve a 6.0 percent reduction in capacitance value and by further trimming conductive finger <b>110</b> to achieve an additional 4.0 percent reduction in capacitance value. In one embodiment, a combination of conductive fingers <b>110</b> through <b>120</b> can be trimmed to achieve a maximum reduction in capacitance value of approximately 30.0 percent for capacitor <b>102</b>. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, each of conductive fingers <b>110</b> through <b>120</b> has width <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, capacitor <b>102</b> has dimensions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> and consumes an area on the semiconductor die substantially equal to the product of dimensions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b>. Dimensions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> can also refer to the dimensions of standard cell <b>104</b>. In the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the geometry of capacitor <b>102</b> can be adjusted by changing the length of one or more of conductive fingers <b>110</b> through <b>120</b> without changing the dimensions and geometry of standard cell <b>104</b> and, consequently, without changing the die area consumed by capacitor <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, capacitor <b>102</b> can be designed according to minimum design rule specifications to minimize its die area.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The fabrication of capacitor <b>102</b> will now be discussed according to an embodiment of the invention. Initially, a tape-out of a data file, such as a GDS (Graphic Data System) data file, including a layout design of an IC including capacitor <b>102</b>, can be sent to a pilot foundry (also referred to as an &#x201c;engineering foundry&#x201d; in the present application), which can be a small-scale foundry, for design verification. The pilot foundry typically has a stringent production schedule and utilizes high quality materials. The IC including capacitor <b>102</b> can be fabricated in the pilot foundry by utilizing a set process parameters, such as a dielectric constant value of a dielectric material and a thickness of the dielectric material. After the design has been verified in the pilot foundry, a tape-out of the data file, such as a GDS data file, can be sent to a production foundry, which can be a large-scale foundry, for mass production.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">However, one of more process parameters, such as dielectric constant value, metal resistance, or dielectric material thickness, utilized in the pilot foundry can be different than the corresponding process parameters utilized in the production foundry. For an advanced process technologies, such as 40 nanometer (nm) process technology and beyond, there can be a significant difference between process parameters utilized in the pilot foundry and process parameter utilized in the production foundry. For example, the pilot foundry may utilize a low-k dielectric material having a low dielectric constant value and the production foundry may utilize a low-k dielectric material having a higher dielectric constant value. As a result of a difference in process parameters, the capacitance value of capacitor <b>102</b> can vary between the pilot foundry and the production foundry.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In a situation where a difference in process parameters causes capacitor <b>102</b> to have a higher capacitance value in the production foundry compared to the pilot foundry, the geometry of capacitor <b>102</b> in standard cell <b>104</b> can be adjusted to match the capacitance value of the capacitor resulting from fabrication in the pilot foundry. For example, the geometry of capacitor <b>102</b> can be adjusted by appropriately trimming at least one of conductive fingers <b>110</b> through <b>120</b> so as to adjust the capacitance value of capacitor <b>102</b> in the production foundry to match the capacitance value of the capacitor in the pilot foundry.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In an embodiment of the invention, the adjustment of the capacitance value of capacitor <b>102</b> can be advantageously accomplished without changing (i.e. increasing or decreasing) the die area or capacitor area of capacitor <b>102</b>. Thus, the dimensions and geometry of standard cell <b>104</b> remain substantially unchanged when capacitor <b>102</b> is fabricated in the production foundry. The geometry of capacitor <b>102</b> can be adjusted by, for example, providing an automatic trimming adjustment of the layout design data file, such as the GDS data file, during tape-out to the production foundry. As such, an embodiment of the invention advantageously avoids manually redesigning the layout of the capacitor and requiring the date file to be regenerated for tape-out to the production foundry. Also, an embodiment of the invention provides an adjustment to the geometry of capacitor <b>102</b> without causing an undesirable change in the die area consumed by the capacitor. Further, adjusting the geometry of capacitor <b>102</b> in standard cell <b>104</b> can be accomplished without causing redesign or resimulation of a circuit that includes capacitor <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Thus, once the layout design has been verified in the pilot foundry, the layout design data file, such as a GDS data file, can be automatically offset to accommodate a difference in process parameters between the pilot foundry and a production foundry. In contrast, a conventional approach for adjusting a capacitance value of a capacitor, such as a composite capacitor, requires manually changing the layout design of the capacitor and the data file for tape-out to the production foundry, which can undesirably change the die area of the capacitor and increase manufacturing cost.</p>

Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, capacitor <b>402</b> has dimensions <b>430</b> and <b>432</b> and consumes an area on the semiconductor die substantially equal to the product of dimensions <b>430</b> and <b>432</b>, which also refer to the dimensions of standard cell <b>404</b>. In the embodiment of the invention in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the geometry of capacitor <b>402</b> can be adjusted to change the capacitance value of capacitor <b>402</b> by appropriately changing (i.e. increasing or decreasing) a width of one or more of conductive fingers <b>410</b> through <b>420</b>, as discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The fabrication of capacitor <b>402</b> will now be discussed according to an embodiment of the invention. Initially, a tape-out of a data file, such as a GDS data file, including a layout design of an IC including capacitor <b>402</b>, can be sent to a pilot foundry, which can be a small-scale foundry, for design verification. Capacitor <b>402</b> can be sent to the pilot foundry having each of conductive fingers <b>410</b> through <b>420</b> at initial width <b>434</b> in a standard cell having dimensions <b>430</b> and <b>432</b>. A wafer including the composite capacitor can be fabricated in the pilot foundry by utilizing a first set process parameters, which can include a dielectric constant of the dielectric material and a thickness of the dielectric material. After the design has been verified at the pilot foundry, a tape-out of the data file, such as a GDS data file, can be sent to a production foundry, which can be a large-scale foundry, for mass production.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The production foundry can utilize a second set of process parameters that are different than the first set of process parameters utilized in the pilot foundry, which can cause a corresponding change in the capacitance value of the composite capacitor. If the dielectric constant of the dielectric material utilized in the pilot foundry is lower than the dielectric constant of the dielectric material utilized in the production foundry, the capacitance value of the capacitor can be higher in the production foundry, and vice versa. In the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the geometry of capacitor <b>402</b> can be adjusted to adjust the capacitance value by appropriately changing (i.e. increasing or decreasing) the width of one or more of conductive fingers <b>410</b> through <b>420</b> from initial width <b>434</b>. For example, to increase the capacitance value of capacitor <b>402</b>, the width of one or more of conductive fingers <b>410</b> through <b>420</b> can be increased to a width indicated by dashed line <b>436</b>. For example, to decrease the capacitance value of capacitor <b>402</b>, the width of one or more of conductive fingers <b>410</b> through <b>420</b> can be decreased to a width indicated by dashed line <b>438</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a change in the capacitance value of capacitor <b>402</b> can be accomplished without changing (e.g. increasing or decreasing) the die area or capacitor area of capacitor <b>402</b> from pilot to production foundries by providing an automatic adjustment to the layout design data file, such as the GDS data file, during tape-out to the production foundry. Similar to the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also advantageously avoids manual changes to the layout design of the capacitor and regeneration of the data file, such as the GDS data file, for tape-out to the production foundry. However, in contrast to the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> allows the geometry of capacitor <b>402</b> to be adjusted to decrease or increase the capacitance of the capacitor as required to cause the capacitance value of the capacitor in the production foundry to be substantially the same as the capacitance value of the capacitor in pilot foundry. However, to be able to increase the capacitance value of capacitor <b>402</b> in the production foundry, standard cell <b>404</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can consume a larger die area than standard cell <b>104</b> in the embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a flowchart illustrating an exemplary method for adjusting geometry of a capacitor, such as a composite capacitor, according to one embodiment of the present invention. Certain details and features have been left out of flowchart <b>500</b> that are apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a step may consist of one or more substeps or may involve specialized equipment or materials, as known in the art. At step <b>502</b> of flowchart <b>500</b>, a first composite capacitor in a first standard cell is fabricated with a first set of process parameters. For example, capacitor <b>102</b> in standard cell <b>104</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can be fabricated with each of conductive fingers <b>110</b> through <b>120</b> at length <b>126</b> with a first set of process parameters in a pilot foundry in one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At step <b>504</b> of flowchart <b>500</b>, a capacitance value from the first composite capacitor is used to adjust the geometry of a second composite capacitor in a second standard cell having substantially the same dimensions as the first standard cell. For example, a capacitance value from a composite capacitor in a standard cell having each of conductive fingers <b>110</b> through <b>120</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> at length <b>126</b> and having dimensions substantially equal to dimensions <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> can be fabricated in the pilot foundry and can be used to adjust the geometry of capacitor <b>102</b> in standard cell <b>104</b> for fabrication in a production foundry using a second set of process parameters. For example, the geometry of capacitor <b>102</b> can be adjusted by changing a length of at least one of conductive fingers <b>110</b> through <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At step <b>506</b>, the second composite capacitor is fabricated in a second standard cell with a second set of process parameters, where the second composite capacitor has substantially a same capacitance value as the first composite capacitor. For example, the length of conductive finger <b>116</b> can be changed from length <b>126</b> to length <b>128</b> and capacitor <b>102</b> in standard cell <b>104</b> can be fabricated using the second set of process parameters in the production foundry so as to cause capacitor <b>102</b> to have substantially the same capacitance value as capacitor <b>102</b> (i.e. the first composite capacitor) had when fabricated using the first set of process parameters in the pilot foundry with conductive fingers <b>110</b> through <b>120</b> each having length <b>126</b>. In an embodiment of the invention, the total area (i.e. the die size) of capacitor <b>102</b> can remain substantially the same in standard cell <b>104</b> after the geometry of capacitor <b>102</b> has been adjusted.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a flowchart illustrating an exemplary method for adjusting a capacitance value of a partially processed composite capacitor of a standard cell in a partially processed wafer in a production foundry according to one embodiment of the present invention. Certain details and features have been left out of flowchart <b>600</b> that are apparent to a person of ordinary skill in the art. For example, a step may consist of one or more substeps or may involve specialized equipment or materials, as known in the art. At step <b>602</b> of flowchart <b>600</b>, a wafer is processed up to a certain metal layer in a first foundry, where the wafer includes a composite capacitor in a standard cell. For example, a partially processed wafer including a partially processed capacitor in standard cell <b>204</b> can be processed up to a metal layer immediately below metal layer <b>206</b> in a production foundry. Metal layer <b>206</b> can be, for example, a topmost metal layer when fabrication of the partially processed wafer is completed. For example, if metal layer <b>206</b> is M<b>7</b> (i.e. a seventh metal layer in the wafer), capacitor <b>202</b> in standard cell <b>204</b> can be processed up to M<b>6</b>. Capacitor <b>202</b> in standard cell <b>204</b> can include conductive fingers <b>212</b> through <b>222</b>, where each conductive finger has length <b>244</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">At step <b>604</b>, feedback data is received indicating a need to change the capacitance value of the composite capacitor being fabricated in the production foundry. The feedback data can be received from a pilot foundry, for example. The feedback data can also be received, for example, from test wafers having fully processed composite capacitors. The feedback data can be further received, for example, from field use of dies having fully processed composite capacitors. For example, field use can provide feedback data that indicates that the capacitance value of a composite capacitor requires a change in a particular semiconductor device, such as a mixer or an amplifier.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">At step <b>606</b>, the feedback data is utilized to adjust the capacitance value of the composite capacitor by adjusting a geometry of the composite capacitor in a subsequent metal layer(s) without changing the dimensions of the standard cell. For example, the feedback data can be utilized to adjust the capacitance value of capacitor <b>202</b> by adjusting a length of one or more of conductive fingers <b>228</b> through <b>238</b> in metal layer <b>226</b> without changing dimensions <b>240</b> and <b>242</b> of standard cell <b>204</b>. In an embodiment of the invention in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, dimensions <b>248</b> and <b>250</b> of capacitor <b>202</b> in metal layer <b>206</b> are substantially equal to respective dimensions <b>240</b> and <b>242</b> of standard cell <b>204</b>. In one embodiment, the feedback data can be utilized to change the capacitance value of a composite capacitor, such as capacitor <b>302</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, by changing (i.e. increasing or decreasing) a length of at least one conductive finger in the subsequent metal layer. In one embodiment, the feedback data can be utilized to change the capacitance value of a composite capacitor, such as capacitor <b>402</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, by changing (i.e. increasing or decreasing) a width of at least one conductive finger in the subsequent metal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Thus, as discussed above, the invention provides a method for adjusting a capacitance value of a capacitor, such as a composite capacitor, by adjusting a geometry of the capacitor without increasing die area. The capacitance value of the capacitor can be advantageously adjusted without requiring a manual change in layout design of the capacitor or regeneration of a data file, such as GDS data file, for tape-out to a production foundry. The invention also provides a method for adjusting a capacitance value of a partially processed composite capacitor of a standard cell in a partially processed wafer in a production foundry without changing dimensions of the standard cell.</p>
