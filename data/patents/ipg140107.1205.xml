<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a sheet storage apparatus that stores conveyed sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, an image forming apparatus is provided with a sheet storage apparatus and is arranged to discharge sheets, on which images have been formed sequentially from an image forming portion, to the sheet storage apparatus. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 5,722,030 (Kato) discloses an image forming apparatus provided with a bin-moving type sorter having a plurality of bins capable of storing printed sheets movably in a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The plurality of bin trays goes up or down one by one as spiral cams, provided on both sides of the trays, rotate once.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Each sheet on which an image has been formed in the body of the image forming apparatus is sent to the sorter by a pair of discharge rollers and is selectively sent in a direction of a sort path or a non-sort path by a change-over member. A sheet that has passed through the non-sort path is discharged onto a non-sort tray. A sheet that has passed through the sort path is discharged by another pair of discharge rollers and is stored on one bin tray of the bin trays that go up and down in synchronism with the discharge of the sheet. The sheets stored on the bin tray are aligned by an aligning bar that penetrates through cutaways provided in each bin tray and moves in a direction of a width of the sheet orthogonal to a direction in which the sheet is discharged. The sheets also undergo a stapling process carried out by an electrically-driven stapler as necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The sheet storage apparatus of the image forming apparatus described above stacks and stores the sheets sequentially and flatly on the bin trays substantially horizontally disposed or gently inclined. Thus, the sheet storage apparatus has a layered structure of the plurality of bin trays, with the bin tray being changed per job of the discharged sheet and securely discriminating the discharged sheets. However, because the bin trays are positioned at different heights, visibility of the sheets stored in the low bin tray is not good and it is inconvenient to take the sheets out of the low bin trays in particular.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Furthermore, the sheets discharged onto the bin trays are not bundled in the stacked state, except in the case when the sheets are stapled as a bundle. As a result, there is a case when the sheets are disordered on the bin tray depending on a condition, e.g., curling, surface friction, and others, of the sheets during the discharge, or when one touches another sheet bundle by mistake in taking out the sheets out of the bin tray.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention provides a sheet storage apparatus that is capable of favorably bundling vertically stored sheets, of improving visibility of the sheets, and of permitting the sheets to be taken out conveniently without a need to, for example, first staple the sheets as a bundle before vertically storing the sheets. According to an aspect of the present invention, a sheet storage apparatus includes a sheet conveying portion configured to convey a sheet, and a sheet storage portion configured to receive the sheet as conveyed upward from below by the sheet conveying portion and to store the sheet in a vertical direction, wherein the sheet storage portion includes: a guide portion having a guide surface set up in the vertical direction to guide the sheet, a first holding member configured to form a first nipping portion between the first holding member and the guide surface, wherein the first holding member is configured to permit the sheet to be conveyed upward to pass through the first nipping portion, and to hold the sheet by restricting the sheet from moving downward at the first nipping portion, and a second holding member configured to form a second nipping portion between the second holding member and the guide surface, wherein the second holding member is configured to permit the sheet to be conveyed upward to pass through the second nipping portion, and to hold the sheet by restricting the sheet from moving downward at the second nipping portion, wherein the second holding member is disposed downstream of the first holding member in a sheet conveying direction.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further features of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of exemplary embodiments with reference to the following attached drawings. The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate exemplary embodiments, features, and aspects of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">An image forming apparatus <b>100</b> of a first embodiment will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 13</figref>. Firstly, a skeleton framework of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> of the first embodiment will be explained along with movement of a sheet P in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a section view showing an entire framework of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> has a body <b>200</b> for forming an image on the sheet P (referred to as an &#x201c;apparatus body&#x201d; <b>200</b> hereinafter) and a sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b> for storing the sheet P on which the image has been formed by the apparatus body <b>200</b>. The apparatus body <b>200</b> includes a sheet supplying portion <b>210</b> for feeding the sheet P, an image forming portion <b>220</b> for forming images, a transfer portion <b>230</b> for transferring the image formed in the image forming portion <b>220</b> onto the sheet P, and a fixing portion <b>105</b> for fixing the transferred image on the sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The sheet supplying portion <b>210</b> includes a sheet feeding cassette <b>104</b> for storing sheets P and a pickup roller <b>108</b> for feeding the sheets P stored in the sheet feeding cassette <b>104</b>, one by one, to the transfer portion <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The image forming portion <b>220</b> includes photosensitive drums (a) through (d) for four colors of toner images of yellow, magenta, cyan and black, an exposure unit <b>106</b> for forming electrostatic latent images on the photosensitive drums (a) through (d) by irradiating laser beams based on image information, and other units. It is noted that these photosensitive drums (a) through (d) are driven by motors, not shown, and are also provided with primary charging units, developers, and transfer charging units, respectively, around the drums. These are unitized as process cartridges <b>101</b><i>a </i>through <b>101</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The transfer portion <b>230</b> includes a transfer belt <b>102</b> rotated and driven in a predetermined direction, transfer charging units <b>102</b><i>a </i>through <b>102</b><i>d </i>for transferring toner images of the respective colors on the photosensitive drums to the transfer belt <b>102</b>, and a secondary transfer portion <b>103</b> for secondarily transferring the toner images onto the sheet P. The fixing portion <b>105</b> is provided on a downstream side of the transfer portion <b>230</b> to fix the toner images to the sheet P by heat and pressure. It is noted that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows a central processing unit (CPU) circuit portion <b>240</b>, which is a controller for controlling the apparatus body <b>200</b> and the sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, an image forming operation of the apparatus body <b>200</b>, constructed as described above, will be explained specifically. When the image forming operation starts, the exposure unit <b>106</b> irradiates laser light based on image information from a personal computer or the like, not shown, and exposes surfaces of the photosensitive drums (a) through (d) sequentially, which are charged uniformly with predetermined polarity and potential to form electrostatic latent images on the photosensitive drums (a) through (d). The electrostatic latent images formed on the photosensitive drums (a) through (d) are then visualized by developing using toners.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For instance, the laser light of an image signal of yellow component color of an original image is irradiated to the photosensitive drum (a) through a polygon mirror and the like of the exposure unit <b>106</b> to form a yellow electrostatic latent image on the photosensitive drum (a). Then, this yellow electrostatic latent image is developed by the yellow toner from the developer to visualize as a yellow toner image. Then, when the photosensitive drum (a) rotates and the yellow toner image comes to a primary transfer portion where the photosensitive drum (a) contacts with the transfer belt <b>102</b>, the yellow toner image is transferred primarily to the transfer belt <b>102</b> by a primary transfer bias applied by the transfer charging unit <b>102</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As the yellow toner image is primarily transferred to the transfer belt <b>102</b>, magenta, cyan and black toner images formed on the photosensitive drums (b), (c), and (d) in a similar manner as described above are superimposed sequentially on the transfer belt <b>102</b> upon the yellow toner image already on the transfer belt <b>102</b>. Thus, a full-color toner image is formed on the transfer belt <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At the same time as this toner image forming operation, the pickup roller <b>108</b> sends out the sheets P stored in the sheet feeding cassette <b>104</b> one by one. The sheet P then reaches a registration roller <b>109</b>, and the registration roller <b>109</b> conveys the sheet P to the secondary transfer portion <b>103</b> at a predetermined time. Then, the full color toner image on the transfer belt <b>102</b> is completely transferred onto the sheet P by a secondary transfer bias applied to the secondary transfer portion <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The sheet P on which the toner image has been transferred is conveyed from the secondary transfer portion <b>103</b> to the fixing portion <b>105</b> via a transfer path <b>120</b>. The toners on the sheet P are melted and color-mixed by receiving heat and pressure, and are fixed as a full-color image on the sheet P at the fixing portion <b>105</b>. After that, the sheet P on which the image has been fixed is discharged by a pair of discharge rollers <b>110</b> provided on the downstream side of the fixing portion <b>105</b> and is conveyed to the sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b> disposed above the apparatus body <b>200</b> by passing through a curved conveyor guide <b>313</b>, that will be described later. The image forming apparatus <b>100</b> additionally includes a conveying guide <b>303</b>, a storage guide <b>304</b>, and holding members <b>305</b> discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and a manipulating portion <b>601</b> discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, the sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b> will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 through 5</figref>, in addition to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, along with the flow of the sheet P. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a section view of the sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b> of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> of the first embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of a sheet storage portion <b>330</b> of the sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b> of the first embodiment, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a side view of the sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b> of the first embodiment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a section view of a sheet holding portion <b>340</b> of the sheet storage portion <b>330</b> of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b> is provided above the apparatus body <b>200</b> and is constructed so that the sheet P is conveyed (discharged) through a curved conveying guide <b>313</b> from the pair of discharge rollers <b>110</b> provided on the apparatus body <b>200</b>, where the pair of discharge rollers <b>110</b> are driven by a sheet discharging motor (not shown). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an inlet sensor S<b>1</b> is provided at an inlet portion of the conveying guide <b>313</b> to monitor conveying timing of the sheet P discharged out of the apparatus body <b>200</b>. Provided at a downstream side of the conveying guide <b>313</b> are a conveying roller <b>301</b> that conveys the sheet discharged out of the apparatus body <b>200</b>, and a driven roller <b>302</b> that press-contacts the conveying roller <b>301</b> and is driven by the conveying roller <b>301</b>. The conveying roller <b>301</b>, the driven roller <b>302</b>, and the conveying guide <b>313</b> compose a sheet conveying portion <b>314</b> that conveys the sheet discharged out of the apparatus body <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The sheet P conveyed to the sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b> is further conveyed by the conveying roller <b>301</b> and the driven roller <b>302</b> to one sheet storage portion selected out of five sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e</i>, which will be described later. It is noted that the conveying roller <b>301</b> is rotated and driven by a driving gear <b>307</b> driven by a conveyor motor M<b>1</b> (a driving unit) and a driving belt <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the present embodiment, the sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b> has the five sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>that receive the sheets P sequentially conveyed by the conveying roller <b>301</b> and the driven roller <b>302</b> from below thereof and store the sheet in a condition of setting a front edge of the sheet up and a rear edge down, i.e., in a condition of setting up the sheet in a vertical direction. The five sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>are arrayed in a horizontal direction as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Sensor S<b>2</b><i>c </i>for detecting whether or not a sheet exists in sheet storage portion <b>330</b> is visible in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>are connected by a connecting shaft <b>308</b> and are held by a holding plate <b>309</b>. The holding plate <b>309</b> is fixed with a connecting member <b>310</b> fixed to a timing belt <b>312</b> wrapped between moving pulleys <b>311</b><i>a </i>and <b>311</b><i>b</i>. The moving pulley <b>311</b><i>b </i>is provided coaxially with a motor M<b>2</b> for moving the sheet storage portion <b>330</b>, and the moving pulley <b>311</b><i>a </i>is provided on the side opposite from the moving pulley <b>311</b><i>b</i>. While the present embodiment utilizes the five sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e</i>, other embodiments may utilize i sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>i</i>, where i is any positive whole number.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The five sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>move in a body in a direction of an arrow X (in a horizontal direction) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> because the holding plate <b>309</b> moves together with the connecting member <b>310</b> when the timing belt <b>312</b> rotates. Then, as the sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>move in the horizontal direction, it becomes possible to change over which of the five sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>faces the conveying roller <b>301</b>, i.e., change the sheet storage portion <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>to which the conveying roller <b>301</b> is aligned in the vertical direction. That is, it becomes possible to store the sheet P conveyed from the conveying roller <b>301</b> to a particular sheet storage portion selected out of the five sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>by changing relative positions of the fixed conveying roller <b>301</b> and the respective sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e. </i></p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b> is also provided with a home position detection sensor S<b>3</b> that detects movement of and a home position of the connecting member <b>310</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A CPU <b>701</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) of a controller <b>636</b> determines the home position at a center in the X direction, i.e., in the lateral direction, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> using the sensor S<b>3</b>. The CPU <b>701</b> also determines a position where the sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>receive the sheet P by counting a number of driving pulses of the motor M<b>2</b> from the home position.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>are provided respectively with sensors (S<b>2</b><i>a</i>) through (S<b>2</b><i>e</i>) for detecting whether or not a sheet exists. Then, the CPU <b>701</b> determines whether or not each sheet storage portions is storing the sheet based on a detecting result of the sensors (S<b>2</b><i>a</i>) through (S<b>2</b><i>e</i>) and controls the position of the sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>so that a next sheet P is stored in one of the sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>storing no sheet. Each of sensors (S<b>2</b><i>a</i>) through (S<b>2</b><i>e</i>) may be referred to as a sheet detecting sensor S<b>2</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, each of the sheet storage portions <b>330</b>, including the five sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e</i>, will be explained. It is noted that because the respective sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>have the same configuration, they each will be explained below in reference to the sheet storage portion <b>330</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Each of the five sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>of the sheet storage portion <b>330</b> has a sheet holding portion <b>340</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) that allows the sheet P to pass through in a sheet conveying direction and restricts the sheet P from moving in a direction opposite from the sheet conveying direction. An edge restricting member <b>350</b> is provided above sheet holding portion <b>340</b>. Each of the five sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>of the sheet storage portion <b>330</b> also has a receiving portion <b>360</b> provided on the upstream side of the sheet holding portion <b>340</b> to receive the sheets P conveyed sequentially from below by the conveying roller <b>301</b> and the driven roller <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The sheet holding portion <b>340</b> for sheet storage portion <b>330</b><i>a </i>has a first holding portion <b>340</b><i>a </i>provided on the upstream side of the sheet conveying direction and a second holding portion <b>340</b><i>b </i>provided on the downstream side, i.e., in the upper part in the vertical direction, of the first holding portion <b>340</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the sheet storage portion <b>330</b><i>a </i>has a guide portion <b>370</b>, which includes a storage guide <b>304</b>, i.e., a first guide, as a guide member set up in the vertical direction, having a guide surface <b>304</b><i>a </i>formed substantially in the vertical direction to guide one surface of the sheet P and a conveying guide <b>303</b>, i.e., a second guide provided to face to the storage guide <b>304</b>. The sheet storage portion <b>330</b><i>a </i>also includes first and second holding members <b>305</b><i>a </i>and <b>305</b><i>b </i>provided between the storage guide <b>304</b> and the conveying guide <b>303</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Then, the guide portion <b>370</b>, i.e. the storage guide <b>304</b> and the conveying guide <b>303</b>, and the first and second holding members <b>305</b><i>a </i>and <b>305</b><i>b </i>configure the first and second holding portions <b>340</b><i>a </i>and <b>340</b><i>b</i>. The first holding portion <b>340</b><i>a </i>includes a conveying guide <b>303</b><i>a </i>as a first conveying guide and includes the first holding member <b>305</b><i>a </i>as a rolling member provided between the storage guide <b>304</b> and the conveying guide <b>303</b><i>a </i>to nip and hold the sheet P together with the storage guide <b>304</b> and its guide surface <b>304</b><i>a</i>. The second holding portion <b>340</b><i>b </i>includes a conveying guide <b>303</b><i>b </i>as a second conveying guide and includes the second holding member <b>305</b><i>b </i>as a rolling member provided between the storage guide <b>304</b> and the conveying guide <b>303</b><i>b </i>to nip and hold the sheet P together with the storage guide <b>304</b> and its guide surface <b>304</b><i>a</i>. The storage guide <b>304</b> forms a side wall of the first holding portion <b>340</b><i>a </i>and guides the sheet P received from the receiving portion <b>360</b> upward along the guide surface <b>304</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The conveying guide <b>303</b><i>a </i>has a counterface wall portion <b>303</b>&#x3b1;<i>a </i>that is provided at an upper part thereof and a lower wall portion <b>303</b>&#x3b3;<i>a </i>that is provided at a lower part thereof. The lower wall portion <b>303</b>&#x3b3;<i>a </i>guides the sheet P received from the receiving portion <b>360</b> upward together with the storage guide <b>304</b>. The conveying guide <b>303</b><i>a </i>also has an inclined portion <b>303</b>&#x3b2;<i>a </i>as an inclined member provided in an upper part of the lower wall portion <b>303</b>&#x3b3;<i>a</i>, i.e., between the counterface wall portion <b>303</b>&#x3b1;<i>a </i>and the lower wall portion <b>303</b>&#x3b3;<i>a</i>, and having an inclined surface <b>31</b> inclined in a direction of separating from and away from the storage guide <b>304</b>. The inclined surface <b>31</b> of the inclined portion <b>303</b>&#x3b2;<i>a </i>is formed so that a distance from the guide surface <b>304</b><i>a </i>of the storage guide <b>304</b> is widened from the lower part to the upper part thereof. That is, the inclined surface <b>31</b> of the conveying guide <b>303</b><i>a </i>is provided to face the storage guide <b>304</b> and is inclined so that a first distance <b>52</b> between an upper part of the inclined surface <b>31</b> and the guide surface <b>304</b><i>a </i>of the first guide <b>304</b> is greater than a second distance <b>51</b> between a lower part of the inclined surface <b>31</b> and the guide surface <b>304</b><i>a </i>of the first guide <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The first holding member <b>305</b><i>a </i>is columnar and rolls along the inclined surface <b>31</b> in a range of the inclined portion <b>303</b>&#x3b2;<i>a </i>and the counterface wall portion <b>303</b>&#x3b1;<i>a </i>of the conveying guide <b>303</b><i>a</i>. The first holding member <b>305</b><i>a </i>is in contact with the storage guide surface <b>304</b><i>a </i>and the inclined portion <b>303</b>&#x3b2;<i>a </i>of the conveying guide <b>303</b><i>a </i>by its own weight until when a sheet is conveyed to the first holding portion <b>340</b><i>a</i>. That is, the first holding member <b>305</b><i>a </i>restricts at position where the first holding member <b>305</b><i>a </i>is received by the guide surface <b>304</b><i>a </i>of the storage guide <b>304</b> and the conveying guide <b>303</b><i>a </i>by its own weight and can roll in a direction in which the distance between the guides becomes large, i.e., in the upward direction.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Thus, the first holding member <b>305</b><i>a </i>forms a first nipping portion <b>61</b> together with the storage guide <b>304</b>, and is a first rolling member that allows the sheet P to pass through the first nipping portion <b>61</b> by rolling when the sheet P conveyed upward enters the first nipping portion <b>61</b>. More specifically, the first holding member <b>305</b><i>a </i>is arranged to allow the sheet P conveyed upward to pass through the first nipping portion <b>61</b> and to restrict the sheet P, whose front-end has passed through the first nipping portion <b>61</b>, from moving downward. Thus, the first holding member <b>305</b><i>a </i>holds the sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The second holding portion <b>340</b><i>b </i>described above also has a same structure as the first holding portion <b>340</b><i>a</i>. That is, the second holding portion <b>340</b><i>b </i>includes the second holding member <b>305</b><i>b</i>, the storage guide <b>304</b>, and the conveying guide <b>303</b><i>b</i>. The storage guide <b>304</b> and the conveying guide <b>303</b><i>b </i>are formed in common with those of the first holding portion <b>340</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Thus, the conveying guide <b>303</b><i>b </i>is provided with the counterface wall portion <b>303</b>&#x3b1;b, the inclined portion <b>303</b>&#x3b2;b and the lower wall portion<b>3</b> <b>303</b>&#x3b3;b formed for the holding portion. Then, the conveying guide <b>303</b> has two inclined surfaces: the first inclined surface <b>31</b> on which the first holding member <b>305</b><i>a </i>rolls and a second inclined surface <b>32</b> on which the second holding member <b>305</b><i>b </i>rolls.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The second holding member <b>305</b><i>b </i>also forms a second nipping portion <b>62</b> together with the storage guide <b>304</b>, and is a second rolling member that allows the sheet P to pass through the second nipping portion <b>62</b> by rolling when the sheet P conveyed upward enters the second nipping portion <b>62</b>. More specifically, the second holding member <b>305</b><i>b </i>is arranged to allow the sheet P conveyed upward to pass through the second nipping portion <b>62</b> and to restrict the sheet P, whose front-end has passed through the second nipping portion <b>62</b>, from moving downward. Thus, the second holding member <b>305</b><i>b </i>holds the sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As described above, each sheet storage portion <b>330</b> has first and second holding portions <b>340</b><i>a </i>and <b>340</b><i>b </i>disposed at vertically different positions. Thereby, the first and second holding members <b>305</b><i>a </i>and <b>305</b><i>b </i>are disposed vertically along the guide surface of the conveying guide <b>303</b>. Thus, each sheet storage portion <b>330</b> is constructed to be able to hold the plurality of sheets P stably via first and second holding members <b>305</b><i>a </i>and <b>305</b><i>b </i>disposed at the vertically different positions.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the CPU circuit portion <b>630</b> has a central processing unit (CPU) <b>629</b>, a read only memory (ROM <b>631</b>), and a random access memory (RAM) <b>650</b>.

The controller <b>636</b> exchanges data by communicating with the CPU circuit portion <b>630</b> provided on the side of the apparatus body <b>200</b> through a communication interface <b>706</b>. Then, the controller <b>636</b> executes various programs stored in the ROM <b>703</b> based on instructions from the CPU circuit portion <b>630</b> and controls the sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b> through the controller <b>708</b>. When a sheet storage processing control is executed, for example, detection signals are taken into the CPU <b>701</b> from the various sensors for controlling the sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b> through an input/output (I/O) unit <b>705</b>, such as the inlet sensor S<b>1</b>, the sheet present detection sensor S<b>2</b> (e.g., sensors S<b>2</b><i>a </i>through S<b>2</b><i>e</i>), and the home position detection sensor S<b>3</b> for detecting the movement of the sheet storage portion <b>330</b> described above.

<p id="p-0094" num="0093">When the evaluated sheet storage portion holds a sheet (N in Step S<b>823</b>) as described above, the controller <b>636</b> repeats this process until monitoring of, for example, the fifth sheet storage portion <b>330</b><i>e </i>is finished, i.e., until i turns to 5. Then, when the fifth sheet storage portion <b>330</b><i>e </i>holds a sheet, i.e., when i=5 and all of the sheet storage portions <b>330</b> hold sheets (Y in Step S<b>826</b>), the controller <b>636</b> transmits a &#x201c;stack FULL&#x201d; signal from the CPU <b>701</b> to the CPU circuit portion <b>630</b> in Step S<b>827</b>. It is noted that the CPU circuit portion <b>630</b> indicates that it is unable to store on a display, not shown, and provided on the manipulating portion <b>601</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) when the CPU circuit portion <b>630</b> receives this &#x201c;stack FULL&#x201d; signal.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">When an i-th sheet storage portion holds no sheet (nil) (Y in Step S<b>823</b>) (that is, the statement that the i-th tray retains no sheet is true), the controller <b>636</b> determines the identification number of the tray in which the sheet is stored as the i-th tray in Step S<b>824</b>. By determining the number, the controller <b>636</b> issues an instruction to convey the sheet P to the sheet storage portion <b>330</b> whose number is i and completes the process for determining the number of the tray in which the sheet is to be stored.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">After completing the process for determining the tray number of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the controller <b>636</b> shifts to the process for moving the sheet storage portion <b>330</b> in Step S<b>802</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. As noted, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a flowchart showing processes for moving the sheet storage portion <b>330</b> of the sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b>. Then, as part of the process for moving the sheet storage portion <b>330</b>, the controller <b>636</b> drives the motor M<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) in Step S<b>830</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> to move the connecting member <b>310</b> toward the home position, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In Step S<b>831</b>, the process determines whether the connecting member <b>310</b> for moving the sheet storage portion <b>330</b> has arrived at the home position. In response to determining the connecting member <b>310</b> for moving the sheet storage portion <b>330</b> has not arrived at the home position (N in Step S<b>831</b>), the process returns to Step S<b>830</b>. In response to determining the connecting member <b>310</b> for moving the sheet storage portion <b>330</b> has arrived at the home position (Y in Step S<b>831</b>), such as when the home position detection sensor S<b>3</b> detects that the connecting member <b>310</b> has arrived at the home position in Step S<b>831</b>, the controller <b>636</b> stops the motor M<b>2</b> once in Step S<b>832</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Next, after Step S<b>832</b> when the sheet storage portion <b>330</b> has arrived at the home position as described above, the controller <b>636</b> drives the motor M<b>2</b> in Step S<b>833</b> and counts a number of clocks of the motor M<b>2</b> in Step S<b>834</b>. For example, based on the revolutions per minute of the motor M<b>2</b>, the motor M<b>2</b> may output a signal and the controller <b>636</b> may count the number of clocks using the signal output from the motor M<b>2</b>. The controller <b>636</b> continues to drive the motor M<b>2</b> and count the number of clocks of the motor M<b>2</b> until the i-th sheet storage portion <b>330</b><i>i</i>, determined in the process of determining the tray number described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, comes to a position aligned with the conveying roller <b>301</b>. In other words, when the receiving portion <b>360</b> of the sheet storage portion <b>330</b><i>i </i>is positioned above the curved conveyor guide <b>313</b> to receive a sheet P from the sheet conveying portion <b>314</b>, the controller <b>636</b> stops the motor M<b>2</b>. To accomplish this, the process determines at Step <b>835</b> whether the number of clocks of the motor M<b>2</b> are equal to a predetermined number of clocks from a set of predetermined number of clocks (such as i&#xd7;20). In response to the process determining at Step <b>835</b> that the determined number of clocks of the motor M<b>2</b> are not equal to the predetermined number of clocks (N at Step S<b>835</b>), the process returns to Step S<b>833</b>. In response to the process determining at Step <b>835</b> that the determined number of clocks of the motor M<b>2</b> are equal to the predetermined number of clocks (y at Step S<b>835</b>), the process concludes that the i-th sheet storage portion <b>330</b><i>i </i>comes to the position aligned with the conveying roller <b>301</b> and the controller <b>636</b> stops the motor M<b>2</b> in Step S<b>836</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">When such a process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> for moving the sheet storage portion <b>330</b><i>i </i>is completed, that is, when Step S<b>802</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is completed, the controller <b>636</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) outputs a print dischargeable signal to the CPU circuit portion <b>630</b> provided on the side of the apparatus body <b>200</b> in Step S<b>803</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The controller <b>636</b> also drives the conveyor motor M<b>1</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) in Step S<b>804</b> and, in Step S<b>805</b>, monitors arrival of a sheet P at the curved conveyor guide <b>313</b> using the inlet sensor S<b>1</b> to prepare for the sheet P conveyed from the apparatus body <b>200</b>. As noted above, a sheet P on which the image has been fixed is discharged by a pair of discharge rollers <b>110</b> from the apparatus body <b>200</b> as driven by a sheet discharge motor (not shown). Then, when the inlet sensor S<b>1</b> detects a front-end of the sheet P (Y in Step S<b>806</b>), the controller <b>636</b> starts to monitor clocks of a sheet discharge motor in Step S<b>807</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Recall that the sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a </i>through <b>330</b><i>e </i>are provided respectively with sensors S<b>2</b> (e.g., S<b>2</b><i>a </i>through S<b>2</b><i>e</i>) for detecting whether or not a sheet P exists within the evaluated sheet holding portion <b>340</b>. When the inlet sensor S<b>1</b> detects a rear-end of the sheet after that (Y in Step S<b>808</b>), the controller <b>636</b> monitors the signal of the sensor S<b>2</b> (e.g., S<b>2</b><i>i</i>) in Step S<b>809</b>. Then, when the sensor S<b>2</b> detects the front-end of the sheet (Y in Step S<b>810</b>), the controller <b>636</b> judges that the sheet P is held properly by the sheet holding portion <b>340</b> of the selected i-th sheet storage portion, and judges that the storage of the sheet P is normally completed in Step S<b>811</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">It is noted that, when the inlet sensor S<b>1</b> does not detect the front-end of the sheet (N in Step S<b>806</b>), this state continues until a predetermined period of time (Y in Step S<b>840</b>). When the predetermined period of time is detected in Step S<b>840</b> (Y in Step S<b>840</b>), the controller <b>636</b> outputs a jam signal in Step S<b>850</b>. When the inlet sensor S<b>1</b> does not detect the rear-end of the sheet (N in Step S<b>808</b>), this state continues for a predetermined period of time. For example, when the number of clocks of the motor reaches a predetermined value (Y in Step S<b>841</b>), the controller <b>636</b> outputs the jam signal in Step S<b>850</b>. Still further, when the sensor S<b>2</b> does not detect the front-end of the sheet (N in Step S<b>810</b>), this state continues for a predetermined period of time. For example, when the number of clocks of the motor reaches a predetermined value (Y in Step S<b>842</b>), the controller <b>636</b> outputs the jam signal in Step S<b>850</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As described above, either one of the holding members <b>305</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5) and 305</figref><i>b </i>holds the preceding sheet P<b>1</b> even when the succeeding sheet P<b>2</b> is put into the sheet holding portion <b>340</b> while holding the preceding sheet P<b>1</b>. Therefore, it is possible to store the sheets without dropping the preceding sheet P<b>1</b> in the condition in which the plurality of sheets P is set up. With this arrangement, it is possible to readily hold a plurality of sheets while setting up in the vertical direction and to improve the visibility and the readiness in taking out the sheet(s), even when no such processing as stapling is implemented. As a result, it is possible to suppress disorder of the vertically stacked sheets when taking out the sheet(s), and to prevent problems of the apparatus <b>100</b>, such as a discharge error.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Still further, it is possible to insert the sheet P between the storage guide <b>304</b> and the holding members <b>305</b><i>a </i>and <b>305</b><i>b </i>by a weak force of just moving the holding members <b>305</b><i>a </i>and <b>305</b><i>b </i>that are movable in the direction of the arrow B (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6B</figref> and <b>7</b>A-<b>7</b>B) by the thickness of the sheet P in the present embodiment. When the rear-end of the inserted sheet P passes through the conveyor roller <b>301</b>, the gravity acting on the holding members <b>305</b><i>a </i>and <b>305</b><i>b </i>applies the nipping pressures F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6C and 7C</figref>) that nip the sheet P between the holding members <b>305</b><i>a </i>and <b>305</b><i>b </i>and the guide surface <b>304</b><i>a </i>of the storage guide <b>304</b> with the effect of the inclined portions <b>30313</b><i>a </i>and <b>30313</b><i>b </i>of the conveying guide <b>303</b>. The sheet P<b>1</b> is held by the sheet holding portion <b>340</b> by the nipping pressures F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> caused by the wedge effect. Then, because the wedge effect does not act if the sheet P, held between the holding members <b>305</b><i>a </i>and <b>305</b><i>b </i>and the storage guide <b>304</b>, is pulled out in the depth direction and the upper direction of the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>, it is possible to take out the sheet(s) P from the sheet holding portion <b>340</b> readily by one hand.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The restricting member <b>350</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6C and 7C</figref>) is provided above the sheet holding portion <b>340</b> in the present embodiment. As a result, it is possible to restrict sheets conveyed from the conveyor roller <b>301</b> and the driven roller <b>302</b>, and a sheet led by the sheet, being conveyed, and to align the level of the sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Still further, the five sheet storage portions <b>330</b><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>are disposed in parallel above the apparatus body <b>200</b> in the present embodiment, so that it is possible to increase a storage amount without widening an installation space.

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Next, an image forming apparatus <b>100</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) of a second embodiment will be explained with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A</figref> through <b>16</b>. Compared to the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> of the first embodiment that has the sheet holding portion <b>340</b> that holds the sheet P with the two holding portions <b>340</b><i>a </i>and <b>340</b><i>b</i>, the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>A of the second embodiment is different from the image forming apparatus <b>100</b> in that the image forming apparatus <b>100</b>A has a sheet holding portion <b>340</b>A that is capable of holding the sheet P with a single holding portion. Therefore, the difference from the first embodiment, i.e., the sheet holding portion <b>340</b>A of a sheet storage apparatus <b>300</b>A (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), will be explained mainly in the second embodiment, and the same or corresponding parts as those of the first embodiment will be denoted by the same reference numerals and explanation thereof will be omitted here.

That is, lengths in the height and depth directions of the sheet storage portion <b>330</b>&#x3b1;A are set so that the downstream-side end in the sheet conveying direction and the near-side end of the stored sheet P project out of the sheet storage portion <b>330</b>&#x3b1;A.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">As described above, the second embodiment makes it possible to dispose the rolling members <b>305</b>A<b>1</b> through <b>305</b>A<b>3</b>, i.e., the plurality of holding members <b>305</b>A, at the vertically different positions using the single inclined surface <b>33</b>, as compared to the first embodiment and to hold the plurality of sheets P stably. That is, the conveying guide <b>303</b><i>b </i>can dispose the plurality of rolling members <b>305</b>A<b>1</b> through <b>305</b>A<b>3</b> at the vertically different positions if the conveying guide <b>303</b><i>b </i>has at least one inclined surface <b>33</b>. Still further, because the inclined portion <b>303</b>&#x3b2;A is formed to be inclined by C degrees with respect to the width direction, a take-out range is widened by C degrees. With this arrangement, the sheet P stored in the sheet storage portion <b>330</b>&#x3b1;A can be taken out in a range of a direction T (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>) obliquely downward on the near side of the apparatus body <b>200</b>, the direction U on the near side of the apparatus body <b>200</b>, the direction V obliquely upward on the near side of the apparatus body <b>200</b> and the upward direction W indicated by an angle &#x3b8;+C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. Thus, the part of the sheet P in this range is effective as a tong hold in taking out the sheet P.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">It is noted that although the rolling member is used as the holding member in the first and second embodiments described above, the holding member need not always be a rolling member. For instance, the holding member may be formed by a brush whose stream of hairs is oriented upward or by a flexible member such as rubber which is oriented upward. That is, the holding member may have any configuration as long as the holding member forms the nip portion with the storage guide <b>304</b>, allows the sheet to be conveyed upward to pass through the nip portion, and can hold the sheet whose front-end has passed through the nip portion by restricting the downward movement of the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Still further, although the holding member is constructed by the columnar rolling member that rolls on the inclined surface in the first and second embodiments described above, the holding member may be a globular, cylindrical, or spindle-shaped member. Furthermore, an outer circumference of the rolling member may be surrounded by sponge or rubber.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a schematic diagram showing another configuration of the holding members of the first and second embodiments. The sheet holding portion <b>340</b>B has a first holding portion <b>340</b><i>a</i>B and a second holding portion <b>340</b><i>b</i>B. The rolling member may be constructed not by the roller that rolls on the inclined surface but by a roller provided through an intermediary of a one-way clutch. For instance, the sheet storage portion <b>330</b> may include a first roller <b>405</b><i>a </i>provided through an intermediary of a first one-way clutch <b>403</b><i>a </i>as a first rolling member and a second roller <b>405</b><i>b </i>provided through an intermediary of a second one-way clutch <b>403</b><i>b </i>as a second rolling member, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">More specifically, the first rolling member has a first stationary shaft <b>404</b><i>a</i>, the first one-way clutch <b>403</b><i>a </i>described above, and the first roller <b>405</b><i>a</i>, wherein the first stationary shaft <b>404</b><i>a </i>is supported to not rotate with respect to the conveying guide <b>303</b>B. Still further, the first one-way clutch <b>403</b><i>a </i>is arranged so that the clutch runs idle with respect to the first stationary shaft <b>404</b><i>a </i>in a direction of following the sheet P to be conveyed upwardly and so that the clutch engages with the first stationary shaft <b>404</b><i>a </i>in the opposite direction. Still further, the first roller <b>405</b><i>a </i>is mounted on the first stationary shaft <b>404</b><i>a </i>through the intermediary of the first one-way clutch <b>403</b><i>a </i>and is composed of an elastic foam member. Therefore, the first roller <b>405</b><i>a </i>elastically deforms by abutting the storage guide <b>304</b> and forms the first nipping portion <b>61</b>B together with the storage guide <b>304</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Meanwhile, similarly to the first rolling member, the second rolling member also has a second stationary shaft <b>404</b><i>b</i>, a second one-way clutch <b>403</b><i>b </i>and a second roller <b>405</b><i>b</i>. While the second stationary shaft <b>404</b><i>b</i>, the second one-way clutch <b>403</b><i>b</i>, and the second roller <b>405</b><i>b </i>have the similar structure to the first rolling member, the second stationary shaft <b>404</b><i>b </i>is disposed so that its vertical position is different from that of the first stationary shaft <b>404</b><i>a</i>. Specifically, the second stationary shaft <b>404</b><i>b </i>is disposed above the first stationary shaft <b>404</b><i>a </i>along the storage guide <b>304</b> and the second nipping portion <b>62</b>B is formed between the storage guide <b>304</b> and the second roller <b>405</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Therefore, when the sheet P is conveyed from the sheet conveying portion <b>314</b> to the receiving portion <b>360</b> of the sheet storage portion <b>330</b>&#x3b1;A, the first roller <b>405</b><i>a </i>turns clockwise by following the sheet P conveyed upward to enter the first nipping portion <b>61</b>B and allows the sheet P to pass through the first nipping portion <b>61</b>B. When the sheet P is conveyed upward further along the guide surface of the storage guide <b>304</b>, the second roller <b>405</b><i>b </i>turns clockwise by the sheet P trying to enter the second nipping portion <b>62</b>B and allows the sheet P to pass through the second nipping portion <b>62</b>B. Then, when the conveyance of the sheet P ends, the sheet P is held by nipping pressure (pressing force) from the first and second rollers <b>405</b><i>a </i>and <b>405</b><i>b </i>because the first and second rollers <b>405</b><i>a </i>and <b>405</b><i>b </i>do not rotate counterclockwise.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Furthermore, in the case of the held sheet P<b>1</b> exists, the nipping pressure of at least either one of the first and second rollers <b>405</b><i>a </i>and <b>405</b><i>b </i>is applied to the held sheet P<b>1</b> also when the succeeding sheet P<b>2</b> enters one of the first and second nip portions <b>61</b>B and <b>62</b>B. It is therefore possible to prevent the held sheet P<b>1</b> from falling.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Still further, although the storage guide <b>304</b> is set up substantially vertically in the embodiments described above, the storage guide <b>304</b> (the guide surface <b>304</b><i>a</i>) may be formed within a range of 45 degrees forward and backwards with respect to a vertical direction.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Furthermore, the inventions described in the embodiments may be combined in any manner. For instance, it is possible to combine the sheet holding portions described in the first and second embodiments or to provide a plurality of sheet holding portions of the second embodiment. In addition, the number of the holding portions is not limited to be two, and that three or more holding portions may be provided. It is also possible to divide the first and second rolling members of the first embodiment in the width direction and to form the holding members with a plurality of groups of rolling members.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">While the embodiments of the invention have been explained above, the invention is not limited to the embodiments described above. Still further, the effects described in the embodiments of the invention are merely the most suitable effects brought about by the invention and the effects of the invention are not limited by those described in the embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Aspects of the present invention can also be realized by a computer (such as a CPU or MPU) of a system or apparatus that reads out and executes a program recorded on a memory device to perform the functions of the above-described embodiment(s), and by a method, the steps of which are performed by a computer of a system or apparatus by, for example, reading out and executing a program recorded on a memory device to perform the functions of the above-described embodiment(s).
