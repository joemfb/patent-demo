<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Embodiments of the invention are generally related to graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and more specifically to selecting items from a radial menu. More specifically, embodiments of the invention provide a complex set of gestures which, when performed using a screen pointer, facilitate fast and accurate selection of radial menu items from a radial menu. The gestures may generally involve a first movement of the screen pointer to activate a desired radial menu item, and a second predefined movement of the screen pointer to select the radial menu item.</p>

<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Most modern computers include applications that allow a user to interact with the application while performing operations associated with the applications. For example, an application may be configured to receive commands from the user to display data, modify data, initiate a particular task, and the like. In the past, user interaction with applications was facilitated by a command line interface. The command line interface allowed users to type predefined commands to interact with an application. However, command line interfaces require users to memorize large lists of commands to communicate with each application.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">More recently, user interaction with applications has involved the use of graphical user interfaces, or GUIs. For example, most applications today are configured to display a window including a menu bar on a display screen. The menu bar may include one or more pull down menus including lists of functions and commands that may be used to interact with the application.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Embodiments of the invention are generally related to graphical user interfaces (GUIs), and more specifically to selecting items from a radial menu. More specifically, embodiments of the invention provide a complex set of gestures which, when performed using a screen pointer, facilitate fast and accurate selection of radial menu items from a radial menu. The gestures may generally involve a first movement of the screen pointer to activate a desired radial menu item, and a second predefined movement of the screen pointer to select the radial menu item.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the following, reference is made to embodiments of the invention. However, it should be understood that the invention is not limited to specific described embodiments. Instead, any combination of the following features and elements, whether related to different embodiments or not, is contemplated to implement and practice the invention. Furthermore, in various embodiments the invention provides numerous advantages over the prior art. However, although embodiments of the invention may achieve advantages over other possible solutions and/or over the prior art, whether or not a particular advantage is achieved by a given embodiment is not limiting of the invention. Thus, the following aspects, features, embodiments and advantages are merely illustrative and are not considered elements or limitations of the appended claims except where explicitly recited in a claim(s). Likewise, reference to &#x201c;the invention&#x201d; shall not be construed as a generalization of any inventive subject matter disclosed herein and shall not be considered to be an element or limitation of the appended claims except where explicitly recited in a claim(s).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One embodiment of the invention is implemented as a program product for use with a computer system. The program(s) of the program product defines functions of the embodiments (including the methods described herein) and can be contained on a variety of computer-readable storage media. Illustrative computer-readable storage media include, but are not limited to: (i) non-writable storage media (e.g., read-only memory devices within a computer such as CD-ROM disks readable by a CD-ROM drive) on which information is permanently stored; (ii) writable storage media (e.g., floppy disks within a diskette drive or hard-disk drive) on which alterable information is stored. Such computer-readable storage media, when carrying computer-readable instructions that direct the functions of the present invention, are embodiments of the present invention. Other media include communications media through which information is conveyed to a computer, such as through a computer or telephone network, including wireless communications networks. The latter embodiment specifically includes transmitting information to/from the Internet and other networks. Such communications media, when carrying computer-readable instructions that direct the functions of the present invention, are embodiments of the present invention. Broadly, computer-readable storage media and communications media may be referred to herein as computer-readable media.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In general, the routines executed to implement the embodiments of the invention, may be part of an operating system or a specific application, component, program, module, object, or sequence of instructions. The computer program of the present invention typically is comprised of a multitude of instructions that will be translated by the native computer into a machine-readable format and hence executable instructions. Also, programs are comprised of variables and data structures that either reside locally to the program or are found in memory or on storage devices. In addition, various programs described hereinafter may be identified based upon the application for which they are implemented in a specific embodiment of the invention. However, it should be appreciated that any particular program nomenclature that follows is used merely for convenience, and thus the invention should not be limited to use solely in any specific application identified and/or implied by such nomenclature.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary graphical user interface (GUI) <b>100</b> according to the prior art. GUI <b>100</b> may be displayed on a display screen, such as, for example, a computer monitor to facilitate communication between a user and an application. The GUI <b>100</b> may include a title bar <b>110</b> and a menu bar <b>120</b> having a plurality of menus including, for example, the File menu <b>121</b>, Edit menu, View menu, Tools menu, and Help menu, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. A particular menu may be selected from the menu bar, for example, by clicking on a desired menu using a mouse. Each of the menus in the menu bar <b>120</b> are drop down menus. Therefore, when a particular menu is selected, a list of items in the menu is displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A particular item may be selected from a drop down menu by moving the mouse pointer vertically up and down the list until the mouse pointer is above a desired item. Selecting a menu item may include performing a second mouse click to select the desired item. For example, a first mouse click on a desired menu may display menu items in a drop down list. A user may then move a mouse pointer vertically up and/or down until the mouse pointer is over a desired menu item. Once the mouse pointer is above the desired menu item, a second click of the mouse may result in the selection of the menu item.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some cases, a menu item may be a sub-menu. For example, the Send To item of the File Menu may be a sub-menu. Accordingly, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, moving the mouse pointer over the Send To item <b>150</b> may result is a cascaded sub-menu <b>122</b> to be displayed. Each cascaded sub-menu may have its own cascaded sub menu, which may result in several cascaded sub-menus being displayed before the desired item is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">However, menu bars and drop down menus are not efficient at allowing a user to quickly select a desired item. First, selecting a menu item requires at least two mouse clicks as described above. Second, in drop down menus having a large number of items, the menu items may be closely spaced, which may require the user to scan up and down along the menu several times before a desired item is found. Furthermore, drop down menus with a large number of closely spaced items have an increased probability of erroneous selection of menu items.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The inefficiency of drop down menus may adversely affect users of applications where a fast response time is desired from the user while interacting with the applications. For example, in a gaming application a user's response time in responding to a particular circumstance in the game may be critical to the user's performance in the game. As an example, in a game where performance is determined by the user's ability to defeat opponents in a fight, the ability of the user to detect and quickly attack opponents may be crucial to performing successfully completing the game.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Embodiments of the invention provide radial menus that allow users to quickly make selections of menu items using a set of predefined gestures. The predefined gestures may include simple and/or complex gestures. The terms &#x201c;simple&#x201d; and &#x201c;complex&#x201d; as used herein are not meant to be limiting on the invention. Rather, the terms &#x201c;simple&#x201d; and &#x201c;complex&#x201d; are used to illustrate that a wide range of different gestures may be used to facilitate interaction between a user and a radial menu.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one embodiment, a radial menu may be displayed on a display screen in response to detecting a predefined screen pointer event such as a mouse click. Other screen pointer events may include touching the display screen with a finger or stylus pen, pressing one or more keys on a keyboard, receiving a voice command, and the like. Thereafter, a complex gesture may be made using the screen pointer to select the active radial menu item.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a block diagram of a system <b>200</b> in which embodiments of the invention may be implemented. The system <b>200</b> may include a Central Processing Unit (CPU) <b>211</b> connected via a bus <b>220</b> to a memory <b>212</b>, storage <b>216</b>, an input device <b>217</b>, an output device <b>218</b>, and a network interface device <b>219</b>. The input device <b>217</b> can be any device to give input to the system <b>200</b>. For example, a keyboard, keypad, light-pen, touch-screen, track-ball, or speech recognition unit, audio/video player, and the like could be used. The output device <b>218</b> can be any device to give output to the user, e.g., any conventional display screen. Although shown separately from the input device <b>217</b>, the output device <b>218</b> and input device <b>217</b> could be combined. For example, a display screen with an integrated touch-screen, a display with an integrated keyboard, or a speech recognition unit combined with a text speech converter could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The network interface device <b>219</b> may be any entry/exit device configured to allow network communications between the system <b>200</b> and one or more other devices <b>291</b> via a network <b>290</b>. For example, the network interface device <b>219</b> may be a network adapter or other network interface card (NIC).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Storage <b>216</b> is preferably a Direct Access Storage Device (DASD). Although it is shown as a single unit, it could be a combination of fixed and/or removable storage devices, such as fixed disc drives, floppy disc drives, tape drives, removable memory cards, or optical storage. The memory <b>212</b> and storage <b>216</b> could be part of one virtual address space spanning multiple primary and secondary storage devices.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The memory <b>212</b> is preferably a random access memory sufficiently large to hold the necessary programming and data structures of the invention. While memory <b>212</b> is shown as a single entity, it should be understood that memory <b>212</b> may in fact comprise a plurality of modules, and that memory <b>212</b> may exist at multiple levels, from high speed registers and caches to lower speed but larger DRAM chips.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Illustratively, the memory <b>212</b> contains an operating system <b>213</b>. Illustrative operating systems, which may be used to advantage, include Linux (Linux is a trademark of Linus Torvalds in the US, other countries, or both) and Microsoft's Windows&#xae;. More generally, any operating system supporting the functions disclosed herein may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Memory <b>212</b> may also include one or more applications <b>214</b>. The applications <b>214</b> may be software products comprising a plurality of instructions that are resident at various times in memory and storage devices in the computer system <b>200</b>. When read and executed by one or more CPU <b>211</b>, the applications <b>214</b> may cause the computer system <b>200</b> to perform the steps necessary to execute steps or elements embodying the various aspects of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In one embodiment, the applications <b>214</b> may include a menu manager program <b>215</b>, which may be configured to display a radial menu on the output device <b>218</b>, and detect selection of one or more radial menu items, as is discussed in greater detail below. In some embodiments the application program <b>214</b> and menu manager <b>215</b> may reside on a networked computer device <b>291</b> and may be configured to manage radial menus on the output device <b>218</b> of computer system <b>200</b>. The applications <b>214</b> may also include user preferences <b>221</b>. The user preferences <b>221</b> may determine one or more characteristics of radial menus, for example, the displaying of radial menus, making selections from radial menus, and the like, as will be discussed in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an exemplary radial menu <b>300</b>, according to an embodiment of the invention. In one embodiment, the radial menu <b>300</b> may be displayed in an application window <b>100</b> by the menu manager <b>215</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, in alternative embodiments, the menu manager <b>215</b> may be configured to display the radial menu <b>300</b> at any location on a screen, whether inside or outside a window.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In general, the radial menu <b>300</b> may include a center <b>310</b> and a plurality of radial menu items <b>320</b> placed radially outwards from the center <b>310</b>. For purposes of illustration, the radial menu <b>300</b> is assumed to be associated with an image editing software. Accordingly, the radial menu items <b>320</b> displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> include &#x201c;Previous Image&#x201d;, &#x201c;Next Image&#x201d;, &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d;, &#x201c;Rotate Clockwise&#x201d;, &#x201c;Rotate Counterclockwise&#x201d;, &#x201c;Save&#x201d;, &#x201c;Exit&#x201d;, and &#x201c;Delete&#x201d;. In a particular embodiment, the radial menu <b>300</b> may include between 6 and 8 radial menu items, however, any reasonable number of radial menu items may be included in the radial menu <b>300</b> in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The radial menu items <b>320</b> may be selected by using a screen pointer such as, for example, a mouse pointer, a stylus pen, trackball pointer, and the like, as is described in greater detail below. Each of the radial menu items <b>320</b> may be associated with commands and/or functions that may be used to communicate with an application <b>114</b> associated with the radial menu <b>300</b>. For example, the &#x201c;Next Image&#x201d; radial menu item, when selected, may cause a new image to be displayed in an application content area <b>130</b> of window <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. As another example, the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item, when selected, may launch a function that may allow a user to insert annotations for an image displayed in the application content area <b>130</b>. In some embodiments, selecting a radial menu item may result in a second or cascaded radial menu to be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In one embodiment of the invention, the radial menu items <b>320</b> may be displayed as a &#x201c;pie slices&#x201d; <b>320</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, in alternative embodiments, the radial menu items may have any reasonable shape that allows a plurality of radial menu items <b>320</b> to be displayed radially outwards from the center <b>310</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, illustrate some alternative shapes for the radial menu items <b>320</b>. Furthermore, while a circular radial menu <b>300</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in alternative embodiments, the radial menu <b>300</b> may be semicircular, quadra circular, or any other radial shape. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref> illustrates a semicircular radial menu, according to an embodiment of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The radial menu <b>300</b> may be a pop-up menu that is displayed upon the occurrence of a predefined screen pointer event. For example, in one embodiment, the menu manager <b>215</b> may be configured to display the radial menu <b>300</b> on a screen (for example, in window <b>100</b>) upon detecting a mouse click. In a particular embodiment, the radial menu <b>300</b> may be displayed when a right button of a mouse is clicked. While using mouse clicks to display radial menus is described herein, alternative screen pointer events that may cause a radial menu to appear may include, for example, touching a screen with a stylus pen or finger, pressing one or more keys on a keyboard, receiving a voice command, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment of the invention, the menu manager <b>215</b> may display the radial menu such that the center of the radial menu aligns with the screen pointer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a radial menu <b>300</b> displayed such that the center <b>310</b> of the radial menu <b>300</b> aligns with a location <b>520</b> of a screen pointer <b>510</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the screen pointer may be a mouse pointer and the location <b>520</b> may be a location of the mouse pointer when the mouse is clicked. Alternatively the location <b>520</b> may be the location where a stylus pen or finger touches a display screen.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Selection of a radial menu item from a radial menu may involve moving the screen pointer <b>510</b> in the direction of a desired radial menu item <b>320</b>. For example, to select the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item, the screen pointer may be moved straight up (in a generally 90 degrees direction) towards the pie slice of the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item. The moving of the screen pointer on the display screen is generally referred to hereinafter as a &#x201c;stroke&#x201d; or a gesture (the terms gesture and stroke are used interchangeably herein). In the case of a mouse pointer, strokes may be performed by simply moving the mouse on a mouse pad. While using a stylus pen or finger on a touch screen, the finger or stylus pen may simply be dragged across the screen to perform a stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The gestures used for selecting radial menu items may be selected from a predefined set of gestures. The predefined set of gestures may include any combination of simple and/or complex predefined gestures. In other words, a wide range of different gestures may be defined to facilitate interaction between a user and the radial menu. As an example, simple gestures may include movement of a screen pointer in a single direction. Complex gestures may include movement of a screen pointer in multiple directions. In one embodiment, performing the gestures may also include other screen pointer events such as, for example, button click downs, button release, and the like. For example, in some embodiments, the gestures may be performed while a mouse button is clicked down. Alternatively, in other embodiments, the gestures may be performed before, after, or in between one or more screen pointer events such as, for example, in between mouse button click down and releases.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment, placing the screen pointer over a radial menu item <b>320</b> may cause the radial menu item to become active. When a radial menu item <b>320</b> is active, the occurrence of a selection event, such as, for example, a mouse click, may cause the radial menu item <b>320</b> to be selected. In one embodiment of the invention, the menu manager <b>215</b> may be configured to provide a visual indication to identify an active radial menu item.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an exemplary stroke <b>610</b> which results in the activation of a radial menu item, according to an embodiment of the invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the stroke <b>610</b> moves the screen pointer over the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item. As a result, the menu manager <b>215</b> may change the background color of the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; pie slice, which is indicated by the shading of the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; pie slice in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The change in color may identify the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item as the active item. Other methods for providing a visual indication such as, for example, bold facing the letters of the active radial menu item, dimming or fading the pie slices or letters of non-active radial menu items, and the like, are also contemplated. While a straight line stroke is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the stroke <b>610</b> may include any movement in any and/or multiple directions on a display screen in alternative embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In one embodiment, the center <b>310</b> of the radial menu <b>300</b> may be an inactive center. In other words, no radial menu items <b>320</b> may be active while the screen pointer <b>510</b> lies over the center portion <b>310</b>. Therefore, when the menu manager <b>215</b> aligns the center <b>310</b> of the radial menu when the radial menu is displayed as described above, no radial menu items <b>320</b> may be initially active. Thereafter, user strokes may cause one or more radial menu items to become active. If the user strokes return the screen pointer to the center <b>310</b>, all radial menu items may again become inactive.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">One embodiment of the invention may allow radial menu items <b>320</b> to be selected using multiple gestures. In some embodiments, the gestures may include one or more screen pointer events such as, for example, mouse click downs (pressing a mouse button), mouse click offs (releasing the mouse button), touching a screen with a stylus pen or finger, removing stylus pen or finger from the screen and the like. The menu manager <b>215</b> may be configured to analyze gestures performed on a display screen to determine whether a radial menu item is selected. In one embodiment, a plurality of predefined gestures may correspond to respective menu item selections.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">For example, exemplary gestures for selecting a radial menu item may include performing a first mouse click, i.e., a mouse button click down and release. The first mouse click may display a radial menu, for example, the radial menu <b>300</b> on the display screen. Thereafter, one or more gestures may be performed to move the mouse pointer over a desired radial menu item <b>320</b>. As discussed above, menu manager <b>215</b> may provide a visual indication that the desired radial menu item is active. When the mouse pointer is over the desired radial menu item, the mouse may be clicked a second time. Because the second mouse click occurred while the mouse pointer is above a radial menu item <b>320</b>, the menu manager may determine that a radial menu item selection has occurred. Therefore, the menu manager <b>215</b> may cause a command or function associated with the selected radial menu item to be executed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one embodiment of the invention, the gestures for selecting a radial menu item may include a first mouse click (i.e., a mouse click down and release) that causes a radial menu to be displayed on the display screen, a first gesture configured to activate a radial menu item, and a predefined second gesture that is configured to select the radial menu item. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> illustrates exemplary first and second gestures according to an embodiment of the invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a first gesture <b>710</b> may move the screen pointer <b>510</b> from a center <b>310</b> of the radial menu to the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item. Thereafter, a predefined second gesture may be performed to select the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, predefined second gesture may involve moving the screen pointer in a zigzag back and forth motion over a same path. If the predefined back and forth motion is detected by the menu manager while the screen pointer is over a radial menu item, the radial menu item may be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Any reasonable predefined movement of the screen pointer <b>510</b> may be used as a radial menu selection event. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> illustrates an alternative predefined second motion that may result in the selection of a radial menu item. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, a first gesture may move the screen pointer <b>510</b> from a center <b>310</b> of the radial menu to the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item. A predefined second gesture may move the screen pointer back in a direction towards the center <b>310</b>, which may result in the selection of the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item. Still another alternative predefined second gestures may include substantially circular and/or semi-circular movement of the screen pointer over the radial menu item.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In another embodiment, the gestures for selecting a radial menu item may involve a mouse button click down (without release), a first gesture for activating a radial menu item, and a second predefined gesture for selecting the radial menu item. The mouse button may be released after selection of the radial menu item. The mouse button click down may cause a radial menu to be displayed. The first gesture and predefined second gesture may function as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, if a second predefined gesture is not received within a predefined period of time after activation of the radial menu, the menu manager <b>215</b> may be configured to close the radial menu. Closing the radial menu may involve removing the radial menu from the display screen. In some embodiments, the predefined period of time may begin after completion of the first gesture, e.g., after the screen pointer stops moving. For example, a screen pointer event may cause the radial menu to be displayed. Thereafter, a first gesture may be completed to activate a radial menu item. If the predefined second gesture is not received within the predefined period of time after completion of the first gesture, the radial menu may be closed by the menu manager <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In yet another embodiment, the menu manager <b>215</b> may select an active radial menu item if the radial menu item has been active for a predefined period of time. Accordingly, the gesture for selecting a radial menu item may involve a mouse button click down (with or without release), and a first gesture for activating a radial menu item. The mouse button click down may cause a radial menu to be displayed. The first stroke may function as described above to activate a radial menu item. The menu manager <b>215</b> may monitor the time for which a particular radial menu item has been active, and select the radial menu item after the predefined period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">While the first gesture is illustrated as a straight line from the center <b>310</b> of the radial menu to a desired radial menu element <b>320</b>, in some embodiments, the first gesture may include movement along any part of the display screen. For example, a user may initially move the screen pointer in the direction of a first radial menu item, but then decide to choose a second radial menu item instead. Accordingly, the user may move the screen pointer across the screen until the desired second radial menu item is activated. Once the second radial menu item is activated, the user may perform the predefined second gesture to select the second radial menu item.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref> illustrates exemplary first and second gestures according to another embodiment of the invention. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>, the first gesture <b>710</b> may include an initial movement towards a first radial menu item (&#x201c;Annotate&#x201d;). The first stroke <b>710</b> may continue to move across the screen until a second radial menu item (&#x201c;Delete&#x201d;) is activated, as indicated by the shading. Thereafter, a predefined second gesture <b>720</b> may be performed to select the second radial menu item. In some embodiments, the first gesture may include movement over multiple radial menu items until a desired radial menu item is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment of the invention, gestures for selecting a radial menu item may include a first mouse click (i.e., a mouse click down and release) that causes a radial menu to be displayed on the display screen, and a first gesture configured to activate and select the radial menu item. The first gesture may activate a menu item <b>320</b> when the mouse pointer is moved thereon. Furthermore, the menu manager <b>215</b> may be configured to analyze a speed of the screen pointer during the first stroke. If the speed exceeds (or falls below) a predefined threshold value, the activated radial menu item may be selected. The threshold speed values may be user configurable in some embodiments. For example, the threshold speed values may be defined by a user in the user preferences <b>221</b> (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In one embodiment of the invention, different gestures may be defined for interacting with different parts of the radial menu. For example, in one embodiment, a first predefined stroke may be defined for selecting radial menu items located on a first side, for example, the right side of the radial menu, and a second predefined stroke may be defined for selecting radial menu items located on a second side, for example, the left side of the radial menu. In alternative embodiment, the same stroke may result in different results in different parts of the radial menu. For example, in one embodiment, a predefined stroke performed on a first side of the radial menu may result in the activation of a radial menu item. However, performing the same predefined stroke on a second side of the radial menu may result in a radial menu item being selected.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In one embodiment of the invention, each pie slice of the radial menu may be overloaded with two or more radial menu items. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref> illustrates an exemplary radial menu <b>700</b> comprising a plurality of pie slices <b>730</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7D</figref>, each pie slice <b>730</b> may include a first radial menu item <b>751</b><sub>1-6 </sub>and a second radial menu item <b>752</b><sub>1-6</sub>. In one embodiment of the invention, a gesture for selecting a first radial menu item <b>751</b><sub>1-6 </sub>may include a first mouse click (i.e., a mouse click down with or without release) that causes a radial menu to be displayed on the display screen, a first stroke configured to activate the first radial menu item <b>751</b><sub>1-6</sub>, and a corresponding second radial menu item <b>752</b><sub>1-6</sub>, and a predefined second stroke configured to select the first radial menu item <b>751</b><sub>1-6</sub>. An exemplary predefined second stroke may include a stroke in a clockwise direction. A gesture for selecting a second radial menu item <b>751</b><sub>1-6 </sub>may include a first mouse click (i.e., a mouse click down with or without release) that causes a radial menu to be displayed on the display screen, a first stroke configured to activate the second radial menu item <b>752</b><sub>1-6 </sub>and a corresponding first radial menu item <b>751</b><sub>1-6</sub>, and a predefined third stroke configured to select the second radial menu item <b>751</b><sub>1-6</sub>. An exemplary predefined third stroke may include a stroke in the counter-clockwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one embodiment of the invention, a user may be allowed to define the particular gestures for selecting items from a radial menu. For example, in one embodiment, the application <b>114</b> may be configured to display a graphical user interface that allows a user to define a gesture for selecting radial menu items. The user defined gesture may be stored in the user preferences <b>221</b>, in one embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref> illustrates an exemplary graphical user interface for defining a gesture for selecting radial menu items. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, the user preferences <b>221</b> may include a first column <b>761</b> for defining screen pointer movement (or strokes), a second column <b>762</b> for defining mouse button input, and a third column <b>763</b> for defining an action performed based on the defined inputs in columns <b>761</b> and <b>762</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, the GUI <b>760</b> may include a plurality of drop down menus <b>767</b> for defining the particular inputs and the actions performed in response to the inputs. Alternatively, the GUI may include radio buttons, text boxes, check boxes, and the like for defining the inputs and actions. In some embodiments, the GUI <b>760</b> may include a screen where the input (for example, strokes and mouse clicks) may be performed to define the inputs and/or actions.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The first row <b>764</b> defines an exemplary screen pointer event, i.e., right mouse button click down, that results in a radial menu being displayed. Alternatively, a right mouse button click down and click off may also be selected as a predefined screen pointer event for displaying a radial menu. As can be seen in row <b>764</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, the no screen pointer movement has been defined. In alternative embodiments, the user may define a screen pointer movement for displaying the radial menu instead of (or in addition to) the right button mouse click down.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Row <b>765</b> illustrates inputs for activating radial menu items. As illustrated, radial menu items may be activated when the right mouse button is held down and the screen pointer is moved in any direction as illustrated by the symbol in row <b>765</b>, column <b>761</b>. Alternatively, a user may choose to select a straight line movement of the screen pointer for selecting radial menu items. Row <b>766</b> illustrates a predefined second stroke, i.e., a circular stroke, for selecting a radial menu item. Row <b>767</b> illustrates a mouse button click off. While no action is shown for the mouse button click off on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7E</figref>, in some embodiments, the mouse button click off may result in predefined action, for example, selection of the radial menu item, removing of the radial menu from the display screen, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In one embodiment of the invention, it may be possible to select radial menu items even though a selection event occurs outside the bounds of the radial menu. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an exemplary radial menu <b>300</b> comprising a plurality of extra-territorial zones <b>810</b><sub>1-8 </sub>associated with respective radial menu items <b>320</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the zones <b>810</b><sub>1-8 </sub>may be outside the visible bounds of the radial menu <b>300</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the outside bounds of the radial menu <b>300</b> are demarcated by a circle <b>301</b>. The circle <b>301</b> is merely illustrative. In other embodiments, any visible geometric shape <b>301</b> is contemplated. In one embodiment of the invention, if a screen pointer is in a zone <b>810</b>, the radial menu item <b>320</b> associated with the zone <b>810</b> may be active. Accordingly, if a selection event occurs in the zone <b>810</b>, a selection of the radial menu item associated with the zone <b>810</b> may occur. In other words, a pie slice of the radial menu item <b>320</b> and a respective zone <b>810</b> may define a selection zone of a radial menu item within which gestures may be performed for selection of the radial menu item.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a first stroke <b>810</b> which moves the screen pointer <b>510</b> across the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item pie slice and into the zone <b>810</b><sub>3 </sub>associated with the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item remains active even though the screen pointer is outside the bounds of the radial menu <b>300</b>. Further as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a predefined second stroke <b>720</b> may occur in the zone <b>810</b><sub>3 </sub>associated with the &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item. The menu manager <b>215</b> may detect the predefined second stroke in the zone <b>810</b><sub>3 </sub>and cause the respective &#x201c;Annotate&#x201d; radial menu item to be selected.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Allowing users to make elongated first strokes such as, for example, the elongated first stroke <b>710</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may reduce errors in selection of radial menu items. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the further the screen pointer is moved from the center <b>310</b> of the radial menu, the greater the area that is available for making gestures such as, for example, the predefined second gestures. By providing greater area for gestures, the probability of gesture strokes accidently moving into zones <b>810</b> of undesired radial menu items may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Furthermore, activating radial menu items as a user performs a first stroke that is outside the bounds of the radial menu item may allow greater precision in the activation of a desired radial menu item. For example, the further the screen pointer <b>510</b> is from the center <b>310</b>, the greater the radial distance that must be traveled by the screen pointer <b>510</b> to a zone <b>810</b> of an adjacent radial menu item. One skilled in the art will appreciate that allowing a user to move the screen pointer in a wider arcs around the radial menu allows increased precision in activating desired radial menu items.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in some embodiments the zones <b>810</b> may extend to the edges of a display area, for example, to the edges of a display screen, an application window, or the like. In an alternative embodiment, a predefined limited selection zone may be defined outside the bounds of the radial menu for receiving selections of radial menu items. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a circular perimeter <b>900</b> around the radial menu <b>300</b> that defines a plurality of zones <b>910</b><sub>1-8 </sub>for each of the radial menu items <b>320</b>. In one embodiment, the perimeter may be made visible to the user, for example, by displaying a solid line, dashed line, shading the zones <b>910</b>, or the like. The perimeter <b>900</b> may have a predefined distance d from the center <b>310</b> of the radial menu <b>300</b>. For example, the perimeter d may be defined by a user in the user preferences <b>221</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. While a circular perimeter is shown herein, in alternative embodiments the perimeter <b>900</b> may have any reasonable shape that encompasses the radial menu <b>300</b>. The dimensions of the perimeter may be user configurable in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In one embodiment of the invention, a predefined second stroke as described above, if performed within a zone <b>910</b>, may result in the selection of a respective radial menu item <b>320</b>. If a screen pointer is moved outside the perimeter <b>900</b>, all radial menu items <b>320</b> may become inactive. Therefore, if the predefined second stroke is performed outside the perimeter <b>900</b>, a radial menu item <b>320</b> may not be selected, thus creating a non-selective zone in the direction of a gesture if the user changes his/her mind regarding selection.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In one embodiment of the invention, selecting a radial menu item <b>320</b> may involve performing the first stroke followed by a predefined second stroke as described above. The first stroke may include moving the screen pointer in and out of the perimeter <b>900</b>. An exemplary first stroke <b>710</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. As illustrated, the first stroke <b>710</b> may begin with a movement of the mouse pointer towards a first radial menu item (&#x201c;Previous Image&#x201d;). As the screen pointer is moved across the pie slice representing the first radial menu item and the zone <b>910</b> associated therewith, the menu manager <b>215</b> may activate the first radial menu item. However, when the screen pointer moves outside the perimeter <b>900</b>, the first radial menu item may be deactivated by the menu manager <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As illustrated further in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the first stroke may continue to move the screen pointer outside the perimeter <b>900</b> and reenter the perimeter <b>900</b> in a zone <b>910</b> associated with a second radial menu item (&#x201c;Rotate Counterclockwise&#x201d;). When the screen pointer enters the zone <b>910</b> associated with the second radial menu item, the menu manager <b>215</b> may activate the second menu item. However, when the screen pointer moves outside the perimeter <b>900</b> again, the second radial menu item may be deactivated by the menu manager <b>215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The screen pointer may be moved in and out of the perimeter <b>900</b> several times as described above, which may result in the activation and deactivation of several radial menu items. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, depicts the first stroke terminating in a selection zone of a third radial menu item (&#x201c;Exit&#x201d;), thereby activating the third radial menu item as illustrated. A predefined second stroke <b>720</b> associated with the activated menu item is also shown, which may result in the selection of the third radial menu item. In a particular embodiment, the selection may occur upon the release of a pressed mouse button.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In one embodiment of the invention, moving the screen pointer outside the perimeter <b>900</b> may result in the radial menu <b>300</b> being removed from the display screen. This may allow a user to cancel or remove the radial menu from the screen in a fluid gesture without additional actions. For example, if a user causes a radial menu to be displayed on the screen (by clicking a mouse button for example), and decides that he no longer wants to make a selection from the radial menu, the user may simply make an elongated straight line first stroke that would take the screen pointer outside the predefined perimeter <b>900</b>. Upon detecting that the screen pointer is outside the perimeter <b>900</b>, the menu manager <b>215</b> may remove the radial menu from the display screen.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow diagram of exemplary operations that may be performed by a menu manager <b>215</b>, according to an embodiment of the invention. The operations may begin in step <b>1010</b> by receiving a predefined screen pointer event. Exemplary predefined screen pointer events may include, for example, a mouse click down, touching of a touch screen with a stylus pen or finger, and the like. In response to receiving the predefined screen pointer event the menu manager <b>215</b> may display a radial menu on a display screen, in step <b>1020</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In step <b>1030</b>, the menu manager <b>215</b> may receive a first stroke of the screen pointer. As described above, the first stroke may include a movement of the screen pointer in any direction and/or multiple directions on the display screen. As the screen pointer moves across the screen during the first stroke, the menu manager may determine whether the screen pointer is within a predefined selection zone of one or more radial menu items of the radial menu in step <b>1040</b>. The predefined selection zone may include the pie slices <b>320</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In some embodiments, the predefined selection zone may also include the zones <b>910</b>, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">If the screen pointer is determined to be outside the predefined selection zone, all radial menu items may be deactivated in step <b>1050</b>. On the other hand, if the screen pointer is within a predefined selection, zone a radial menu item associated with the predefined selection zone may be activated for selection in step <b>1060</b>. In one embodiment, activating a radial menu item for selection may involve providing a visual indication that the radial menu item is active.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In step <b>1070</b>, the menu manager <b>215</b> may receive a predefined second stroke, for example, the predefined second strokes <b>720</b> described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>. In response to receiving the predefined second stroke, the menu manager <b>215</b> may select a respective active radial menu item in step <b>1080</b>. In one embodiment, selecting the radial menu item may involve launching execution of a command or function associated with the selected radial menu item.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In one embodiment of the invention, after selection of a radial menu item, the menu manager <b>215</b> may remove the radial menu from the display screen. In a particular embodiment, after selection of a particular radial menu item, the radial menu may be removed from the display screen after a predefined period of time. In some embodiments, the radial menu may fade away during the predefined period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">During the predefined period of time after selection of a radial menu item during which the radial menu is displayed on the display screen, the user may be allowed to enter a predefined gesture to undo the selection in some embodiments of the invention. For example, in one embodiment, as the radial menu is fading away during the predefined time period, a predefined screen pointer event such as a mouse click, and/or a predefined stroke may undo the selection of the radial menu item.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">By providing a radial menu where selections can be made with simple and quick gestures and strokes, embodiments of the invention facilitate fast selection of menu items in comparison to traditional drop down menus.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">While the foregoing is directed to embodiments of the present invention, other and further embodiments of the invention may be devised without departing from the basic scope thereof, and the scope thereof is determined by the claims that follow.</p>
