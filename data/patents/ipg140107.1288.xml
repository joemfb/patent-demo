<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus for restraining an object in a vehicle may have an elongated frame, a clamp member mounted to the frame at or near one end thereof, and an elongated base member movably mounted to the frame between the clamp member and an opposite end of the frame. The base member may include a curved portion having a support surface defining a curvature and a linear portion between the curved portion and the clamp member. The base member may be movable relative to the frame to an object transition position in which a free end of the linear portion extends outwardly away from the frame and the curved portion retracts upwardly toward the clamp member along a path defined by the curvature to allow the object to be received between, and removed from between, the clamp member and the support surface of the base member.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to restraint systems for transportation vehicles, and more specifically to apparatuses and methods for restraining objects in transportation vehicles.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various mechanisms and apparatuses are known for restraining objects in vehicles. It is desirable to provide such mechanisms and apparatuses with an object restraining structure that allows an object to be easily received within and removed from the mechanism or apparatus under quasi-static conditions, and that retains the object within the mechanism or apparatus under dynamic loading conditions such as may occur during vehicle crash events.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention may comprise one or more of the features recited in the attached claims, and/or one or more of the following features and combinations thereof. An apparatus for restraining an object in a vehicle may comprise an elongated frame configured to be mounted within the vehicle, the frame having a first end and a second end opposite the first end, a clamp member mounted to the elongated frame at or near the first end of the elongated frame, and an elongated base member movably mounted to the elongated frame between the clamp member and the second end of the elongated frame. The elongated base member may include a curved portion having a support surface defining a curvature and a linear portion between the curved portion and the clamp member with one end of the curved portion coupled to one end of the linear portion. The elongated base member may be movable relative to the elongated frame to an object transition position in which a free end of the linear portion extends outwardly away from the elongated frame and the curved portion retracts upwardly toward the clamp member along a path defined by the curvature to allow the object to be received between, and removed from between, the clamp member and the support surface of the elongated base member.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The elongated base member may be movable relative to the elongated frame to an object retaining position in which the free end of the linear portion is positioned adjacent to the frame and the curved portion extends outwardly from the frame with the object retained by the apparatus between the clamp member and the support surface of the elongated base member. The clamp member may be movably mounted to the elongated frame. The clamp member may be movable relative to the elongated frame between an open position in which the object may be received between, and removed from between, the clamp member and the support surface of the elongated base member when the elongated base member is in its object transition position, and a closed position in which the object is retained by the apparatus between the clamp member and the support surface of the elongated base member when the elongated base member is in its object retaining position. The apparatus may further comprise a blocking member movably mounted to the frame and configured to move relative to the frame under dynamic loading conditions to a position that blocks movement of the clamp member sufficiently to retain the object between the clamp member and the elongated base member under the dynamic loading conditions when the object retained by the apparatus between the clamp member and the support surface of the elongated base member. The dynamic loading conditions are illustratively defined as conditions under which inertial forces are directed outwardly away from the frame in a direction toward the object positioned within the apparatus. The clamp member may be movable between its open and closed positions and the elongated base member may be movable between its object transition and object retaining positions under quasi-static conditions. The quasi-static conditions are illustratively defined as conditions under which any movement of the blocking member does not block movement of the clamp member. The frame may define at least one channel therein. The clamp member may have at least one protrusion that extends into the at least one channel defined by the frame such that the at least one protrusion travels along the at least one channel when the clamp member moves relative to the frame. The blocking member may blocks movement of the clamp member relative to the frame by extending at least partially across the at least one channel under the dynamic loading conditions to provide a barrier to travel of the at least one protrusion in at least one direction of travel of the at least one protrusion along the at least one channel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with any of the preceding paragraphs of this summary section, the vehicle may include a vehicle seat having a seat bottom and a seat back both mounted to a vehicle seat frame that is mounted within the vehicle, and the frame may be mounted to the seat back. Alternatively or additionally, the frame may be mounted to the vehicle seat frame.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with any of the preceding paragraphs of this summary section, the object may comprise a cylinder. The cylinder may illustratively comprise an air tank for a self contained breathing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with any of the preceding paragraphs of this summary section, the elongated base member may comprise a first elongated base member and a second elongated base member. The first and second elongated base members may be movably mounted side-by-side to opposite sides of the elongated frame to define a space between the first and second elongated base members. The first and second elongated base members may each include a support surface defining the curvature and may have a free end and an opposite end coupled to one end of a linear portion between the curved portion and the clamp member. The linear portions of each of the first and second elongated base members may have free ends opposite the one ends thereof. The apparatus may further comprise a first mounting plate rigidly secured to one side of the elongated frame between the clamp member and the second end of the elongated frame, and a second mounting plate rigidly secured to an opposite side of the elongated frame between the clamp member and the second end of the elongated frame in side-by-side relationship with the first mounting plate. The first elongated base member may be movably mounted to the first mounting plate and the second elongated base member may be movably mounted to the second mounting plate. The first elongated base member may define a first curved slot therethrough and a first fixation member may extend through the first curved slot and into the first mounting plate to movably mount the first elongated base member to the first mounting plate. The second elongated base member may define a second curved slot therethrough and a second fixation member may extend through the second curved slot and into the second mounting plate to movably mount the second elongated base member to the second mounting plate. The first and second curved slots may define the same curvature as that defined by the support surfaces of each of the first and second elongated base members such that the curved portions of each of the first and second elongated base members retract upwardly toward the clamp member along the path defined by the curvature as the first and second fixation members move along the first and second curved slots respectively. Alternatively or additionally, the first mounting plate may define a first linear slot therethrough and the second mounting plate may define a second linear slot therethrough. A third fixation member may extend through the first and second elongated base members and through each of the first and second linear slots to movably mount the first elongated base member to the first mounting plate and movably mount the second elongated base member to the second mounting plate. The first and second linear slots may define an angle relative to a plane parallel to the elongated frame such that the free ends of the linear portions of each of the first and second elongated base members extend outwardly away from the elongated frame along a path defined by the angle as the third fixation member moves along the first and second linear slots. The object may be a cylindrical object having a domed surface at one end with a gas outlet of the cylindrical object extending outwardly from a center of the domed surface. The space defined between the first and second elongated base members may be sized to receive the gas outlet therein with portions of the domed surface on either side of the gas outlet supported by the support surfaces of each of the first and second elongated base members when the object is received by the elongated base member.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In accordance with any of the preceding paragraphs of this summary section, the apparatus may further comprise a biasing member connected at one end to the elongated frame and at an opposite end to the elongated base member. The biasing member may normally bias the elongated base member toward the object transition position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In accordance with any of the preceding paragraphs of this summary section, the object may be a cylindrical object having a domed surface that is supported by the support surface of the elongated base member. The apparatus may further comprise a spacer attached to, and adjustably positionable relative to, the elongated base member. The spacer may be configured to contact the object when the object is received within the apparatus and force the domed surface of the object to a desired position relative to the support surface of the curved portion of the elongated base member.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In accordance with any of the preceding paragraphs of this summary section, the apparatus may further comprise a first mounting plate rigidly secured to one side of the elongated frame between the clamp member and the second end of the elongated frame, and a second mounting plate rigidly secured to an opposite side of the elongated frame between the clamp member and the second end of the elongated frame in side-by-side relationship with the first mounting plate. The first mounting plate may define a first linear slot therethrough and the second mounting plate defines a second linear slot therethrough. A fixation member may extend through each of the first and second linear slots and through the elongated base member to movably mount the elongated base member to the first and second mounting plates. The first and second linear slots may define an angle relative to a plane parallel to the elongated frame such that the free end of the linear portion of the elongated base members extends outwardly away from the elongated frame along a path defined by the angle as the fixation member moves along the first and second linear slots.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In accordance with any of the preceding paragraphs of this summary section, the apparatus may further comprise a first mounting plate rigidly secured to one side of the elongated frame between the clamp member and the second end of the elongated frame, and a second mounting plate rigidly secured to an opposite side of the elongated frame between the clamp member and the second end of the elongated frame in side-by-side relationship with the first mounting plate. The elongated base member may define first and second curved slots therethrough, and a first fixation member may extend through the first curved slot and into the first mounting plate and a second fixation member may extend through the second curved slot and into the second mounting plate to movably mount the elongated base member to the first and second mounting plates. The first and second curved slots may define the same curvature as that defined by the support surface of the elongated base member such that the curved portion of the elongated base member retracts upwardly toward the clamp member along the path defined by the curvature as the first and second fixation members move along the first and second curved slots respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In accordance with any of the preceding paragraphs of this summary section, the clamp member may be movably mounted to the frame. The apparatus may further comprise a blocking member movably mounted to the frame and configured to move relative to the frame under dynamic loading conditions to a position that blocks movement of the clamp member sufficiently to retain the object between the clamp member and the elongated base member under the dynamic loading conditions when the object retained by the apparatus between the clamp member and the support surface of the elongated base member. The dynamic loading conditions are illustratively defined as conditions under which inertial forces are directed outwardly away from the frame in a direction toward the object positioned within the apparatus.</p>

Another conventional roller <b>50</b>B is coupled to the free end of the gripping arm <b>18</b>, and is configured to be freely rotatable relative to the gripping arm <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, one illustrative embodiment of the gripping arm <b>18</b> is shown. In the illustrated embodiment, the gripping arm <b>18</b> includes a pair of generally arcuate plates <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B and an arcuate-shaped mass <b>40</b>B that is sized and configured to be sandwiched between the plates <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B. The conventional roller <b>50</b>B is mounted between the plates <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B at the free end of the gripping arm <b>18</b>, and the mass <b>40</b>B extends away from the roller <b>50</b>B and along an arcuate portion of the gripping arm <b>18</b> between the plates <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B. A number of conventional fastening elements <b>42</b> secure the two plates <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B together with the mass <b>40</b>B sandwiched between the two. Juxtaposed bores <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B are defined through the plates <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B respectively, near the opposite ends of the plates <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B. The retaining pin <b>48</b> extends through the top plate <b>20</b>A of the upper frame member <b>20</b> and through the bores <b>44</b>A and <b>44</b>B, to movably mount the gripping arm <b>18</b> to the upper frame member <b>20</b>. The gripping arm <b>18</b> pivots about the retaining pin <b>48</b> relative to the upper frame member <b>20</b>, and the retaining pin <b>48</b> thereby defines a pivot point of the gripping arm <b>18</b> relative to the upper frame member <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The gripping arm <b>18</b> further includes a guide member <b>52</b> that is mounted to the top plate <b>18</b>A via conventional fastening elements <b>56</b>A and <b>56</b>B. The guide member <b>52</b> defines a number of teeth <b>54</b> on one surface thereof that are configured to engage like teeth of a guide member attached to the gripping arm <b>16</b> as will be described in greater detail hereinafter. The gripping arm <b>18</b> further includes another conventional fastening element <b>58</b>B that not only secures the two plates <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B together, but that also forms a stop between the plates <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B for a biasing member that may be used to bias the gripping arm <b>18</b> to a default position relative to the upper frame member <b>20</b>, as will be described in greater detail hereinafter. In the illustrated embodiment, the gripping arm <b>16</b> is configured identically as described with respect to the gripping arm <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, except that the gripping arm <b>16</b> is movably attached to the top plate <b>20</b>A of the upper frame member <b>20</b> via the retaining pin <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, top plan views of the apparatus <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> are shown in partial cutaway and partially in phantom. More specifically, the top plate <b>20</b>A of the upper frame member <b>20</b> is shown in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> to allow for the viewing of components that are otherwise hidden by the top plate <b>20</b>A. Also, the top plates <b>16</b>A and <b>18</b>A of the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> respectively are shown in partial cutaway to illustrate placement of the masses <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B of the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the biasing members <b>60</b>A and <b>60</b>B are illustrated. More specifically, a biasing member <b>60</b>A is disposed between the back plate <b>20</b>B of the upper frame member <b>20</b> and the gripping arm <b>16</b>, and a biasing member <b>60</b>B is disposed between the back plate <b>20</b>B of the upper frame member <b>20</b> and the gripping arm <b>18</b>. The biasing members <b>60</b>A and <b>60</b>B are configured to apply biasing forces to the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> respectively that normally bias the free ends of the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> toward each other to form a mouth <b>70</b> between the two free ends. In the illustrated embodiment, the biasing members <b>60</b>A and <b>60</b>B are provided in the form of conventional torsional or coil springs having one leg <b>62</b>A, <b>64</b>A respectively in contact with the back plate <b>20</b>B and another leg <b>62</b>B, <b>64</b>B respectively in contact with the fastening element <b>58</b>A, <b>58</b>B respectively between the plates <b>16</b>A, <b>18</b>A and <b>18</b>B, <b>16</b>B respectively. It will be appreciated, however, that the biasing members <b>60</b>A and <b>60</b>B may alternatively be provided in the form of linear springs, flat springs or other conventional biasing members.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> may be spread apart to receive the object <b>11</b> therein by forcing the object <b>11</b> into the mouth <b>70</b> of the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> in the direction indicated by the arrows <b>72</b>. This action compresses the biasing members <b>60</b>A and <b>60</b>B as the free ends of the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> travel along the exterior of the object <b>11</b>, which is facilitated by the rolling action of the rollers <b>50</b>A and <b>50</b>B. As the object advances into the mouth <b>70</b>, the mouth <b>70</b> widens to accommodate the increasing diameter of the object <b>11</b>. Eventually, the widest diameter portion of the object <b>11</b> will pass by the rollers <b>50</b>A and <b>50</b>B, and the free ends of the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> will begin to close around the object <b>11</b> as the object <b>11</b> is advanced further toward the top plate <b>20</b>A of the upper frame member <b>20</b>. When fully received within the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, the object <b>11</b> the object <b>11</b> will reside between the top plate <b>20</b>A and the free ends of the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> as illustrated by example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. The object <b>11</b> may be withdrawn from the apparatus <b>10</b> by reversing the above process under quasi-static conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is desirable in some embodiments of the apparatus <b>10</b> with cylindrical objects to maintain the object <b>11</b> centrally between the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>. In this regard, the front face <b>20</b>A<sub>F </sub>of the top plate <b>20</b>A has a concave contour that acts to urge a cylindrical object <b>11</b> disposed between the free ends of the gripping arms <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> and the top plate <b>20</b>A to be positioned centrally with respect to the top plate <b>20</b>A and thus centrally with respect to the gripping arms <b>16</b>, <b>18</b>. The guide members <b>52</b>A and <b>52</b>B facilitate this by symmetrically guiding movement of the gripping arms <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">It should further be observed with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref> that the masses <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B extend from the free ends of the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> respectively, along the arcuate portions of the gripping arms <b>16</b>, and <b>18</b>, and terminate approximately at where the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> cross under the top plate <b>20</b>A of the upper frame member <b>20</b>. Such distribution of the masses <b>40</b>A and <b>40</b>B define, at least in part, centers of gravity of the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b>, and the centers of gravity of the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> relate directly to the gripping force of the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> as will be described in greater detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A method of restraining an object <b>11</b> in a vehicle <b>85</b> may comprise providing first and second gripping arms <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> each defining a free end as described hereinabove. The first and second gripping arms are then movably mounted to the frame <b>20</b> with the free ends of the gripping arms <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> extending toward each other. The frame <b>20</b> may then be secured to the vehicle <b>85</b> as described hereinabove with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-5</figref>. At least a portion of the object <b>11</b> may then be placed between the first and second gripping arms <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> with the free ends thereof extending at least partially about the object <b>11</b>. The first and second gripping arms <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> are configured, as will be described hereinafter with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, such that a restraining force exerted by the first and second gripping arms <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> on the object <b>11</b> is greater than or equal to an inertial force exerted by the object <b>11</b> on the first and second gripping arms <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> so that the object <b>11</b> is retained between the first and second gripping arms <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> under dynamic loading conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the apparatus <b>10</b> is illustrated similarly to that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, however, to facilitate an understanding of the operation of the apparatus <b>10</b> under dynamic loading conditions, the guide members <b>52</b>A and <b>52</b>B are omitted and a cylinder <b>12</b> portion of the object <b>11</b> is shown disposed between the free ends of the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> and the top plate <b>20</b>A of the upper frame member <b>20</b>. Under static conditions, the biasing members <b>60</b>A and <b>60</b>B bias the gripping arms <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> forwardly relative to the upper frame member <b>20</b> so that the free ends of the gripping arms <b>16</b> and <b>18</b> extend at least partially about the cylinder <b>12</b> and toward each other.</p>

In the illustrated embodiment, the apparatus <b>100</b> includes an elongated frame <b>102</b> having a first end <b>102</b>A and a second end <b>102</b>B opposite the first end <b>102</b>A. The frame <b>102</b>, like the frame <b>14</b> illustrated and described hereinabove, is configured to be mounted within a vehicle generally, and more specifically to at least a portion of a vehicle seat that is mounted within the vehicle.

In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the one end of the bracket <b>186</b> is rigidly secured to the pivot point <b>106</b> so that the bracket <b>186</b> rotates with the pivot point <b>106</b> as the top clamp is pivoted about the pivot point <b>106</b>. The opposite end of the bracket <b>186</b> is configured to engage a conventional locking retractor <b>194</b> that is mounted to the frame <b>102</b>.

In one embodiment, for example, the locking retractor <b>194</b> may be a conventional retractor that is configured to prevent the gear or wheel <b>190</b> from further rotational movement when the retractor <b>194</b> experiences a deceleration (i.e., negative acceleration) that is greater than a predefined deceleration threshold (i.e., that is greater in magnitude than a negative acceleration threshold). Alternatively, the locking retractor <b>194</b> may be a conventional retractor that is configured to prevent further rotation of the gear or wheel <b>192</b> when the gear or wheel <b>192</b> rotates faster than a predefined threshold rotational speed. Alternatively still, the locking retractor <b>194</b> may be a conventional retractor that is configured to prevent further rotation of the gear or wheel <b>192</b> when either the retractor <b>194</b> experiences a deceleration that is greater than a predefined deceleration threshold or the gear or wheel <b>192</b> is rotating faster than a predefined threshold rotational speed.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The inertial member <b>194</b> and the bracket <b>186</b> are generally configured to move relative to the frame <b>102</b> and the clamp member <b>104</b> under quasi-static conditions and also under dynamic loading conditions, such as may occur during vehicle crash events, vehicle roll-over events, and the like. Under quasi-static conditions, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, for example, the clamp member <b>104</b> is responsive to a force applied thereto by one end <b>11</b>A of the object <b>11</b> to move upwardly against the bias of the at least one biasing member as described hereinabove to allow the object <b>11</b> to be received within, and to be removed from between, the clamp member <b>104</b> and the end <b>102</b>B of the frame <b>102</b> in the direction <b>196</b>. For example, when the object <b>11</b> is forced against the clamp member <b>104</b> in the direction toward the frame <b>102</b> under quasi-static conditions, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>, the clamp member <b>104</b> to moves upwardly to receive the end <b>11</b>A of the object <b>11</b> as described above.

Because the teeth <b>190</b> of the gear or wheel <b>192</b> are engaged with the teeth <b>188</b> of the bracket <b>186</b>, locking of the gear or wheel <b>192</b> likewise locks the bracket <b>186</b> from further movement relative to the inertial member <b>194</b>. Because the bracket <b>186</b> is rigidly secured to the pivot point <b>106</b>, locking of the bracket <b>186</b> relative to the inertial member <b>194</b> thus applies a retention force to the clamp member <b>104</b> via the pivot point <b>106</b>, which causes the bracket <b>186</b> to lock the position of the clamp member <b>104</b> relative to the frame <b>102</b>. In other words, locking of the bracket <b>186</b> relative to the inertial member <b>194</b> locks the pivot point <b>106</b> from further movement relative to the frame <b>102</b>, and thus locks the clamp member <b>104</b> to the frame <b>102</b>. This, then, prevents movement of the clamp member <b>104</b> relative to the frame <b>102</b>. The retention force applied by the inertial member <b>194</b> to the clamp member <b>104</b>, as just described, is sufficient to retain the object <b>11</b> between the clamp member <b>104</b> and the end <b>102</b>B of the frame <b>102</b> under the dynamic loading conditions.</p>

This extreme position of the clamp member <b>310</b> relative to the support members <b>308</b>A and <b>308</b>B is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, and is the open or unloaded position of the clamp member <b>310</b>, i.e., when the object <b>11</b> has not been loaded into or positioned within the apparatus <b>300</b>. The other extreme position of the clamp member <b>310</b> relative to the support members <b>308</b>A and <b>308</b>B is defined by the protrusion <b>320</b> reaching the end or near the end of the channel <b>322</b> that is closest to the elongated frame <b>302</b> and by the protrusion <b>330</b> reaching the end or near the end of the channel <b>332</b> that is closest to the channel <b>322</b>. This extreme position of the clamp member <b>310</b> relative to the support members <b>308</b>A and <b>308</b>B is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, and is the closed or loaded position of the clamp member <b>310</b>, i.e., when the object <b>11</b> has been loaded into or positioned within the apparatus <b>300</b>. In the closed or loaded position, one end of the object <b>11</b> is in contact with the lower end <b>302</b>B of the frame <b>302</b>, and the clamp member <b>310</b> engages the opposite end <b>11</b>A of the object <b>11</b> such that the object <b>11</b> is trapped or positioned between the clamp member <b>310</b> and the end <b>302</b>B of the frame <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The apparatus <b>300</b> further includes a blocking member <b>340</b> that is movably mounted to the support member <b>308</b>A. Illustratively, the blocking member <b>340</b> defines one or more slots or channels therethrough, and one or more corresponding protrusions extend from the support member <b>308</b>A into the one or more channels to movably mount the blocking member <b>340</b> to the support member <b>308</b>A. In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the blocking member <b>340</b> defines two channels <b>344</b> and <b>348</b> therethrough, and two corresponding protrusions <b>342</b> and <b>346</b> extend from the support member <b>308</b>A and into and through the channels <b>344</b> and <b>348</b>. The channels <b>344</b> and <b>348</b> are generally elongated channels that extend generally parallel with a longitudinal axis of the blocking member <b>340</b>. The protrusions <b>342</b> and <b>346</b> are positioned generally parallel with the longitudinal axis of the support member <b>308</b>A, and extend into and through the channels <b>344</b> and <b>348</b> respectively. The blocking member <b>340</b> is thus movable relative to the support member <b>308</b>A in directions that are generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the elongated frame <b>302</b> and parallel with the longitudinal axis of the support member <b>308</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Illustratively, the support members <b>308</b>A and <b>308</b>B, as well as the blocking member <b>340</b>, are provided in the form of generally flat, rigid sheet or plate material. Examples of such rigid sheet or plate material include, but are not limited to, steel or other metal or metal composite, ceramic, rigid plastic material, or the like. In any case, the one or more support members, e.g., <b>308</b>A and <b>308</b>B, will be generally understood to form part of the overall frame <b>302</b>. Accordingly, the clamp member <b>310</b> and the blocking member <b>340</b> may be referred to herein and/or in the appended claims as being movably mounted to the frame. Likewise, the one or more channels defined through the support member <b>308</b>A, e.g., the channels <b>322</b> and <b>332</b>, may be referred to herein and/or in the appended claims as being defined in and/or through the frame, and the one or more protrusions extending from the support member <b>308</b>A, e.g., the protrusions <b>342</b> and <b>348</b>, may be referred to herein and/or in the appended claims as extending from the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-30</figref>, side elevational views of the apparatus <b>300</b> are shown illustrating a process for loading the object <b>11</b> into the apparatus <b>300</b> so that the object <b>11</b> is ultimately positioned between the clamp member <b>310</b> and the end <b>302</b>B of the frame <b>302</b>. It will be understood that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-30</figref> are not intended to represent the detailed physical structure of the apparatus <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>, and the apparatus <b>300</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-30</figref> is instead simplified to illustrate operation thereof. In any case, the apparatus <b>300</b> is generally configured such that the object <b>11</b> may be received between, and may be removed from between, the clamp member <b>310</b> and the end <b>302</b> of the frame <b>302</b> under quasi-static conditions. For purposes of this description, quasi-static conditions are intended to describe conditions under which the blocking member <b>340</b> remains stationary relative to the support member <b>308</b>A and/or under which any movement of the blocking member <b>340</b> relative to the support member <b>308</b>A does not block or otherwise impede movement of the clamp member <b>310</b> between its two extreme positions relative to the support member <b>308</b>A, as the two extreme positions of the clamp member <b>310</b> are described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-30</figref> illustrate two additional structural components that were not illustrated or described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>. One of the additional structural components is a biasing member <b>350</b> that is connected at one end <b>352</b> to the frame <b>302</b> or alternatively to the support member <b>308</b>A, and at an opposite end <b>354</b> to the clamp member <b>310</b>, e.g., to the rear portion of <b>310</b>A of the clamp member <b>310</b>. The biasing member <b>350</b> is illustratively provided in the form of a conventional coil spring, although other conventional biasing components may alternatively be used, e.g., flat spring or the like. Generally, the biasing member <b>350</b> exerts a biasing force on the clamp member <b>310</b> that normally draws the clamp member <b>310</b> inwardly toward the elongated frame <b>302</b>. The biasing force exerted by the biasing member <b>350</b> will generally be effective only under quasi-static conditions and only when the protrusion <b>330</b> is positioned within the first section of the channel <b>332</b>, i.e., the section of the channel <b>332</b> that is closest to the channel <b>322</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29 and 30</figref>. The other additional structural component is another biasing member <b>360</b> that is connected at one end <b>362</b> to the frame <b>302</b> or to the support member <b>308</b>A, and at an opposite end <b>364</b> to the blocking member <b>340</b>. The biasing member <b>360</b> is illustratively provided in the form of a conventional coil spring, although other conventional biasing components may alternatively be used, e.g., flat spring or the like. Generally, the biasing member <b>360</b> exerts a biasing force on the blocking member <b>340</b> that normally draws the blocking member <b>340</b> rearwardly away from the second section of the channel <b>332</b>, i.e., the section of the channel <b>332</b> that is furthest from the channel <b>322</b>, as illustrated in each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-30</figref>. The biasing force exerted by the biasing member <b>360</b> will generally be effective only under quasi-static conditions will generally be overcome under dynamic loading conditions as will be described in detail hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> represents the open or unloaded position of the clamp member <b>310</b> relative to the frame as described hereinabove. With one end of the object <b>11</b> positioned in contact with the lower end <b>302</b>B of the frame <b>302</b>, the object <b>11</b> is moved in the direction <b>325</b> so that the end <b>11</b>A of the object <b>11</b> comes into contact with the clamp member <b>310</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>. Continued forcing of the end <b>11</b>A against the clamp member <b>310</b> in the direction <b>325</b> causes the object <b>11</b> to come into contact with the rear portion <b>310</b>A of the clamp member <b>310</b>. Continued forcing of the end <b>11</b>A against the rear portion <b>310</b>A of the clamp member <b>310</b> then causes the protrusion <b>330</b> to travel along the second section of the channel <b>332</b> toward the first section of the channel <b>332</b>, thus causing the front portion <b>3108</b> of the clamp member <b>310</b> to move downwardly over, and then into contact with, the end <b>11</b>A of the object, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. With both the rear and front portions <b>310</b>A and <b>310</b>B respectively of the clamp member <b>310</b> in contact with the end <b>11</b>A of the object <b>11</b>, continued forcing of the end <b>11</b>A of the object <b>11</b> against the rear portion <b>310</b>A of the clamp member <b>310</b> causes the entire clamp member <b>310</b> to move rearwardly toward the elongated frame <b>302</b> as the protrusions <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> travel along the respective channels <b>322</b> and <b>332</b> toward the channel ends that are closest to the elongated frame <b>302</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. This rearward movement of the clamp member <b>310</b> is assisted or facilitated by the biasing force that is applied by the biasing member <b>350</b> between the frame <b>302</b> and the clamp member <b>310</b>. The biasing force applied by the biasing member <b>350</b> further serves to facilitate maintaining the clamp member <b>310</b> in the closed or loaded position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> under quasi-static conditions so that the object <b>11</b> remains positioned and retained between the clamp member <b>310</b> and the end <b>302</b>B of the frame <b>302</b> under the quasi-static conditions. The object <b>11</b> may be removed from between the clamp member <b>310</b> and the end <b>302</b>B of the frame <b>302</b> under quasi-static conditions by forcing the end <b>11</b>A of the object <b>11</b> against the front portion <b>310</b>B of the clamp member <b>310</b> and following the above process in reverse order.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>, side elevational views of the apparatus <b>300</b> are shown illustrating operation of the apparatus <b>300</b> under dynamic loading conditions. Under dynamic loading conditions, as described hereinabove, inertial forces are directed outwardly from the frame <b>302</b> in the direction toward the object <b>11</b> as illustrated by the directional arrow <b>370</b>. Under such dynamic loading conditions, the blocking member <b>340</b> is generally movable relative to the support member <b>308</b>A between two extreme positions. One extreme position of the blocking member <b>340</b> relative to the support member <b>308</b>A is defined by the protrusions <b>342</b> and <b>346</b> being at or near the ends of the channels <b>344</b> and <b>348</b> respectively that are furthest from the elongated frame <b>302</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28-30</figref>. This position of the blocking member <b>340</b> is generally maintained under quasi-static conditions by the biasing force applied by the biasing member <b>360</b> between the support member <b>308</b>A and the blocking member <b>340</b>. The other extreme position of the blocking member <b>340</b> relative to the support member <b>308</b>A is defined by the protrusions <b>342</b> and <b>346</b> being at or near the ends of the channels <b>344</b> and <b>348</b> respectively that are closest to the elongated frame <b>302</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>, this position of the blocking member <b>340</b> has a portion of the blocking member <b>340</b> extending at least partially across the second portion of the channel <b>332</b>, i.e., the portion of the channel <b>332</b> that is furthest from the channel <b>322</b> and from the elongated frame <b>302</b>. Because the protrusion <b>330</b> extends through and beyond the channel <b>332</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>), the bottom edge or surface <b>345</b> of the blocking member <b>340</b> thus creates a barrier to movement of the protrusion <b>330</b> into the second section of the channel <b>332</b>. Thus, when the blocking member <b>340</b> moves to the blocking position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref> under the dynamic loading conditions, the blocking member <b>340</b> blocks movement of the clamp member <b>310</b> sufficiently to maintain the clamp member <b>310</b> in contact with the end <b>11</b>A of the object <b>11</b> and therefore sufficiently to retain the object <b>11</b> between the clamp member <b>310</b> and the end <b>302</b>B of the frame <b>302</b> under the dynamic loading conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The biasing force of the biasing member <b>360</b> and the mass of the blocking member <b>340</b> are selected to ensure that, under the dynamic loading conditions, the mass of the blocking member <b>340</b> is sized relative to the biasing force of the biasing member <b>360</b> such that the biasing force of the biasing member <b>360</b> is overcome by the blocking member <b>340</b> and that the blocking member <b>340</b> then moves to the blocking position, i.e., with a portion of the blocking member <b>340</b> extending at least partially across the second portion of the channel <b>332</b>, before the protrusion <b>330</b> reaches the second portion of the channel <b>332</b>. This feature is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, a dynamic loading event has just occurred, causing an inertial force to be applied by the object <b>11</b> to the clamp member <b>310</b> in the direction of the arrow <b>370</b>. As the biasing force of the biasing member <b>350</b> is overcome by the mass of the object <b>11</b> in response to the dynamic loading event, the protrusions <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> begin to travel along the channels <b>322</b> and <b>332</b> respectively. At the same time, the inertial force <b>370</b> acting upon the mass of the blocking member <b>340</b> causes the blocking member <b>340</b> to overcome the biasing force of the biasing member <b>360</b> and quickly move to the blocking position described above. The protrusions <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> continue to travel forwardly along the channels <b>322</b> and <b>332</b> respectively as the inertial force <b>370</b> resulting from the dynamic load event continues to force the end <b>11</b>A of the object against the clamp member <b>310</b>, and when the protrusion <b>330</b> reaches the end of the first portion of the channel <b>332</b>, it is blocked from entering the second portion of the channel <b>332</b> by the blocking member <b>340</b> that has already moved to its blocking position. Because the protrusion <b>330</b> cannot enter into, and travel along, the second portion of the channel <b>332</b>, the clamp member <b>310</b> is maintained in a position that retains the object <b>11</b> between the clamp member <b>310</b> and the end <b>302</b>B of the frame <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-37</figref>, yet another illustrative embodiment of an object restraining apparatus <b>400</b> is shown. The apparatus <b>400</b> is identical in its overall structure and operation to the apparatus <b>300</b>, although some of the structural components and features of the apparatus <b>400</b> are different than corresponding components and features of the apparatus <b>300</b>. The structural components of the apparatus <b>400</b> are numbered consistently with the corresponding structural components of the apparatus <b>300</b> so that the reference numbers of the two embodiments differ only by a factor of 100. Unless specifically described below, it will be understood that the remaining components of the apparatus <b>400</b> are identical in structure and operation with correspondingly numbered components of the apparatus <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">One of the structural differences between the apparatuses <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> is the location and configuration of the channels defined through the support members <b>408</b>A and <b>408</b>B (<b>408</b>B not shown). More specifically, the channel <b>422</b> has a first portion or section that extends generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the elongated frame <b>302</b>, and a second portion or section that extends downwardly from the first section and generally parallel with the longitudinal axis of the elongated frame <b>302</b>. The blocking member <b>440</b> is positioned such that it resides between the elongated frame <b>302</b> and the second portion of the channel <b>422</b> under quasi-static conditions, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-35</figref>, and that it extends at least partially across the second portion of the channel <b>422</b> under dynamic loading conditions, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36-37</figref>. The channel <b>432</b> is an elongated channel that extends generally perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the elongated frame <b>302</b>, and the channels <b>422</b> and <b>432</b> are positioned such that the channel <b>422</b> is located between the end <b>302</b>A&#x2032; of the elongated frame <b>302</b> and the channel <b>432</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Another difference between the apparatuses <b>300</b> and <b>400</b> is the position of the biasing member <b>450</b> relative to the clamp member <b>410</b>. In the apparatus <b>400</b>, the biasing member is attached at one end <b>452</b> to the support member <b>408</b>A and at an opposite end <b>454</b> to the clamp member <b>410</b> between the rear portion <b>410</b>A and the front portion <b>410</b>B thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The operation of the apparatus <b>400</b> is substantially identical to that of the apparatus <b>300</b> described above, with the exception of the movement of the protrusions within the channels <b>422</b> and <b>432</b>. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> represents the open or unloaded position of the clamp member <b>410</b> relative to the frame in which the protrusion <b>420</b> is positioned at or near the end of the second portion of the channel <b>422</b>, i.e., at or near the lowermost end of the channel <b>422</b>, and in which the protrusion <b>430</b> is at or near the end of the channel <b>432</b> that is furthest from the elongated frame <b>302</b>. With one end of the object <b>11</b> positioned in contact with the lower end <b>302</b>B of the frame <b>302</b>, the object <b>11</b> is moved in the direction <b>425</b> so that the end <b>11</b>A of the object <b>11</b> comes into contact with the clamp member <b>410</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref>. Continued forcing of the end <b>11</b>A against the clamp member <b>410</b> in the direction <b>425</b> causes the object <b>11</b> to come into contact with the rear portion <b>410</b>A of the clamp member <b>410</b>. Continued forcing of the end <b>11</b>A against the rear portion <b>410</b>A of the clamp member <b>410</b> then causes the protrusion <b>420</b> to travel upwardly along the second section of the channel <b>432</b> toward the first section of the channel <b>432</b>, thus causing the front portion <b>410</b>B of the clamp member <b>410</b> to move downwardly over, and then into contact with, the end <b>11</b>A of the object, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34</figref>. With both the rear and front portions <b>410</b>A and <b>410</b>B respectively of the clamp member <b>410</b> in contact with the end <b>11</b>A of the object <b>11</b>, continued forcing of the end <b>11</b>A of the object <b>11</b> against the rear portion <b>410</b>A of the clamp member <b>410</b> causes the entire clamp member <b>410</b> to move rearwardly toward the elongated frame <b>402</b> as the protrusions <b>420</b> and <b>430</b> travel rearwardly along the respective channels <b>422</b> and <b>432</b> toward the channel ends that are closest to the elongated frame <b>402</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>. This rearward movement of the clamp member <b>410</b> is assisted or facilitated by the biasing force that is applied by the biasing member <b>450</b> between the support member <b>408</b>A and the clamp member <b>410</b>. The biasing force applied by the biasing member <b>450</b> further serves to facilitate maintaining the clamp member <b>410</b> in the closed or loaded position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> under quasi-static conditions so that the object <b>11</b> remains positioned and retained between the clamp member <b>410</b> and the end <b>402</b>B of the frame <b>402</b> under the quasi-static conditions. The object <b>11</b> may be removed from between the clamp member <b>410</b> and the end <b>302</b>B of the frame <b>302</b> under quasi-static conditions by forcing the end <b>11</b>A of the object <b>11</b> against the front portion <b>410</b>B of the clamp member <b>410</b> and following the above process in reverse order.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>, side elevational views of the apparatus <b>400</b> are shown illustrating operation of the apparatus <b>400</b> under dynamic loading conditions. Under dynamic loading conditions, as described hereinabove, inertial forces are directed outwardly from the frame <b>402</b> in the direction toward the object <b>11</b> as illustrated by the directional arrow <b>470</b>. Under such dynamic loading conditions, the blocking member <b>440</b> is generally movable relative to the support member <b>408</b>A between two extreme positions. One extreme position of the blocking member <b>440</b> relative to the support member <b>408</b>A is defined by the protrusions <b>442</b> and <b>446</b> being at or near the ends of the channels <b>444</b> and <b>448</b> respectively that are furthest from the elongated frame <b>302</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 33-34</figref>. This position of the blocking member <b>440</b> is generally maintained under quasi-static conditions by the biasing force applied by the biasing member <b>460</b> between the support member <b>408</b>A or the elongated frame <b>302</b> and the blocking member <b>440</b>. The other extreme position of the blocking member <b>440</b> relative to the support member <b>408</b>A is defined by the protrusions <b>442</b> and <b>446</b> being at or near the ends of the channels <b>444</b> and <b>448</b> respectively that are closest to the elongated frame <b>302</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>, this position of the blocking member <b>440</b> has a portion of the blocking member <b>440</b> extending at least partially across the second portion of the channel <b>432</b>, i.e., the portion of the channel <b>432</b> that extends downwardly toward the object <b>11</b>. Because the protrusion <b>430</b> extends through and beyond the channel <b>432</b> as described with respect to the apparatus <b>300</b>, the top edge or surface <b>445</b> of the blocking member <b>440</b> thus creates a barrier to movement of the protrusion <b>430</b> downwardly into the second section of the channel <b>432</b>. Thus, when the blocking member <b>440</b> moves to the blocking position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref> under the dynamic loading conditions, the blocking member <b>440</b> blocks movement of the clamp member <b>410</b> sufficiently to maintain the clamp member <b>410</b> in contact with the end <b>11</b>A of the object <b>11</b> and therefore sufficiently to retain the object <b>11</b> between the clamp member <b>410</b> and the end <b>302</b>B of the frame <b>302</b> under the dynamic loading conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">As with the biasing member <b>360</b> and the blocking member <b>340</b>, the biasing force of the biasing member <b>460</b> and the mass of the blocking member <b>440</b> are selected to ensure that, under the dynamic loading conditions, the mass of the blocking member <b>440</b> is sized relative to the biasing force of the biasing member <b>460</b> such that the biasing force of the biasing member <b>460</b> is overcome by the blocking member <b>440</b> and that the blocking member <b>440</b> then moves to the blocking position, i.e., with a portion of the blocking member <b>440</b> extending at least partially across the second portion of the channel <b>432</b>, before the protrusion <b>430</b> reaches the second portion of the channel <b>432</b>. This feature is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 36 and 37</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 36</figref>, for example, a dynamic loading event has just occurred, causing an inertial force to be applied by the object <b>11</b> to the clamp member <b>410</b> in the direction of the arrow <b>470</b>. As the biasing force of the biasing member <b>450</b> is overcome by the mass of the object <b>11</b> in response to the dynamic loading event, the protrusions <b>420</b> and <b>430</b> begin to travel along the channels <b>422</b> and <b>432</b> respectively. At the same time, the inertial force <b>470</b> acting upon the mass of the blocking member <b>440</b> causes the blocking member <b>440</b> to overcome the biasing force of the biasing member <b>460</b> and quickly move to the blocking position described above. The protrusions <b>420</b> and <b>430</b> continue to travel forwardly along the channels <b>422</b> and <b>432</b> respectively as the inertial force <b>470</b> resulting from the dynamic load event continues to force the end <b>11</b>A of the object against the clamp member <b>410</b>, and when the protrusion <b>430</b> reaches the end of the first portion of the channel <b>432</b>, it is blocked from traveling downwardly into the second portion of the channel <b>432</b> by the blocking member <b>440</b> that has already moved to its blocking position. Because the protrusion <b>430</b> cannot enter downwardly into, and travel along, the second portion of the channel <b>432</b>, the clamp member <b>410</b> is maintained in a position that retains the object <b>11</b> between the clamp member <b>410</b> and the end <b>402</b>B of the frame <b>402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">A method or process of restraining an object <b>11</b> in a vehicle using either of the apparatuses <b>300</b> or <b>400</b> may thus include providing a frame having a first end and a second end opposite the first end, movably mounting a clamp member to the frame, mounting the frame within the vehicle, placing one end of the object in contact with the second end of the frame and then forcing an opposite end of the object against the clamp member to move the clamp member and the object together into a position in which the object is trapped between the clamp member and the second end of the frame, and movably mounting a blocking member to the frame such that the blocking member moves under dynamic loading conditions to a position that blocks movement of the clamp member sufficiently to retain the object between the clamp member and the second end of the frame under the dynamic loading conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38-42</figref>, perspective views of still another embodiment of an apparatus <b>500</b> for restraining an object <b>11</b>&#x2032; in a vehicle is shown. Illustratively, the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; is an elongated object which may, but need not be cylindrical, such as a Self Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA), although it will be understood that the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; may alternatively be or include other objects. In embodiments in which the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; is a self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA), the SCBA <b>11</b>&#x2032; is similar in many respects to the SCBA <b>11</b> illustrated and described hereinabove. For example, like the SCBA <b>11</b> the SCBA <b>11</b>&#x2032; includes a conventional air (or other breathing gas) cylinder <b>12</b> having a domed bottom surface <b>19</b>A and a domed top surface <b>19</b>B, and an air (gas) outlet <b>13</b> extending outwardly from a center of the domed bottom surface <b>19</b>A. The air outlet <b>13</b> is fluidly coupled to a conventional air outlet valve <b>15</b>. Unlike the SCBA <b>11</b>, an air outlet adjustment knob <b>17</b> is positioned opposite to the air outlet <b>13</b>, rather than opposite to the air outlet valve <b>15</b> as with the SCBA <b>11</b> (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 27</figref>), such that the air outlet adjustment knob <b>17</b> resides at the terminal end of the air outlet mechanism of the SCBA <b>11</b>&#x2032;. For this embodiment of the SCBA <b>11</b>&#x2032; in particular, the object restraining apparatus <b>500</b> includes an elongated base member <b>550</b> that is configured to support the domed bottom surface <b>19</b>A of the SCBA rather than the terminal end of the air outlet mechanism as was done with the embodiment of the SCBA <b>11</b> illustrated and described hereinabove. It will be understood, however, that the apparatus <b>500</b> may also be used to restrain embodiments of the SCBA <b>11</b> in an identical fashion to that which will be described hereinafter with respect to the SCBA <b>11</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In the illustrated embodiment, the apparatus <b>500</b> includes an elongated frame <b>502</b> having a first end <b>502</b>A and a second end <b>502</b>B opposite the first end <b>502</b>A.

The frame <b>502</b>, like the frames <b>14</b>, <b>102</b> and <b>302</b> illustrated and described hereinabove, is configured to be mounted within a vehicle generally, and more specifically to at least a portion of a vehicle seat that is mounted within the vehicle. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> described hereinabove, an example vehicle seat <b>80</b> has a seat bottom <b>82</b> and a seat back <b>86</b>, both of which are mounted to a vehicle seat frame <b>84</b> that is mounted within the vehicle. Illustratively, the frame <b>502</b> of the apparatus <b>500</b> is configured to be mounted to at least the seat back <b>86</b>, and may be further configured to be also mounted to the vehicle seat frame <b>84</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>.</p>

Illustration of such structure is omitted from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38-42</figref> for ease of illustration, and description of such structure and function is not repeated here for brevity. It will be understood, however, that this disclosure contemplates alternative embodiments of the apparatus <b>500</b> in which one of the clamp members <b>104</b> or <b>410</b> and associated ancillary components is used in place of the clamp member <b>310</b> and associated ancillary components. In any case, the apparatus <b>500</b> further includes a height adjustment knob <b>504</b> that may be manually actuated to lengthen or shorten the length of the frame <b>502</b> between the clamp member <b>310</b> and the elongated base member <b>550</b> to accommodate different length objects <b>11</b>, <b>11</b>&#x2032;.</p>

The apparatus <b>500</b> is generally configured such that the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; may be received between, and may be removed from between, the clamp member <b>310</b> and the elongated base member <b>550</b> under quasi-static conditions which, for purposes of this description, are intended to describe conditions under which the blocking member <b>340</b> remains stationary relative to the support member <b>308</b>A and/or under which any movement of the blocking member <b>340</b> relative to the support member <b>308</b>A does not block or otherwise impede movement of the clamp member <b>310</b> between its two extreme positions relative to the support member <b>308</b>A, as the two extreme positions of the clamp member <b>310</b> are described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">With the clamp member in its open position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26</figref>, <b>28</b> and <b>38</b> and the elongated base member <b>550</b> in its object transition position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 38 and 39</figref>, this represents the normal, unloaded (e.g., unloaded with an object <b>11</b>&#x2032; or <b>11</b>) condition of the apparatus <b>500</b>. In this condition, the domed bottom surface <b>19</b>A of the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; (or <b>11</b>) is positioned on the support surfaces <b>552</b>C and <b>554</b>C of the elongated base members <b>552</b> and <b>554</b> with the air outlet <b>13</b> and associated components <b>15</b>, <b>15</b> positioned in the space, S, defined between the curved portions <b>552</b>A and <b>554</b>A of the elongated base members <b>552</b> and <b>554</b> as generally illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref>. The top domed surface <b>19</b>B of the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; (or <b>11</b>) is then forced into and against the clamp member <b>310</b> as illustrated generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26 and 29</figref>. As the domed surface <b>19</b>B of the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; (or <b>11</b>) moves into engagement with the clamp member <b>310</b>, the center portion of the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; is forced against the free ends of the linear portions <b>552</b>B and <b>554</b>B of the elongated base members <b>552</b> and <b>554</b>, thereby forcing the elongated base member toward its object retaining position. Continued forcing of the end <b>19</b>A (or <b>11</b>A) of the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; (or <b>11</b>) against the clamp member <b>310</b> causes the end <b>19</b>A (or <b>11</b>A) of the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; (or <b>11</b>) to come into contact with the rear portion <b>310</b>A of the clamp member <b>310</b>. Continued forcing of the end <b>19</b>A (or <b>11</b>A) against the rear portion <b>310</b>A of the clamp member <b>310</b> then causes the protrusion <b>330</b> to travel along the second section of the channel <b>332</b> toward the first section of the channel <b>332</b>, thus causing the front portion <b>310</b>B of the clamp member <b>310</b> to move downwardly over, and then into contact with, the end <b>19</b>A (or <b>11</b>A) of the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; (or <b>11</b>), as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref>. With both the rear and front portions <b>310</b>A and <b>310</b>B respectively of the clamp member <b>310</b> in contact with the end <b>19</b>A (or <b>11</b>A) of the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; (or <b>11</b>), continued forcing of the end <b>19</b>A (or <b>11</b>A) of the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; (or <b>11</b>) against the rear portion <b>310</b>A of the clamp member <b>310</b> causes the entire clamp member <b>310</b> to move rearwardly toward the elongated frame <b>502</b> as the protrusions <b>320</b> and <b>330</b> travel along the respective channels <b>322</b> and <b>332</b> toward the channel ends that are closest to the elongated frame <b>302</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. This rearward movement of the clamp member <b>310</b> is assisted or facilitated by the biasing force that is applied by the biasing member <b>350</b> between the frame <b>502</b> and the clamp member <b>310</b>. The biasing force applied by the biasing member <b>350</b> further serves to facilitate maintaining the clamp member <b>310</b> in the closed or loaded position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> under quasi-static conditions so that the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; (or <b>11</b>) remains positioned and retained between the clamp member <b>310</b> and the elongated base member <b>550</b> under the quasi-static conditions. The object <b>11</b>&#x2032; (or <b>11</b>) may be removed from between the clamp member <b>310</b> and the elongated base member <b>550</b> under quasi-static conditions by forcing the end <b>19</b>A (or <b>11</b>A) of the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; (or <b>11</b>) against the front portion <b>310</b>B of the clamp member <b>310</b> and following the above process in reverse order.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">With the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; (or <b>11</b>) positioned between the clamp member <b>310</b> and the elongated base member <b>550</b> with the clamp member in its closed position and the elongated base member in its object retaining position as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31</figref>, <b>32</b> and <b>40</b>, the object <b>11</b>&#x2032; (or <b>11</b>) will be retained in the apparatus under dynamic loading conditions as described hereinabove with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 31 and 32</figref>.</p>
