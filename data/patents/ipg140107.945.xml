<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to fluid flow systems useful in underground wells. In some embodiments, the present invention relates to systems, apparatus and methods capable of allowing fluid filtered through a screen to pass along the outside of a pipe disposed in a well bore to a pipe entry point near the end of the pipe.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In subsurface hydrocarbon recovery operations, some situations warrant the communication of fluid within the downhole assembly along the outside of a span of pipe. For example, during circulating gravel packing operations, it is often desirable to recover gravel delivery fluid through one or more fluid entry point at or near the bottom of the pipe. However, the delivery fluid typically initially enters the downhole assembly through screens located along a length of the pipe, requiring the fluid to be able to thereafter travel along the outside of the pipe to the desired entry point(s).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Various challenges may create difficulties in achieving effective fluid flow along the outside of a span of pipe in a well bore. In the gravel packing scenario above, there may be difficulties in directing the screen-filtered delivery fluid along the outside of the pipe to the desired pipe entry point downhole of the screens. For example, the inclusion of inflow ports or devices, such as inflow control devices (ICD), along the length of the pipe assembly may prevent fluid isolation (from inside the pipe) or impede flow along the desired path. For another example, the orientation of the well bore, such as in non-vertical wells or well sections, may hinder the ability of the fluid to flow in the desired path. As used herein, the term &#x201c;non-vertical well&#x201d; includes horizontal, lateral, inclined, deviated, directional or similar wells. In particular scenarios involving systems with ICDs deployed in horizontal wells, for example, the free circulating return of gravel pack carrier fluid would be difficult or impossible, preventing complete alpha/beta wave packing. In such instance, the wells would not be fully gravel packed, which can lead to problems during production.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Accordingly, there exists a need for apparatus, systems and methods useful with underground fluid flow systems having one or more of the following attributes, capabilities or features: allows the communication of fluid within a downhole assembly along the outside of a span of pipe disposed in a well bore; allows the communication of fluid in either direction within a downhole assembly along the outside of a span of pipe; allows screen-filtered fluid to pass at least substantially unrestricted past at least one inflow control device along the outside of a length of pipe to a desired pipe entry point near the end of the pipe; allows fluid to pass from the well bore through at least one screen jacket into the pipe at a desired entry point without at least substantial entry into the pipe therebetween; allows the recovery of gravel delivery fluid through one or more fluid entry point at or near the bottom of the pipe during gravel packing operations; allows the recovery of gravel delivery fluid through one or more fluid entry point at or near the bottom of the pipe during gravel packing operations without the need for a wash pipe; allows effective free circulating return of gravel pack carrier fluid during gravel packing operations in non-vertical wells; allows alpha/beta wave gravel packing of non-vertical wells in which ICD type screen assemblies are deployed; or any combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It should be understood that the above-described examples, features and/or disadvantages are provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope or subject matter of the appended claims or any other patent application or patent claiming priority hereto. Thus, none of the appended claims or claims of any related application or patent should be limited by the above discussion or construed to address, include or exclude the cited examples, features and/or disadvantages, except and only to the extent as may be expressly stated in a particular claim.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some embodiments, the present disclosure involves apparatus useful for allowing fluid flow inside at least one screen and outside a span of pipe disposed in a well bore. The apparatus includes a tubular assembly having an upper portion, a lower portion and a bore extending therebetween. The upper and lower portions and the bore are disposed along a longitudinal axis of the tubular assembly. At least one inlet is formed in the lower portion of the tubular assembly and allows fluid communication between the bore and the exterior of the tubular assembly. At least a first screen is in fluid communication with the well bore and at least partially concentrically surrounds at least part of the tubular assembly. The screen is disposed along the longitudinal axis of the tubular assembly at a location above the inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In these embodiments, at least a first port is formed in the tubular assembly at a location above the inlet. The first port allows fluid communication between the bore and the exterior of the tubular assembly. At least a first ICD at least partially concentrically surrounds at least part of the tubular assembly over the first port, and is disposed along the longitudinal axis of the tubular assembly at a location between the upper end of the first screen and the inlet(s). At least one flow path for fluid entering the screen extends along the exterior of the bore of the tubular assembly at least partially along the longitudinal axis thereof. The flow path is at least substantially fluidly isolated from the port(s) and extends from the first screen to the inlet. Fluid is capable of at least substantially unrestricted flow between the screen(s) and inlet(s) without at least substantially entering the bore of the tubular assembly therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">There are embodiments of the present disclosure involving apparatus useful for allowing the flow of fluid into a fluid flow system disposed in a well bore during gravel packing operations. The apparatus includes a tubular assembly having upper and lower ends and at least one port that allows fluid communication between the interior and exterior of the tubular assembly. A first ICD extends at least partially around at least part of the tubular assembly over at least one port. At least one screen extends around at least part of the tubular assembly over the first ICD. The screen forms an annulus around the tubular assembly. The annulus includes a gap disposed between the screen and the first ICD. At least one inlet is formed in the tubular assembly between the screen(s) and the lower end of the tubular assembly. The inlet is in fluid communication with the annulus and the interior of the tubular assembly. Fluid may flow from the well bore through the screen(s), into and through the annulus, through the gap at least substantially around the first ICD and port(s) and into the tubular assembly through the inlet(s) without the necessity of a wash pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In many embodiments, the present disclosure involves apparatus for allowing the flow of fluid into a fluid flow system disposed in a well bore during gravel packing operations. A tubular assembly has upper and lower ends and at least one port that allows fluid communication between the interior and exterior of the tubular assembly. A first ICD extends at least partially around at least part of the tubular assembly over at least one port. The first ICD includes at least one flow restriction mechanism useful to control the flow of fluid through the port. The first ICD also includes at least one bypass flowway through which fluid may flow at least substantially around the flow restriction mechanism and port.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In these embodiments, at least one screen extends around at least part of the tubular assembly adjacent to the first ICD. The screen forms an annulus around the tubular assembly. The annulus is in fluid communication with the bypass flowway of the first ICD. At least one inlet is formed in the tubular assembly proximate to the lower end thereof below the first ICD and the screen(s). The inlet is in fluid communication with the annulus, the bypass flowway and the interior of the tubular assembly. Fluid may flow from the well bore through the screen(s), into and through the annulus and the bypass flowway and into the tubular assembly through the inlet without the necessity of a wash pipe.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Various embodiments of the present disclosure involve a system useful for allowing fluid filtered through a screen jacket to pass along a length of pipe having multiple ICDs and disposed in a well bore to a desired pipe entry point near the end of the pipe. A tubular assembly includes an upper end, a lower end and a bore extending therebetween. At least one inlet is formed proximate to the lower end of the tubular assembly and allows fluid communication between the bore and the exterior of the tubular assembly. At least one closure member is selectively operable to open and close the inlet(s).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In these embodiments, at least first and second axially aligned screen assemblies each include at least one screen jacket and base pipe. The bore of the tubular assembly extends through each base pipe. Each screen jacket at least partially concentrically surrounds at least part of its associated base pipe. Each base pipe includes at least one port formed therein. The ports are capable of allowing fluid communication between the bore and the exterior of the tubular assembly and are disposed above the inlet. At least first and second ICDs are disposed above the at least one inlet. Each ICD is associated with at least one port and is capable of controlling the flow of fluid therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Also in these embodiments, at least one fluid communication assembly is disposed between the first and second screen assemblies, is in fluid communication with the first and second screen jackets and is fluidly isolated from the bore of the tubular assembly. At least one flow path extends along the interior of the screen jackets and exterior of the base pipes to the inlet(s). The flow path passes through the fluid communication assembly and either passes through or around the ICDs in at least substantial fluid isolation from the ports. When the inlet is open, the flow path allows fluid to pass from the well bore through the screen jacket(s) and the inlet(s) into the bore of the tubular assembly without at least substantial entry into the bore therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">There are embodiments of the present disclosure that involve methods of allowing gravel packing of substantially the entire well bore annulus around a tubular assembly disposed in a well bore. These methods involve the use of a tubular assembly having at least one closable inlet. The tubular assembly also includes at least one screen and at least one ICD disposed between the inlet and the upper end of the tubular assembly. At least one flow path extends and allows fluid flow between each screen and at least one inlet on the outside of the bore of the tubular assembly. The flow path at least substantially bypasses the flow restriction mechanisms of the ICD(s).</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Now in accordance with the methods of these embodiments, with the inlet(s) open, gravel delivery fluid from the well bore is allowed to enter through the screen(s) and into the flow path(s) during the alpha wave formation. The screen filtered gravel delivery fluid is allowed to flow in the flow path(s) outside the bore of the tubular assembly to the inlet(s) and allowed to enter the bore through the inlet(s). After the alpha wave is formed, gravel delivery fluid from the well bore is allowed to enter through the screen(s) and into the flow path(s) during the beta wave formation. The screen filtered gravel delivery fluid is allowed to flow in the flow path(s) outside the tubular assembly bore to the inlet(s) and allowed to enter the bore through the inlet(s). At a desired time, the inlet(s) may be closed, such as to allow formation fluid to pass from the well bore through the screen(s) into the ICDs for controlled entry in the tubular assembly through at least one other entry port.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Accordingly, the present disclosure includes features and advantages which are believed to enable it to advance underground fluid flow technology. Characteristics and advantages of the present invention described above and additional features and benefits will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art upon consideration of the following detailed description of various embodiments and referring to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a fluid flow system <b>10</b> capable of allowing fluid flow along the exterior of a span of pipe is shown disposed within a well bore <b>14</b> formed in or adjacent to an earthen formation <b>15</b>. In this example, the well bore <b>14</b> is a non-vertical, open-hole well having an earthen wall <b>16</b>. A well bore annulus <b>18</b> is formed between the earthen wall <b>16</b> and the fluid flow system <b>10</b>. However, the well bore <b>14</b> is not limited to this particular arrangement and orientation. For example, the well bore <b>14</b> may be vertical and include a casing. Furthermore, the well bore <b>14</b> is in no way limiting upon the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The illustrated fluid flow system <b>10</b> includes a tubular assembly <b>20</b> comprising one or more tubular member <b>25</b> and generally having an upper portion <b>21</b>, a lower portion <b>22</b> and at least one bore <b>26</b> extending therebetween. The bore <b>26</b> allows one or more downhole operations to be conducted from the surface, such as, for example, fluid communication, oil/gas recovery and tool deployment as is and becomes further known. The upper and lower portions <b>21</b>, <b>22</b> of the tubular assembly <b>20</b> and the bore <b>26</b> are disposed along a longitudinal axis <b>28</b> of the tubular assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">At least one inlet <b>46</b> is provided in the lower portion <b>22</b> of the exemplary tubular assembly <b>20</b> and at least one port <b>24</b> is formed in the tubular assembly <b>20</b> above the inlet(s) <b>46</b>. The inlet(s) <b>46</b> and port(s) <b>24</b> are capable of allowing fluid communication between the bore <b>26</b> and the exterior <b>23</b> of the tubular assembly <b>20</b>, as described further below and as is or becomes further known.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Still referring to the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, at least one screen <b>34</b> at least partially concentrically surrounds at least part of the tubular assembly <b>20</b> and is disposed along the longitudinal axis <b>28</b> thereof at one or more respective locations above the inlet(s) <b>46</b>. The screen <b>34</b> typically serves as a filtering medium for fluid entering the tubular assembly <b>20</b>, as is or becomes further known. For example, in many applications, the screen <b>34</b> is useful to assist in preventing sand, gravel and other slurry particles, debris, and/or other materials from entering the tubular assembly <b>20</b> from the well bore <b>14</b>. The screen <b>34</b> may have any suitable construction, configuration, operation and other details. For example, the screen <b>34</b> may include a multi-layer, premium-type screen <b>35</b>, a wire wrap or standard screen (not shown) or any other arrangement, as is or becomes known.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the illustrated embodiment, at least one inflow control device <b>30</b> is associated with the tubular assembly <b>20</b> and at least one port <b>24</b> formed therein. In this example, the ICD <b>30</b> concentrically surrounds part of the assembly <b>20</b> over the port <b>24</b>. The ICD <b>30</b> is disposed along the longitudinal axis <b>28</b> of the tubular assembly <b>20</b> at a location above the inlet(s) <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The ICD <b>30</b> is typically useful during hydrocarbon production operations to limit, control or affect the inflow of formation fluids into the bore <b>26</b> of the tubular assembly <b>20</b> via the associated port(s) <b>24</b>, as is and becomes further known. The ICD <b>30</b> often includes at least one inflow aperture <b>32</b> into the ICD <b>30</b> and at least one flow restriction mechanism <b>31</b> to affect the fluid flow rate through the port <b>24</b>. The flow restriction mechanism <b>31</b> may include, for example, at least one tortuous flow path, profile arrangement, expandable or swellable member, adjustable throttling or valve device such as a remotely controllable sleeve assembly, or a combination thereof, as is or becomes further known. However, the present invention and appended claims are not limited to any of the above details. As used herein and in the appended claims, the terms &#x201c;inflow control device&#x201d; and variations thereof include any one or more devices, features, components or mechanisms disposed between the bore and exterior of a pipe and which in some way affects the flow therebetween.</p>

It should be noted that nothing contained in any of the above-referenced sources or any other source is limiting upon the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It should be understood that all of the above-described components and features may have any suitable or desired construction, configuration, components, operation and other details, none of which are in any way limiting upon the present invention unless and only to the extent as may be expressly provided in and with respect to any particular appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Still referring to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in accordance with the present invention, at least one flow path <b>48</b> is provided within the fluid flow system <b>10</b> on the exterior <b>23</b> of the bore <b>26</b> to allow fluid communication between the screen(s) <b>34</b> and the inlet(s) <b>46</b>. The illustrated flow path <b>48</b> extends generally from the upper end <b>37</b> of the illustrated leftmost screen <b>36</b> to the inlet <b>46</b>. When additional screens (not shown) are included in the tubular assembly <b>20</b> uphole of the screen <b>36</b>, the flow path <b>48</b> would similarly extend from the first uphole screen to the inlet(s) <b>46</b>. Thus, in accordance with the present invention, fluid is at least substantially able to flow between the screens <b>34</b> and the inlet(s) <b>46</b> external to the bore <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The flow path(s) <b>48</b> may extend through any desired number and types of components, as long as fluid is able to at least substantially flow between the screen(s) <b>34</b> and inlet(s) <b>46</b> outside the bore <b>26</b>. In the particular view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the exemplary fluid flow system <b>10</b> is shown including first and second screen assemblies <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, a fluid communication coupling or assembly <b>70</b> allowing fluid communication therebetween and a valve assembly <b>80</b> capable of selectively opening and closing the inlet <b>46</b>. It should be understood that the illustrated arrangement does not necessarily represent an entire fluid flow system <b>10</b>, which may include other various components. For example, the flow path <b>48</b> may extend along more than two screen assemblies and multiple associated fluid communication assemblies.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In this embodiment, each screen assembly <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> includes a base pipe <b>66</b>, at least one screen <b>34</b> and at least one ICD <b>30</b>. The base pipes <b>66</b> each include at least one port <b>24</b> and an interior space <b>68</b> that forms part of the bore <b>26</b> of the assembly <b>20</b>. In this example, the ICD <b>30</b> surrounds at least one port <b>24</b>, and the screen <b>34</b> surrounds the associated ICD <b>30</b>. An assembly annulus <b>40</b> is shown formed between each screen <b>34</b> and adjacent base pipe <b>20</b>. The annulus <b>40</b> includes a gap <b>44</b> (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) disposed between the screen <b>34</b> and the adjacent ICD <b>30</b>. The assembly annuluses <b>40</b> and gaps <b>44</b> are part of the illustrated flow path <b>48</b>. Thus, in this example, when the inlet <b>46</b> is open, fluid flowing through either assembly annulus <b>40</b> is capable of at least substantially flowing around the corresponding ICD <b>30</b> via the gap <b>44</b> and into the inlet <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The screens <b>34</b> and ICDs <b>30</b> may be arranged in any other suitable configuration. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the illustrated ICD <b>30</b> is not surrounded by a screen <b>34</b>, but is instead shown sandwiched between the screen <b>34</b> of the first screen assembly <b>60</b> and the fluid communication assembly <b>70</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>28</b> of the tubular assembly <b>20</b>. In this particular arrangement, the ICD <b>30</b> is disposed downhole of, or below, the first screen assembly <b>60</b> and uphole of, or above, the illustrated fluid communication assembly <b>70</b>. In other embodiments, the ICD <b>30</b> may instead be located downhole of the fluid communication assembly <b>70</b>. Moreover, the system <b>10</b> may include any arrangement of screens <b>34</b>, ICDs <b>30</b> and fluid communication assemblies <b>70</b> along the longitudinal axis <b>28</b> of the tubular assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Still referring to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the ICD <b>30</b> of this embodiment includes a bypass flowway <b>50</b> in fluid communication with the adjacent annulus <b>40</b>. The bypass flowway <b>50</b> extends around the inflow aperture <b>32</b> and the flow restriction mechanism <b>31</b> of the ICD <b>30</b> and is part of the flow path <b>48</b> of the system <b>10</b>. Fluid may thus flow in the flow path <b>48</b> from the first and second screen assemblies <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> to the inlet <b>46</b> without entry therebetween into the tubular assembly <b>20</b> through the ports <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Referring back to the particular arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the fluid communication assembly <b>70</b>, when included, may have any suitable form, construction, components, configuration, operation and other details. In the illustrated example, the fluid communication assembly <b>70</b> is disposed between the first and second screen assemblies <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. The assembly <b>70</b> provides at least one passageway <b>72</b> that fluidly connects the adjacent assembly annuluses <b>40</b> and is fluidly isolated from the interior spaces <b>68</b> of the respective base pipes <b>66</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the embodiment shown, the fluid communication assembly <b>70</b> includes a sleeve <b>73</b> sealingly engaged within the base pipes <b>66</b> proximate to their adjacent ends <b>67</b> (see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The illustrated sleeve <b>73</b> surrounds at least one passage <b>76</b> formed in each base pipe <b>66</b> (or an associated component) proximate to the end <b>67</b> thereof and is in fluid communication with the corresponding assembly annulus <b>40</b>. Thus, in this example, the flow path <b>48</b> extends between the assembly annuluses <b>40</b> of the first and second screen assemblies <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> via the passages <b>76</b> in the base pipes <b>66</b> (or associated components) and the passageway <b>72</b> formed by the fluid communication assembly <b>70</b>. A coupling <b>78</b> is shown extending around the outside of the joint formed between the screen assemblies <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>. However, the present invention is not limited to this particular configuration of the fluid communication assembly <b>70</b>. Moreover, a fluid communication assembly <b>70</b> may not be included. Any other mechanism or feature for communicating fluid between screens or other components of a multi-screen arrangement may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further details and examples of fluid communication assemblies that may be used in connection with the present invention are described and shown in various publicly available documents, including without limitation, the brochure of the present assignee, BJ Services company, entitled &#x201c;Screen Communication System Product Information&#x201d; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,405,800 issued on Jun. 18, 2002 to Walker et al., entitled &#x201c;Method and Apparatus for Controlling Fluid Flow in a Well&#x201d; and having a common assignee of the present patent, both of which are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Still referring to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the valve assembly <b>80</b>, when included, may have any suitable form, construction, components, configuration, operation and other details. The illustrated valve assembly <b>80</b> is coupled to the lower end of the second screen assembly <b>62</b> and includes at least one passageway <b>84</b> in fluid communication with the adjacent assembly annulus <b>40</b>. The valve assembly <b>80</b> is also shown having an interior area <b>86</b> in fluid communication with the interior space <b>68</b> of the second screen assembly <b>62</b>. Thus, the interior area <b>86</b> of the exemplary valve assembly <b>80</b> along with the interior spaces <b>68</b> of the base pipes <b>66</b> form part of the bore <b>26</b> of the tubular assembly <b>20</b>. The inlet <b>46</b> of the illustrated system <b>10</b> is formed in the valve assembly <b>80</b> and fluidly couples the passageway <b>84</b> and interior area <b>86</b>. Fluid may thus flow at least substantially unrestricted between the assembly annuluses <b>40</b> into the bore <b>26</b> of the exemplary tubular assembly <b>20</b> via the passageway <b>84</b> and inlet <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In this example, the valve assembly <b>80</b> also includes a closure member <b>88</b> selectively moveable over the inlet <b>46</b>. The closure member <b>88</b> may be useful in some applications, for example, to close the inlet <b>46</b> when it is desired to pressurize the flow path <b>48</b> and allow production fluid flow from the formation <b>15</b> to pass into the inflow apertures <b>32</b> of the inflow control devices <b>30</b> and ports <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The illustrated closure member <b>88</b> is a sliding sleeve movable between open and closed positions relative to the inlet <b>46</b> in any suitable manner. For example, the closure member <b>88</b> may be movable with the use of a mechanical shifting tool or wash pipe (not shown) inserted in the bore <b>26</b> and operable as is or becomes further known. However, the closure member <b>88</b> may have any other suitable form, configuration and operation. For example, the closure member <b>88</b> may be a ball-valve or other type of valve, mechanism or other feature that is hydraulically, electrically, electronically or otherwise actuated. Thus, the present invention is not limited by the construction, components, configuration, operation and other details of the closure member <b>88</b>. Moreover, a closure member <b>88</b> may not be included, and the inlet <b>46</b> may be selectively closed or blocked (if desired) in any suitable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Still with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the illustrated valve assembly <b>80</b> also includes at least one screen member <b>90</b> extending at least partially concentrically around its periphery and in fluid communication with the passageway <b>84</b>. In this example, the screen member <b>90</b> is a wire wrap screen assembly <b>92</b>, but may have any other suitable form. Thus, fluid may flow directly from the well bore annulus <b>18</b> through the screen member <b>90</b>, into the valve assembly <b>80</b> and into the bore <b>26</b> of the illustrated tubular assembly <b>20</b> via the passageway <b>84</b> and inlet <b>46</b>. However, a screen member <b>90</b> may not be included.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In other embodiments, the valve assembly <b>80</b> may not comprise a separate component, but may be integral to the second screen assembly <b>60</b> or other component. For example, the inlet <b>46</b> may be formed directly in the second screen assembly <b>60</b> or lowermost tubular member <b>25</b> of the system <b>10</b> or another component welded to the tubular assembly <b>20</b>, and a closure member <b>88</b> may be associated therewith. Moreover, a valve assembly <b>80</b> may not be included.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another independent aspect, the present invention includes methods of allowing fluid filtered through at least one screen to flow outside the bore of a pipe disposed in a well bore to a pipe entry point at a desired location in the pipe span. An embodiment of a method will now be described with the use of the fluid flow system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in connection with the recovery of gravel pack delivery fluid during circulating gravel packing operations, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">However, it should be understood that the illustrated system <b>10</b> is not required for practicing this exemplary method or other methods of the present invention or the appended claims. Any suitable components may be used. Further, the present invention is not limited to the particular method as described below, but includes any method of allowing fluid flow within a fluid flow system along the exterior of a span of pipe disposed in a well bore in accordance with the principals of the present disclosure. Moreover, the apparatus, methods and systems of the present invention are not limited to use during gravel packing operations, but may be used in any scenario involving communication of fluid in either direction between the pipe interior and well bore where fluid flow along the exterior of a span of the pipe is desired. A few other examples where the invention may, in some instances, be useful include well stimulation, hole cleaning and fracturing packing.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in typical gravel packing operations, a gravel slurry, which includes, without limitation, gravel <b>94</b> and delivery fluid, is provided through the pipe string into the well bore annulus <b>18</b> at or near the heel (not shown) of the well bore <b>14</b> or another desired location above the production zone, as is and becomes further know. In the well bore <b>14</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the &#x201c;heel&#x201d; of the well bore would be somewhere to the left of the upper end <b>37</b> of the illustrated leftmost screen <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">During the insertion of the gravel slurry, gravel <b>94</b> from the slurry will typically settle in the well bore annulus <b>18</b> along the outside of the tubular assembly <b>20</b> beginning near the heel of the well bore <b>14</b> and progressing downhole in the well bore <b>14</b> along the outside of the tubular assembly <b>20</b> toward the toe (not shown) of the well bore <b>14</b>. In this example, the &#x201c;toe&#x201d; of the illustrated well bore <b>14</b> would be to the right of the valve assembly <b>80</b>. This gravel build-up or bank is sometimes known as and referred to herein as the alpha wave <b>96</b> and may, for example, fill approximately &#xbe; of the width of the well bore annulus <b>18</b>. The alpha wave <b>96</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as it progresses down the well bore <b>14</b>. Typically, the alpha wave <b>96</b> continues generally to build up along the length of the tubular assembly <b>20</b> to a desired location near the bottom end <b>29</b> of the tubular assembly <b>20</b>, such as at the valve assembly <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, as the alpha wave <b>96</b> forms, the gravel delivery fluid is capable of substantially flowing into the tubular assembly <b>20</b> through the screen(s) <b>34</b> (and screen member(s) <b>90</b>, if included) as indicated by arrows <b>98</b>. The screens <b>34</b>, <b>90</b> generally prevent the entry of the gravel, sand and other particles or material into the system <b>10</b>, as is and becomes further known. After entering the screens <b>34</b> (and screen assembly <b>90</b>), the delivery fluid is capable of substantially flowing along the exterior <b>23</b> of bore <b>26</b> of the tubular assembly <b>20</b> through the flow path <b>48</b> as indicated by arrows <b>99</b>. The delivery fluid then enters the bore <b>26</b> through the open inlet(s) <b>46</b> without at least substantially entering the bore <b>26</b> at any intermediate location.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this particular example, the flow path <b>48</b> includes the assembly annuluses <b>40</b> of the first and second screen assemblies <b>60</b>, <b>62</b>, the respective gaps <b>44</b> (see e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and the passageways <b>72</b>, <b>84</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the gap <b>44</b> portions of the flow path <b>48</b> provide a route for the delivery fluid that at least substantially bypasses the flow restriction mechanism(s) <b>31</b> of the ICDs <b>30</b> and ports <b>24</b>. For example, the width of the gap <b>44</b> may be substantially greater than the width of the inflow aperture(s) <b>32</b> (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) of the ICD <b>30</b>, allowing the gap <b>44</b> to serve as the path of least resistance for fluid flowing through the assembly annulus <b>40</b> when the inlet <b>46</b> is open. For another example, the entry of fluid into the inflow aperture(s) <b>32</b> of the ICDs <b>30</b> may require pressurization, which may be avoided when the inlet <b>46</b> is open. However, any other suitable conditions, components, features or mechanisms may be utilized to encourage or ensure desired fluid flow in the flow path <b>48</b> without passing through flow restriction mechanisms <b>31</b> of the ICDs <b>30</b> or ports <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In this example, there is no need for a wash pipe (not shown) or other component to assist in blocking ports <b>24</b> or other intermediate entry points into the bore <b>26</b>, or to otherwise encourage fluid flow along the exterior <b>23</b> of the tubular members <b>25</b> to the inlet <b>46</b>. After passing through the inlet(s) <b>46</b>, the delivery fluid may then flow up the bore <b>26</b> as indicated by arrows <b>100</b> to the surface (not shown) or otherwise as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Now referring to the exemplary illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, if it is desirable to substantially fill the remainder of the width of the well bore annulus <b>18</b> with gravel <b>94</b> after the alpha wave <b>96</b> is formed, the gravel slurry may continue to be provided in the well bore <b>14</b>, as is or becomes further known. Gravel <b>94</b> from the slurry then begins settling in the well bore annulus <b>18</b> on top of the alpha wave <b>96</b> beginning near the toe (not shown) of the well bore <b>14</b> or otherwise generally where the alpha wave <b>96</b> ended, forming the second bank, or beta wave <b>102</b>, of gravel <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in accordance with this embodiment, as the beta wave <b>102</b> is formed, delivery fluid from the gravel slurry is able to flow through the alpha wave <b>96</b> and into the illustrated fluid flow system <b>10</b> through the screens <b>34</b> (and screen member(s) <b>90</b>, when included) as indicated by arrows <b>104</b>. The delivery fluid inside the screens <b>34</b> and screen member <b>90</b> is then capable of flowing generally unrestricted through the flow path <b>48</b> as indicated by arrows <b>99</b>, to the open inlet(s) <b>46</b> and into the bore <b>26</b>, similarly as described above with respect to the alpha wave <b>96</b> and as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>. The beta wave <b>102</b> is thus able to progress up the well bore <b>14</b> in the direction of the heel (not shown) thereof to potentially cover the entire alpha wave <b>96</b> and substantially fill the remainder of the width of the well bore annulus <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">After the delivery fluid has sufficiently entered the bore <b>26</b> (or at any other time), the inlet <b>46</b> may be closed or blocked, such as by actuation of a closure member <b>88</b>. This may be desired, for example, to allow the ICDs <b>30</b> to be the active inflow points into the bore <b>26</b> for production, or other operations.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">It should be noted that in other applications, it may be desirable for fluid flow in the opposite direction through the flow path <b>48</b> from the bore <b>26</b> of the tubular assembly <b>20</b> to the well bore annulus <b>18</b>. Thus, the present invention is not limited to flow into the bore <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Preferred embodiments of the present invention thus offer advantages over the prior art and are well adapted to carry out one or more of the objects of the invention.
