<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is a national stage of PCT/EP09/005621 filed Aug. 4, 2009 and published in English, which claims the priority of Argentina number P080103526 filed Aug. 13, 2008, hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Hemodialysis machines use one or several aqueous solution salt concentrates&#x2014;such as, for example, a sodium bicarbonate solution&#x2014;to purify blood in patients under dialysis treatment, thus working as a sort of artificial kidney. This concentrate can be derived by the machine from powdered or granular salt compounds that are provided in disposable, replaceable containers that can be of a bag type. In the standard process, water is provided by the machine to dissolve, e.g. the powdered sodium bicarbonate, the usable solution being concomitantly removed from the container through a separate tube.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a connector that is disposed in the container and serves to attach the container to the dialysis machine, which connector is formed by the water inlet and solution outlet.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Patent EP No 1,344,550 describes a connector that serves the same purpose, made of one piece with three tubes. The main tube is a central bore which completely traverses the member between its outer and inner sides (the latter being thus defined because it is within a tubular container once the connector is placed in the corresponding opening in such container), which is used to fill the container with soluble solid powdered or granular salts, whereby it has a greater diameter. The other two tubes are designed for water inflow and solution outflow, respectively, and they each have a length that is parallel to the central tube from the inner side of the connector to the vicinity of the outer side, wherefrom they outwardly diverge to extend in a parallel direction along a respective side wing or along the edge of the outer side leading to a cylindrical portion configured to be plugged into a dialysis machine. FIGS. 4 and 5 of such European Patent show the general features of a mounting console of the aforesaid dialysis machine model, wherein the side tubes are seen following paths forming more than one bend such that, for mold-designing purposes, if the member were made of plastic, the open side tubes could be molded on the outer side.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The pre-filling operation is typically carried out during the container manufacturing process itself and it can be followed by a sealing operation wherein a compliant sheet is welded onto the outer side of the connector to cover the mouth of the central tube, as can be seen in FIG. 2 of the aforementioned European Patent No. 1,344,550, to avoid both the loss of its contents and its contamination within the container. These procedures are performed in a sterile area. The same sheet also covers the side tubes that are molded with openings therein, as shown in FIG. 1 of such patent.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent AR No 37,133 refers to a connecting cap for a bi-compartment bag used with another hemodialysis machine. FIGS. 3; 4, and 5 of such patent AR No 37,133 show a connector having two inlet and outlet tubes, which is made of an assembly of two sealed and nested members. One member is of annular shape and it is incorporated into the replaceable bag in such a manner that on its inner side, each tube is in fluid communication with a separate compartment. The second, central member is not placed within the annular member until just after the bag has been pre-filled with the powdery product through the larger diameter central tube. The central member is formed with a disk sealing the central tube once it has been snapped into the annular member, thus forming a connector to attach the bag to the dialysis machine when the latter opens such disk as a valve to let the water in and dissolve the product, with the machine removing the resulting solution via the side tube.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Finally, FIGS. 2 and 3 of Published Patent Application AR No 35,471 show a two-piece molded connector having ribs to allow for its assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">An object of the present invention is to develop another connector to be used on this type of replaceable container as described in AR No 35,471.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another object of this invention is to eliminate the opening-sealing procedure on the outer side of the connector by means of a welded sheet or film, as is done in the aforementioned European Patent. A further object is a connector structure that is provided with a novel sealing system that is effective for one- or two-compartment disposable containers.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The further problem solved by the invention is that of achieving a sealing of the open channels or grooves formed by the tubes around the outer side of the connector wings, in a safer and more cost-efficient manner.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The problems are solved by a connector for a replaceable container having walls, the container having a member with an opening in one of the walls, the container to be used in a medical machine. The connector is comprised of at least a body, the inner side of which is traversed by inlet and outlet tubes extending from a central member within such container when the connector is attached to the container by joining the central member to the member with the opening, towards an outer side of the connector. The tubes separately extend leading to two laterally spaced-apart apertures that are removably attachable to a mounting element and supplementary connection of the machine.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention further includes a connector as described in the previous paragraph in combination with a replaceable, disposable container closed by the connector.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention further includes a method of making a connector for a replaceable container having walls, the container having a member with an opening in one of the walls, the container to be used in a medical machine as described above. The connector includes at least a body, the inner side of which is traversed by inlet and outlet tubes extending from a central member within such container when the connector is attached to the container by joining the central member to the member with the opening, towards an outer side of the connector. The tubes separately extend leading to two laterally spaced-apart apertures that are removably attachable to a mounting element and supplementary connection of the machine. The method comprises molding the body having the inlet and outlet tubes traversing the inside thereof from the inner side of the container to an outer side of the connector, the tubes separately extending parallel or along the edge of the outer side of the connector leading to two removably attachable apertures. The body is molded with openings on the outer side disclosing the open portions in both tubes and has a cap that conforms to the openings. The cap is affixed to the body by flexible, hinged or frangible linkages, such that the cap can fold around such linkages until it covers the exposed portions of the tubes.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Still further, the present invention includes a method of making a replaceable device containing a powdered, granular or similar matter to be attached to a medical machine for preparing medical solutions, in particular dialysis solutions. The method includes providing a device comprising two members, with one of the two members being a container provided with a member having an opening, the other member being a connector. The connector includes at least a body, the inner side of which is traversed by inlet and outlet tubes extending from a central member within such container when the connector is attached to the container by joining the central member to the member with the opening, towards an outer side of the connector. The tubes separately extend leading to two laterally spaced-apart apertures that are removably attachable to a mounting element and supplementary connection of the machine. The method further includes filling the container by introducing into the container a solid matter through the opening, and fitting the connector within the opening of the member of the container, such the connector and the container form a sealing fit.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">These and other benefits, objects and solutions, which will become apparent from the following description, are in one embodiment achieved by shaping a connector having a cap attached to the connector body itself by means of compliant, hinged, or frangible linkages. In a further operation, the cap is folded around the outer side and sealingly closed to block the tube openings on the side wings thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a preferred embodiment, the connector comprises an member, preferably an annular member, lodged in the bag opening and that is configured as disclosed in Patent Application AR 35,471, through which the solid product pre-filling operation is carried out, and a central member that makes up a nozzle with the essential features of the connector as listed in the previous paragraphs.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The disclosures of the patent applications AR 35,471 and EP 1 344 550 A1 are incorporated in the present application by reference.</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Further scope of applicability of the present invention will become apparent from the detailed description given hereinafter. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it is first shown an elongated single-compartment bag <b>11</b> made of two wall sheets having an opening <b>13</b> in one of the wall sheets, and a connector <b>15</b> that is shown unattached for illustration purposes. In order to place the connector member <b>15</b> in the bag, an ancillary member <b>17</b> which in this embodiment is of annular shape is positioned at the rim of the opening <b>13</b>, which annular member is capable of centrally receiving the connector body <b>15</b> within its throat or opening <b>13</b>, thus forming a sealing fit.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the member <b>15</b> comprises a central body <b>19</b> having annular ribs <b>21</b>, which allow for a firm hold within the opening <b>13</b> of the annular member <b>17</b>, and two wing-like lateral extensions <b>23</b> within which tubes or conduits <b>25</b> extend to respectively inject water and remove the solution therethrough. These conduits <b>25</b> extend from corresponding apertures <b>27</b> in the wing ends <b>23</b>, that are configured to allow the attachment and connection to a dialysis machine (not shown), having some lengths that form channels <b>29</b> that are open on one end on the outer or rear side <b>31</b> of the member, then leading into the inner side <b>33</b> of the connector, wherein the solution outlet tube has an extremity for the attachment of a suction tube <b>35</b>, the terminal edge of which ends in a filter <b>37</b> such that, in use, the latter is lodged at the bottom of the bag <b>11</b>, at the opposite end of the opening <b>13</b>. Similarly the inlet tube to inject the water can have a filter element directly at its end in the central body <b>19</b>. The filter element can be made by various manufacturing techniques. In one embodiment the orifice of the inlet tube is covered by a non-woven welded sheet which is welded or glued to the central body. The inlet orifice may also have a small extremity pointing into the container and having an enlarged cross-section compared with the outlet tube.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">For brevity purposes, any further details on the conventional aspects of the disclosure so far are omitted, since they are known from the aforementioned patents. The permanent bond between the annular member and the sheet material the bag <b>11</b> is made of, as well as the snap fitting thereto of the central member or the actual nozzle <b>15</b>, may have the same characteristics as shown in the above Publication AR No 35,471.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the connector member <b>15</b> is molded with a cap <b>39</b> attached thereto by two linking flexible strips <b>41</b>. Such cap <b>39</b> has the same transversally elongated configuration as the aforementioned rear side <b>31</b> of the wings <b>23</b> in the connector <b>15</b>, together with internal protuberances <b>43</b> replicating the open portions <b>29</b> of the tubes. Thus, it is easy to understand that, when the cap <b>39</b> is folded over the outer side <b>31</b> of the connector <b>15</b>, thus folding the strips <b>41</b> which attach it to the ends of wings <b>23</b>, protuberances <b>43</b> snap fit within the open channels <b>29</b> far enough to seal them, the sealing being guaranteed by ultrasound or laser welding.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the illustrated example, wings <b>23</b> have an 87.3 mm span to accommodate a 78.0 mm length between the central points of the mounting apertures and connection <b>27</b>. The open channels <b>29</b> have a 4.1 mm width, whereas the cap <b>39</b> has a 1.0 mm thickness, just like protuberances <b>43</b> on the inner side of the cap <b>39</b>. Strips <b>41</b> attaching the cap onto the body <b>15</b> of the connector are 3.0 mm long, 2.0 mm wide and 0.8 mm thick.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the apertures <b>27</b> that the channels <b>29</b> of the connector <b>15</b> lead into, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a reinforcing structure <b>45</b> that serves to stiffen the said member. Once the central piece <b>15</b> of the connector with the cap <b>39</b> already welded onto it, as disclosed above, and the bag <b>11</b> with the annular member <b>17</b> have been made, the powdered product is filled into the bag <b>11</b>. The member <b>15</b> of the actual connector is then placed on the annular member <b>17</b>, by first introducing the suction tube <b>35</b>, which serves as an extension of the solution outlet, such that the filter <b>37</b> reaches the bottom of the bag <b>11</b>. Both apertures <b>27</b> are sealed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref> by means of a polyester-coated sheet <b>47</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which is bonded by a peel-off hot melt, and then the filled and sealed device containing the substance to be dissolved is ready to be shipped to a point of use, i.e. a hospital, clinic or dialysis center. It is seen that the annular member <b>17</b> serves two purposes: as an inlet port for the solid matter to be dissolved and as a sealing mounting and retention member on the central member of connector <b>15</b> having the characteristics of a finished plug.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When it is time for use, the device is promptly attached to a dialysis machine, after the peel-off sheet <b>47</b> has been lifted from apertures <b>27</b>, and plugged into the mounting console of the machine, after which the latter will pump pure or distilled water via one of the tubes <b>25</b> in order to dissolve the solid matter. After being contacted by water, such solid matter forms a solution with the solid contents that is capable of passing through sieve <b>37</b> such that it can be sucked by tube <b>35</b> and carried through the outlet tube <b>21</b> into the machine for the purifying treatment of the blood taken from the patient to be detoxified and returned by extracorporeal circulation in the case of hemodialysis. When the product in the device bag has been depleted, the connecting apertures <b>27</b> are unplugged and the device is disposed of or replaced to perform another treatment with a new device.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It will be apparent that various modifications and additions could be introduced into the embodiment disclosed herein, as long as they are consistent with the spirit and scope of the present invention. For instance, while the invention has been described regarding a replaceable device suitable for a hemodialysis machine, it should be apparent that the solution provided could eventually be used in other medical application with analogous problems to solve such as a peritoneal dialysis machine. It should also be apparent that while the described embodiment uses a bag, the concept of the invention is applicable to containers in general, independent of the flexibility of the walls of the container.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The invention being thus described, it will be apparent that the same may be varied in many ways. Such variations are not to be regarded as a departure from the spirit and scope of the invention, and all such modifications as would be recognized by one skilled in the art are intended to be included within the scope of the following claims.</p>
