<p id="p-0007" num="0010">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0011">The invention relates to a power converter method and apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0012">2. Discussion of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0013">Power is generated from a number of sources. The generated power is necessarily converted, such as before entering the power grid or prior to use. In many industrial applications, electromagnetic components, such as inductors and capacitors, are used in power filtering. Important factors in the design of power filtering methods and apparatus include cost, size, efficiency, resonant points, inductor impedance, inductance at desired frequencies, and/or inductance capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">What is needed is a more efficient inductor apparatus and method of use thereof.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0048">In various embodiments, the electrical system is adaptable for energy storage or a generation system using direct current (DC) or alternating current (AC) electricity configured to backup, store, and/or generate distributed power. Various embodiments described herein are particularly suitable for high current applications, such as currents greater than about one hundred amperes (A), currents greater than about two hundred amperes, and more particularly currents greater than about four hundred amperes. Embodiments described herein are also suitable for use with electrical systems exhibiting multiple combined signals, such as one or more pulse width modulated (PWM) higher frequency signals superimposed on a lower frequency waveform. For example, a switching element may generate a PWM ripple on a main supply waveform. Such electrical systems operating at currents greater than about one hundred amperes operate within a field of art substantially different than low power electrical systems, such as those operating at sub-ampere levels or at about 2, 5, 10, 20, or 50 amperes.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">Various embodiments are optionally adapted for high-current inverters and/or converters. An inverter produces alternating current from a direct current. A converter processes AC or DC power to provide a different electrical waveform. The term converter denotes a mechanism for either processing AC power into DC power, which is a rectifier, or deriving power with an AC waveform from DC power, which is an inverter. An inverter/converter system is either an inverter system or a converter system. Converters are used for many applications, such as rectification from AC to supply electrochemical processes with large controlled levels of direct current, rectification of AC to DC followed by inversion to a controlled frequency of AC to supply variable-speed AC motors, interfacing DC power sources, such as fuel cells and photoelectric devices, to AC distribution systems, production of DC from AC power for subway and streetcar systems, for controlled DC voltage for speed-control of DC motors in numerous industrial applications, and/or for transmission of DC electric power between rectifier stations and inverter stations within AC generation and transmission networks.</p>

Preferably, the inductor isolator <b>320</b> is used to attach the mount <b>232</b> indirectly to the base plate <b>210</b>.

<p id="p-0058" num="0061">Cooling System</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an optional cooling system <b>240</b> is used in the power processing system <b>100</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the cooling system <b>240</b> uses a fan to move air across the inductor <b>230</b>. The fan either pushes or pulls an air flow around and through the inductor <b>230</b>. An optional air guide shroud <b>450</b> is placed over 1, 2, 3, or more inductors <b>230</b> to facilitate focused air movement resultant from the cooling system <b>240</b>, such as airflow from a fan, around the inductors <b>230</b>.

Optional liquid based cooling systems <b>240</b> are further described, infra.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0063">Buss bars</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0064">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in the power processing system <b>100</b>, the capacitor <b>250</b> is preferably an array of capacitors connected in parallel to achieve a specific capacitance for each of the multi-phases of the power supply <b>110</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, two capacitors <b>250</b> are illustrated for each of the multi-phased power supply U<b>1</b>, V<b>1</b>, and W<b>1</b>. The capacitors are mounted using a series of busbars or buss bars <b>260</b>. A buss bar <b>260</b> carries power from one point to another or connects one point to another.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0065">Common Neutral Buss bar</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0066">A particular type of buss bar <b>260</b> is a common neutral buss bar <b>265</b>, which connects two phases. In one example of an electrical embodiment of a delta capacitor connection in a poly phase system, it is preferable to create a common neutral point for the capacitors. Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an example of two phases using multiple capacitors in parallel with a common neutral buss bar <b>265</b> is provided. The common neutral buss bar <b>265</b> functions as both a mount and a parallel bus conductor for two phases. This concept minimizes the number of parallel conductors, in a &#x2018;U&#x2019; shape or in a parallel &#x2018;| |&#x2019; shape in the present embodiment, to the number of phases plus two. In a traditional parallel buss bar system, the number of buss bars <b>260</b> used is the number of phases multiplied by two or number of phases times two. Hence, the use of &#x2018;U&#x2019; shaped buss bars <b>260</b> reduces the number of buss bars used compared to the traditional mounting system. Minimizing the number of buss bars required to make a poly phase capacitor assembly, where multiple smaller capacitors are positioned in parallel to create a larger capacitance, minimizes the volume of space needed and the volume of buss bar conductors. Reduction in buss bar <b>260</b> volume and/or quantity minimizes cost of the capacitor assembly. After the two phases that share a common neutral bus conductor are assembled, a simple jumper <b>270</b> bus conductor is optionally used to jumper those two phases to any quantity of additional phases as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The jumper optionally includes as little as two connection points. The jumper optionally functions as a handle on the capacitor assembly for handling. It is also typical that this common neutral bus conductor is the same shape as the other parallel bus conductors throughout the capacitor assembly. This common shape theme, a &#x2018;U&#x2019; shape in the present embodiment, allows for symmetry of the assembly in a poly phase structure as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0067">Parallel Buss Bars Function as Mounting Chassis</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">Herein, the buss bars <b>260</b>, <b>265</b> preferably mechanically support the capacitors <b>250</b>. The use of the buss bars <b>260</b>, <b>265</b> for mechanical support of the capacitors <b>250</b> has several benefits. The parallel conducting buss bar connecting multiple smaller value capacitors to create a larger value, which can be used in a &#x2018;U&#x2019; shape, also functions as a mounting chassis. Incorporating the buss bar as a mounting chassis removes the requirement of the capacitor <b>250</b> to have separate, isolated mounting brackets. These brackets typically would mount to a ground point or metal chassis in a filter system. In the present embodiment, the capacitor terminals and the parallel buss bar support the capacitors and eliminate the need for expensive mounting brackets and additional mounting hardware for these brackets. This mounting concept allows for optimal vertical or horizontal packaging of capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">Parallel Buss Bar</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">A parallel buss bar is optionally configured to carry smaller currents than an input/output terminal. The size of the buss bar <b>260</b> is minimized due to its handling of only the capacitor current and not the total line current, where the capacitor current is less than about 10, 20, 30, or 40 percent of the total line current. The parallel conducting buss bar, which also functions as the mounting chassis, does not have to conduct full line current of the filter. Hence the parallel conducting buss bar is optionally reduced in cross-section area when compared to the output terminal <b>350</b>. This smaller sized buss bar reduces the cost of the conductors required for the parallel configuration of the capacitors by reducing the conductor material volume. The full line current that is connected from the inductor to the terminal is substantially larger than the current that travels through the capacitors. For example, the capacitor current is less than about 10, 20, 30, or 40 percent of the full line current. In addition, when an inductor is used that impedes the higher frequencies by about 20, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 1500, or 2000 KHz before they reach the capacitor buss bar and capacitors, this parallel capacitor current is lower still than when an inferior filter inductor, whose resonant frequency is below 5, 10, 20, 40, 50, 75, 100 KHz, is used which cannot impede the higher frequencies due to its high internal capacitive construction or low resonant frequency. In cases where there exist high frequency harmonics and the inductor is unable to impede these high frequencies, the capacitors must absorb and filter these currents which causes them to operate at higher temperatures, which decreases the capacitors usable life in the circuit. In addition, these un-impeded frequencies add to the necessary volume requirement of the capacitor buss bar and mounting chassis, which increases cost of the power processing system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">Staggered Capacitor Mounting</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">Use of a staggered capacitor mounting system reduces and/or minimizes volume requirements for the capacitors.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a filter system <b>300</b> is illustrated. The filter system <b>300</b> preferably includes a mounting plate or base plate <b>210</b>. The mounting plate <b>210</b> attaches to the inductor <b>230</b> and a set of capacitors <b>330</b>. The capacitors are preferably staggered in an about close packed arrangement having a spacing between rows and staggered columns of less than about 0.25, 0.5, or 1 inch. The staggered packaging allows optimum packaging of multiple smaller value capacitors in parallel creating a larger capacitance in a small, efficient space. Buss bars <b>260</b> are optionally used in a &#x2018;U&#x2019; shape or a parallel &#x2018;| |&#x2019; shape to optimize packaging size for a required capacitance value. The &#x2018;U&#x2019; shape with staggered capacitors <b>250</b> are optionally mounted vertically to the mounting surface, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or horizontally to the mounting surface as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>. The &#x2018;U&#x2019; shape buss bar is optionally two about parallel bars with one or more optional mechanical stabilizing spacers, <b>267</b>, at selected locations to mechanically stabilize both about parallel sides of the &#x2018;U&#x2019; shape buss bar as the buss bar extends from the terminal <b>350</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">In this example, the capacitor bus work <b>260</b> is in a &#x2018;U&#x2019; shape that fastens to a terminal <b>350</b> attached to the base plate <b>210</b> via an insulator <b>325</b>. The &#x2018;U&#x2019; shape is formed by a first buss bar <b>260</b> joined to a second buss bar <b>260</b> via the terminal <b>350</b>. The &#x2018;U&#x2019; shape is alternatively shaped to maintain the staggered spacing, such as with an m by n array of capacitors, where m and n are integers, where m and n are each two or greater. The buss bar matrix or assembly contains neutral points <b>265</b> that are preferably shared between two phases of a poly-phase system. The neutral buss bars <b>260</b>, <b>265</b> connect to all three-phases via the jumper <b>270</b>. The shared buss bar <b>265</b> allows the poly-phase system to have x+2 buss bars where x is the number of phases in the poly-phase system instead of the traditional two buss bars per phase in a regular system. Optionally, the common buss bar <b>265</b> comprises a metal thickness of approximately twice the size of the buss bar <b>260</b>. The staggered spacing enhances packaging efficiency by allowing a maximum number of capacitors in a given volume while maintaining a minimal distance between capacitors needed for the optional cooling system <b>240</b>, such as cooling fans and/or use of a coolant fluid. Use of a coolant fluid directly contacting the inductor <b>230</b> is described, infra. The distance from the mounting surface <b>210</b> to the bottom or closest point on the body of the second closest capacitor <b>250</b>, is less than the distance from the mounting surface <b>210</b> to the top or furthest point on the body of the closest capacitor. This mounting system is designated as a staggered mounting system for parallel connected capacitors in a single or poly phase filter system.</p>

The angled mounting surface is optionally angled at least 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, or 80 degrees off of horizontal. In these cases, the axis <b>405</b> still runs about parallel to the mounting surface, such as about parallel to the vertical mounting surface or about parallel to a sloped mounting surface <b>430</b>, base plate <b>210</b>, or other surface.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0087">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the inductor <b>230</b> has an inner surface <b>414</b> surrounding the center opening, center aperture, or center hole <b>412</b>; an outer edge <b>416</b> or outer edge surface; and two faces <b>417</b>, including a front face <b>418</b> and a back face <b>419</b>. An inductor section refers to a portion of the about annular inductor between a point n the inner surface <b>414</b> and a closest point on the outer edge <b>416</b>. The surface of the inductor <b>230</b> includes: the inner surface <b>414</b>, outer edge <b>416</b> or outer edge surface, and faces <b>417</b>. The surface of the inductor <b>230</b> is typically the outer surface of the magnet wire windings surrounding the core of the inductor <b>230</b>. The magnet wire is preferably a wire with an aluminum oxide coating for minimal corona potential. The magnet wire is preferably temperature resistant or rated to at least two hundred degrees Centigrade. The winding of the wire or magnet wire is further described, infra.

<p id="p-0085" num="0088">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an optional clamp bar <b>234</b> runs through the center hole <b>412</b> of the inductor <b>230</b>. The clamp bar <b>234</b> is preferably a single piece, but is optionally composed of multiple elements. The clamp bar <b>234</b> is connected directly or indirectly to the mounting surface <b>430</b> and/or to a base plate <b>210</b>. The clamp bar <b>234</b> is composed of a non-conductive material as metal running through the center hole of the inductor <b>230</b> functions as a magnetic shorted turn in the system. The clamp bar <b>234</b> is preferably a rigid material or a semi-rigid material that bends slightly when clamped, bolted, or fastened to the mounting surface <b>430</b>. The clamp bar <b>234</b> is preferably rated to a temperature of at least 130 degrees Centigrade. Preferably, the clamp bar material is a fiberglass material, such as a thermoset fiberglass-reinforced polyester material, that offers strength, excellent insulating electrical properties, dimensional stability, flame resistance, flexibility, and high property retention under heat. An example of a fiberglass clamp bar material is Glastic&#xae;. Optionally the clamp bar <b>234</b> is a plastic, a fiber reinforced resin, a woven paper, an impregnated glass fiber, a circuit board material, a high performance fiberglass composite, a phenolic material, a thermoplastic, a fiberglass reinforced plastic, a ceramic, or the like, which is preferably rated to at least 150 degrees Centigrade. Any of the mounting hardware <b>422</b> is optionally made of these materials.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0089">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the clamp bar <b>234</b> is preferably attached to the mounting surface <b>430</b> via mounting hardware <b>422</b>. Examples of mounting hardware include: a bolt, a threaded bolt, a rod, a clamp bar <b>234</b>, a mounting insulator <b>424</b>, a connector, a metal connector, and/or a non-metallic connector. Preferably, the mounting hardware is non-conducting. If the mounting hardware <b>422</b> is conductive, then the mounting hardware <b>422</b> is preferably contained in or isolated from the inductor <b>230</b> via a mounting insulator <b>424</b>. Preferably, an electrically insulating surface is present, such as on the mounting hardware. The electrically insulating surface proximately contacts the faces of the inductor <b>230</b>. Alternatively, an insulating gap <b>426</b> of at least about one millimeter exists between the faces <b>417</b> of the inductor <b>230</b> and the metallic or insulated mounting hardware <b>422</b>, such as a bolt or rod.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0090">An example of a mounting insulator is a hollow rod where the outer surface of the hollow rod is non-conductive and the hollow rod has a center channel <b>425</b> through which mounting hardware, such as a threaded bolt, runs. This system allows a stronger metallic and/or conducting mounting hardware to connect the clamp bar <b>234</b> to the mounting surface <b>430</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an exemplary bolt head <b>423</b> fastening a threaded bolt into the base plate <b>210</b> where the base plate has a threaded hole <b>452</b>. An example of a mounting insulator <b>424</b> is a mounting rod. The mounting rod is preferably composed of a material or is at least partially covered with a material where the material is electrically isolating.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0091">The mounting hardware <b>422</b> preferably covers a minimal area of the inductor <b>230</b> to facilitate cooling with a cooling element <b>240</b>, such as via one or more fans. In one case, the mounting hardware <b>422</b> does not contact the faces <b>417</b> of the inductor <b>230</b>. In another case, the mounting hardware <b>422</b> contacts the faces <b>417</b> of the inductor <b>230</b> with a contact area. Preferably the contact area is less than about 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, or 30 percent of the surface area of the faces <b>417</b>. The minimal contact area of the mounting hardware with the inductor surface facilitates temperature control and/or cooling of the inductor <b>230</b> by allowing airflow to reach the majority of the inductor <b>230</b> surface. Preferably, the mounting hardware is temperature resistant to at least 130 degrees centigrade. Preferably, the mounting hardware <b>422</b> comprises curved surfaces circumferential about its length to facilitate airflow around the length of the mounting hardware <b>422</b> to the faces <b>417</b> of the inductor <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the mounting hardware <b>422</b> connects the clamp bar <b>234</b>, which passes through the inductor, to the mounting surface <b>430</b>. The mounting surface is optionally non-metallic and is rigid or semi-rigid. Generally, the properties of the clamp bar <b>234</b> apply to the properties of the mounting surface <b>430</b>. The mounting surface <b>430</b> is optionally (1) composed of the same material as the clamp bar <b>234</b> or is (2) a distinct material type from that of the clamp bar <b>234</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in one example the inductor <b>230</b> is held in a vertical position by the clamp bar <b>234</b>, mounting hardware <b>422</b>, and mounting surface <b>430</b> where the clamp bar <b>234</b> contacts the inner surface <b>414</b> of the inductor <b>230</b> and the mounting surface <b>430</b> contacts the outer edge <b>416</b> of the inductor <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0094">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in a second example one or more vibration isolators <b>440</b> are used in the mounting system. As illustrated, a first vibration isolator <b>440</b> is positioned between the clamp bar <b>234</b> and the inner surface <b>414</b> of the inductor <b>230</b> and a second vibration isolator <b>440</b> is positioned between the outer edge <b>416</b> of the inductor <b>230</b> and the mounting surface <b>430</b>. The vibration isolator <b>440</b> is a shock absorber. The vibration isolator optionally deforms under the force or pressure necessary to hold the inductor <b>230</b> in a vertical position or edge mounted position using the clamp bar <b>234</b>, mounting hardware <b>422</b>, and mounting surface <b>430</b>. The vibration isolator preferably is temperature rated to at least two hundred degrees Centigrade. Preferably the vibration isolator <b>440</b> is about &#x215b;, &#xbc;, &#x215c;, or &#xbd; inch in thickness. An example of a vibration isolator is silicone rubber. Optionally, the vibration isolator <b>440</b> contains a glass weave <b>442</b> for strength. The vibration isolator optionally is internal to the inductor opening or extends out of the inductor <b>230</b> central hole <b>412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0095">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a common mounting surface <b>430</b> is optionally used as a mount for multiple inductors. Alternatively, the mounting surface <b>430</b> is connected to a base plate <b>210</b>. The base plate <b>210</b> is optionally used as a base for multiple mounting surfaces connected to multiple inductors, such as three inductors used with a poly-phase power system where one inductor handles each phase of the power system. The base plate <b>210</b> optionally supports multiple cooling elements, such as one or more cooling elements per inductor. The base plate is preferably metal for strength and durability. The system reduces cost associated with the mounting surface <b>430</b> as the less expensive base plate <b>210</b> is used for controlling relative position of multiple inductors and the amount of mounting surface <b>430</b> material is reduced and/or minimized. Further, the contact area ratio of the mounting surface <b>430</b> to the inductor surface is preferably minimized, such as to less than about 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 20 percent of the surface of the inductor <b>230</b>, to facilitate efficient heat transfer by maximizing the surface area of the inductor <b>230</b> available for cooling by the cooling element <b>240</b> or by passive cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0096">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, an optional cooling system <b>240</b> is used to cool the inductor. In one example, a fan blows air about one direction, such as horizontally, onto the front face <b>418</b>, through the center hole <b>412</b>, along the inner edge <b>414</b> of the inductor <b>230</b>, and/or along the outer edge <b>416</b> of the inductor <b>230</b> where the clamp bar <b>234</b>, vibration isolator <b>440</b>, mounting hardware <b>422</b>, and mounting surface <b>430</b> combined contact less than about 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, or 30 percent of the surface area of the inductor <b>230</b>, which yields efficient cooling of the inductor <b>230</b> using minimal cooling elements and associated cooling element power due to a large fraction of the surface area of the inductor <b>230</b> being available for cooling. To aid cooling, an optional shroud <b>450</b> about the inductor <b>230</b> guides the cooling air flow about the inductor <b>230</b> surface. The shroud <b>450</b> optionally circumferentially encloses the inductor along 1, 2, 3, or 4 sides. The shroud <b>450</b> is optionally any geometric shape.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0097">Preferably, mounting hardware <b>422</b> is used on both sides of the inductor <b>230</b>. Optionally, the inductor <b>230</b> mounting hardware <b>422</b> is used beside only one face of the inductor <b>230</b> and the clamp bar <b>234</b> or equivalent presses down or hooks over the inductor <b>230</b> through the hole <b>412</b> or over the entire inductor <b>230</b>, such as over the top of the inductor <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0098">In yet another embodiment, a section or row of inductors <b>230</b> are elevated in a given airflow path. In this layout, a single airflow path or thermal reduction apparatus is used to cool a maximum number of toroid filter inductors in a filter circuit, reducing additional fans or thermal management systems required as well as overall packaging size. This increases the robustness of the filter with fewer moving parts to degrade as well as minimizes cost and packaging size. The elevated layout of a first inductor relative to a second inductor allows air to cool inductors in the first row and then to also cool inductors in an elevated rear row without excessive heating of the air from the front row and with a single airflow path and direction from the thermal management source. Through elevation, a single fan is preferably used to cool a plurality of inductors approximately evenly, where multiple fans would have been needed to achieve the same result. This efficient concept drastically reduces fan count and package size and allows for cooling airflow in a single direction.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0099">An example of an inductor mounting system is provided. Preferably, the pedestal or non-planar base plate, on which the inductors are mounted, is made out of any suitable material. In the current embodiment, the pedestal is made out of sheet metal and fixed to a location behind and above the bottom row of inductors. Multiple orientations of the pedestal and/or thermal management devices are similarly implemented to achieve these results. In this example, toroid inductors mounted on the pedestal use a silicone rubber shock absorber mounting concept with a bottom plate, base plate, mounting hardware <b>122</b>, a center hole clamp bar with insulated metal fasteners, or mounting hardware <b>122</b> that allows them to be safe for mounting at this elevated height. The mounting concept optionally includes a non-conductive material of suitable temperature and mechanical integrity, such as Glastic&#xae;, as a bottom mounting plate. The toroid sits on a shock absorber of silicone rubber material of suitable temperature and mechanical integrity. In this example, the vibration isolator <b>440</b>, such as silicone rubber, is about 0.125 inch thick with a woven fiber center to provide mechanical durability to the mounting. The toroid is held in place by a center hole clamp bar of Glastic&#xae; or other non-conductive material of suitable temperature and mechanical integrity. The clamp bar fits through the center hole of the toroid and preferably has a minimum of one hole on each end, two total holes, to allow fasteners to fasten the clamp bar to the bottom plate and pedestal or base plate. Beneath the center clamp bar is another shock absorbing piece of silicone rubber with the same properties as the bottom shock absorbing rubber. The clamp bar is torqued down on both sides using fasteners, such as standard metal fasteners. The fasteners are preferably an insulated non-conductive material of suitable temperature and mechanical integrity. The mounting system allows for mounting of the elevated pedestal inductors with the center hole parallel to the mounting chassis and allows the maximum surface area of the toroid to be exposed to the moving air, thus maximizing the efficiency of the thermal management system. In addition, this mounting system allows for the two shock absorbing rubber or equivalent materials to both hold the toroid inductor in an upright position. The shock absorbing material also absorbs additional shock and vibration resulting during operation, transportation, or installation so that core material shock and winding shock is minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0100">Inductor Elements</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0101">The inductor <b>230</b> is further described herein. Preferably, the inductor includes a pressed powder highly permeable and linear core having a BH curve slope of about 11 &#x394;B/&#x394;H surrounded by windings and/or an integrated cooling system.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0102">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the inductor <b>230</b> comprises a core <b>610</b> and a winding <b>620</b>. The inductor <b>230</b> preferably includes any additional elements or features, such as other items required in manufacturing. The winding <b>620</b> is wrapped around the core <b>610</b>. The core <b>610</b> provides mechanical support for the winding <b>620</b> and is characterized by a permeability for storing or transferring a magnetic field in response to current flowing through the winding <b>620</b>. Herein, permeability is defined in terms of a slope of &#x394;B/&#x394;H. The core <b>610</b> and winding <b>620</b> are suitably disposed on or in a mount or housing <b>210</b> to support the core <b>610</b> in any suitable position and/or to conduct heat away from the core <b>610</b> and the winding <b>620</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0103">The inductor core optionally provides mechanical support for the inductor winding and comprises any suitable core for providing the desired magnetic permeability and/or other characteristics. The configuration and materials of the core <b>610</b> are optionally selected according to any suitable criteria, such as a BH curve profile, permeability, availability, cost, operating characteristics in various environments, ability to withstand various conditions, heat generation, thermal aging, thermal impedance, thermal coefficient of expansion, curie temperature, tensile strength, core losses, and/or compression strength. For example, the core <b>610</b> is optionally configured to exhibit a selected permeability and BH curve.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0104">For example, the core <b>610</b> is configured to exhibit low core losses under various operating conditions, such as in response to a high frequency pulse width modulation or harmonic ripple, compared to conventional materials. Conventional core materials are laminated silicon steel or conventional silicon iron steel designs. The inventor has determined that the core preferably comprises an iron powder material or multiple materials to provide a specific BH curve, described infra. The specified BH curve allows creation of inductors having: smaller components, reduced emissions, reduced core losses, and increased surface area in a given volume when compared to inductors using the above described traditional materials.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0105">BH Curve</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0106">There are two quantities that physicists use to denote magnetic field, B and H. The vector field, H, is known among electrical engineers as the magnetic field intensity or magnetic field strength, which is also known as an auxiliary magnetic field or a magnetizing field. The vector field, H, is a function of applied current. The vector field, B, is known as magnetic flux density or magnetic induction and has the international system of units (SI units) of Teslas (T). Thus, a BH curve is induction, B, as a function of the magnetic field, H.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0107">Inductor Core/Distributed Gap</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0108">In one exemplary embodiment, the core <b>610</b> comprises at least two materials. In one example, the core includes two materials, a magnetic material and a coating agent. In one case, the magnetic material includes a first transition series metal in elemental form and/or in any oxidation state. In a second case, the magnetic material is a form of iron. The second material is optionally a non-magnetic material and/or is a highly thermally conductive material, such as carbon, a carbon allotrope, and/or a form of carbon. A form of carbon includes any arrangement of elemental carbon and/or carbon bonded to one or more other types of atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0109">In one case, the magnetic material is present as particles and the particles are each coated with the coating agent to form coated particles. For example, particles of the magnetic material are each substantially coated with one, two, three, or more layers of a coating material, such as a form of carbon. The carbon provides a shock absorber affect, which minimized high frequency core loss from the inductor <b>230</b>. In a preferred embodiment, particles of iron, or a form thereof, are coated with multiple layers of carbon to form carbon coated particles. The coated particles are optionally combined with a filler, such as a thermosetting polymer or an epoxy. The filler provides an average gap distance between the coated particles.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0110">In another case, the magnetic material is present as a first layer in the form of particles and the particles are each at least partially coated, in a second layer, with the coating agent to form coated particles. The coated particles are subsequently coated with another layer of a magnetic material, which is optionally the first magnetic material, to form a three layer particle. The three layer particle is optionally coated with a fourth layer of a non-magnetic material, which is optionally the non-magnetic material of the second layer. The process is optionally repeated to form particles of n layers, where n is a positive integer, such as about 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, or 20. The n layers optionally alternate between a magnetic layer and a non-magnetic layer. Optionally, the innermost particle of each coated particle is a non-magnetic particle.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0111">Optionally, the magnetic material of one or more of the layers in the coated particle is an alloy. In one example, the alloy contains at least 70, 75, 80, 85, or 90 percent iron or a form of iron, such as iron at an oxidation state or bound to another atom. In another example, the alloy contains at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10 percent aluminum or a form of aluminum. Optionally, the alloy contains a metalloid, such as boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, antimony, and/or tellurium. An example of an alloy is sendust, which contains about eighty-five percent iron, nine percent silicon, and six percent aluminum. Sendust exhibits about zero magnetostriction.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0112">The coated particles preferably have, with a probability of at least ninety percent, an average cross-sectional length of less than about one millimeter, one-tenth of a millimeter (100 &#x3bc;m), and/or one-hundredth of a millimeter (10 &#x3bc;m). While two or more coated particles in the core are optionally touching, the average gap distance between two coated particles is optionally a distance greater than zero and less than about one millimeter, one-tenth of a millimeter (100 &#x3bc;m), one-hundredth of a millimeter (10 &#x3bc;m), and/or one-thousandth of a millimeter (1 &#x3bc;m). With a large number of coated particles in the inductor <b>230</b>, there exist a large number of gaps between two adjacent coated particles that are about evenly distributed within at least a portion of the inductor. The about evenly distributed gaps between particles in the inductor is optionally referred to as a distributed gap.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0113">In one exemplary manufacturing process, the carbon coated particles are mixed with a filler, such as an epoxy. The resulting mixture is optionally pressed into a shape, such as an inductor shape, an about toroidal shape, an about annular shape, or an about doughnut shape. Optionally, during the pressing process, the filler or epoxy is melted out. The magnetic path in the inductor goes through the distributed gaps. Small air pockets optionally exist in the inductor <b>230</b>, such as between the coated particles. In use, the magnetic field goes from coated particle to coated particle through the filler gaps and/or through the air gaps.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0114">The distributed gap nature of the inductor <b>230</b> yields an about even Eddy loss, gap loss, or magnetic flux loss. Substantially even distribution of the bonding agent within the iron powder of the core results in the equally distributed gap of the core. The resultant core loss at the switching frequencies of the electrical switches substantially reduces core losses when compared to silicon iron steel used in conventional iron core inductor design.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0115">Further, conventional inductor construction requires gaps in the magnetic path of the steel lamination, which are typically outside the coil construction and are, therefore, unshielded from emitting flux, causing electromagnetically interfering radiation. The electromagnetic radiation can adversely affect the electrical system.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0116">The distributed gaps in the magnetic path of the present core <b>610</b> material are microscopic and substantially evenly distributed throughout the core <b>610</b>. The smaller flux energy at each gap location is also surrounded by a winding <b>620</b> which functions as an electromagnetic shield to contain the flux energy. Thus, a pressed powder core surrounded by windings results in substantially reduced electromagnetic emissions.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0117">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and to Table 1, preferred inductance, B, levels as a function of magnetic force strength are provided. The core <b>610</b> material preferably comprises: an inductance of about &#x2212;4400 to 4400 B over a range of about &#x2212;400 to 400 H with a slope of about 11 &#x394;B/&#x394;H. Herein, permeability refers to the slope of a BH curve and has units of &#x394;B/&#x394;H. Core materials having a substantially linear BH curve with &#x394;B/&#x394;H in the range of ten to twelve are usable in a preferred embodiment. Less preferably, core materials having a substantially linear BH curve with a permeability, &#x394;B/&#x394;H, in the range of nine to thirteen are acceptable.

<p id="p-0119" num="0126">Herein, a corona potential is the potential for long term breakdown of winding wire insulation due to high electric potentials between winding turns winding a mid-level power inductor in a converter system. The high electric potential creates ozone, which breaks down insulation coating the winding wire and results in degraded performance or failure of the inductor.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0127">Herein, power is described as a function of voltage. Typically, homes and buildings use low voltage power supplies, which range from about 100 to 690 volts. Large industry, such as steel mills, chemical plants, paper mills, and other large industrial processes optionally use medium voltage filter inductors and/or medium voltage power supplies. Herein, medium voltage power refers to power having about 1,500 to 35,000 volts or optionally about 2,000 to 5,000 volts. High voltage power refers to high voltage systems or high voltage power lines, which operate from about 20,000 to 150,000 volts.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0128">In one embodiment, a power converter method and apparatus is described, which is optionally part of a filtering method and apparatus. The inductor is configured with inductor winding spacers, such as a main inductor spacer and/or inductor segmenting winding spacers. The spacers are used to space winding turns of a winding coil about an inductor. The insulation of the inductor spacer minimizes energy transfer between windings and thus minimizes corona potential, formation of corrosive ozone through ionization of oxygen, correlated breakdown of insulation on the winding wire, and/or electrical shorts in the inductor.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0129">More particularly, the inductor configured with winding spacers uses the winding spacers to separate winding turns of a winding wire about the core of the inductor, which reduces the volts per turn. The reduction in volts per turn minimizes corona potential of the inductor. Additional electromagnetic components, such as capacitors, are integrated with the inductor configured with winding spacers to facilitate power processing and/or power conversion. The inductors configured with winding spacers described herein are designed to operate on medium voltage systems and to minimize corona potential in a mid-level power converter. The inductors configured with winding spacers, described infra, are optionally used on low and/or high voltage systems.</p>

<p id="p-0124" num="0131">In still yet another embodiment, the inductor <b>230</b> is optionally configured with inductor winding spacers. Generally, the inductor winding spacers or simply winding spacers are used to space winding turns to reduce corona potential, described infra.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0132">For clarity of presentation, initially the inductor winding is described. Subsequently, the corona potential is further described. Then the inductor spacers are described. Finally, the use of the inductor spacers to reduce corona potential through controlled winding with winding turns separated by the insulating inductor spacers is described.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0133">Inductor Winding</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0134">The inductor <b>230</b> includes a core <b>610</b> that is wound with a winding <b>620</b>. The winding <b>620</b> comprises a conductor for conducting electrical current through the inductor <b>230</b>. The winding <b>620</b> optionally comprises any suitable material for conducting current, such as conventional wire, foil, twisted cables, and the like formed of copper, aluminum, gold, silver, or other electrically conductive material or alloy at any temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0135">Preferably, the winding <b>620</b> comprises a set of wires, such as copper magnet wires, wound around the core <b>610</b> in one or more layers. Preferably, each wire of the set of wires is wound through a number of turns about the core <b>610</b>, where each element of the set of wires initiates the winding at a winding input terminal and completes the winding at a winding output terminal. Optionally, the set of wires forming the winding <b>620</b> nearly entirely covers the core <b>610</b>, such as a toroidal shaped core. Leakage flux is inhibited from exiting the inductor <b>230</b> by the winding <b>620</b>, thus reducing electromagnetic emissions, as the windings <b>620</b> function as a shield against such emissions. In addition, the soft radii in the geometry of the windings <b>620</b> and the core <b>610</b> material are less prone to leakage flux than conventional configurations. Stated again, the toroidal or doughnut shaped core provides a curved outer surface upon which the windings are wound. The curved surface allows about uniform support for the windings and minimizes and/or reduced gaps between the winding and the core.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0136">Corona Potential</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0137">A corona potential is the potential for long term breakdown of winding wire insulation due to the high electric potentials between winding turns near the inductor <b>230</b>, which creates ozone. The ozone breaks down insulation coating the winding wire, results in degraded performance, and/or results in failure of the inductor <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0138">Inductor Spacers</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0139">The inductor <b>230</b> is optionally configured with inductor winding spacers, such as a main inductor spacer <b>810</b> and/or inductor segmenting winding spacers <b>820</b>. Generally, the spacers are used to space winding turns, described infra. Collectively, the main inductor spacer <b>810</b> and segmenting winding spacers <b>820</b> are referred to herein as inductor spacers. Generally, the inductor spacer comprises a non-conductive material, such as air, a plastic, or a dielectric material. The insulation of the inductor spacer minimizes energy transfer between windings and thus minimizes or reduces corona potential, formation of corrosive ozone through ionization of oxygen, correlated breakdown of insulation on the winding wire, and/or electrical shorts in the inductor <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0140">A first low power example, of about 690 volts, is used to illustrate need for a main inductor spacer <b>810</b> and lack of need for inductor segmenting winding spacers <b>820</b> in a low power transformer. In this example, the inductor <b>230</b> includes a core <b>610</b> wound twenty times with a winding <b>620</b>, where each turn of the winding about the core is about evenly separated by rotating the core <b>610</b> about eighteen degrees (360 degrees/20 turns) for each turn of the winding. If each turn of the winding <b>620</b> about the core results in 34.5 volts, then the potential between turns is only about 34.5 volts, which is not of sufficient magnitude to result in a corona potential. Hence, inductor segmentation winding spacers <b>820</b> are not required in a low power inductor/conductor system. However, potential between the winding input terminal and the winding output terminal is about 690 volts (34.5 volts times 20 turns). More specifically, the potential between a winding wire near the input terminal and the winding wire near the output terminal is about 690 volts, which can result in corona potential. To minimize the corona potential, an insulating main inductor spacer <b>810</b> is placed between the input terminal and the output terminal. The insulating property of the main inductor spacer <b>810</b> minimizes or prevents shorts in the system, as described supra.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0141">A second medium power example illustrates the need for both a main inductor spacer <b>810</b> and inductor segmenting winding spacers <b>820</b> in a medium power system. In this example, the inductor <b>230</b> includes a core <b>610</b> wound 20 times with a winding <b>620</b>, where each turn of the winding about the core is about evenly separated by rotating the core <b>610</b> about 18 degrees (360 degrees/20 turns) for each turn of the winding. If each turn of the winding <b>620</b> about the core results in about 225 volts, then the potential between individual turns is about 225 volts, which is of sufficient magnitude to result in a corona potential. Placement of an inductor winding spacer <b>820</b> between each turn reduces the corona potential between individual turns of the winding. Further, potential between the winding input terminal and the winding output terminal is about 4500 volts (225 volts times 20 turns). More specifically, the potential between a winding wire near the input terminal and the winding wire near the output terminal is about 4500 volts, which results in corona potential. To minimize the corona potential, an insulating main inductor spacer <b>810</b> is placed between the input terminal and the output terminal. Since the potential between winding wires near the input terminal and output terminal is larger (4500 volts) than the potential between individual turns of wire (225 volts), the main inductor spacer <b>810</b> is preferably wider and/or has a greater insulation than the individual inductor segmenting winding spacers <b>820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0142">In a low power system, the main inductor spacer <b>810</b> is optionally about 0.125 inch in thickness. In a mid-level power system, the main inductor spacer is preferably about 0.375 to 0.500 inch in thickness. Optionally, the main inductor spacer <b>810</b> thickness is greater than about 0.125, 0.250, 0.375, 0.500, 0.625, or 0.850 inch. The main inductor spacer <b>810</b> is preferably thicker, or more insulating, than the individual segmenting winding spacers <b>820</b>. Optionally, the individual segmenting winding spacers <b>820</b> are greater than about 0.0312, 0.0625, 0.125, 0.250, 0.375 inches thick. Generally, the main inductor spacer <b>810</b> has a greater thickness or cross-sectional width that yields a larger electrically insulating resistivity versus the cross-section or width of one of the individual segmenting winding spacers <b>820</b>. Preferably, the electrical resistivity of the main inductor spacer <b>810</b> between the first turn of the winding wire proximate the input terminal and the terminal output turn proximate the output terminal is at least about 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 percent greater than the electrical resistivity of a given inductor segmenting winding spacer <b>820</b> separating two consecutive turns of the winding <b>620</b> about the core <b>610</b> of the inductor <b>230</b>. The main inductor spacer <b>810</b> is optionally a first material and the inductor segmenting spacers are optionally a second material, where the first material is not the same material as the second material. The main inductor spacer <b>810</b> and inductor segmenting winding spacers <b>820</b> are further described, infra.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0143">In yet another example, the converter operates at levels exceeding about 2000 volts at currents exceeding about 400 amperes. For instance, the converter operates at above about 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, or 5000 volts at currents above any of about 500, 1000, or 1500 amperes.

<p id="p-0137" num="0144">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, an example of an inductor <b>230</b> configured with four spacers is illustrated.

The clock position used herein are for clarity of presentation. The spacers are optionally present at any position on the inductor and any coordinate system is optionally used. For example, referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the three illustrated inductor segmenting winding spacers <b>820</b> are positioned at about the three o'clock, six o'clock, and nine o'clock positions. However, the main inductor spacer <b>810</b> is optionally present at any position and the inductor segmenting winding spacers <b>820</b> are positioned relative to the main inductor spacer <b>810</b>. As illustrated, the four spacers segment the toroid into four sections.

In this system, preferably a first turn of the winding <b>620</b> wraps the core <b>610</b> in the first inductor section <b>831</b>, a second turn of the winding <b>620</b> wraps the core <b>610</b> in the second inductor section <b>832</b>, a third turn of the winding <b>620</b> wraps the core <b>610</b> in the third inductor section <b>833</b>, and a fourth turn of the winding <b>620</b> wraps the core <b>610</b> in the fourth inductor section <b>834</b>. Generally, the number of inductor spacers <b>810</b> is set to create 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, or more inductor sections.

Generally, any number of winding wires are wrapped or layered to form the winding <b>610</b> about the core <b>610</b> of the inductor <b>230</b>. An advantage of the system is that in a given inductor section, such as the first inductor section <b>1031</b>, each of the winding wires are at about the same potential, which yields essentially no risk of corona potential within a given inductor section.

The buss bars use a toroid/heat sink integrated system solution, THISS&#xae;, (CTM Magnetics, Tempe, Ariz.) to filter output power <b>150</b> and customer generated input power <b>154</b>. The efficient filter output terminal layout described herein minimizes the copper cross section necessary for the capacitor buss bars <b>260</b>. The copper cross section is minimized for the capacitor buss bar by sending the bulk of the current directly to the output terminals <b>221</b>, <b>223</b>, <b>225</b>.

The termination of the THISS&#xae; technology filter inductor is integrated to the capacitor bank for each phase of the system. These buss bars are optionally manufactured out of any suitable material and are any suitable shape. For instance, the buss bars are optionally a flat strip or a hollow tube. In one example, flat strips of tinned copper with threaded inserts or tapped threaded holes are used for both mounting the capacitors mechanically as well as providing electrical connection to each capacitor. This system optimizes the packaging efficiency of the capacitors by mounting them vertically and staggering each capacitor from each side of the buss bar for maximum density in the vertical dimension. A common neutral buss bar or flex cable <b>265</b> is used between two phases to further reduce copper quantity and to minimize size. A jumper buss bar connects this common neutral point to another phase efficiently, such as through use of an about flat strip of copper. Connection fittings designed to reduce radio-frequency interference and power loss are optionally used. The buss bars are optionally designed for phase matching and for connecting to existing transmission apparatus. The buss bars optionally use a mechanical support spacer, <b>270</b>, made from non magnetic, non conductive material with adequate thermal and mechanical properties, such as a suitable epoxy and glass combination, a Glastic&#xae; or a Garolite material. The integrated output terminal buss bars provide for material handling of the filter assembly as well as connection to the sine wave filtered load or motor.

The inductor key <b>1620</b> optionally includes an outside ring <b>1622</b>, a middle post <b>1624</b>, and/or an inductor lid <b>1626</b>. During use, the inductor lid <b>1626</b> is proximate an inductor face <b>417</b>, such as the inductor back face <b>419</b>. The inductor base <b>1610</b>, inductor <b>230</b>, and inductor lid <b>1620</b> are optionally positioned in any orientation, such as to mount the inductor <b>230</b> horizontally, vertically, or at an angle relative to gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0167">The bundt style inductor cooling system <b>1600</b> facilitates thermal management of the inductor <b>230</b>. The inductor guide <b>1610</b> and/or the inductor lid <b>1620</b> is at least partially made of a thermally transmitting material, where the inductor guide <b>1610</b> and/or the inductor lid <b>1620</b> draws heat away from the inductor <b>230</b>. A thermal transfer agent <b>1630</b>, such as a thermally conductive potting compound, a thermal grease, and/or a heat transfer liquid is optionally placed between an outer surface of the inductor <b>230</b> and an inner surface of the inductor guide <b>1610</b> and/or the inductor lid <b>1620</b>. One or more heat sinks <b>1640</b> or heat sink fins are optionally attached to any surface of the inductor base <b>1610</b> and/or the inductor lid <b>1620</b>. In one case, not illustrated, the heat sink fins function as a mechanical stand under the inductor guide <b>1610</b> through which air or a liquid coolant optionally flows. More generally, a heat sink <b>1640</b> is optionally attached to any of the electrical components described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0168">For example, the cooling system comprises at least two parts, such as a plurality of coolant containment parts or a bottom section of a cooling jacket and a top section of a cooling jacket. The two parts come together to surround or circumferentially surround the wound core during use. The top and bottom halves join each other along an axis coming down onto the toroid shape of the wound core, referred to as a z-axis. However, the pieces making up the cooling system are optionally assembled in any orientation, such as along x-axis and/or y-axis, referring to the axis planes of the toroid.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0169">Further, the top and bottom sections of a cooling jacket are optionally equal in size or either piece could be from 1 to 99 percent of the mass of the sandwiched pair of pieces. For instance, the bottom piece may make up about 10, 25, 50, 75, or 90 percent of the combined cooling jacket assembly. Still further, the cooling jacket may be composed of multiple pieces, such as 3, 4, or more pieces, where the center pieces are rings sandwiched by the top and bottom section of the cooling jacket. Generally, any number of cooling pieces optionally come together along any combination of axes to form a jacket cooling the wound core. Each section of the cooling jacket optionally contains its own cooling in and cooling out lines.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0170">Potted Cooling System</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0171">In still another example, a thermally potted cooling inductor cooling system <b>1700</b> is described. In the potted cooling system, one or more inductors <b>230</b> are positioned within a container <b>1710</b>. A thermal transfer agent <b>1630</b>, such as a thermally conductive potting agent is placed substantially around the inductor <b>230</b> inside the container <b>1710</b>. The thermally conductive potting agent is any material, compound, or mixture used to transfer heat away from the inductor <b>230</b>, such as a resin, a thermoplastic, and/or an encapsulant. Optionally, one or more cooling lines <b>1730</b> run through the thermal transfer agent. The cooling lines <b>1730</b> optionally wrap <b>1732</b> the inductor <b>230</b> in one or more turns to form a cooling coil and/or pass through <b>1734</b> the inductor <b>230</b> with one or more turns. Optionally, a coolant runs through the coolant line <b>1730</b> to remove heat to a radiator <b>1740</b>. The radiator is optionally attached to the housing <b>1710</b> or is a stand alone unit removed from the housing. A pump <b>1750</b> is optionally positioned anywhere in the system to move the coolant sequentially through a cooling line input <b>1742</b>, through the cooling line <b>1730</b> to pick up heat from the inductor <b>230</b>, through a cooling line output <b>1744</b>, through the radiator <b>1740</b> to dissipate heat, and optionally back into the pump <b>1750</b>. Generally, the thermal transfer agent <b>1630</b> facilitates movement of heat, relative to air around the inductor <b>230</b>, to one or more of: a heat sink <b>1640</b>, the cooling line <b>1730</b>, to the housing <b>1710</b>, and/or to the ambient environment.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0172">The thermally conductive potting agent optionally exhibits any appropriate characteristics, such as a high thermal transfer coefficient; resistance to fissure when the mass of the inductor/conductor system has a large internal temperature change, such as greater than about 50, 100, or 150 degrees Centigrade; flexibility so as not to fissure with temperature variations, such as greater than 100 degrees Centigrade, in the potting mass; low thermal impedance between the inductor <b>230</b> and heat dissipation elements; sealing characteristics to seal the inductor assembly from the environment such that a unit can conform to various outdoor functions, such as exposure to water and salts; and mechanical integrity for holding the heat dissipating elements and inductor <b>230</b> together as a single module at high operating temperatures, such as up to about 150 or 200 degrees Centigrade. Examples of potting materials include: an electrical insulating material, a polyurethane; a urethane; a multi-part urethane; a polyurethane; a multi-component polyurethane; a polyurethane resin; a resin; a polyepoxide; an epoxy; a varnish; an epoxy varnish; a copolymer; a thermosetting polymer; a thermoplastic; a silicone based material; Conathane&#xae; (Cytec Industries, West Peterson, N.J.), such as Conathane EN-2551, 2553, 2552, 2550, 2534, 2523, 2521, and EN 7-24; Insulcast&#xae; (ITW Insulcast, Roseland, N.J.), such as Insulcast 333; Stycast&#xae; (Emerson and Cuming, Billerica, Mass.), such as Stycast 281; and epoxy varnish potting compound. Potting material is optionally mixed with silica sand or aluminum oxide, such as at about thirty to seventy percent, for example about forty-five percent silica sand or aluminum oxide by volume; to create a potting compound with lower thermal impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0173">Inductor Cooling Line</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0174">In yet another example, an oil/coolant immersed inductor cooling system is provided. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, an expanded view example of a liquid cooled induction system <b>1800</b> is provided. In the illustrated example, an inductor <b>230</b> is placed into a cooling liquid container <b>1810</b>. The container <b>1810</b> is preferably enclosed, but at least holds an immersion coolant. The immersion coolant is preferably in direct contact with the inductor <b>230</b> and/or the windings of the inductor <b>230</b>. Optionally, a solid heat transfer material, such as the thermally conductive potting compound described supra, is used in place of the liquid immersion coolant. Optionally, the immersion coolant directly contacts at least a portion of the core <b>610</b> of the inductor <b>230</b>, such as near the input terminal and/or the output terminal. Further, the container <b>1810</b> preferably has mounting pads designed to hold the inductor <b>230</b> off of the inner surface of the container <b>1810</b> to increase coolant contact with the inductor <b>230</b>. For example, the inductor <b>230</b> preferably has feet that allow for immersion coolant contact with a bottom side of the inductor <b>230</b> to further facilitate heat transfer from the inductor to the cooling fluid. The mounting feet are optionally placed on a bottom side of the container to facilitate cooling air flow under the container <b>1810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0175">Heat from a circulating coolant, separate from the immersion coolant, is preferably removed via a heat exchanger. In one example, the circulating coolant flows through an exit path <b>1744</b>, through a heat exchanger, such as a radiator <b>1740</b>, and is returned to the container <b>1810</b> via a return path <b>1742</b>. Optionally a fan is used to remove heat from the heat exchanger. Typically, a pump <b>1750</b> is used in the circulating path to move the circulating coolant.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0176">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the use of the circulating fluid to cool the inductor is further described. Optionally, the cooling line is attached to a radiator <b>1740</b> or outside flow through cooling source. Circulating coolant optionally flows through a cooling coil:

    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0177">circumferentially surrounding or making at least one cooling line turn <b>1820</b> or circumferential turn about the outer face <b>416</b> of the inductor <b>230</b> or on an inductor edge;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0178">forming a path, such as an about concentrically expanding upper ring <b>1830</b>, with subsequent turns of the cooling line forming an upper cooling surface about parallel to the inductor front face <b>418</b>;</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0179">forming a path, such as an about concentrically expanding lower ring <b>1840</b>, with subsequent turns of the cooling line forming a lower cooling surface about parallel to the inductor back face <b>419</b>; and</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0180">a cooling line running through the inductor <b>230</b> using a non electrically conducting cooling coil or cooling coil segment.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0181">Optionally, the coolant flows sequentially through one or more of the expanding upper ring <b>1830</b>, the cooling line turn <b>1820</b>, and the expanding lower ring <b>1840</b> or vise-versa. Optionally, parallel cooling lines run about, through, and/or near the inductor <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0182">Coolant/Inductor Contact</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0183">In yet still another example, referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, heat is transferred from the inductor <b>230</b> to a heat transfer solution <b>1920</b> directly contacting at least part of the inductor <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0184">In one case, the heat transfer solution <b>1920</b> transfers heat from the inductor <b>230</b> to an inductor housing <b>1910</b>. In this case, the inductor housing <b>1910</b> radiates the heat to the surrounding environment, such as through a heat sink <b>1640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0185">In another case, the inductor <b>230</b> is in direct contact with the heat transfer solution <b>1920</b>, such as partially or totally immersed in a non-conductive liquid coolant. The heat transfer solution <b>1920</b> absorbs heat energy from the inductor <b>230</b> and transfers a portion of that heat to a cooling line <b>1730</b> and/or a cooling coil and a coolant therein. The cooling line <b>1730</b>, through which a coolant flows runs through the heat transfer solution <b>1920</b>. The coolant caries the heat out of the inductor housing <b>1910</b> where the heat is removed from the system, such as in a heat exchanger or radiator <b>1740</b>. The heat exchanger radiates the heat outside of the sealed inductor housing <b>1910</b>. The process of heat removal transfer allows the inductor <b>230</b> to maintain an about steady state temperature under load.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0186">For instance, an inductor <b>230</b> with an annular core, a doughnut shaped inductor, an inductor with a toroidal core, or a substantially circular shaped inductor is at least partially immersed in an immersion coolant, where the coolant is in intimate and direct thermal contact with a magnet wire, a winding coating, or the windings <b>610</b> about a core of the inductor <b>230</b>. Optionally, the inductor <b>230</b> is fully immersed or sunk in the coolant. For example, an annular shaped inductor is fully immersed in an insulating coolant that is in intimate thermal contact with the heated magnet wire heat of the toroid surface area. Due to the direct contact of the coolant with the magnet wire or a coating on the magnet wire, the coolant is substantially non-conducting.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0187">The immersion coolant comprises any appropriate coolant, such as a gas, liquid, gas/liquid, or suspended solid at any temperature or pressure. For example, the coolant optionally comprises: a non-conducting liquid, a transformer oil, a mineral oil, a colligative agent, a fluorocarbon, a chlorocarbon, a fluorochlorocarbon, a deionized water/alcohol mixture, or a mixture of non-conducting liquids. Less preferably, the coolant is de-ionized water. Due to pinholes in the coating on the magnet wire, slow leakage of ions into the de-ionized water results in an electrically conductive coolant, which would short circuit the system. Hence, if de-ionized water is used as a coolant, then the coating should prevent ion transport. Alternatively, the de-ionized cooling water is periodically filtered and/or changed. Optionally, an oxygen absorber is added into the coolant, which prevents ozonation of the oxygen due the removal of the oxygen from the coolant.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0188">The inductor <b>230</b> is optionally separated from an at least partially enclosing container with one or more spacers. The spacers are optionally configured with an aperture therethrough to allow circulation of the coolant or an airflow about the inductor <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0189">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the inductor housing <b>1910</b> optionally encloses two or more inductors <b>230</b>. The inductors <b>230</b> are optionally vertically mounted using mounting hardware <b>422</b> and a clamp bar <b>234</b>. The clamp bar optionally runs through the two or more inductors <b>230</b>. An optional clamp bar post <b>423</b> is positioned between the inductors <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0190">Chill Plate</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0191">Often, an inductor <b>230</b> in an electrical system is positioned in industry in a sensitive area, such as in an area containing heat sensitive electronics or equipment. In an inductor <b>230</b> cooling process, heat removed from the inductor <b>230</b> is typically dispersed in the local environment, which can disrupt proper function of the sensitive electronics or equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0192">In yet still another example, a chill plate is optionally used to minimize heat transfer from the inductor <b>230</b> to the local surrounding environment, which reduces risk of damage to surrounding electronics. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, one or more inductors <b>230</b> are placed into a heat transfer medium. Moving outward from an inductor, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> is described in terms of layers. In a first layer about the inductor, a thermal transfer agent is used, such as an immersion coolant <b>1920</b>, described supra. Optionally, the heat transfer medium is a solid, a semi-solid, or a potting compound, as described supra. In a second layer about the immersion coolant, a heat transfer interface <b>2010</b> is used. The heat transfer interface is preferably a solid having an inner wall interface <b>2012</b> and an outer wall interface <b>2014</b>. In a third layer, a chill plate is used. In one case, the chill plate is hollow and/or has passages to allow flow of a circulating coolant. In another case, the chill plate contains cooling lines <b>1730</b> through which a circulating coolant flows. An optional fourth layer is an outer housing or air.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0193">In use, the inductor <b>230</b> generates heat, which is transferred to the immersion coolant. The immersion coolant transfers heat to the heat transfer interface <b>2010</b> through the inner wall surface <b>2012</b>. Subsequently, the heat transfer interface <b>2010</b> transfers heat through the outer wall interface <b>2014</b> to the chill plate. Heat is removed from the chill plate through the use of the circulating fluid, which removes the heat to an outside environment removed from the sensitive area in the local environment about the inductor <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0194">Cooling Multiple Inductors</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0195">In yet another example, the cooling system optionally simultaneously cools multiple inductors <b>230</b>. For instance, a series of two or more inductor cores of an inductor/converter system are aligned along a single axis, where a single axis penetrates through a hollow geometric center of each core. A cooling line or a potting material optionally runs through the hollow geometric center.</p>

<p id="p-0189" num="0217">In one example, a substantially annular inductor core <b>610</b> is rotated about an axis passing through a center opening of the inductor.
