<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Printer users, especially graphic arts professionals, rely on consistent and accurate color reproduction. To the human eye, the appearance of a printed color image changes depending upon the characteristics of the light illuminating the image. To optimize color reproduction of a printer, device specific color profiles are used to transform print jobs into physical printed images. A given printer's color profile reflects various characteristics. Those characteristics include the type of colorant used to form printed images, the type of media on which the image is formed, and the illumination under which the printed output is to be viewed. Thus, to optimize color reproduction, a color profile designed for the viewing illuminant, the printer's ink, and the print media is identified and then utilized to form printed color images.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Colorant and media types are easily identifiable. An illuminant is not. Often, a printer's color profile simply presumes a standard viewing illuminant such as D50. Other printers allow a user to select a color profile that corresponds to a desired illuminant manually identified by the user. If the user cannot identify the illuminant, the user can purchase an external sensor such as a spectrophotometer to measure and identify the illuminant of the environment in which the printed output is to be viewed. Such a procedure is not user friendly and can prove expensive.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Utilizing an integrated spectrophotometer, a printer analyzes colors formed on a print medium. The analysis typically involves comparing measured colors against intended colors. Based on the analysis, the printer identifies a color profile for accurately and consistently transform color information from a print job into the device's own local color space. The color profile typically accounts and/or corrects for various characteristics including, for example, the type of colorants and the type of print media being used. An example of a standardized device color profile format is provided by the International Color Consortium (ICC).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The particular illumination under which an image is viewed affects an individual's perception of color. In other words, the same printed color can appear different under different lighting conditions. As a consequence, a color profile also takes into account a viewing illuminant. Often the viewing illuminant is presumed to be D50. Such a presumption is often not optimal and many times undesirable. Various embodiment discussed below utilize a printer's integrated spectrophotometer to identify an illuminant and a color profile for use in producing color output.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The following description is broken into sections. The first, labeled &#x201c;Environment,&#x201d; describes exemplary printer in which embodiments may be implemented. The second section, labeled &#x201c;Components&#x201d; describes various physical and logical components utilized to implement various embodiments. The third section, labeled as &#x201c;Operation&#x201d;, describes steps taken to implement various embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Environment:</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts exemplary printer <b>10</b> in which embodiments may be implemented. While printer <b>10</b> is depicted as a large format color printer, embodiments may be implemented in color printers of other types. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, printer <b>10</b> is shown to include body <b>12</b>, colorant supply <b>14</b>, user interface <b>16</b>, and front cover <b>18</b>. Body <b>12</b> represents the physical shell that encompasses internal printing components (seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of printer <b>10</b>. Colorant sources <b>14</b> represent generally containers storing different colorants used by printer <b>10</b> to form color images. In the Example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, colorant sources <b>14</b> are designed to hold ink. In other examples, colorant sources might contain toner or other substances for forming color images. User interface <b>16</b> represents generally one or more physical controls through which a user is able to provide instructions to printer <b>10</b>. Front cover <b>18</b> represents generally a portion of body that can be repositioned to expose internal printing components of printer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, front cover <b>18</b> has been opened to reveal internal printing components identified as carriage <b>20</b>, print heads <b>22</b>, and color sensor <b>24</b>. Carriage <b>20</b> represents generally a component designed to hold print heads <b>22</b> while being moved back and forth along a carriage path (CP). Print heads <b>22</b> represent generally components designed to selectively dispense colorants on a print medium being urged along media path (MP). Color sensor <b>24</b> represents generally a component configured to measure color characteristics of images formed by print head <b>22</b> on a print medium. In a particular example, color sensor <b>24</b> is a spectrophotometer capable of being utilized to measure a power spectral distribution. In the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, color sensor <b>24</b> is coupled to carriage <b>20</b>. In other example, color sensor <b>24</b> may be a stationary component positioned within body <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> are partial side schematic views of printer <b>10</b> depicting internal printing components <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>, and <b>24</b> and print media <b>26</b> traveling along media path (MP). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, color sensor <b>24</b> is operating in a first mode. Color sensor <b>24</b>, depicted as a spectrophotometer, includes light source <b>28</b> and spectrometer <b>30</b>. Light source <b>28</b> includes light source <b>28</b><i>a </i>and projection optics <b>28</b><i>b</i>. Projection optics <b>28</b><i>b </i>are configured to focus light from source <b>28</b><i>a </i>onto a target on print medium <b>26</b>. Spectrometer <b>30</b> includes collection optics <b>30</b><i>a </i>and sensor <b>30</b><i>b</i>. Collection optics <b>30</b><i>a </i>are configured to collect light reflected from the target on print medium <b>26</b> and communicate the reflected light onto sensor <b>30</b><i>b</i>. Sensor <b>30</b><i>b</i>, for example, may include a number of filtered sensors each designed to produce a response with respect to a particular range of wavelengths. Thus, the integrated output from the sensor <b>30</b><i>b </i>represents the power spectral distribution of the collected reflected light and can be used to accurately identify the color of the target.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Moving to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, front cover <b>18</b> has been opened to allow color sensor <b>24</b> to operate in a second mode. With front cover <b>18</b> open, ambient light <b>32</b> is allowed to enter printer body <b>12</b>. Light source <b>28</b> is turned off, and spectrometer collects and measures ambient light <b>32</b>. As noted above, sensor <b>30</b><i>b </i>can include a number of filtered sensors each designed to produce a response with respect to a particular range of wavelengths. Thus, sensor <b>30</b><i>b </i>produces an output that measures the power spectral distribution of ambient light <b>32</b>. Using the output from color sensor <b>24</b>, a particular illuminant serving as a source of the ambient light can be identified and used to identify an appropriate color profile for printer <b>10</b>. The term &#x201c;identify&#x201d; as it is used with respect to a color profile can mean recognizing an existing profile that corresponds to the identified illuminant. It can also mean generating a color for the identified illuminant. The term &#x201c;illuminant&#x201d; as used herein can refer to a single illuminant or to a combination of illuminants.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Components:</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram depicting an example of the various physical and logical components of printer <b>10</b> capable of identifying and utilizing a color profile for the ambient illuminant of an environment in which printer <b>10</b> is placed. Printer <b>10</b> is depicted to include print engine <b>40</b>, color sensor <b>24</b>, user interface <b>16</b>, and controller <b>46</b>. Print engine <b>40</b> represents generally the physical components designed to form printed images on a medium. Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, such components can include carriage <b>20</b>, print heads <b>22</b>, colorant supplies <b>14</b> and the like. Color sensor <b>24</b> represents generally the physical component designed to produce an output that measures the color of a target. Such a target, for example, may be a printed patch formed print engine <b>40</b> on a print medium. The output of color sensor <b>24</b> can be a measure of a power spectral distribution of light collected by the sensor. User interface <b>16</b> represents the physical components such as buttons, touch screens, and the like through which a user communicates instructions to printer <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Controller <b>46</b> represents generally a combination of hardware and programming configured to communicate signals to and receive signals from print engine <b>40</b>, color sensor <b>24</b>, and user interface <b>16</b>. Described in more detail with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, controller <b>46</b> is responsible for determining an operational mode of color sensor <b>24</b>. In a first mode, controller <b>46</b> utilizes color sensor <b>24</b> to measure a color a target formed by print engine <b>40</b> on a print medium. In a second mode, controller <b>46</b> utilizes color sensor <b>24</b> to identify an illuminant of an environment in which printer <b>10</b> placed. The operational mode of color sensor <b>24</b> may be set by a user interacting with user interface <b>16</b>. By default, controller <b>46</b> may identify color sensor <b>24</b> as operating in the first mode. Manipulation of user interface <b>16</b> may later be interpreted by controller <b>46</b> to cause color sensor <b>24</b> to operate in the second mode.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a block diagram depicting the physical and logical components of controller <b>46</b>. As shown controller <b>46</b> includes processor <b>48</b> and memory <b>50</b>. Processor <b>48</b> represents generally any process capable of executing program instruction stored in memory <b>50</b>. Execution of those instructions causes processor <b>48</b> to interact, at least indirectly, with print engine <b>40</b>, color sensor <b>24</b>, and user interface <b>16</b> instructing those components to perform selected tasks. Such tasks include causing color sensor <b>24</b> to measure ambient light and utilizing a color profile for the ambient light to cause print engine <b>40</b> to form a desired image utilizing a on a print medium.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, memory <b>50</b> is shown to include profile data <b>52</b>, print service <b>54</b>, sensor service <b>56</b>, and profile service <b>58</b>. Profile data <b>52</b> includes one or more color profiles as well as data used to identify a color profile. For example, such data may be used to identify a color profile that corresponds to a particular illuminant. Print service <b>54</b> represents program instructions for causing print engine <b>40</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to form desired color images on a print medium. When executed by processor <b>48</b>, print service <b>54</b> utilizes an identified color profile from color profile data <b>50</b> to form color images. That is, print service <b>54</b> receives a color print job and utilizes the identified color profile to map colors of the print job to the color space of the printer. In this manner, the colors reproduced by the printer are accurate representations of the colors in the print job.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Sensor service <b>56</b> represents program instructions for causing color sensor <b>24</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> to collect light so that characteristics of the collected light can be measured and used to identify a color profile. In a first operational mode, the collected light is light reflected from a selected target often formed on a print medium. In a second operational mode, the collected light is ambient light. Color sensor <b>24</b> can be positioned within the body of a printer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> provide examples. As such, the ambient light collected in the second mode originates from an illuminant present in the environment in which the printer is placed and enters the printer body to reach color sensor <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, color sensor <b>24</b> may be a spectrophotometer that includes a light source and a spectrometer. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> provide an example. When operating in the first mode, sensor service <b>56</b> causes the light source to emit light onto the target. That light reflects from the target and is collected by the spectrometer. When operating in the second mode, sensor service <b>56</b> prevents the light source from emitting light allowing the spectrometer to collect ambient light entering the printer body through an opening such as front cover <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Profile service <b>58</b> represents program instructions for processing the output of color sensor <b>24</b> to measure characteristics of the collected light and to identify a color profile based on the measured characteristics. When executed by processor <b>48</b>, profile service <b>58</b> interacts with sensor service <b>56</b>. Through that interaction, color sensor <b>24</b> is caused to collect light. Profile service <b>58</b> processes output from color sensor <b>24</b> to measure characteristics of the collected light. In the first operational mode, the measured characteristics are those of light reflected from a target. In the second operational mode, the measured characteristics are those of ambient light reaching color sensor <b>24</b>. Based on the particular operational mode and the measured characteristics of the collected light, profile service updates color profile data <b>52</b> accordingly. The update may involve recognizing an existing color profile contained in color profile data <b>52</b> for use by print service <b>54</b>. The update may include generating a color profile and adding it to color profile data <b>52</b> for use by print service <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As noted above, color sensor <b>24</b> may be a spectrophotometer that includes a light source and a spectrometer. In such a case, the characteristics measured by profile service <b>58</b> are a power spectral distribution of the collected light. In the second operational mode, profile service <b>58</b> may identify a color profile in a number of manners. In a first such example, profile service <b>58</b> interacts with sensor service <b>56</b> to cause color sensor <b>24</b> to collect light in at least two instances. In both instances sensor service <b>56</b> prevents the light source from emitting light. In one instance, sensor service <b>56</b> causes the spectrometer to close a shutter preventing any light from being collected, and profile service <b>58</b> measures a first power spectral distribution. In another instance, sensor service <b>56</b> causes the spectrometer to open the shutter allowing the ambient light to be collected, and profile service <b>58</b> measures a second power spectral distribution. Profile service <b>58</b> then identifies a color profile based on a third power spectral distribution that is a function of the first and second power spectral distributions. In particular, that function may involve subtracting the first distribution from the second.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In a second example, color sensor <b>24</b> is positioned adjacent to a media path within a printer body. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> provide an example. Again, color sensor <b>24</b> is a spectrophotometer that includes a light source and a spectrometer. Profile service <b>58</b> interacts with sensor service <b>56</b> to cause color sensor <b>24</b> to collect light in at least two instances. In one instance, sensor service <b>56</b> allows the light source to emit light. The emitted light is reflected from one of a print medium and a platen positioned in the media path. The reflected light is collected by the spectrometer. From the output of the spectrometer, profile service <b>58</b> measures a first power spectral distribution. In another instance, sensor service <b>56</b> prevents the light source from emitting light allowing only ambient light entering the printer body to be collected by the spectrometer. From the output of the spectrometer, profile service <b>58</b> measures a second power spectral distribution. Profile service <b>58</b> then identifies a color profile based on a third power spectral distribution that is a function of the first and second power spectral distributions. In particular, that function may involve subtracting the first distribution from the second.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a chart depicting a power spectral distribution <b>60</b> measured during a second operational mode. In other words, distribution <b>60</b> is representative of ambient light entering a printer body. As one can see, distribution <b>60</b> peaks at about 488 nm, 545 nm, and 612 nm. Such is representative of fluorescent lighting. Thus, profile data <b>52</b> may associate peaks of a given power spectral distribution with a known illuminant or combination of illuminants. Profile service <b>58</b> accesses profile data <b>52</b> to identify an illuminant associated with the peaks of a given distribution and then identifies a color profile for the identified illuminant to be used by print service <b>54</b>.</p>
