<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART STATEMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a technology for controlling the progress of a match game in which a group composed of a head character and a follower character which acts in accordance with action instructions of the head character competes with another team.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In actual baseball games, if a manager is not skillful or not experienced, famous players with high ability, veteran players and the like often seem to act on their own judgment without following instructions of the manager. On the other hand, such as when a manager is skillful or experienced in leading a team to win the title, even famous players and veteran players have a respect for the manager and have a higher tendency to act in accordance with the manager's instructions. In actual baseball, such a subtle power relationship between players and a manager is one important element which influences the atmosphere of a team and the players' play and livens up a game. Accordingly, if such an element that players act or do not act as instructed by a manager in view of a power relationship between the players and the manager is incorporated into a baseball game, it is thought that reality of the baseball game is increased and the baseball game can be made more interesting and enjoyable.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">On the other hand, although a game player plays a game as a manager in some of conventional baseball games, it is limited to merely give certain instructions to players as the manager and a relationship between the manager and the players is not particularly considered. For example, JP2001-137555 discloses a match game using a communication line. In paragraphs [0023] to [0026] of this publication, it is disclosed that a command can be selected as a manager and a game player can enjoy a game as if he were a manager or the like and also that the command can be selected at least at one of the following timings; every game, for each opponent, every inning, every pitch, for each pitcher, every at-bat, for each batter and for each runner. Note that patent literature 1 further discloses that a game property is improved by incorporating real-world information.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in patent literature 1, after a game player as a manager selects a command, a game progresses merely in accordance with the command and a subtle power relationship between the players and the manager as described above and the like are not considered there.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An object of the present invention is to provide a game control system, a recording medium, a game control method and the like for realizing a nonconventional game into which such an element that another character acts or does not act as instructed by one character in accordance with a power relationship of the one character and the other character is incorporated.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">One aspect of the present invention is directed to a game control device for controlling the progress of a match game in which a group composed of a head character and a follower character which acts in accordance with action instructions of the head character competes with another group in a game space, comprising a follower character controlling unit for determining an action instruction to be given to the follower character by the head character in accordance with an operation command entered by a game player using an operation unit and causing the follower character to act in accordance with the determined action instruction; a first evaluation value setting unit for setting a first evaluation value used to evaluate a management ability of the head character to manage the follower character; a second evaluation value setting unit for setting a second evaluation value used to evaluate the follower character based on an ability value indicating an ability of the follower character; an evaluation difference value calculating unit for calculating an evaluation difference value indicating a difference between the first and second evaluation values when the first evaluation value is lower than the second evaluation value; and a head character management ability setting unit for setting a management ability value used to reflect the management ability on the match game based on the evaluation difference value, the head character management ability setting unit changing the management ability value to reduce the management ability of the head character as the evaluation difference value increases.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Another aspect of the present invention is directed to a computer-readable recording medium storing a game control program for causing a computer to function as a game control system for controlling the progress of a match game in which a group composed of a head character and a follower character which acts in accordance with action instructions of the head character competes with another group in a game space, wherein the computer is caused to function as a follower character controlling unit for determining an action instruction to be given to the follower character by the head character in accordance with an operation command entered by a game player using an operation unit and causing the follower character to act in accordance with the determined action instruction; a first evaluation value setting unit for setting a first evaluation value used to evaluate a management ability of the head character to manage the follower character; a second evaluation value setting unit for setting a second evaluation value used to evaluate the follower character based on an ability value indicating an ability of the follower character; an evaluation difference value calculating unit for calculating an evaluation difference value indicating a difference between the first and second evaluation values when the first evaluation value is lower than the second evaluation value; and a head character management ability setting unit for setting a management ability value used to reflect the management ability on the match game based on the evaluation difference value, the head character management ability setting unit changing the management ability value to reduce the management ability of the head character as the evaluation difference value increases.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Still another aspect of the present invention is directed to a game control method by which a computer controls the progress of a match game in which a group composed of a head character and a follower character which acts in accordance with action instructions of the head character competes with another group in a game space, the method comprising a follower character controlling step in which the computer determines an action instruction to be given to the follower character by the head character in accordance with an operation command entered by a game player using an operation unit and causes the follower character to act in accordance with the determined action instruction; a first evaluation value setting step in which the computer sets a first evaluation value used to evaluate a management ability of the head character to manage the follower character; a second evaluation value setting step in which the computer sets a second evaluation value used to evaluate the follower character based on an ability value indicating an ability of the follower character; an evaluation difference value calculating step in which the computer calculates an evaluation difference value indicating a difference between the first and second evaluation values when the first evaluation value is lower than the second evaluation value; and a head character management ability setting step in which the computer sets a management ability value used to reflect the management ability on the match game based on the evaluation difference value, the management ability value being changed to reduce the management ability of the head character as the evaluation difference value increases in the head character management ability setting step.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from an embodiment described with reference to accompanying drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Next, the respective constituent elements shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are described. The graphic data generation processor <b>3</b> functions as a coprocessor, so to speak, of the CPU <b>1</b>. That is, the graphic data generation processor <b>3</b> performs coordinate transformation and light source calculation, e.g. calculation of fixed-point matrixes and vectors by a parallel processing.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Main processings performed by the graphic data generation processor <b>3</b> include a processing of calculating address data of a processing target image on a specified display area based on coordinate data, movement amount data and rotation amount data of vertices of image data supplied from the CPU <b>1</b> in a two-dimensional or three-dimensional space and returning the calculated address data to the CPU <b>1</b>, a processing of calculating the luminance of an image according to a distance from a virtually set light source, and other processings.</p>

The expansion processing includes a decoding processing (decoding of data encoded by a VLC (Variable Length Code)), an inverse quantization processing, an IDCT (Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform) processing, a processing of restoring an intra image, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The imaging processor <b>10</b> performs an imaging processing on the buffer <b>14</b> in accordance with an imaging command issued by the CPU <b>1</b> every predetermined time interval T (e.g. one frame T= 1/60 second).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The buffer <b>14</b> is, for example, composed of a RAM and divided into a display area (frame buffer) and a non-display area. The display area is composed of a development area of image data to be displayed on a display surface of the television monitor <b>21</b>. The non-display area is composed of a storage area for data defining skeletons, model data defining polygons, animation data for causing models to move, pattern data indicating the contents of respective animations, texture data and color palette data and other data.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Here, texture data is two-dimensional image data. The color palette data is data for designating the colors of the texture data and the like.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Imaging commands include an imaging command for imaging a solid image using polygons and an imaging command for imaging a normal two-dimensional image. Here, polygons are polygonal two-dimensional virtual figures. For example, triangular or rectangular polygons are used.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">An imaging command for imaging a solid image using polygons is given for polygon vertex address data indicating stored positions of polygon vertex coordinate data on the display area of the buffer <b>14</b>, texture address data indicating stored positions of textures to be attached to the polygons on the buffer <b>14</b>, color pallet address data indicating stored positions of color palette data indicating the colors of the textures on the buffer <b>14</b> and luminance data indicating the luminances of the textures.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Out of the above data, the polygon vertex address data on the display area are polygon vertex coordinate data in the two-dimensional space permutated by coordinate transformation of the polygon vertex coordinate data in the three-dimensional space from the CPU <b>1</b> based on movement amount data and rotation amount data by the graphic data generation processor <b>3</b>. The luminance data is determined by the graphic data generation processor <b>3</b> based on a distance from a position indicated by the polygon vertical coordinate data from the CPU <b>1</b> after the coordinate transformation to a virtually arranged light source.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The polygon vertex address data indicates an address on the display area of the buffer <b>14</b>.

This baseball game is such that an own team (an example of a group) composed of a manager character (an example of a head character) and player characters (an example of follower characters) which act in accordance with action instructions of the manager character competes with another team (an example of another group) in a game space.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">This baseball game is a breeding-type baseball game in which a manager character as a virtual self of a player is bred. That is, the game player increases a manager evaluation value (an example of a first evaluation value) used to evaluate a management ability of the manager character and breeds the manager character by causing his own team compete with another team and win. Player characters include a pitcher character, a batter character and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in this baseball game, a pitcher character CL<b>2</b> throws a ball object BL and a batter character CL<b>1</b> hits the ball object BL with a bat object BT.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In this baseball game, in offense, the game player moves a meet cursor K displayed in an outer frame WK indicating a strike zone on the display screen, positions the meet cursor K to the ball object BL when the ball object BL reaches the vicinity of a home base and enters a hit command by maneuvering the controller <b>19</b>.

<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Next, main functions of the game system in the case of playing a baseball game using the game system constructed as described above are described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram showing main functions of the game system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">An operation unit <b>410</b> is composed of the controller <b>19</b> and the like and receives various operation commands which are necessary as the game player proceeds with the game. The operation commands include a move command, a hit command, a pitch command and action instruction commands and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The move command is an operation command which is entered when the game player is in offense to move the meet cursor K shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> on the display screen of a display unit <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Here, the game player enters the move command, for example, by inclining the left stick <b>19</b>SL or the right stick <b>19</b>SR. A move command signal corresponding to the move command and output from the operation unit <b>410</b> includes information indicating an inclined direction of the left stick <b>19</b>SL or the right stick <b>19</b>SR.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The hit command is an operation command which is entered when the game player is in offense to determine a timing of hitting the ball object BL. The game player enters the hit command, for example, by depressing any one of the first to fourth buttons <b>19</b><i>a </i>to <b>19</b><i>d</i>. The pitch command is an operation command which is entered when the player is in defense to cause the pitcher character CL<b>2</b> to throw the ball object BL.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The action instruction command is an operation command for causing a player character to act in accordance with an action instruction of the manager character, and this is a command simulating an instruction given by a manager to a player by means of a sign or orally in actual baseball.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In this baseball game, there are action instruction commands to be entered when the player is in offense and those to be entered when the player is in defense.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The action instruction commands to be entered when the player is in defense include &#x201c;base steal intention/aggressive&#x201d;, &#x201c;base steal intention/normal&#x201d;, &#x201c;base steal intention/passive&#x201d;, &#x201c;base steal intention/ground-and-go&#x201d;, &#x201c;defensive shift/double play aimed&#x201d;, &#x201c;defensive shift/bunt cautious&#x201d;, &#x201c;defensive shift/intermediate defense&#x201d;, &#x201c;defensive shift/drawn-in defense&#x201d;, &#x201c;defensive shift/drawn-in outfielder&#x201d;, &#x201c;defensive shift/extra-base hit cautious&#x201d;, &#x201c;intentional walk&#x201d;, &#x201c;bastard play&#x201d;, &#x201c;base steal cautious&#x201d;, &#x201c;squeeze cautious&#x201d;, &#x201c;pitching policy/strike prioritized&#x201d;, &#x201c;pitching policy/cautious&#x201d;, &#x201c;pitching policy/strikeout oriented&#x201d; and &#x201c;pitching policy/ground ball out&#x201d;. These action instruction commands are entered by the game player, for example, immediately before a pitch command is entered.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">All, any one or some of these action instruction commands fall under use limited commands. A use limited command is a command, a use number of which is limited in one match (one game). In this embodiment, there are a plurality of use limited commands. A use number per game is assigned to the game player at the start of the game and decremented by 1 every time any one of the use limited commands is used once. When the use number becomes 0, the game player can no longer use any of the use limited commands. Note that this is only an example and a use number per game may be individually set for each use limited command and the use numbers of the respective use limited commands may be individually managed.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The display unit <b>420</b> is composed of the television <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and displays various images under the control of a control unit <b>430</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The control unit <b>430</b> is composed of the CPU <b>1</b>, the graphic data generation processor <b>3</b> and the like shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and includes a player character selecting unit <b>431</b>, a selection number managing unit <b>432</b>, a character controlling unit <b>433</b> (an example of a follower character controlling unit), a manager evaluation value setting unit <b>434</b> (an example of a first evaluation value setting unit), a player evaluation value setting unit <b>435</b> (an example of a second evaluation value setting unit), an evaluation difference value calculating unit <b>436</b>, a management ability setting unit <b>437</b> (an example of a head character management ability setting unit) and a condition setting unit <b>438</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">This baseball game is a baseball game simulating a professional baseball. Accordingly, the game player selects favorite player characters out of the plurality of predetermined player characters simulating actual professional baseball players to organize his own team. Further, the player character selecting unit <b>431</b> sets nine player characters as starting members out of the player characters constituting the own team in accordance with selection commands entered by the game player to select the starting members.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The selection number managing unit <b>432</b> individually manages a selection number value of each player character selected by the player character selecting unit <b>431</b> from the first match of the game player's team to the present. Specifically, the selection number managing unit <b>432</b> stores the selection number value corresponding to each player character for each separate game player in a selection number storage unit <b>451</b> and, when a certain player character is selected, updates the selection number value of this player character by incrementing it by 1. In this way, even if a plurality of game players select the same player character in the same game system, the selection number values of the respective player characters can be managed for each separate game player. As described later, the higher the selection number value is, the higher an assumed degree of pseudo-intimacy with the manager character is and the more a change rate of a management ability value determined according to an evaluation difference value between the player character and the manager character is relaxed if a player evaluation value is higher than a manager evaluation value.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The character controlling unit <b>433</b> determines an action instruction to be given to the player character by the manager character in accordance with an action instruction command the game player entered by maneuvering the operation unit <b>410</b>, and causes the player character to act in accordance with the determined action instruction.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Here, the character controlling unit <b>433</b> may read image data of the player character as an action target from a character information storage unit <b>452</b>, cause the read image data to make a predetermined movement corresponding to the action instruction command in a game space, and display the player character in an animated manner on the display unit <b>420</b> by performing rendering.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Further, the character controlling unit <b>433</b> determines a hit timing from an entry timing of a hit command when the hit command is entered to the operation unit <b>410</b> and judges that the batter character CL<b>1</b> succeeded in hitting if the ball object BL overlaps the meet cursor K at the determined hit timing. Then, the character controlling unit <b>433</b> determines the speed and trajectory of the hit ball object BL based on an ability value of the batter character CL<b>1</b> and the overlapping position of the ball object BL and the meet cursor K. Then, the character controlling unit <b>433</b> causes the display unit <b>420</b> to display the batter character CL<b>1</b> in an animated manner such that the batter character CL<b>1</b> displayed on the display unit <b>420</b> hits the ball object BL with the bat object BT. Further, the character controlling unit <b>433</b> causes the display unit <b>420</b> to display the ball object BL in an animated manner such that the ball object BL moves in accordance with the determined trajectory.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">For example, if the game player enters an action instruction command &#x201c;sacrifice bunt&#x201d; when in offense, the character controlling unit <b>433</b> determines by lottery whether or not the batter character CL<b>1</b> presently up at the batter's box will succeed in sacrifice bunt in accordance with an instruction accomplishment rate of this batter character CL<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When determining a success in sacrifice bunt by lottery, the character controlling unit <b>433</b> determines a hit timing from an entry timing of a hit command entered by the game player and causes the batter character CL<b>1</b> to make a sacrifice bunt if the ball object BL overlaps the meet cursor K at the determined hit timing. Then, the character controlling unit <b>433</b> determines the speed and trajectory of the hit ball object BL from the ability value of the batter character CL<b>1</b> and the overlapping position of the ball object BL and the meet cursor K.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The manager evaluation value setting unit <b>434</b> sets a manager evaluation value (an example of a first evaluation value) used to evaluate a management ability of the manager character to manage the player characters. Here, the manager evaluation value setting unit <b>434</b> updates the manager evaluation value by increasing the present manager evaluation value stored in a manager evaluation value storage unit <b>453</b> by specified points if the game player wins a match against another team. On the other hand, the manager evaluation value setting unit <b>434</b> does not increase the present manager evaluation value if the team of the game player loses the match against another team. However, this is only an example and the manager evaluation value setting unit <b>434</b> may set an increase in the manager evaluation value when the team of the game player wins a match against another team larger than an increase in the manager evaluation value when the team of the game player loses a match against another team and increase the manager evaluation value every time the game is played.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Note that the manager evaluation value setting unit <b>434</b> sets a default value as the manager evaluation value before the game player starts the first game. 0 may be adopted or a predetermined value larger than 0 may be adopted as the default value.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The player evaluation value setting unit <b>435</b> sets player evaluation values used to evaluate the player characters based on ability values indicating abilities of the player characters. Here, the player evaluation value setting unit <b>435</b> increases the ability values of the player characters according to action results of the player characters and accordingly increases the player evaluation values regardless of whether the team wins or loses the match against another team.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">There are three ability values of power, running skill and defensive skill. The ability value in power is an ability value to specify a hitting skill of the player character by a numerical value such as 20 or 100. Accordingly, if a player character with a large ability value in power succeeds in hitting, the moving speed of the hit ball object BL is set to be fast and there is a higher probability of extra-base hit. For pitcher characters CL<b>2</b>, the ability value in power is an ability value to specify the speed of the thrown ball object BL. Thus, the moving speed of the ball object BL of a pitcher character CL<b>2</b> with a large ability value in power is faster than that of a pitcher character CL<b>2</b> with a smaller ability value in power.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The ability value in running skill is an ability value to specify the running speed of a player character by a numerical value such as 20 or 100. Accordingly, a player character with a high running skill has a higher probability of hitting an infield hit and a higher probability of succeeding in base steal.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The ability value in defensive skill is an ability value to specify the skill of a player character in defense by a numerical value such as 20 or 100. Accordingly, a player character with a high defensive skill has a higher probability of making a good play such as jumping and catching the hit ball object BL.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The player evaluation value setting unit <b>435</b> tallies action results of each player character and increases the ability values in power, running skill and defensive skill by specified points based on the tallied action results, for example, when one game ends. For example, if a certain player character had a hit such as single, double or triple or had a home run, the ability value in power of this player character is increased by specified points according to the number of hits or home runs. Further, if a certain player character succeeded in base steal, the ability value in running skill of this player character is increased by specified points according to the number of successful base steals. Furthermore, if a certain player character succeeded in catching a grounder or fly, the ability value in defensive skill of this player character is increased by specified points according to the number of successful catches.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In this way, the ability values of each player character are increased according to the number of successes in action regardless of the outcome of the game. Since cumulative values from the game player's first game to the present are adopted as these ability values, the game player can individually breed not only the manager character, but also the respective player characters. This can make the game player feel attached to the respective player characters and make the game more interesting and enjoyable.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">The player evaluation value setting unit <b>435</b> calculates the player evaluation value used to evaluate each player character from the ability values in power, running skill and defensive skill and stores them in a player evaluation value storage unit <b>454</b>. Here, a value which increases in a stepwise manner according to, for example, an average value of the ability values in power, running skill and defensive skill is, for example, adopted as the player evaluation value. Alternatively, a value which increases in a stepwise manner according to a weighted average value of the ability values in power, running skill and defensive skill using predetermined weight values is adopted as the player evaluation value. Accordingly, the player evaluation value increases as the ability values in power, running skill and defensive skill increase, and a degree of growth of the player character can be known from the player evaluation value. Note that default values corresponding to characteristics of each player character are set as the ability values in power, running skill and defensive skill before the game player plays the first match. For example, a default value of the ability value in power larger than that of an ordinary player character is set for a player character with a high hitting skill.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Note that the player evaluation values are preferably normalized to align a range thereof with that of the manager evaluation value. In this case, a manager evaluation value is obtained by dividing the manager evaluation value calculated as described above by a maximum possible value of the manager evaluation value.

<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The evaluation difference value calculating unit <b>436</b> calculates an evaluation difference value indicating a difference between the manager evaluation value and the player evaluation value when the present manager evaluation value of the manager character stored in the manager evaluation value storage unit <b>453</b> is smaller than the present player evaluation value stored in the player evaluation value storage unit <b>454</b>. Here, the evaluation difference value calculating unit <b>436</b> calculates an evaluation difference value when a process for determining a use limited command use number, an instruction accomplishment rate determining process and a condition setting process to be described later are performed.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The management ability setting unit <b>437</b> sets a management ability value used to reflect the management ability of the manager character on the match game based on the evaluation difference value. Here, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> changes the management ability value to reduce the management ability of the manager character as the evaluation difference value increases. The management ability value includes an instruction accomplishment rate, a command use number decrease value and a condition decrease probability.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The instruction accomplishment rate indicates a probability that an action result of the player character which acts in accordance with an action instruction command ends in success. Here, the larger the evaluation difference value is, the lower the instruction accomplishment rate is set. Thus, in the case of giving an action instruction to the player character having a player evaluation value higher than the manager evaluation value, there is a high probability that the action of this player character ends in failure.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Here, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> determines the instruction accomplishment rate by referring to an instruction accomplishment rate determination table stored in a management ability determining information storage unit <b>455</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a table showing an example of data configuration of an instruction accomplishment rate determination table TB<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the instruction accomplishment rate is understood to decrease as the evaluation difference value increases. Thus, if the manager character gives an action instruction to a player character having a player evaluation value higher than the manager evaluation value of the manager character, this player character does not act in accordance with the action instruction, whereby the management ability of the manager character can be reflected on the match game.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">For example, in the first row record, an instruction accomplishment rate of 90% is set for an evaluation difference value of 1. Thus, if the manager character gives an action instruction to a player character having a player evaluation value higher than the manager evaluation value by 1, the instruction accomplishment rate is set at 90%. In this way, the character controlling unit <b>433</b> sets the instruction accomplishment rate at 90%, determines whether or not the player character accomplishes this action instruction by a lottery processing and causes the player character to act in accordance with a lottery result.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">On the other hand, if the manager character gives an action instruction to a player character having a player evaluation value lower than the manager evaluation value, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> does not set any instruction accomplishment rate. Thus, the character controlling unit <b>433</b> causes the player character to act in accordance with the action instruction of the manager character with a probability of 100%. If a default instruction accomplishment rate is set in an action instruction command, the character controlling unit <b>433</b> may determine an instruction accomplishment rate of a player character by multiplying an instruction accomplishment rate set by the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> by the default instruction accomplishment rate. This enables the default instruction accomplishment rate to decrease according to the instruction accomplishment rate set in the management ability setting unit <b>437</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The command use number decrease value indicates a decrease value when the use number of the use limited commands per game is reduced. In this baseball game, the use number of the use limited commands per game is specified beforehand.

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the use limited command decrease value is understood to increase as the evaluation difference value increases.

<p id="p-0111" num="0110">The management ability setting unit <b>437</b> sets the use limited command use number at 10&#x2212;1=9 if the default use number of the use limited commands is, for example, 10 when the evaluation difference value is 1.

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Here, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> may specify player characters having a player evaluation value higher than the manager evaluation value out of the player characters selected by the player character setting unit <b>431</b> and used in the match game, calculate evaluation difference values for the respective specified player characters, and specify the total value of the calculated evaluation difference values as an evaluation difference value used in setting the use limited command decrease value.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Thus, if the game player organizes his team by the player characters having a higher player evaluation value than the manager evaluation value, the use limited command use number is reduced. Therefore, a limitation is imposed on the selection of the player characters having higher player evaluation values than the manager evaluation value and a reduction in the management ability of the manager character can be reflected on the match game.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The condition decrease probability indicates a probability of reducing the present condition of the player character set by the condition setting unit <b>438</b> to a predetermined level.

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The condition setting unit <b>438</b> sets the condition of each player character selected by the player character setting unit <b>431</b> at the time of starting one game. Here, there are five conditions: top condition, good condition, normal condition, bad condition and very bad condition.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The condition setting unit <b>438</b> performs a lottery processing for each player character and determines one condition out of these five conditions. Then, the condition setting unit <b>438</b> increases or decreases the present ability values of the player character by a predetermined increase/decrease value according to the one determined condition. For example, if the condition level is normal, the increase/decrease value is 0. Thus, the present ability values of the player character are adopted as they are. Further, if the condition level is good, the increase/decrease value is &#x201c;+&#x3b1;1&#x201d;. Thus, the present ability values of the player character are increased by &#x3b1;1. Further, if the condition level is bad, the increase/decrease value is &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x3b1;1&#x201d;. Thus, the present ability values of the player character are decreased by &#x3b1;1.

<p id="p-0127" num="0126">First, when a selection command is entered by the game player to select a player character using the operation unit <b>410</b> (YES in Step S<b>1</b>), the selected player character is selected to become a member of the team of the game player (Step S<b>2</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Here, the control unit <b>430</b> prompts the game player to select the player character by causing the display unit <b>420</b> to display a list of selectable player characters.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">On the other hand, if the game player does not enter any selection command (NO in Step S<b>1</b>), the process returns to Step S<b>1</b>. Subsequently, the selection number managing unit <b>432</b> increments a selection number value indicating the selection number of the player character selected in Step. S<b>2</b> from the first match to the present by 1 (Step S<b>3</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Subsequently, the evaluation difference value calculating unit <b>436</b> specifies the present player evaluation value of the player character selected in Step S<b>2</b> by reading it from the player evaluation value storage unit <b>454</b> (Step S<b>4</b>). Subsequently, the evaluation difference value calculating unit <b>436</b> reads a manager evaluation value of a manager character of the game player from the manager evaluation value storage unit <b>453</b> and specifies the present manager evaluation value (Step S<b>5</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Subsequently, the evaluation difference value calculating unit <b>436</b> judges whether or not the player evaluation value of the player character selected in Step S<b>2</b> is higher than the manager evaluation value (Step S<b>6</b>). Then, the evaluation difference value calculating unit <b>436</b> calculates an evaluation difference value by subtracting the manager evaluation value from the player evaluation value (Step S<b>7</b>) if player evaluation value&#x3e;manager evaluation value (YES in Step S<b>6</b>), i.e. the manager character does not have a management ability capable of managing the player character. The calculated evaluation difference value is temporarily stored in the buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">On the other hand, the evaluation difference value calculating unit <b>436</b> skips the processing in Step S<b>7</b> if the player evaluation value of the player character selected in Step S<b>2</b> is equal to or lower than the manager evaluation value (NO in Step S<b>6</b>), i.e. the manager character has a management ability capable of managing the player character.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Subsequently, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> returns the process to Step S<b>1</b> if the number of the selected player characters has not reached an upper limit value yet (NO in Step S<b>8</b>) and causes the game player to enter a selection command to select another player character. On the other hand, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> advances the process to Step S<b>9</b> if the number of the selected player characters has reached the upper limit value (YES in Step S<b>8</b>). That is, the player character selecting unit <b>431</b> causes the game player to select the player characters until the number of the player characters constituting the team of the game player reaches a specified number.

<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In Step S<b>9</b>, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> calculates the total value of the evaluation difference values stored in the buffer.

<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Subsequently, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> determines a use limited command decrease value corresponding to the total value of the evaluation difference values calculated in Step S<b>9</b> by referring to the decrease value determination table TB<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> (Step S<b>10</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Subsequently, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> reads the selection number values of the respective player characters, for which the evaluation difference values were calculated, from the selection number storage unit <b>451</b>, obtains a relaxing value of the use limited command decrease value determined in Step S<b>10</b> according to the read selection number values and corrects the use limited command decrease value by subtracting the relaxing value from the use limited command decrease value (Step S<b>11</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In this case, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> may specify the player character having the maximum selection number value out of the player characters, for which the evaluation difference values were calculated, and specify a relaxing value predetermined according to the selection number value of this player character. Here, the relaxing value is specified using the selection number value of the player character having the maximum selection number value because the use limited commands are set not for the individual player characters, but for one game played by the game player and need to be set based on a specific certain standard. Note that the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> may specify the relaxing value using the selection number value of the player character having the minimum selection number value or may specify the relaxing value using an average value of the selection number values of the player characters, for which the evaluation difference values were calculated.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Specifically, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> specifies the relaxing value using the relaxing value specification table TB<b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. The relaxing value specification table TB<b>4</b> includes a field of the selection number value and a field of the relaxing value. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the relaxing value is set to increase as the selection number value increases. In an example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the relaxing value is 1 when the selection number value is equal to or above 10 and below 15 and the relaxing value is 2 when the selection number value is equal to or above 15 and below 20. In this way, the relaxing value increases in a stepwise manner according to the selection number value. Further, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the relaxing value is 10 when the selection number value is equal to or above 55 and does not increase any further. However, numerical values shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> are merely an example and different numerical values may be adopted as needed. For example, the relaxing value may be specified using a function such as a linear function or a quadratic function of increasing the relaxing value as the selection number value increases instead of using the relaxing value specification table TB<b>4</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Although the relaxing value does not increase any further with the selection number value of 55 or above in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, it may increase even with the selection number value of 55 or above. Further, the relaxing value specification table TB<b>4</b> may be so set that the relaxing value continuously increases relative to the selection number value.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">For example, the selection number value of the player character having the maximum selection number value is assumed to be 16. Then, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> specifies the relaxing value to be 2 by referring to the relaxing value specification table TB<b>4</b>. If the use limited command decrease value determined in Step S<b>10</b> is 4,4&#x2212;2=2 is calculated as the use limited command decrease value after correction, thereby relaxing the use limited command decrease value.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">If the use limited command decrease value is determined to be 1 by referring to the decrease value determination table TB<b>2</b> in Step S<b>10</b> and the relaxing value is determined to be 2 by referring to the relaxing value specification table TB<b>4</b> in Step S<b>11</b>, the use limited command decrease value after correction is calculated to be 1&#x2212;2=&#x2212;1 which is equal to or below &#x2212;1. If the use limited command decrease value after correction is &#x2212;1 or less as in this case, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> may set the use limited command decrease value at 0.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">By correcting the use limited command decrease value according to the selection number value in this way, the game player can be motivated to continue to use a certain player character. By continuing to use a certain player character, the game player can be made to feel attached to this player character, whereby the game can be made more interesting and enjoyable.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Subsequently, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> sets the use limited command use number by subtracting the use limited command decrease value corrected in Step S<b>11</b> from the default use number of the use limited commands per game (Step S<b>12</b>). The game player can use the use limited commands the use number of times set in Step S<b>12</b> in a subsequent game. In the above example, a value of 2 is calculated as the use limited command decrease value in Step S<b>11</b>. Accordingly, if the default use number of the use limited commands is 10, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> sets 10&#x2212;2=8 as the use limited command use number. In this case, the game player can use the use limited commands only eight times less than ten times as the default use number by two times.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Although the use limited command decrease value is corrected according to the selection number value in Step S<b>11</b>, it may be corrected according to the manager evaluation value of the manager character without being limited to this. In this case, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> may correct the use limited command decrease value by referring to a relaxing value specification table TB<b>5</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The relaxing value specification table TB<b>5</b> includes a field of the manager evaluation value and a field of the relaxing value. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the relaxing value is set to increase as the manager evaluation value increases. In an example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the relaxing value is 1 when the manager evaluation value is equal to or above 100 and below 110 and the relaxing value is 2 when the manager evaluation value is equal to or above 110 and below 120. In this way, the relaxing value increases in a stepwise manner according to the manager evaluation value. Further, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the relaxing value is 10 when the manager evaluation value is equal to or above 220 and does not increase any further. However, numerical values shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> are merely an example and different numerical values may be adopted as needed. For example, the relaxing value may be specified using a function such as a linear function or a quadratic function of increasing the relaxing value as the manager evaluation value increases instead of using the relaxing value specification table TB<b>5</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. Although the relaxing value does not increase any further with the manager evaluation value of 220 or above in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, it may increase even with the manager evaluation value of 220 or above. Further, the relaxing value specification table TB<b>5</b> may be so set that the relaxing value continuously increases relative to the manager evaluation value.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">For example, the manager evaluation value is assumed to be 115. Then, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> specifies the relaxing value to be 2 by referring to the relaxing value specification table TB<b>5</b>. If the use limited command decrease value determined in Step S<b>10</b> is 4, 4&#x2212;2=2 is calculated as the use limited command decrease value after correction, thereby relaxing the use limited command decrease value.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Since the use limited command decrease value is relaxed as the manager evaluation value increases in this way if the manager evaluation value reaches a given value (100 in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>), the game player can be motivated to increase the manager evaluation value by winning the match, whereby the game can be made more interesting and enjoyable.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a flow chart of the instruction accomplishment rate determining process. The instruction accomplishment rate determining process is performed for each determined player character after the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is performed to determine the player characters constituting the team and before the start of the game.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">First, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> sets the player character, for which the instruction accomplishment rate is to be calculated, out of the player characters selected by the game player (Step S<b>21</b>). Here, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> may set the player character as a calculation target according to an order of selection by the game player.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">Subsequently, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> reads the player evaluation value of the player character set as the calculation target from the player evaluation value storage unit <b>454</b> and specifies the present player evaluation value of the player character (Step S<b>22</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Subsequently, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> reads the manager evaluation value from the manager evaluation value storage unit <b>453</b> and specifies the present manager evaluation value of the manager character (Step S<b>23</b>). Subsequently, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> judges whether or not the player evaluation value is higher than the manager evaluation value (Step S<b>24</b>) and advances the process to Step S<b>25</b> because an instruction accomplishment rate needs to be determined for this player character if player evaluation value&#x3e;manager evaluation value (YES in Step S<b>24</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">On the other hand, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> advances the process to Step S<b>28</b> because the instruction accomplishment rate needs not be determined for this player character if the player evaluation value is equal to or below the manager evaluation value (NO in Step S<b>24</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Subsequently, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> calculates an evaluation difference value by subtracting the manager evaluation value from the player evaluation value (Step S<b>25</b>). Subsequently, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> determines an instruction accomplishment rate corresponding to the evaluation difference value by referring to the instruction accomplishment rate determination table TB<b>1</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> (Step S<b>26</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Subsequently, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> corrects the instruction accomplishment rate according to the selection number value of the player character (Step S<b>27</b>). Here, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> determines a relaxing value for the instruction accomplishment rate predetermined according to the selection number value of the player character and corrects the instruction accomplishment rate by adding the relaxing value to the instruction accomplishment rate determined in Step S<b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">In this case, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> may specify the relaxing value using the data of the relaxing value specification table TB<b>4</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the relaxing value is set to increase as the selection number value increases. Although the relaxing value specification table TB<b>4</b> is used in setting a number for suppressing the use limited command decrease value, the data of this table can also be used to correct the instruction accomplishment rate.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">For example, the selection number value of a certain player character is assumed to be 16. Then, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> specifies the relaxing value to be 2 by referring to the relaxing value specification table TB<b>4</b>. In the case of correcting the instruction accomplishment rate, a numerical value obtained by multiplying this relaxing value by a predetermined coefficient (e.g. 1.5) is set as a relaxing value. If the instruction accomplishment rate determined in Step S<b>26</b> is assumed to be 80, an instruction accomplishment rate after correction is calculated to be 80+3=83, whereby the instruction accomplishment rate is slightly increased.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Although the relaxing value specification table TB<b>4</b> is used above for the correction of the instruction accomplishment rate, a table used to correct the instruction accomplishment rate may be separately provided as a matter of course.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">This increases the instruction accomplishment rate of the player character having a large selection number value, with the result that a probability of failing action instructions of the manager character decreases. Accordingly, the game player can be motivated to continue to use a certain player character and made to feel attached to this player character, whereby the game can be made more interesting and enjoyable.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">If the instruction accomplishment rate becomes larger than 100 as a result of adding the relaxing value to the instruction accomplishment rate determined in Step S<b>26</b>, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> may set the instruction accomplishment rate after correction at 100.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Subsequently, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> ends the process if all the player characters selected by the game player are set as calculation targets (YES in Step S<b>28</b>). On the other hand, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> returns the process to Step S<b>21</b> to set the next player character as the calculation target unless all the player characters selected by the game player are set as the calculation targets (NO in Step S<b>28</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">Although the instruction accomplishment rate is corrected according to the selection number value in Step S<b>27</b>, it may be corrected according to the manager evaluation value of the manager character without being limited to this.

In this way, the game player can be motivated to increase the manager evaluation value by winning the match, whereby the game can be made more interesting and enjoyable.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow chart showing the condition setting process. The condition setting process is performed for each determined player character after the process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is performed and before the game is started. Since processings in Steps S<b>31</b> to S<b>35</b> are the same as those in Steps S<b>21</b> to S<b>25</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, they are not described. In Step S<b>36</b>, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> determines a condition decrease probability corresponding to the evaluation difference value by referring to the condition decrease probability determination table TB<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">Subsequently, the management ability setting unit <b>437</b> corrects the condition decrease probability determined according to the evaluation difference value according to the use number value of the player character (Step S<b>37</b>).

<p id="p-0162" num="0161">For example, the selection number value of a certain player character is assumed to be 16.

If the condition decrease probability determined in Step S<b>36</b> is 20, 20&#x2212;2=18 is calculated as the condition decrease probability after correction and the condition decrease probability is slightly decreased. Note that, similar to a technique described with respect to the instruction accomplishment rate, the data of the relaxing value specification table TB<b>4</b> may be converted by being multiplied by a predetermined coefficient and data after conversion may be used as a relaxing value instead of using the data of the relaxing value specification table TB<b>4</b> as it is.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Thus, if the use number value is large even if the player character has a higher player evaluation value than the manager evaluation value, the condition decrease probability becomes lower than that determined by the condition decrease probability determination table TB<b>3</b> and a probability that the condition becomes a very bad condition is relaxed.

<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Note that the condition decrease probability may be corrected according to the manager evaluation value of the manager character in Step S<b>37</b>.

<p id="p-0167" num="0166">On the other hand, the condition setting unit <b>438</b> performs the lottery processing again (Step S<b>40</b>) and sets the condition of the player character at any one of the five conditions from the top condition to the very bad condition (Step S<b>41</b>) if the result of the lottery processing in Step S<b>38</b> does not indicate a very bad condition (NO in Step S<b>39</b>). Here, the condition setting unit <b>438</b> may randomly determine one condition out of the five conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Subsequently, the condition setting unit <b>438</b> determines the ability values of the player character by increasing or decreasing the ability values of the player character by an increase/decrease value corresponding to the set condition (Step S<b>42</b>).</p>

<p id="p-0170" num="0169">If all the player characters are set as calculation targets in Step S<b>44</b> (YES in Step S<b>44</b>), the process ends.

<p id="p-0171" num="0170"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart showing the evaluation value setting process.

First, if the game player wins the match (YES in Step S<b>51</b>), the manager evaluation value setting unit <b>434</b> increases the manager evaluation value by specified points (Step S<b>52</b>). On the other hand, if the game player loses the match (NO in Step S<b>51</b>), the manager evaluation value setting unit <b>434</b> advances the process to Step S<b>53</b> without increasing the manager evaluation value.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">In Step S<b>53</b>, the player evaluation value setting unit <b>435</b> increases the ability values (power, running skill and defensive skill) of each player character from a tally value of action results of the action instruction commands of each player character in the game that ended.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Subsequently, the player evaluation value setting unit <b>435</b> determines the player evaluation value of each player character according to the ability values increased in Step S<b>53</b> (Step S<b>54</b>).

<p id="p-0174" num="0173"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a flow chart showing a process of the game system when a baseball game is started and the battery character CL<b>1</b> hits the ball object BL. This flow chart shows a process when the player is in offense and the game system is in defense. First, in Step S<b>61</b>, the control unit <b>430</b> performs initialization by reading the image data such as the meet cursor K, the batter character CL<b>1</b>, the ball object BT, a background image of a baseball stadium, a pitcher character CL<b>2</b>, fielder characters and the like from the character information storage <b>452</b> and causing the display unit <b>420</b> to display them. In this case, an image as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is, for example, displayed on the display unit <b>420</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Subsequently, when an action instruction command is entered by the game player (YES in Step S<b>62</b>), the control unit <b>430</b> performs a lottery processing with a lottery probability indicated by the instruction accomplishment rate set for each player character and determines whether or not to cause the player character to accomplish the action instruction command (Step S<b>63</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Subsequently, the control unit <b>430</b> sets a trajectory of the ball object BL, causes the pitcher character CL<b>2</b> to throw the ball object BL and causes the display unit <b>420</b> to display the ball object BL to move along the set trajectory (Step S<b>64</b>) when a predetermined pitching start timing is reached. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the ball object BL is displayed to move from the pitcher character CL<b>2</b> toward the home base.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Subsequently, when the operation unit <b>410</b> receives the entry of a hit command from the game player (YES in Step S<b>65</b>), the control unit <b>430</b> determines a hit timing from the entry timing of the hit command and judges whether or not the batter character CL<b>1</b> could hit the ball object BL based on whether or not the meet cursor K overlaps the ball object BL at the hit timing (Step S<b>66</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Subsequently, the control unit <b>430</b> determines the speed and trajectory of the ball object BL after hitting from the ability value in power of the batter character CL<b>1</b> and the overlapping position of the meet cursor K and the ball object BL and causes the ball object BL to be displayed to move in accordance with the determined speed and trajectory (Step S<b>67</b>) if judging that the batter character CL<b>1</b> could hit the ball object BL (YES in Step S<b>66</b>). In this case, the ability value in power determined by the condition setting process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is adopted as the ability value in power.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Subsequently, the control unit <b>430</b> causes the batter character CL<b>1</b> and related player characters to act (S<b>69</b>) if the lottery result in Step S<b>63</b> indicates that &#x201c;the batter character CL<b>1</b> is caused to act in accordance with the action instruction command&#x201d; (YES in Step S<b>68</b>). For example, if the action instruction command is to squeeze, the batter character CL<b>1</b> is caused to squeeze and the player character on the third base is caused to reach home. In this way, actions in accordance with the action instruction command are made by the player characters.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">On the other hand, if the lottery result in Step S<b>63</b> indicates that &#x201c;the batter character CL<b>1</b> is not caused to act in accordance with the action instruction command&#x201d; (NO in Step S<b>68</b>), the control unit <b>430</b> does not cause the batter character CL<b>1</b> and related player characters to act (Step S<b>70</b>).

<p id="p-0181" num="0180">If the game player does not enter any hit command (NO in Step S<b>65</b>), i.e. the batter character CL<b>1</b> looks the ball object BL, a look processing of causing the display unit <b>420</b> to display, for example, an image in which the catcher character catches the ball object BL is performed (Step S<b>71</b>).</p>

However, the reduction of the use limited condition use number and/or the reduction of the conditions of the player characters may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Further, although the above embodiment is described, taking the baseball game as an example, the present invention may also be applied to a soccer game, a hockey game, a rugby game, an American football game or the like without being limited to this. That is, the present invention relates to a breeding type match game in which a manager character as a virtual self of a game player is bred and is applicable to a match game in which player characters act under instructions of a manager character.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">Technical features of the above game control system is summarized as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">(1) The above game system is a game control system for controlling the progress of a match game in which a group composed of a head character and a follower character which acts in accordance with action instructions of the head character competes with another group in a game space and includes a follower character controlling unit for determining an action instruction to be given to the follower character by the head character in accordance with an operation command entered by a game player using an operation unit and causing the follower character to act in accordance with determined the action instruction; a first evaluation value setting unit for setting a first evaluation value used to evaluate a management ability of the head character to manage the follower character; a second evaluation value setting unit for setting a second evaluation value used to evaluate the follower character based on an ability value indicating an ability of the follower character; an evaluation difference value calculating unit for calculating an evaluation difference value indicating a difference between the first and second evaluation values when the first evaluation value is lower than the second evaluation value; and a head character management ability setting unit for setting a management ability value used to reflect the management ability on the match game based on the evaluation difference value, the head character management ability setting unit changing the management ability value to reduce the management ability of the head character as the evaluation difference value increases.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">According to this construction, if the first evaluation value used to evaluate the management ability of the head character (e.g. manager character in a baseball game) is lower than the second evaluation value specified from the ability value of the follower character (e.g. player character in a baseball game), the evaluation difference value indicating the difference between the two evaluation values is calculated. The management ability value used to reflect the management ability of the head character on the game is changed to reduce the management ability as this evaluation difference value increases.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Accordingly, if the game player uses a follower character having a higher evaluation value than the head character, a probability that the follower character acts without following the action instruction of the head character increases. Thus, an unpredictable element that a player does not act in accordance with an instruction of a manager according to a power relationship between the manager and the player as in actual baseball can be incorporated into the game, and it is possible to provide a nonconventional and highly interesting and enjoyable game.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">(2) The head character management ability setting unit preferably reduces an instruction accomplishment rate of the follower character in response to an action instruction of the head character as the evaluation difference value increases.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">According to this construction, the instruction accomplishment rate of the follower character is reduced if the evaluation value of the head character is lower than that of the follower character. Thus, if the head character gives an action instruction to the follower character having a higher evaluation value than the head character, a probability that an action of the follower character in response to this action instruction ends in failure increases. Therefore, a reduction in the management ability of the head character can be effectively reproduced.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">(3) Preferably, the first evaluation value setting unit increases the first evaluation value in the case of victory in the match against the other group; and the head character management ability setting unit relaxes a change rate of the management ability value determined according to the evaluation difference value as the first evaluation difference value increases.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">According to this construction, the change rate of the management ability value determined according to the evaluation difference value is relaxed when the first evaluation value is high and the head character has a high management ability. Thus, if the head character having a high management ability gives an action instruction to the follower character having a higher evaluation value than the head character, a probability that the follower character acts in accordance with the action instruction increases as compared with the case where the head character having a low management ability gives an action instruction to the follower character having a higher evaluation value than the head character. This can clearly motivate the game player to increase the evaluation value of the head character by winning the match (e.g. to improve the ability of the manager character by winning many times in the baseball game), whereby the game can be made more interesting and enjoyable.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Further, since it is necessary to reduce a difference in the evaluation value between the head character and the follower character and increase the evaluation value of the head character to cause an excellent follower character having a high evaluation value to act as instructed, the game player can be clearly motivated to win the match against the other group, whereby the game can be made more interesting and enjoyable.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">(4) Preferably, there are a plurality of follower characters; the game control system further includes a follower character selecting unit for selecting the follower character to be used in the match game out of the plurality of follower characters in accordance with a selection command from the game player and a selection number managing unit for managing a selection number indicating how many times the follower character has been selected by the follower character selecting unit for each follower character; and the head character management ability setting unit relaxes a change rate of the management ability value determined according to the evaluation difference value more for the follower character having a larger selection number.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">According to this construction, even if the head character gives an action instruction to the follower character having a higher evaluation value than the head character, the change rate of the management ability value is relaxed if the selection number indicating selection of the follower character by the game player is large. A case where this construction is incorporated into a baseball game is specifically described as an example. In the present invention, when a manager character uses a player character having a high ability, this player character may not possibly follow an instruction of the manager character. Even in this case, a degree of pseudo intimacy between the manager character and the player character is assumed to be high and a probability that the player character does not follow an instruction of the manager character is reduced if the manager character has selected this player character as a starting member or a game participating member many times. This can motivate the game player to repeatedly select a specific follower character and make the game player feel attached to this follower character, whereby the game can be made more interesting and enjoyable.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">(5) Preferably, the operation command includes a use limited command, a use number of which in one match game is limited beforehand; and the head character management ability setting unit reduces the use number of the use limited command as the evaluation difference value increases.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">According to this construction, since the use number of the use limited command is reduced if the game player gives an instruction to the follower character having a higher evaluation value than the head character, a limitation is imposed on the use of the follower character having a large evaluation value than the head character and a reduction in the management ability of the head character can be naturally reflected on the game.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">(6) Preferably, the game control system further includes a condition setting unit for increasing or decreasing the ability value of the follower character to virtually show a condition of the follower character in starting one match game; and the head character management ability setting unit increases a probability of reducing the ability value of the follower character by the condition setting unit according to the evaluation difference value.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">According to this construction, if the head character gives an instruction to the follower character having a higher evaluation value than the head character, a probability of reducing the ability value of the follower character is increased and a reduction in the management ability of the head character can be effectively reflected.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">(7) The second evaluation value setting unit increases the ability value of the follower character according to an action result of the follower character regardless of the outcome of the match against the other group.</p>
