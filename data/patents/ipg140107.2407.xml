<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0010">Chain carbonates such as DEC are easily decomposed and cause easily gas production as compared with cyclic carbonates. Since the non-aqueous electrolyte described in Patent Literature 1 has a large proportion of DEC, a large amount of gas is produced along with decomposition of DEC during storage at high temperatures and during charge and discharge cycles. Thus, high-temperature storage characteristics and charge and discharge cycle characteristics of the battery are deteriorated readily. Since the non-aqueous electrolyte of Patent Literature 2 also uses DEC as the main solvent, a large amount of gas is produced along with decomposition of DEC during storage at high temperatures and during charge and discharge cycles.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0011">Therefore, in view of suppressing gas production during storage at high temperatures and during charge and discharge cycles while ensuring favorable low-temperature characteristics, the present invention provides a non-aqueous electrolyte in which proportion of DEC is reduced, and a non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery using the same that has high safety.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0023">The non-aqueous electrolyte of the present invention includes a non-aqueous solvent and a solute dissolved in the non-aqueous solvent. The non-aqueous solvent includes a mixed solvent A of ethylene carbonate (EC), propylene carbonate (PC), and diethyl carbonate (DEC), and a low-viscosity solvent B which serves to adjust viscosity, as an additive.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0024">A conventional non-aqueous electrolyte including DEC as the main solvent permits favorable low-temperature characteristics. However, since proportion of DEC included in the non-aqueous solvent is large, oxidative decomposition and reductive decomposition of DEC occur in the positive electrode and the negative electrode during storage at high temperatures and during charge and discharge cycles, and gases such as CO, CO<sub>2</sub>, CH<sub>4</sub>, and C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>may be produced greatly.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0025">In order to solve the above problem, the present invention reduces relatively the proportion of DEC in the non-aqueous solvent, by adding cyclic carbonates of PC and EC which have high oxidation potential and which are difficult to be decomposed by oxidation, as compared with chain carbonates such as DEC.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0026">Meanwhile, when the weight ratio of EC in the non-aqueous solvent including EC, PC, and DEC is relatively large, oxidative decomposition of EC occurs particularly in the positive electrode, and a large amount of gases such as CO and CO<sub>2 </sub>is produced. Further, when the weight ratio of EC is excessively large, an excessive coating film is formed on the negative electrode, which lowers charge acceptance and facilitates deposition of Li.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0027">Therefore, in the present invention a weight ratio W<sub>PC </sub>of PC to the total of the non-aqueous electrolyte is made relatively larger, being 15 to 60 wt %. By increasing relatively the weight ratio W<sub>PC </sub>of PC, oxidative decomposition and reductive decomposition of DEC, and oxidative decomposition of EC can be suppressed notably. The weight ratio W<sub>PC </sub>of PC is preferably 25 to 60 wt %, more preferably 30 to 50 wt %.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0028">Further, since PC (melting point: &#x2212;49&#xb0; C.) has a lower melting point than EC (melting point: 37&#xb0; C.), in one aspect, PC is advantageous in terms of the low-temperature characteristics of the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery. That is, by increasing relatively the weight ratio W<sub>PC </sub>of PC, the low-temperature characteristics of the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery can be improved while production of gases originating from DEC and EC can be suppressed favorably.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0029">However, since the viscosity of PC is higher than the viscosities of EC and DEC, the viscosity of the non-aqueous electrolyte increases when the amount of PC increases.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0030">When the non-aqueous electrolyte having a large amount of PC is used and charged in a low temperature environment, Li may be deposited on the negative electrode. When the battery in which Li is deposited on the surface of the negative electrode is stored in a high temperature environment, the defect of abnormal heat production in the battery may be caused because of the deposited Li.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0031">Also, when the viscosity of the non-aqueous electrolyte increases, lithium-ion conductivity may decline at low temperatures, causing the defect of deterioration in the rate characteristics of the battery at low temperatures.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0032">Therefore, the non-aqueous electrolyte of the present invention includes the low-viscosity solvent B as the additive that can solve the above defects. Consequently, production of gases originating from EC and DEC can be suppressed and the low-temperature characteristics of the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery can be improved, while also enabling suppression of defects which occur due to a large amount of PC can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0033">In recent years, the safety standard required of non-aqueous electrolyte secondary batteries is extremely high. For example, there is a test in which a battery overcharged at a low temperature of about &#x2212;5&#xb0; C. is heated deliberately to about 130&#xb0; C. By using the non-aqueous electrolyte of the present invention, high safety can be obtained in such a test.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0034">The low-viscosity solvent B is a fluorinated aromatic compound (fluorine-containing aromatic compound) having a molecular weight of 90 to 200, or a fatty acid alkyl ester having a molecular weight of 80 to 240. These substances can be used singly or in combination of two or more. By using the low-viscosity solvent B, the viscosity of the non-aqueous electrolyte having a large amount of PC can be decreased notably. Thus, the rate characteristics at low temperatures can be improved. Also, deposition of Li on the negative electrode surface caused during the charge at low temperatures can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0035">The low-viscosity solvent B is a solvent having a viscosity (25&#xb0; C.) of 1 mPa&#xb7;s or less. The viscosity (25&#xb0; C.) of the fluorinated aromatic compound having a molecular weight of 90 to 200 is 0.3 to 1 mPa&#xb7;s. The viscosity (25&#xb0; C.) of the fatty acid alkyl ester having a molecular weight of 80 to 240 is 0.3 to 1 mPa&#xb7;s.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0036">By setting the molecular weight of the fluorinated aromatic compound to 200 or less (viscosity of 1 mPa&#xb7;s or less), the viscosity of the non-aqueous electrolyte can be reduced sufficiently. By setting the molecular weight of the fluorinated aromatic compound to 90 or more (viscosity of 0.3 mPa&#xb7;s or more), the fluorinated aromatic compound cannot be decomposed easily, which ensures sufficiently the stability of the non-aqueous electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0037">By setting the molecular weight of the fatty acid alky ester to 240 or less (viscosity of 1 mPa&#xb7;s or less), the viscosity of the non-aqueous electrolyte can be reduced sufficiently. By setting the molecular weight of the fatty acid alkyl ester to 80 or more (viscosity of 0.3 mPa&#xb7;s or more), the fatty acid alkyl ester cannot be decomposed easily, which ensures sufficiently the stability of the non-aqueous electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0038">The viscosity of the non-aqueous electrolyte (25&#xb0; C.) is preferably 3 to 7 mPa&#xb7;s. Thus, deterioration of the rate characteristics at low temperatures can be suppressed. Also, deposition of Li during the charge in a low temperature environment can be suppressed. The viscosity is measured by using a rotational viscometer, and a spindle of a cone-plate type.</p>

Therefore, even when Li is deposited on the negative electrode surface due to overcharge in a low temperature environment, abnormal heat production in the battery in a high temperature environment can be suppressed.

<p id="p-0049" num="0049">Among these compounds, ethyl propionate, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate, methyl pentanoate, or ethyl pentanoate is particularly preferable because the effect of improved low-temperature rate characteristics can be obtained notably.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0050">It is preferable to use both the fluorinated aromatic compound and the fatty acid alkyl ester because the effect improved heat stability can be obtained notably with the fluorinated aromatic compound, and the effect of improved low-temperature rate characteristics can be obtained with the fatty acid alkyl ester.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0053">A weight ratio W<sub>EC </sub>of EC is 5 to 30 wt %, preferably 5 to 20 wt % to the total of the non-aqueous electrolyte. In this case, production of gas originating from oxidative decomposition of EC reduces and an appropriate coating film is formed on the negative electrode, which improves greatly the charge and discharge capacity and the rate characteristics of the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery. By setting the weight ratio of EC to 5 wt % or more, a coating film (SEI: solid electrolyte interface) can be formed sufficiently on the negative electrode, which allows lithium ions to be absorbed easily in the negative electrode or desorbed easily from the negative electrode. By setting the weight ratio of EC to 30 wt % or less, oxidative decomposition of EC particularly on the positive electrode can be suppressed, and the production of gas due to such oxidative decomposition can be reduced. Also, by setting the weight ratio of EC to 30 wt % or less, decline in the charge acceptance and deposition of Li due to excessive formation of a coating film on the negative electrode can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0054">In view of the charge and discharge capacity and the rate characteristics of the non-aqueous electrode secondary battery, the weight ratio W<sub>EC </sub>of EC is particularly preferably 10 to 15 wt % to the total of the non-aqueous electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0055">A weight ratio W<sub>DEC </sub>of DEC is 10 to 50 wt % to the total of the non-aqueous electrolyte.

In order to improve greatly the low-temperature characteristics of the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery, the weight ratio W<sub>DEC </sub>of DEC is preferably 10 to 40 wt % to the total of the non-aqueous electrolyte. In view of the cycle characteristics and the low-temperature characteristics of the non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery, the weight ratio W<sub>DEC </sub>of DEC is more preferably 30 to 40 wt % to the total of the non-aqueous electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0056">A ratio W<sub>PC</sub>/W<sub>EC</sub>: the weight ratio W<sub>PC </sub>of PC to the weight ratio W<sub>EC </sub>of EC in the total of the non-aqueous electrolyte, is preferably 2.25 to 6. By setting the W<sub>PC</sub>/W<sub>EC </sub>to 2.25 or more, production of gas originating from oxidative decomposition of EC particularly in the positive electrode can be reduced. Meanwhile, by setting the W<sub>PC</sub>/W<sub>EC </sub>to 6 or less, production of gas originating from reductive decomposition of PC particularly in the negative electrode can be reduced. The ratio W<sub>PC</sub>/W<sub>EC</sub>: the weight ratio W<sub>PC </sub>of PC to the weight ratio W<sub>EC </sub>of EC is preferably 3 to 5.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0057">The weight ratio of EC, PC, and DEC is preferably W<sub>EC</sub>:W<sub>PC</sub>:W<sub>DEC</sub>=1:3 to 6:1 to 4, more preferably 1:3 to 5:1 to 4.

<p id="p-0058" num="0058">In the non-aqueous electrolyte having the weight ratio of EC, PC, and DEC in the above range, the weight ratio of PC is large, and the weight ratio of EC and DEC is relatively small. Consequently, production of gas originating from oxidative reaction and reductive reaction of EC and DEC can be reduced to a very small amount.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0059">It is preferable that the non-aqueous electrolyte includes, as an additive C, at least one of a sultone compound and a cyclic carbonate having a C&#x2550;C unsaturated bond, in addition to the fluorinated aromatic compound and the fatty acid alkyl ester described above.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0060">The amount of the additive C, that is, the total amount of the sultone compound and the cyclic carbonate having a C&#x2550;C unsaturated bond preferably accounts for 1.5 to 5 wt %, more preferably 2 to 4 wt %, of the total of the non-aqueous electrolyte. By setting the total amount of the sultone compound and the cyclic carbonate having a C&#x2550;C unsaturated bond to 1.5 wt % or more to the total of the non-aqueous electrolyte, the effect of suppressing reductive decomposition of PC can be obtained sufficiently in the non-aqueous electrolyte including EC, PC, and DEC. By setting the total amount of the sultone compound and the cyclic carbonate having a C&#x2550;C unsaturated bond to 5 wt % or less to the total of the non-aqueous electrolyte, a coating film is formed appropriately on the negative electrode surface, and absorption reaction and desorption reaction of lithium ions occur smoothly, enabling excellent charge acceptance in the non-aqueous electrolyte including EC, PC, and DEC.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0061">A ratio W<sub>C</sub>/W<sub>SL</sub>: the weight ratio W<sub>C </sub>of the cyclic carbonate having a C&#x2550;C unsaturated bond to the weight ratio of the sultone compound, is preferably 0.75 to 3. By setting the W<sub>C</sub>/W<sub>SL </sub>to 0.75 or more, the charge acceptance is improved and excellent cycle characteristics can be obtained. Also, the coating film resistance of the negative electrode can be reduced and the discharge characteristics at low temperatures can be improved. Meanwhile, by setting the W<sub>C</sub>/W<sub>SL </sub>to 3 or less, increase in the gas production caused by oxidative decomposition of the cyclic carbonate having a C&#x2550;C unsaturated bond due to excessive amount thereof, can be suppressed. The W<sub>C</sub>/W<sub>SL </sub>is more preferably 0.75 to 2, particularly preferably 1 to 1.5.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0062">Since the additive C includes the cyclic carbonate having a C&#x2550;C unsaturated bond, a coating film is formed mainly on the negative electrode, which suppresses decomposition of the non-aqueous electrolyte.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0063">Specific examples of the cyclic carbonate having a C&#x2550;C unsaturated bond include vinylene carbonate (VC), vinyl ethylene carbonate (VEC), and divinyl ethylene carbonate (DVEC). These compounds can be used singly or in combination of two or more. Among these compounds, the additive C preferably includes vinylene carbonate, in terms of being able to form a thin and fine coating film on the negative electrode, and of low coating film resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0064">Since the additive C includes the sultone compound, coating films are formed respectively on the positive electrode and the negative electrode. Since a coating film is formed on the positive electrode, oxidative decomposition of the non-aqueous solvent on the positive electrode in a high temperature environment can be suppressed. Also, since a coating film is formed on the negative electrode, reductive decomposition of the non-aqueous solvent, particularly PC, in the negative electrode can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0065">Specific examples of the sultone compound include 1,3-propane sultone (PS), 1,4-butane sultone, and 1,3-pronene sultone (PRS). These compounds can be used singly or in combination of two or more. Among these compounds, the additive C preferably includes 1,3-propane sultone, in terms of a higher effect of suppressing reductive decomposition of PC.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0066">Above all, it is particularly preferable that the additive C includes both of vinylene carbonate and 1,3-propane sultone. In this case, a coating film originating from 1,3-propane sultone is formed on the positive electrode, and a coating film originating from vinylene carbonate and a coating film originating from 1,3-propane sultone are formed on the negative electrode. Since the coating film originating from vinylene carbonate can suppress increase in the coating film resistance, the charge acceptance can be improved. Consequently, deterioration in the cycle characteristics can be suppressed. The coating film originating from 1,3-propane sultone can suppress reductive decomposition of PC and can suppress generation of gases such as CH<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>6</sub>, and C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0067">When only vinylene carbonate is added, since vinylene carbonate has poor oxidation resistance, it is decomposed by oxidation in the positive electrode and a large amount of CO<sub>2 </sub>gas may be produced. By adding 1,3-propane sultone together with vinylene carbonate, 1,3-propane sultone forms a coating film also on the positive electrode surface, and oxidative decomposition of vinylene carbonate can also be suppressed as well as oxidative decomposition of non-aqueous solvent. Consequently, production of gas such as CO<sub>2 </sub>can be suppressed greatly.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0068">The additive C is not limited to the sultone compound and the cyclic carbonate having a C&#x2550;C unsaturated bond described above and can include other compounds. Other compounds are not particularly limited, and examples thereof include cyclic sulfone such as sulfolane, fluorine-containing compound such as fluorinated ether, and cyclic carboxylic acid ester such as &#x3b3;-butyrolactone.

The solute in the non-aqueous electrolyte preferably has a concentration of 1 to 1.5 mol/L, more preferably being 1 to 1.2 mol/L.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0070">The non-aqueous electrolyte secondary battery of the present invention includes a positive electrode, a negative electrode, a separator disposed between the positive electrode and the negative electrode, and the non-aqueous electrolyte described above. Since the above non-aqueous electrolyte has excellent lithium conductivity, the rate characteristics of the battery can be improved. Even when Li is deposited on the negative electrode surface, abnormal increase in the battery temperature due to Li deposited on the negative electrode surface can be suppressed during storage at high temperatures, which improves the safety of the battery.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0096">(1) Evaluation of Cycle Characteristics</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0097">For each battery, the following charge and discharge cycle test was performed in an environment at 45&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0098">Each battery was charged at a constant current of 600 mA until the battery voltage reached 4.2 V, and subsequently charged at a constant voltage of 4.2 V. The charge time totaling the constant current charge and the constant voltage charge was set to 2 hours and 30 minutes. The rest time after the charge was set to 10 minutes. Thereafter, the battery was discharged at a constant current of 850 mA until the battery voltage reached 2.5 V. The rest time after the discharge was set to 10 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0099">The above charge and discharge were repeated. Regarding the discharge capacity at the 3<sup>rd </sup>cycle as 100%, the discharge capacity at the 500<sup>th </sup>cycle was expressed in percentage, and this was designated as the cycle capacity retention rate (%).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0100">(2) Evaluation of Battery Expansion</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0101">For each battery, after the charge at the 3<sup>rd </sup>cycle and after the 501<sup>st </sup>cycle in the charge and discharge cycle test described in (1) above, the thickness of the central portion perpendicular to the maximum plane surface (length: 50 mm, width: 34 mm) of the battery was measured. From the difference of the battery thicknesses, battery expansion (mm) during the charge and discharge cycles in an environment at 45&#xb0; C. was determined.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0102">(3) Evaluation of Low-Temperature Discharge Characteristics</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0103">For each battery, 3 cycles of charge and discharge were performed in an environment at 25&#xb0; C. under the same conditions as in (1) above. Next, after the charge at the 4<sup>th </sup>cycle was performed in an environment at 25&#xb0; C., the battery was left for 3 hours in an environment at 0&#xb0; C., and then discharged in the same environment at 0&#xb0; C. Regarding the discharge capacity at the 3<sup>rd </sup>cycle (25&#xb0; C.) as 100%, the discharge capacity at the 4<sup>th </sup>cycle (0&#xb0; C.) was expressed in percentage, and this was designated as the low-temperature discharge capacity retention rate (%). The charge and discharge conditions at the 4<sup>th </sup>cycle were set to the same conditions as in (1) above, with the exception of: the rest time after the charge; the ambient temperature during the rest time after the charge; and the ambient temperature during the discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0104">(4) Evaluation of Safety of Battery</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0105">For each battery, 3 cycles of charge and discharge were performed in an environment at 25&#xb0; C. under the same conditions as in (1) above.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0106">Next, the charge at the 4<sup>th </sup>cycle was performed under the following conditions. The battery was charged at a constant current of 600 mA in an environment at &#x2212;5&#xb0; C. until the battery voltage reached 4.25 V, and subsequently charged at a constant voltage of 4.25 V. The charge time totaling the constant current charge and the constant voltage charge was set to 2 hours and 30 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0107">Thereafter, the battery temperature was increased to 130&#xb0; C. at 5&#xb0; C./min and was subsequently retained at 130&#xb0; C. for 3 hours. Then, the temperature of the battery surface was measured with a thermocouple, and the maximum value thereof was determined.</p>
