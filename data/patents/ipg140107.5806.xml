<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Websites are often a part of an integral plan in advertising business solutions and engaging visitors as customers or potential customers. Nurturing those visitors to the website has traditionally taken human expertise, skill, and effort that have been impractical in converting a large number of visitors into customers. While an experienced sales person may be able to quickly evaluate a contact and determine whether or not he/she is a prospective customer, the sheer volume of visitors to a website and the impersonal nature of web interactions make large-scale human involvement infeasible and impractical. Business-to-business websites traditionally have not reached their marketing potential in yielding qualified leads.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Historically, email marketing and sales campaigns have driven visitors to a website to discover information about a company&#x2014;much like an online brochure. With the advent of sophisticated marketing automation tools, marketing campaigns have focused on creating conversions or registrations to capture visitor data. However, real personalization of the website visitor's experience has not been possible due to the fact that the marketing tools could not instruct a static website what particular content to present to any given visitor. Hence, improvements in the art are needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some embodiments, a system for analyzing website nurturing data while compensating for test visitor profiles may be presented. The system may include a nurturing engine that receives interactions between a plurality of visitors and a website. The plurality of visitors may include one or more test visitors. The nurturing engine may score each of the plurality of visitors based on the interactions between each of the plurality of visitors and the website. The system may include a profile database that stores a plurality of visitor profiles that correspond to the plurality of visitors. Each of the plurality of visitor profiles may be assigned a discrete profile state from a hierarchy of profile states. The plurality of visitor profiles may include one or more test visitor profiles corresponding to the one or more test visitors. Each of the one or more test visitor profiles may include a test indicator. The system may additionally include a visitor analytics engine that is configured to receive the plurality of visitor profiles and generate reporting data based on the plurality of visitor profiles. The one or more test visitor profiles may be excluded at least in part from the reporting data.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some embodiments, one or more of following features may also be implemented. The reporting data may describe a progression of the plurality of visitor profiles through the hierarchy of profile states. The one or more test visitors may include inputs provided from a customer employee to the website to test a progression through the hierarchy of profile states. The nurturing engine may be configured to customize a website feature comprising one or more selections from the group consisting of: website content, website look-and-feel, and website organization. The system may further include a visitor identification module that is configured to automatically identify the one or more test visitor profiles from among the plurality of visitor profiles; and store the test visitor indicator in each of the one or more test visitor profiles based on the automatic identification. The system may also include a visitor identification module that is configured to receive one or more user inputs that identify the one or more test visitor profiles from among the plurality of visitor profiles; and store the test visitor indicator in each of the one or more test visitor profiles based on the one or more user inputs. The reporting data may include first reporting data, and the visitor analytics engine may be further configured to generate second reporting data based on the plurality of visitor profiles, where the one or more test visitor profiles may be used to generate the reporting data. The visitor analytics engine may be further configured to compare the first reporting data to the second reporting data to generate a score indicating an effectiveness of the nurturing engine. Parameters of the nurturing engine may be altered based on the score. The nurturing engine may provide access to gated content for a device associated with a first visitor profile in the plurality of profiles based on the discrete profile state assigned to the first visitor profile from the hierarchy of profile states.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The ensuing description provides exemplary embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope, applicability or configuration of the disclosure. Rather, the ensuing description of the exemplary embodiments will provide those skilled in the art with an enabling description for implementing an exemplary embodiment. It is understood that various changes may be made in the function and arrangement of elements without departing from the spirit and scope as set forth in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to some embodiments, a progressive profiling system with discrete profile states can be applied to both individual visitors to a website as well as groups of visitors to a website. In some embodiments, interactions between the website and an individual visitor can be detected and analyzed during a communication session. A characteristic associated with the communication session, such as a business organization, an IP address, or a geographic location, may be detected. This characteristic can then be matched with a group profile. The group profile can be associated with multiple different visitors and/or communication sessions that are all associated with the same characteristic. For example, users associated with the same business can all be associated with the same group profile. The group profile can progress through discrete states in the same way that individual profiles can progress through discrete states. Each individual visitor associated with the group profile can be allowed to access additional content based on the entire group's interactions with the website.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Described herein are embodiments for operating a Web Content Management System (WCMS) to present a website to visitors in a way that generates increased interaction between users and the website over time until the visitors become qualified sales leads. The WCMS may include a nurturing engine, otherwise referred to as a Web Marketing Acceleration (WMA) engine that scores and tracks visitor interactions on the website. The WMA may be configured to solicit additional information from the user, store the interactions and information in a user profile, generate a lead score, and tailor the content and/or organization of the website based on the visitor profile. A discrete state machine may be used to track visitor profile levels, and as lead scores increase due to interactions, users may ascend through a hierarchy of discrete profile states by providing additional information (e.g., an e-mail address, a business address, professional information, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Customers of the WMA can use the system to create marketing strategies that are designed to guide visitors to the website through a user experience that increases their interest in the customer's products and/or services. However, testing these marketing strategies is a difficult and nuanced operation that is difficult to achieve using traditional test vectors or simulated data. Many customers want to perform dry runs on their marketing strategies without changing the way the WMA operates. By way of example, many customers may prefer to have their own web test engineers or employees search through their website and provide a subjective assessment of their experience. Thus, the WMA and the website treat visitors that are merely testing the marketing strategy of the website the same as visitors who are actual sales prospects for the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">By testing the many possible pathways and progressions through the WMA using actually test visitor inputs allows the customer to evaluate their marketing strategies based on human observations and real-time feedback. This method also allows the WMA to be tested without altering its design, including special test modes, additional coding, and special case processing. In other words, test visitors see the exact same user experience on their screen from the website as is presented to real visitors.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As used herein, the term customer may refer to a customer of the WMA, in many cases, a customer may use the WMA to establish their website and track visitors in order to establish qualified sales leads. In some embodiments, the WMA may be operated by the same entity hosting a content delivery network (CDN). In this arrangement, the CDN can host the content and code for the website, providing efficient and fast downloads for the user, while the WMA can operate on the CDN as well to track and score customer interactions. This combination of a WMA and the CDN can allow a customer control both aspects of the user experience through a single point of contact; the CDN can adjust how content is delivered, while the WMA can customize how the content is presented to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As used herein, the term visitor may refer to any visitor of the customer's website that is managed by the WMA. For example, a visitor may access the website from a laptop computer or smart phone in order to download content. A test visitor is a subset of the visitor class. Test visitors are still considered visitors, however, it may be said that their intent is different. A test visitor may be characterized as a visitor who is interacting with the website in order to test how content is presented based on their interactions. A test visitor may also characterize an employee or test engineer of the customer who is testing the website. Visitors may occasionally be referred to as regular visitors in order to distinguish them from test visitors.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Because test visitors are treated the same as regular visitors by the WMA, it can be assumed that the user experience as seen by a test visitor is a valid representation of the user experience as will be presented to a regular visitor. However, problems arise when the customer wants to analyze data recorded by the WMA. Because testing is an ongoing process, and thus test visitors may constantly be interacting with the website, the test visitor data will be mixed in with the regular visitor data. The WMA may include a visitor analytics engine that can access the visitor profiles stored by the WMA and generate reporting data that may be useful for a customer in analyzing the effectiveness of their website marketing scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">For example, the visitor analytics engine may provide weekly reports to a customer describing the number of visitors progressing to a certain one of the discrete profile states in the hierarchy. Such a report would necessarily include regular visitors who had sufficiently progressed through the hierarchy, as well as test visitors. Thus the advantage of using test visitors to navigate through the website in order to provide a realistic evaluation of the website marketing progression inevitably distorts any reporting data that were computed after test visitors were introduced to the system. Simply deleting test visitors is inefficient because certain test visitors need to interact with the website over a prolonged period of time in a repeated fashion. In short, test visitors needed to stay in the system to mimic real visitors without corrupting reporting for the customer. Additionally, the WMA profile progression system includes a state-based hierarchy. Therefore, instead of just submitting a set of dummy inputs, a test visitor may be required to navigate the website, view or download content, and provide verifiable information in order to progress through the state hierarchy. This may be a time-consuming process that cannot be efficiently repeated every time test visitors are removed from the system.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The embodiments described herein provide methods and systems for identifying a test visitor at various points during the test visitor interaction with the website. These embodiments may store an indication in a visitor profile associated with the test visitor. The WMA, or nurturing engine, can disregard any test visitor indicator and continue to treat test visitors the same as regular visitors. The WCMS may also include a visitor analytics engine that is configured to generate reporting data based on stored visitor profiles. The visitor analytics engine may be configured to operate in a number of different modes. For example, the visitor analytics engine can generate reporting data that includes only test visitors, reporting data that includes only regular visitors, reporting data that includes both test visitors and regular visitors, and so forth. The visitor analytics engine may also generate a report that can be sent to third-party advertisers distinguishing ad views by regular visitors from ad views by test visitors. In the case of internal ad engines, this reporting data can be used to adjust revenues paid to advertisers and views recorded by customers.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Web Content Management System</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, the term &#x201c;website&#x201d; refers to a single web domain. The website may be comprised of multiple individual pages; however, each page in the website may be associated with a single business brand or organization. For example, www.clickability.com could be considered a website associated with the Clickability&#x2122; brand and product. Each webpage in the www.clickability.com domain could be considered a part of the www.clickability.com website, as used herein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A WCMS may include computer programs that allow for the publishing, editing, and modifying of data content on a website, as well as maintenance from a centralized platform. A WCMS can typically be used to present information on websites. Data content managed by a WCMS may include items such as documents, movies, pictures, text, scientific data, phone numbers, database information, animations, white papers, product descriptions, navigational structures, contact information, data entry forms, code, JavaScript, interactive chat pages, and/or the like. Serving as a central repository, a WCMS can be used to uniformly raise the version level when new updates are added to an already existing item of data content. The WCMS may be particularly beneficial when used to catalog and index content, select or assemble content at runtime, or deliver content to specific visitors in a requested way. A WCMS may allow client control over files, documents, and other content based on a particular visitor</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments described herein, the WCMS may be integrated with a lead management system. Generally, lead management is a term used to describe general business practices and methodologies designed to generate new potential business clientele. In other words, lead management facilitates a business's connection between it outgoing customer advertising and the responses to that advertising. Lead manager may include business-to-business strategies, as well as direct-to-consumer strategies. Will the lead management system may be used to manage business inquiries, or leads, in order to guide potential customers through an organization's public information. Embodiments described herein may implement a lead management system in a WCMS. In these embodiments, the lead management system is used to track, guide, and customize a potential customer's interaction with data content of a business organization's website. At a certain level of interaction, the potential customer may be determined to be a lead that is ready for an increased level of sales and marketing exposure and/or contact.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a block diagram <b>100</b> of an embodiment of a lead management system <b>120</b>. Visitors <b>102</b> interact with a website <b>108</b> monitored by an interaction gathering engine <b>110</b>. A marketing automation system <b>106</b> may drive prospects to the website <b>150</b>. Although a marketing automation system <b>106</b> is shown separately, the marketing automation system <b>106</b> could be integrated with the lead management system in other embodiments. The lead management system <b>120</b> choreographs the website's interactions with the visitor <b>102</b> to lead to a sale or deepen the relationship with the visitor <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The lead management system <b>120</b> may include an interaction gathering engine <b>110</b> is configured to identify visitors <b>102</b> and monitor their interactions with the website <b>108</b>. The lead management system <b>120</b> may also include a nurturing engine <b>114</b> that is configured to score visitor interactions, maintain visitor profiles, advanced visitors through the profile state hierarchy, and provide parameters that can be used to control the look and feel, organization, or content of the website <b>108</b> based on each individual visitor. The nurturing engine <b>114</b> may also identify interests for visitors, associate visitors into group profiles, automatically identify business is associated with the visitor using an IP address, and receive external login information from sources such as social media sites, e-mail, and proprietary login systems.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The lead management system <b>120</b> may also include a profile database <b>116</b> configured to store visitor profiles. Visitor profiles may include a history of their interactions with the website <b>108</b> including a listing of content viewed, time spent on particular webpages, the order in which content and webpages were viewed, time between visits, and so forth. Visitor profiles may also store information provided by visitors, such contact information, business information, specialties, affiliations, interests, products, and so forth. Visitor profiles may also store analysis performed by the nurturing engine <b>114</b>, such as a discrete profile state identifying a buying level of the visitor <b>102</b>, associations automatically made with other visitors, groups to its vision may be assigned, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The lead management system <b>120</b> may also include a visitor analytics engine <b>122</b> configured to access the visitor profiles in the profile database <b>116</b> and provide reporting data accessible by the customer providing the website <b>108</b>. The visitor analytics engine <b>122</b> may accept various input parameters to generate reporting data over a certain time intervals, and across cross-sections of the visitor profiles.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The lead management system <b>120</b> could be hosted on the same computer system, hosting service or CDN as the website <b>108</b>, and the lead management system <b>120</b> and the CDN may be operated by the same entity, such as Limelight Networks&#xae;. Some information may be provided by external sources, such as a marketing automation system or ad module configured to retrieve advertisements from an external ad server. The website <b>108</b> may provide some information to all visitors <b>102</b>, but other gated content <b>112</b> may be provided to visitors <b>102</b> who have reached a particular qualified profile state in the hierarchy of profile states.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">It will also be understood that arrangement of the WCMS <b>100</b> and the lead management system as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is merely illustrative. Many other arrangements of software and hardware functionality are possible. For example, software modules that are depicted as separate in these figures may be combined into the same software module. Likewise, software modules may be divided an implemented remotely from one another in different hardware systems. Additionally, the various roles assigned to web developers, marketers, users, and content designers may be reassigned according the individual needs and expertise of an implementing business.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Nurturing Engine</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In order to assess the interactions of a visitor with a website, ascertain interests, and create a qualified lead, the website may need to identify individual visitors, then track and store information such that the visitor's overall quality as a lead can be assessed. When a visitor first accesses the website, the visitor may be classified as an anonymous visitor. The interactions with the website by an anonymous visitor may be a singular visit, or they may be comprised of multiple visits, where each visit may have one or multiple page requests within the website. The end of a visit may be governed by a period of inactivity, and a visit may be deemed complete after the period of inactivity surpasses an established visit-timeout value. For example, a period of inactivity of 30 minutes may signal the end of a visit. In some embodiments, if a visitor closes their browser and returns within the timeout period, the visitor may be credited with a new visit rather than a continuation of the previous visit. Some embodiments may also use an aging cutoff to detect stale visitors. For example, if the time between visits to the website exceeds the aging cutoff, such as 120 days, and the visitor has not submitted information for a user profile, then the website may start a new user profile for the visitor. Alternatively, if the visitor has established a user profile, then an expired account may reset certain information in the user profile that is likely to be stale at that point.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">To track a visitor, a lead management system in a WCMS may have logic added to at least some of the published pages within the website specifically for this purpose. For example, the website could check for a &#x201c;vmSessionId&#x201d; cookie, which may include a string token that may uniquely identify each visitor. If such a cookie exists, the website may load any information that has been saved by the website for that particular visitor. If the vmSessionId cookie does not exist, the website may create a new anonymous visitor profile and create a vmSessionId cookie in the browser of the visitor. Additionally, if the visitor does not have a vmSessionId cookie, the website may present the visitor with the opportunity to provide identifying information, such as a user name and/or password, to identify the visitor for this web session and for future web sessions. In this case, the website may recreate a vmSessionId cookie and load information about the visitor from a stored user profile. This may allow the website to recognize the visitor on a subsequent visit without the visitor being required to provide any identifying information.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After an anonymous user profile is established for the visitor, any information provided by the visitor and any information that may be ascertained by analyzing the interactions of the visitor with the website may be stored in the user profile. As more information is collected from a visitor, the anonymous user profile may be populated such that the visitor is no longer considered anonymous, but instead becomes an engaged prospective sales lead. Any and all aspects of the website interaction may be stored in the user profile, such as the interests, contact information, and/or business needs of the visitor. The various uses and function of the user profile are discussed in greater detail later in this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">While much of the information stored in a user profile may be provided by the visitor or ascertained by analyzing the visitor's website interactions, it is also possible to import information about a visitor based on an IP address. In one embodiment, the website may be able to detect the IP address of the visitor, and then an existing database may be queried using the IP address to gather additional information about the visitor. For example, Demandbase&#xae; is a third party service that can provide information about a business based on an IP address. Another such product is Geo Location from MaxMind&#xae;, which provides geographic location information based on the IP address of the visitor. The information acquired from an IP mapping service may be imported into the user profile of the visitor. In the case where visitor is new or anonymous and the user profile is empty, the information from the IP mapping may be used to initially populate a user profile with information. Using services such as these also relieves the visitor of the need to provide this information themselves, which may in turn ease the process of creating a qualified sales lead, and alleviate visitor frustration associated with filling out web forms.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition to individual user profiles, accounts may also be established for businesses. A business account may be established explicitly by the business by registering as such with the website. Alternatively, if a visitor provides information identifying the business of the visitor, a separate business account may be created. In some embodiments, IP mapping as described above may be used to identify a business and to identify individual visitors associated with that business. For example, a new visitor may access the website, and the website may recognize the IP address of the visitor as belonging to, for example, ACME corp. In this case, a business account for ACME corp. may be created and populated with information about the business through methods similar to those described above. Additionally, a user profile could be created for the visitor, and the user profile could be linked to the business account, and/or information from the business account could be imported and stored in the user profile. Business accounts may be useful for a website to ascertain, depending upon the particular embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In addition to IP mapping, the external data sources described above for user logins may also provide profile information to be stored locally on the Web server. When first accessing a website associated with a WCMS, a user may be prompted to create an account or login to an existing account. If a user already has an existing account with the website, the user can provide login credentials that were previously agreed upon between the user device and the website. However, a number of available login options may also be made available to a user. As discussed above, these may include options such as Facebook&#xae;, Disqus&#xae;, Google&#xae;, Twitter&#xae;, Yahoo&#xae;, OpenID&#xae;, and/or the like. In some embodiments, the services may be presented to a user for their convenience. In various embodiments, using these services may be more appealing to a user, may decrease the number of usernames and passwords the user is required to remember, make the user feel more secure using the website, and/or may overall encourage the user to provide login information.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Lead scoring is a method for a marketer to quantitatively assess a sales prospect's interest in the marketer's products. The marketer may define parameters for creating, incrementing, and decrementing lead scores based on various factors. Explicit factors may be used, such as demographic information, expressions of the interests of a visitor in the marketer's products, company size, industry segment, job title, and/or geographic location. Implicit factors may be derived by monitoring a sales prospect's behavior. Examples of implicit factors may include website visits, e-mail openings, clicks on advertisements, and/or accessing information. Any of these explicit or implicit factors may be tracked by the marketer and may contribute, either positively or negatively, to a lead score. Generally, a higher lead score may indicate that the prospect is likely to respond favorably to further interaction with the marketer's attempts to solicit a sale, and that eventually the prospective customer should be routed from the marketing department to the sales department.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the context of a website operated by a WCMS, the concept of lead scoring may be tailored to track the actions of a visitor to the website. Explicit factors contributing to lead score of the visitor may include filling out online forms, requesting information, participating in chats, and/or registering a user profile or account with the website. Implicit scores may be derived from monitoring various forms of the online behavior of the visitor, such as number, frequency, and recency of website visits, whitepaper downloads, website navigation, access of specific content, and/or searching for products or solutions. Each of these factors may have a numerical score associated with the factor, and that score may be added to, or subtracted from, the overall lead score of the visitor. Scoring may be dynamic, such that the score associated with a current action may be increased or decreased based on previous actions. For example, each visit to a webpage that is related to the same topic may increase the score associated with each successive viewing of each new webpage. On the other hand, multiple views of the same webpage may decrease the score associated with each successive viewing of the same webpage, depending upon the particular embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As the lead score for a particular visitor increases during their association with the website, the WCMS may take actions to increase the website's interactivity with the visitor. Generally, certain threshold values may be established to act as triggers. As the lead score of the visitor crosses a threshold value, the website may present the visitor with more interactive content that may be calculated to increase the assumed interests of the visitor in the offerings of the website, or to solicit additional information from the visitor. The lead score of the visitor may cross the threshold value in both the positive and negative direction. Crossing a threshold in the positive direction may indicate that the visitor is expressing increased interest in the website, while crossing a threshold in the negative direction may indicate that the visitor is losing interest in the website. In either case, the website may need to show content that is more targeted towards the interests of the visitor, or the website may need to show content that is more varied in order to find something that the visitor is more interested in viewing. In some embodiments, a threshold score may be determined, which when crossed, may designate the visitor as a qualified lead, i.e., a lead that is ready for more aggressive and/or direct contact with a sales department associated with the website. When the lead score of the visitor indicates a qualified lead, the WCMS may be programmed to alert the sales department, to present purchasing opportunities to the visitor, or to take any other action that may be calculated to follow up the expressed interest of the visitor with a sales opportunity.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Lead scoring may take various forms, and may depend on a number of different factors associated with the website. In some embodiments, a score may be associated with each detectable action taken by a visitor while interacting with the website. For example, a value of &#x201c;25&#x201d; may be added to the lead score of a visitor every time the visitor downloads a document from the website. In this case, the action of downloading the document could be statically programmed into the WCMS such that every instance of downloading the document may increase the lead score of the visitor by 25 points. On the other hand, it may also be beneficial to dynamically determine the appropriate score at the time of the action based on the history of actions by the visitor and how those actions correlate with the interests of the visitor. For example, the website may be added to the lead score of the visitor when the visitor downloads three or more documents, in addition to tracking and scoring each of the individual downloads.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment, visitor interactions with the website can generally be placed in three categories for scoring: (1) content and media items, (2) actions, and (3) information submissions. Content and media items may include viewing videos, product specifications, sample code, and/or training materials, downloading trial software, white papers, audio or video presentations, or using online resources, such as web forms, online calculators, spreadsheets and/or the like. The action category may include searches, number of visits, frequency of visits, navigation between pages, accessing content through specific web portals, adding items to a resource portfolio, creating a user profile, saving research trials and/or searches in a user profile, and/or the like. Information submissions may include all instances where the visitor provides personal or business information to the website, for example, filling out a web form, saving information in a user profile, revealing an association with a business, and/or expressing interest in business solutions associated with the website. These categories are illustrative, and not meant to be limiting. It will be understood that these categories may be changed to meet needs and content of each individual organization and website.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In some embodiments, information submissions may be explicitly linked to voluntary submissions by a user. These may indicate a level of user interest. In other embodiments, information submissions may also include information provided by an external data source, such as external data sources used to log in a user as described above. In some cases, the information requested from a user by the website and the information provided by an external data source login may be very similar. For example, a first request for information by the website may focus on personal information used to identify a visitor. Similarly, an external data source may provide personal information, including names, addresses, e-mails, phone numbers, businesses, and/or the like. When the information overlap sufficiently, the information provided by an external data source may be treated similarly to information provided explicitly by a visitor.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">When a WCMS is used to present a website's content, the score for each type of interaction may be determined within the WCMS. In one embodiment, a section of the WCMS interface may be set aside for setting the threshold lead scores and the corresponding actions that may be taken in response to the crossing threshold scores. For example, it may be possible in the WCMS to specify a threshold for a &#x201c;qualified lead&#x201d; score. Such a threshold may be set universally and applied to each visitor, or the threshold may be set differently for different classes of visitors. For instance, the threshold may be set to &#x201c;100&#x201d; for visitors who are unassociated with a business account, while the threshold may be set to &#x201c;75&#x201d; for visitors who are associated with a business account. Alternatively or additionally, a threshold may be set higher/lower for a visitor having information provided by an external data source, such as an external logins, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In addition to setting the threshold levels, a WCMS may include an interface for setting the scoring values for each instance of visitor interaction with the website. For example, a WCMS may include a means for selecting specific content, media, and/or actions, and may assign a lead score value to each type. In one embodiment, a lead score value is set for each content instance of a certain type. For example, when a visitor watches any demonstration video, a score of &#x201c;10&#x201d; may be added to the visitor's lead score. Content may be scored collectively based on content type (video, audio, and/or documents, etc.), by content category (products, research, and/or marketing, etc.), or by interest of the visitor (solutions for managers, data sheets for engineers, sales solutions, etc.). If no score is set for a particular type of interaction, the WCMS may set a default scoring level to apply to each unassigned interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Additionally or alternatively, each instance of a website interaction may be scored individually, as described above. One embodiment may allow for assigning specific scores to each instance, such that downloading a first white paper would have a score of &#x201c;10&#x201d;, while downloading a second white paper could have a score of &#x201c;15&#x201d;. Assigning values to specific content may be done by a website developer and available to the WCMS through exposed tags in the content code that may be accessible to the WCMS, or the scores may be entered into the WCMS by marketers when the content is published to the website, depending on the particular embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to one embodiment, lead scores may also be associated with each instance where a visitor provides information to the website. During the course of navigating the website, various types of information that may be requested from a visitor, such as e-mail, job function, size of company, and/or the like. In one embodiment, filling out a web form may be associated with a predetermined lead score. Optionally, each field within the web form may be individually associated with a lead score that can be added to the visitor's lead score when it is properly populated with data from the visitor. In one embodiment, an interface within the WCMS may be provided by which particular lead scores can be associated with each web field. For example, if a visitor fills out a web form and provides an e-mail address, then the associated lead score of &#x201c;10&#x201d; could be added to the lead score of the visitor.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Lead scores may also be associated with information provided by external data sources used during a login procedure. In one embodiment, information provided by the external data source may be scored in a manner similar to situations where the same information would be entered explicitly by the user in a web form. In another embodiment, a lead scored may be associated with each different external data source selected by a user. For example, a user may select two different external data sources, each providing different information to the website. A lead score of 10, for example, may be associated with each external data source identified and linked by a user. Furthermore, when a user links an external data source to an existing internal profile, additional points may be added to a lead score. Linking an account in this manner may indicate that the user is willing to share information stored by the external data source.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">When determining the lead score values to associate with each type of visitor interaction, it may be advantageous in some embodiments, depending on the particular implementation, to develop a scoring strategy to avoid overlapping lead score contributions and accurately gauge visitor interest. For example, some embodiments can divide lead score points between viewing a page with a download link, clicking on the link, and watching media associated with the link. Additionally, there may be a variety of ways to establish, track, and divide lead scores for the website's content and actions. It will be understood that the lead scoring methods described above are merely illustrative.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When a visitor is associated with a visitor profile, the website may be programmed to collect personal, business and other information from the visitor. In a way to similar to how a lead score may indicate the value of a visitor based on their activity on the website, a user profile may be incrementally filled with information and indicate a the willingness of the visitor to receive further sales interactions. A progressive profile may be defined as a visitor profile designed to have a number of different levels, or states, corresponding to increasing amounts of information provided by the visitor. Progressive profiling may enable marketers to capture an increasing amount of information about individual visitors over time, incrementally enriching the user profile. Generally, a visitor will gradually complete their profile; however, it is also possible for a visitor to supply a large amount of information in a single session and jump between multiple profile levels or states. In one embodiment, the each profile level can be associated with a certain type or number of information fields that must be completed by the visitor before the profile is allowed to progress to the next level. In another embodiment, each profile level can be associated with a particular piece of information that needs to be received from a visitor in order to progress to a subsequent level or state.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a state diagram <b>200</b> of a visitor progressing through discrete states, according to some embodiments. The progression between the various levels in the progressive profiling scheme may depend, at least in part, on the amount of information provided by a visitor <b>206</b>. When a visitor first encounters the website, the visitor <b>206</b> may be associated with an anonymous, or entry level profile <b>202</b>. The entry level profile <b>202</b> may be assigned to new visitors, anonymous visitors, or to visitors for whom there is very little known information. At a certain point, the visitor <b>206</b> may be asked, for example, for identifying contact information. If the visitor <b>206</b> provides the identifying contact information, the profile can progress to the next level, which may be termed the &#x201c;Identification Level&#x201d; <b>204</b>. Similarly, if the visitor <b>206</b> continues to navigate through the website and/or access content, the website may be programmed to present the visitor <b>206</b> with the opportunity to provide a second level of information.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">According to one embodiment, the second level of information may relate to business needs. If the visitor <b>206</b> provides the business needs information, the profile may progress to the next level, which may be an &#x201c;Identify Pain Points&#x201d; level <b>208</b>. In one embodiment, this level may be reached when the visitor <b>206</b> provides information about specific products and/or services they are interested in. These specific products and/or services may relate to specific needs of the visitor <b>206</b>, which may be termed &#x201c;pain points.&#x201d; Finally, at some point the visitor <b>206</b> may be given the opportunity to provide the website with purchasing information. If such information is provided, the profile may progress to a final level termed the &#x201c;Buying Horizon&#x201d; level <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is merely illustrative, and is not meant to be limiting. It will be understood that many different profile progressions may be used, and that the information required from each level may be tailored to meet the unique needs of a business. For example, a company may require extensive contact information, including first name, last name, username, e-mail, address, city, state, zip, country, company, phone number, fax number, mobile number, website, birth date, ideal contact times, and/or the like. For business information, a website may be programmed to require a business name, industry, size of company, listings of various business interests, revenues, and/or problems that the visitor <b>206</b> is attempting to solve. For purchasing information, the website may be programmed to require a budget, purchasing timeframe, role in the purchasing process, purchasing contact, and/or a listing of more specific business interests. These types and categories of information may be enlarged or reduced, and may be subdivided according to the marketing plan of the website owner/operator. In one embodiment, the desired profile fields may first be chosen, and then they may be grouped by type and divided into various progressive profile levels that are arranged according to perceived willingness of the visitor <b>206</b> to divulge the information.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Some embodiments present the same profile questions to every visitor associated with a given profile level. However, some embodiments may allow the progressive profile questions to be tailored to the type of visitor, such that different visitors may receive different questions at the same level based on information that has already been provided. Certain questions may pertain to, or change depending upon, answers to previous questions. For example, during a request for information, a visitor may be presented with the question &#x201c;How large is your business?&#x201d; If the visitor responds with a business size that is larger than a threshold number, then the next question may ask about topics that would only apply to a large business. On the other hand, if the visitor's response indicated that the business is comparatively small, then the next question may ask about topics that would only apply to a small business. It will be understood that many variations are possible when segmenting the profile questions into different categories. Some embodiments allow the website to use complex rules for segmenting the order, number, and topics for each profile questionnaire. For example, it is possible to have an interface in the WCMS where rules and alternatives for each question may be selected and tailored to the individual visitor type.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments, the profile levels/information and a lead score of a visitor may both be stored in the visitor profile of the visitor, yet these two measurements of lead progress may be independent of each other to varying degrees. However, in one embodiment, the lead score may be used to trigger the requests for visitor information required to progress through the profile levels. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a state diagram <b>300</b> for moving between discrete states, according to some embodiments. When a visitor <b>306</b> first encounters the website, the visitor <b>306</b> may be associated with an entry level profile state <b>302</b>. As the visitor <b>306</b> interacts with the website, the lead score of the visitor <b>306</b> may increase and decrease based on the types of interactions while associated with the entry level profile state <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In one embodiment, every time an interaction by the visitor <b>306</b> is detected, the lead score of the visitor <b>306</b> can be adjusted in state <b>340</b>. Each time the lead score of the visitor <b>306</b> is adjusted, the lead score can be compared to a threshold value. So long as the lead score of the visitor <b>306</b> stays below the threshold, no action needs to be taken, and the visitor <b>306</b> will persist in the entry level profile state <b>302</b>. If at some point the lead score of the visitor <b>306</b> meets or exceeds the threshold, the website may present the visitor <b>306</b> with the opportunity to provide contact information to the website in state <b>350</b>. If the visitor <b>306</b> provides the requested information, the profile level of the visitor <b>306</b> may increase to the &#x201c;Identification&#x201d; level <b>304</b>. On the other hand, if the visitor <b>306</b> fails to provide the requested information, the profile level of the visitor <b>306</b> may revert back to the &#x201c;Entry&#x201d; level <b>302</b>. If the user profile level reverts back to the &#x201c;Entry&#x201d; level <b>302</b>, then the visitor <b>306</b> may be presented with a similar information request each subsequent time that a visitor <b>306</b> interaction is detected and the score increases above the threshold value. Alternatively, the lead score of the visitor <b>306</b> may be reset or reduced to the threshold of the current level, or the threshold value of the next level may be increased to allow for more navigation before the next information request is made.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Other factors may be used in addition to using the lead score of the visitor <b>306</b> as a mechanism to trigger presenting the visitor <b>306</b> with an information request. In some embodiments, a specific type of interaction by the visitor <b>306</b>, such as accessing a specific section of content may trigger an information request, even if the lead score of the visitor <b>306</b> has not yet reached the threshold value. In this case, content may be &#x201c;gated&#x201d; such that only visitors who have achieved a certain profile level may be allowed to access the gated content. For example, in order to access a demonstration video of a product solution on the website, the visitor <b>506</b> may be required to provide enough information to have progressed past the first profile level. If the visitor <b>306</b> has already provided enough information to move to the second profile level, then the visitor <b>306</b> may be able to access the content. If instead the visitor <b>306</b> has not yet provided enough information to move beyond the first profile level, then the visitor <b>306</b> may be diverted from the demonstration video and given an opportunity to provide the requested information. If the information is provided at this time by the visitor <b>306</b>, the visitor <b>306</b> may be given access to the demonstration video. On the other hand, if the visitor <b>306</b> does not provide all of the requested information, the website may deny access to the demonstration video, or it may grant some form of limited access, such as a one-time viewing of the demonstration video. Using gated content in this manner may entice the visitor <b>306</b> to provide information to the website that the visitor <b>306</b> might otherwise be reluctant to divulge.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition to ascending multiple levels when gated content is accessed, it may also be possible to ascend multiple profile levels when information is imported from a business account or discovered via an IP address, or through a group account. When a user profile is associated with a business/group/external account, information from the business/group/external account may be associated with the visitor profile, or the information may be imported and stored in the visitor profile. If all of the information required for a profile level is imported or available from a business/group/external account, then the profile level of the visitor may be increased without requiring the visitor to provide any additional information.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Some embodiments may also determine and/or solicit a set of interests from a visitor. &#x201c;Interests&#x201d; as used herein, represent the classification of visitors. For example, interests may map to different types of personas that the website is intended for. Interests could also map to different business solutions offered by the website, or to main verticals served by the operator of the website.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It may be useful to draw a distinction between the interest assignment and utilization that takes place in some embodiments described herein and the &#x201c;suggested products&#x201d; or banner advertisements that are often displayed on retail websites. The interests in some embodiments need not be based on physical or other characteristics of products viewed by a customer, nor need they be based on activity on websites outside of the immediate domain of the business website used by these embodiments. The interests of these embodiments can ultimately be used to identify business problems that the visitor is concerned with and to link them to business solutions provided by the organization of the website in the business-to-business market context. Unlike most advertisers that track visitors across various sites without recording identifiable information, the interests of these embodiments can instead rely heavily on identifying information provided by a visitor. The interests can also be refined based in this information gathered from visitors with each successive interaction with the website.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For example, Google's AdSense software attempts to produce advertisements based on tracking a user's web interaction over a numerous sites without recording identifying information. In contract, some embodiments of the lead management system can instead rely on personal information provided voluntarily from a visitor, and some embodiments only use that information within the single website administered by the WCMS. Additionally, embodiments of the lead management system of this invention may attempt to match business solutions offered by the website to the business associated with each visitor, while advertising software targets retail products for individual purchasers. While the website using these embodiments may include advertisements administered by third parties such as Google's AdSense, data need not be shared, the products could be very dissimilar, and the two systems could operate on completely different principles.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The number and types of interests may vary, and may be tailored to the needs of each individual business. Typically, the number of interests will be small compared to the number of categories for content on the website. In one embodiment, the website content is first divided into categories, and then visitor interests are established independently. The number of categories may correspond to individual products, departments, types of media, authors of documents, etc., and these categories may be extensive. In comparison, the website may only have a few interests corresponding to the different major problems that are addressed by the business solutions of the website.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">One method for determining the interests of a visitor is to track the interactions of the visitor with the website. Content and navigation actions can be related to one or more interests, and those interests may then be related to the visitor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a block diagram mapping interests to content, according to some embodiments. Each instance of content, such as a document <b>430</b>-<b>2</b> or a product video <b>430</b>-<b>1</b>, can be assigned to at least one content category <b>410</b>. Each content category <b>410</b> may then be associated with one or more interests <b>420</b>. A content category, such as category B <b>410</b>-<b>2</b>, may be associated with more than one interest, such as Interest A <b>420</b>-<b>1</b> and Interest B <b>420</b>-<b>2</b>. For example, a series of white papers may be related to an interest named &#x201c;Marketing Solutions&#x201d; and related to an interest named &#x201c;Management Solutions.&#x201d; Individual instances of content within a category may also be assigned to an interest in addition to, or in the place of, the interest assignments of the content category. For example, document <b>430</b>-<b>4</b> may be individually assigned to Interest B <b>420</b>-<b>2</b>, while the rest of the content in category C <b>410</b>-<b>3</b> may be associated with Interest A <b>420</b>-<b>1</b>. In another example, document <b>430</b>-<b>4</b> may be assigned to both Interest A <b>420</b>-<b>1</b> and Interest B <b>420</b>-<b>2</b>, while the rest of the content in category C <b>410</b>-<b>3</b> may be only associated with Interest A <b>420</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As a visitor interacts with the website by accessing content, the interests associated with the content may be imputed to the visitor. In one embodiment, after a visitor has accessed a threshold number of content items associated with an interest, that interest may be recorded in the user profile of the visitor as an interest for the visitor. A visitor may be assigned multiple interests. Assigning an interest may depend on quantity, frequency of access, and a comparison to other interests. For example, if a visitor accesses three different documents all pertaining to a single interest, that interest may be assigned to the visitor. On the other hand, if in addition to those three documents, the visitor accessed ten documents in each of two different interests, then the latter two interests may be assigned to the visitor instead of the first interest because the visitor exhibited more interest in the latter two interests by comparison. It will be understood that interests may be dynamically assigned and unassigned to each visitor based on the continued interactions by the visitor and his/her expression of interests.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition to determining the interests of a visitor based on the interactions of the visitor with the website, some embodiments also determine interests both implicitly and explicitly from the user profile of the visitor. When a visitor provides certain types of information, such as business type, business role, business size, and/or various &#x201c;pain points&#x201d; (business problems in need of a solution), this information may lead to the assignment of one or more interests. For example, if the interests of the website are related to the business role of the visitor, such as manager, IT specialist, or marketing and sales representative, then a visitor who selects a business role that can be mapped to one of these website interests, and the interest may be assigned to the user profile of that visitor. The interests of a visitor may also be explicitly assigned by presenting the visitor with a listing of interests during a request for information when the visitor attempts to ascend to a higher profile level. A visitor who selects categories of interests may be assigned those interests. Alternatively or additionally, assignment of an interest that is explicitly chosen by a visitor may be overridden by the interactions of the visitor with the website, or vice versa. For example, if a visitor selects an interest corresponding to marketing and sales, but the interactions of the visitor exhibit only an interest in management solutions, then the marketing and sales interest may be replaced or supplemented by the management solutions interest.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Although they may be stored and analyzed separately, it should be apparent that a visitor's lead score, profile information, and interests are inter-related in how they are assigned and accumulated in this invention throughout the interaction of a visitor with a website. Additionally, the lead score, profile information, and interests can be used to tailor the experience of a visitor with the website, to guide the visitor to business solutions that are most likely to meet the business needs of the visitor, and to create a qualified lead to be passed on to the sales department of the website's organization.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">As interests are assigned to a visitor and profile information is obtained, the website may provide for conditional content to tailor the experience of the visitor. As described earlier, some content may be gated, such that the visitor is required to provide information and raise their profile level before the gated content may be accessed. If the visitor fails to provide the required information, the visitor may instead be presented with alternative content based on the interests of the visitor or partial profile information that may be designed to entice the visitor to provide the required information and view the originally requested gated content. Also, content could be dynamically presented based on the lead score of the visitor. For example, content X could be displayed for visitors with a low lead score, whereas content Y may be displayed for more engaged visitors with a higher lead score. In another example, a simpler, more streamlined interface may be displayed for a new visitor with a low lead score, whereas a more complete and/or detailed interface may be used for a more engaged visitor with a higher lead score.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Featured solutions, articles, and/or marketing videos may also be dynamically displayed based on the interests and/or profile of the visitor. As the interests of a visitor are identified, the website may dynamically display content that is tagged with the interests of the visitor. For example, the visitor may have an interest named &#x201c;Corporate Branding and Marketing.&#x201d; On the home page of the website, the business solutions and content related to &#x201c;Corporate Branding and Marketing&#x201d; may be prominently displayed, and additional white papers, demonstration videos, and/or more advanced materials may be added to the areas of the website dedicated to that interest. Also, a user profile may include geo-location data based either on the physical address of the visitor or on a detected IP address. For example, the website may present solutions, information, or live seminars or demonstrations that are located in the same geographic region as the visitor.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In additional to tailoring the content, the layout of the website may change according to the interests and lead score of the visitor. In some embodiments, the links on the website may be presented in a different order or prominence to emphasize the areas of the website that correlate strongest with the interests of the visitor. Additional content and hyperlinks may become available that align with the interests of a visitor as they are identified. In other embodiments, the lead score or profile level of a visitor may determine the amount of the website that is available. For example, a new visitor with a low lead score and/or a low profile level may be presented with fewer hyperlinks, whereas a more engaged visitor and/or a visitor with a higher profile level may have more hyperlinks presented in order to open up more of the website for exploration.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The tailoring of the layout of the website and the content presented to the visitor described above utilizes the profile and/or interests of the visitor. However, it is also possible to tailor the layout and content of the website for a visitor who is anonymous when he/she first interacts with the site using the IP mapping techniques also described above. A visitor who is anonymous may not have any information stored in the associated user profile when first accessing the website, but when the IP address of the visitor is detected, profile information may be used to populate the user profile of the visitor. This information may be used to tailor the content and/or layout of the website on the first visit of the visitor to the website, even though the visitor has not yet provided any information to the website. Thus, the visitor may be presented with content and layouts that are of interest to the visitor without the visitor needed to take any action other than to visit the website.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Test Visitors</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The discussion above regarding lead scoring and visitor profiles can be applied equally to monitoring test visitors and test visitor profiles. As described earlier, test visitors are treated the same way by the nurturing engine as regular visitors. Therefore, the interactions of test visitors may be monitored, a lead score may be generated, they may be presented with opportunities to provide information to the nurturing engine, interests may be mapped, and website content, look and feel, and/or organization may be dynamically adjusted based on the visitor profile of the test visitor.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a block diagram <b>500</b> of a test visitor providing inputs to a nurturing engine, according to some embodiments. Based on the discussion above, a test visitor <b>502</b> may interact with a website by navigating through content, providing information, downloading information, and/or the like. The nurturing engine <b>504</b> may track, monitor, and store all these interactions in a visitor profile database <b>506</b>. An individual visitor profile <b>510</b> may be created for the test visitor <b>502</b>. The visitor profile <b>510</b> corresponding to the test visitor <b>502</b> may be stored amongst a plurality of visitor profiles <b>508</b>. The plurality of visitor profiles <b>508</b> may include visitor profiles associated with both regular visitors and/or test visitors. Generally, the format and contents of a regular visitor profile may be indistinguishable from those of a test visitor profile. Thus, the visitor profile <b>510</b> associated with the test visitor <b>502</b> is treated exactly the same as a regular visitor profile by both the nurturing engine <b>504</b> and the profile database <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In order to compensate for the effects of test visitors, some embodiments described herein may implement methods and/or systems for identifying test visitors and distinguishing them from regular visitors. In some cases, test visitors may be detected as they are providing information to the nurturing engine while such information is being stored in the visitor profile. In other cases, test visitors may be identified at a later time by analyzing their visitor profile.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a block diagram <b>600</b> of a test visitor detection module, according to some embodiments. In this embodiment, a test visitor detection module <b>612</b> may be implemented as part of the nurturing engine <b>604</b>. The test visitor detection module <b>612</b> may be configured to distinguish between regular visitors and a test visitor <b>602</b>. This may be accomplished by monitoring the inputs provided by the test visitor <b>602</b>, the interactions between the test visitor <b>602</b> and the website, information automatically obtained from external data sources, and/or information provided by the test visitor <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In some embodiments, the visitor test detection module <b>612</b> may monitor interactions between the test visitor <b>602</b> and the website. For example, a test visitor <b>602</b> may distinguish themselves by navigating through the website or accessing content in a particular order or fashion. Test visitors may distinguish themselves by visiting a certain webpage for a predetermined time interval, or by accessing the same content multiple times. Whatever pattern is used to identify a test visitor may be considered a code that test visitors may use to identify themselves to the test visitor detection module <b>612</b>. Generally, this pattern may be configured to be one that is unlikely to be repeated by regular visitors.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some embodiments, the visitor test detection module <b>612</b> may monitor information provided by the test visitor <b>602</b>. For example, a test visitor may be directed to use a certain name, a certain address, a certain e-mail domain, a certain business name, and/or the like, when entering their personal or business contact information. For example, the test visitor <b>602</b> could identify their business as &#x201c;Acme Corp.&#x201d; in order to identify themselves as test visitors. In another example, the test visitor <b>602</b> can use a predetermined surname such as &#x201c;test&#x201d; or &#x201c;ACME&#x201d; in order to identify themselves as a test visitor. In some cases, the visitor could truthfully identify their business or e-mail domain as belonging to the customer operating the website. For example, when testing the Acme Corp. website, a test visitor could enter their e-mail address as joe@acme.com, which would automatically be identified as a test visitor.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Some embodiments may also allow a test visitor <b>602</b> to identify themselves without explicitly entering distinguishing information. In some cases, the visitor test detection module <b>612</b> may be configured to identify a test visitor <b>602</b> based on an external data source. For example, IP address mapping services may be queried in order to identify a geographic location of the test visitor <b>602</b>. The test visitor detection module <b>612</b> could determine that all IP addresses originating from a certain geographic location associated with the customer's facilities may be associated with test visitors. In other cases, the test visitor detection module <b>612</b> could also associate all IP addresses from a certain subdomain with test visitor profiles. For example, an IP address known to be associated with the customer's own computer system could be identified as a test visitor interaction.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In cases where an IP address is used to identify the test visitor <b>602</b>, this determination may be made during the initial interactions between the test visitor <b>602</b> and the website. Therefore, the test visitor detection module <b>612</b> need only operate when a new visitor is detected. In other embodiments, the test visitor detection module <b>612</b> may operate continuously throughout the interactions between the test visitor <b>602</b> and the website. For example, a test visitor may initially with begin interacting with a website from a home computer, and thus would not be detected as a test visitor by virtue of their IP address. However, on a subsequent login the test visitor <b>602</b> may interact with the website from a device with an IP address associated with the customer's computer system, and thus would be identified as a test visitor at that point. Note that even if it was not initially determined that a visitor was a test visitor based on an IP address or geographic location, the test visitor detection module <b>612</b> may otherwise determine that a visitor is a test visitor by virtue of information provided, inputs, navigational patterns, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">After determining that a visitor is a test visitor, an indicator <b>614</b> may be stored in the test visitor profile <b>610</b> inside the profile database <b>606</b>. Note that a test visitor profiles <b>610</b> may be identical to any of the other of the plurality of visitor profiles <b>608</b> stored in the profile database <b>606</b>. In some cases, the indicator <b>614</b> may be referred to as a test visitor indicator, or a test indicator. The indicator <b>614</b> may comprise a single bit or flag, or may include other information that further identifies the circumstances under which the test visitor was identified.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In some embodiments, the indicator <b>614</b> may be alternately turned on and off as the test visitor detection module <b>612</b> determines the status of the visitor. For example, during the initial stages of the interactions between a visitor in the website, it may initially be determined that the visitor is a test visitor. However, during later interactions, it may become apparent that the visitor is a regular visitor. Therefore, the test visitor detection module <b>612</b> may continuously update the indicator <b>614</b> according to its current and best calculations regarding the state of the visitor as a test visitor.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In another embodiment (not shown) the indicator <b>614</b> need not be stored directly in the test visitor profile <b>610</b>. Instead any other means of identifying the test visitor profile <b>610</b> as such may be employed. For example, the profile database <b>606</b> may store a list of pointers or references to the various test visitor profiles within the plurality of visitor profiles <b>608</b>. It will be understood that the arrangement shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is merely exemplary and not meant to be limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a block diagram <b>700</b> of an alternate arrangement of a test visitor detection module <b>712</b>, according to some embodiments. Compared to block diagram <b>600</b>, this test visitor detection module <b>712</b> differs in that is executed using the visitor profiles stored in the profile database <b>706</b> as an input, rather than using the interactions between the visitor and the website as gathered in real time as part of the nurturing engine <b>704</b>. In this embodiment, the test visitor detection module <b>712</b> may be run off-line or during times where web traffic is at a minimum. The test visitor detection module <b>712</b> may analyze all the same information as described above, the only difference being that such information may be stored in the visitor profile <b>710</b> rather than analyzed on-the-fly as it is received by the nurturing engine <b>704</b> from the test visitor <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some embodiments, the test visitor detection module <b>712</b> may be run on batches of visitor profiles in the profile database <b>706</b> at regular intervals. In some cases, the test visitor detection module <b>712</b> may also use inferences made by the nurturing engine <b>704</b> regarding the interests and business affiliations associated with the test visitor profile <b>710</b>. The discrete profile state in the hierarchy of states may also be used to classify the visitor is a test visitor. After identifying a test visitor profile <b>710</b>, an indication may be stored <b>714</b> and the profile database <b>706</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an interface <b>800</b> for identifying test visitors, according to some embodiments. In some embodiments, the test visitor detection module may be augmented by or replaced with a customer interface that allows a customer to directly control the test visitor status of each visitor profile. In some cases, it may simply be more efficient for a customer to search for two or three test visitors assigned to test the marketing scheme of the website. This allows the customer to deactivate or not install the test visitor detection module in order to reduce overhead and storage space.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Interface <b>800</b> is one of many possible implementations that may be used to manually select test visitors from amongst a plurality of visitor profiles. In this embodiment, a user can view a display <b>806</b> of useful visitor profile information for each visitor profile. For example, an e-mail address, a name, and/or information regarding the timing and frequency of a visitor's interactions with the website may be presented. In some cases, calculations such as a lead score or a discrete profile level may also be presented. In other embodiments, additional profile information may also be displayed that may be useful to a customer in identifying test visitors. In some embodiments (not shown) an option may be available to view the entire user profile for a selected visitor profile.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">After selecting various visitor profiles as test visitor profiles, the customer may provide an input (<b>802</b>) instructing the interface to store an indication of the test visitor status of the selected visitor profiles in the profile database. In some embodiments, each time the interface <b>800</b> is presented, previously selected test visitor profiles will remain checked. This may also provide the customer with the option of removing the test visitor status from some visitor profiles (<b>804</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a block diagram <b>900</b> of a visitor analytics engine, according to some embodiments. At this point, it may be assumed that test visitor profiles <b>910</b> within the profile database <b>906</b> have been marked as test visitor profiles, either automatically or manually as described above. The visitor analytics engine <b>920</b> may be configured to access the plurality of visitor profiles <b>908</b> in the profile database <b>906</b> in order to generate reporting data <b>924</b> that may be useful for a customer in assessing and diagnosing the effectiveness of their marketing campaign through their website.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The reporting data <b>924</b> may be controlled by input parameters provided to the visitor analytics engine <b>920</b>. Merely by way of example, a customer could request reporting data that describes the number of visitor profiles that moved to a certain discrete profile level during a previous week. A customer could also request to see visitor profiles that had been stagnant for at least a month. A customer can request reporting data that diagnoses why certain visitor profiles have failed to move up in the discrete hierarchy of profile states. For example, movement from one state to the next may require downloading five different content items on the website. The reporting data may show that many customers only access three to four content items on the website before becoming stagnant. This may lead the customer to adjust their marketing strategy to reduce the number of content items needed to move up the state hierarchy. The customer could also request reporting data that generates visual depictions such as histograms, bar charts, linear graphs, and/or other statistical representations of data. These can be used to show a &#x201c;velocity&#x201d; at which visitors move through various profile states over time. Note that many other types of reporting data may be generated by the visitor analytics engine <b>920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The visitor analytics engine <b>920</b> may include the ability to selectively consider subsets of the visitor profiles stored in the profile database based on test visitor status. In other words, a control <b>922</b> may be provided for the visitor analytics engine <b>920</b> that adjusts the input visitor profile set based on whether or not each visitor profile is classified as a test visitor profile. By controlling test visitor data on the input to the visitor analytics engine <b>920</b>, complex statistical reporting data can be generated accurately. Note that complex statistical data could not be easily adjusted afterwards to compensate for test visitor data without performing copulations that meet or exceed the complexity of the original calculations required to generate reporting data in the first place. By controlling the inputs, the processing time may be reduced, and no corrective algorithms may be needed.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Various settings may be employed. In some cases, the visitor analytics engine <b>920</b> may consider only test visitor profiles. In other cases, the visitor analytics engine <b>920</b> may consider only regular visitor profiles. The visitor analytics engine <b>920</b> may also generate multiple reporting data sets <b>924</b> as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, each having a different test visitor status. For example, two different versions of the same reporting data may be generated, one using regular visitors and the other using test visitors. This may be particularly useful in cases where test visitors represent the ideal progression of a visitor through a website's marketing plan. By comparing the test visitor reporting data to the regular visitor reporting data, it can be observed how closely actual visitors come to the ideal progression represented by test visitors. In some cases, the test visitor reporting data and the regular visitor reporting data may be compared and a score <b>930</b> may be generated that describes how closely the actual data comes to the ideal (test visitor) data. Based on the score <b>930</b>, the nurturing engine may automatically adjust the state criteria, or any other parameter in order to more closely match the test visitors with the regular visitors.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Other types of reporting data <b>924</b> that may be generated by the visitor analytics engine <b>920</b> may include advertising statistics. As part of the testing process, test visitors may view pages of advertisements or even click on advertisements and navigate to a third-party website. Generally, because test visitors do not represent actual visitors to the website, these views and clicks on advertisements should be discarded in order to accurately measure and bill for the value of the advertisements. In cases where an internal ad module is used to generate advertisements, ad statistics for test visitors may be excluded from advertisement views that would normally be billed to advertising companies. In some cases, third-party ad servers <b>932</b> may monitor views and navigations through advertisements on the website. In order to maintain accurate data, the customer may provide reporting data involving test visitor ad statistics to the third-party ad server <b>932</b> such that they can adjust their billing accordingly. In one embodiment, the reporting data <b>924</b> for add statistics may be formatted such that it describes the number of clicks, views, etc. that need to be removed from the statistics of the ad server <b>932</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a flowchart <b>1000</b> of a method for generating reporting data that compensates for test visitors, according to some embodiments. Each operation for this method may be carried out on the computer system described above, or on a general purpose computer system without restriction. The method may include tracking interactions between visitors and the website (<b>1002</b>). The plurality of visitors being tracked may include one or more test visitors. Interactions may include information provided from the visitors, website navigation, content downloads, information from third parties or external databases, and inferences made by a nurturing engine.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The method may also include storing visitor state and progression in a visitor profile (<b>1004</b>). Visitor profile and be part of a profile database, and may include a discrete profile state from a hierarchy of profile states. The profile state may be based on a corresponding lead score, on an amount of information provided by the visitor, a number of content items viewed or downloaded, and so forth. Tracking interactions and storing the progress of the visitor may include computing a score for each visitor based on the interactions between a visitor and the website. The score may be referred to as a lead score, and may be stored in the visitor profile database.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The method may additionally include identifying test visitor profiles and storing an indication in a profile database (<b>1006</b>). Test visitor profiles may be identified automatically based on interactions, automatically based on IP address or other external databases, or manually by a customer employee. The identification may take place in real time as interactions and data are captured by nurturing engine. Additionally or alternatively, this identification may take place based on information stored in the visitor profiles and may take place after the interactions have been captured and analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Next, a decision may be made as to how to analyze visitor profiles (<b>1008</b>). In some cases, reporting data may be generated using test visitor data (<b>1010</b>), while in other cases, reporting data may be generated using regular visitor data (<b>1012</b>). Note that these two execution paths are not mutually exclusive, and reporting data may be generated that includes both test visitors and regular visitors, and multiple versions of the reporting data may be generated as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some embodiments, the reporting data may be compared internally between that based on test visitors (second reporting data) to that based on regular visitors (first reporting data). Scores may be generated and assessments may be made as to how closely regular visitors interactions track test visitor interactions. The operation of the nurturing engine may then be adjusted in response thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In some embodiments, the reporting data may comprise information related to advertisement views. This ad information may be sent to both internal and external ad modules/servers to compensate for ad views recorded for test visitors.</p>
