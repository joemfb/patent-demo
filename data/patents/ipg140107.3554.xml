<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0059699 filed on Jul. 1, 2009, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the inventive concept relate generally to semiconductor devices and methods of testing the semiconductor devices. More particularly, embodiments of the inventive concept relate to methods for establishing alignment between bonding pads of semiconductor devices and probe pins on a probe card used to test the semiconductor devices.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Following fabrication, semiconductor devices are tested for defects and sorted according to whether or not any defects are detected. The processes used to test and sort the devices are referred to as electric die sorting (EDS) processes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In conventional EDS processes, probe pins of a test apparatus such as a probe card are brought into contact with a plurality of bonding pads on a substrate such as a silicon wafer. With the probe pins in contact with the bonding pads, test signals are applied to the bonding pads to test the electrical properties of electrical elements formed on the substrate, such as microprocessor elements or memory elements.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In addition to supplying the test signals, the test apparatus also receives signals output through the bonding pads in response to the test signals. The received signals are analyzed to determine whether elements formed on the substrate contain any defects.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The accuracy of the EDS processes depends on maintaining proper electrical connections between the probe pins and the bonding pads. To ensure proper electrical connections, the probe pins should be precisely aligned with the bonding pads. Unfortunately, however, many conventional test systems lack the precision needed to reliably align the probe pins and bonding pads of modern semiconductor devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Embodiments of the inventive concept provide semiconductor devices comprising a reference pad that can be brought into contact with a reference pin to assist the alignment of bonding pads and probe pins. Embodiments of the inventive concept also provide methods for performing electrical test on the semiconductor devices using the bonding pads and probe pins.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to one embodiment of the inventive concept, a semiconductor device comprises a substrate, a plurality of bonding pads formed on the substrate, a reference pad comprising a plurality of sensing lines located in a reference pad area of the substrate, and a plurality of detection wirings electrically connected to the respective sensing lines. The bonding pads are configured to make contact with a plurality of probe pins of a test apparatus to receive electrical test signals for an electrical test of the semiconductor device. The reference pad is configured to make contact with a reference pin of the test apparatus, and the reference pad area has substantially the same shape and size as the bonding pads such that positions in the reference pad area correspond one-to-one with positions in each of the bonding pads.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In certain embodiments, the reference pad area is divided into a plurality of blocks each corresponding to an edge of the reference pad area, and wherein a subset of the sensing lines is arranged in each of the blocks in parallel with the corresponding edge.</p>

<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In certain embodiments, the reference pad area is divided into a first block at a center portion of the reference pad area and a second block surrounding the first block.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In certain embodiments, the second block comprises four regions in which sensing lines are arranged in parallel with a corresponding edge of the reference pad area.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In certain embodiments, the first block corresponds to an aligned position of the reference position, and the second block corresponds to a misaligned position of the reference pin.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">In certain embodiments, the reference pad further comprises an insulation pattern or a conductive pattern covering the first portion of the reference pad area.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In certain embodiments, the semiconductor device further comprises a dynamic random access memory or a flash memory device formed on the substrate and electrically connected to the bonding pads.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to another embodiment of the inventive concept, a method of performing an electrical test on a semiconductor device is provided. The semiconductor device comprises a plurality of bonding pads and a reference pad formed on a substrate, the reference pad comprising a plurality of sensing lines and having the same shape and size as the bonding pads.

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In certain embodiments, determining the alignment state of the probe pins and the bonding pads based on the reference contact position comprises determining whether the reference contact position is in a first block spanning a central portion of the reference pad, or in a second block surrounding the first block, and upon determining that the reference contact position is in the second block, determining the alignment state to be misaligned.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In certain embodiments, the method further comprises applying test signals to the semiconductor memory device through the probe pins and the bond pads to perform an electric die sorting process.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In certain embodiments, the semiconductor memory device comprises a flash memory or a dynamic random access memory formed on the substrate.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Various example embodiments will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which some example embodiments are shown. The inventive concept may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the example embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these example embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the inventive concept to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. Like numerals refer to like elements throughout. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular example embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the inventive concept. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Example embodiments are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized example embodiments (and intermediate structures). As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, example embodiments should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place. Thus, the regions illustrated in the figures are schematic in nature and their shapes are not intended to illustrate the actual shape of a region of a device and are not intended to limit the scope of the inventive concept.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this inventive concept belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>

The probe pins are used to perform an electrical test on the semiconductor device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is a plan view illustrating an embodiment of a reference pad <b>150</b> in semiconductor device <b>100</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of reference pad <b>150</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a cross-sectional view illustrating a bonding pad <b>110</b> of semiconductor device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, semiconductor device <b>100</b> comprises a plurality of bonding pads <b>110</b> in contact with an external test apparatus and at least one reference pad <b>150</b> for aligning the external test apparatus with bonding pads <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Semiconductor device <b>100</b> is formed on a substrate <b>101</b> that can be populated with a variety of conductive structures and electronic circuits connected to the conductive structures. For example, in some embodiments, substrate <b>101</b> comprises a semiconductor wafer and semiconductor device <b>100</b> is formed from one or more of a plurality of memory devices arranged on the wafer, such as a dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device and a flash memory device. Each memory device typically comprises a plurality of micro transistor structures and various electronic circuits for operating the transistor structures. The micro transistor structures are typically formed in a cell region of substrate <b>101</b> and the electrical circuits are typically formed in a peripheral region of the substrate <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The memory devices are typically separated into distinct units and manufactured into semiconductor packages through subsequent packaging processes. Before the packaging processes, the semiconductor devices undergo electrical tests such as an electrical die sorting (EDS) process. In the electrical tests, bonding pads on the semiconductor devices are connected to probe pins on a probing device. The probing device then applies electrical signals to the devices to test their functions.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, bonding pads <b>110</b> and reference pad <b>150</b> are arranged around outer portions of semiconductor device <b>100</b> such that a central portion of semiconductor device <b>100</b> is enclosed by an array of bonding pads <b>110</b> and reference pad <b>150</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one reference pad <b>150</b> is positioned among multiple bonding pads <b>110</b> and each of the pads is shaped as a rectangle.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Bonding pads <b>110</b> each comprise a conductive material having low electrical resistance and allowing semiconductor device <b>100</b> to make contact with external devices without damaging to the transistor structures and the electronic circuits. Bonding pads <b>110</b> are spaced apart from the transistor structures and the electronic circuits by a distance and typically each comprise a signal wiring <b>112</b> connected to the transistor structures and the electronic circuits. Signal wiring <b>112</b> prevents direct contact between bonding pads <b>110</b> and the transistor structures and the electronic circuits, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Reference pad <b>150</b> is positioned adjacent to bonding pad <b>110</b> in a configuration where an upper surface of reference pad <b>150</b> is coplanar with upper surfaces of bonding pads <b>110</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, reference pad <b>150</b> comprises a plurality of signal lines <b>152</b> making contact with a reference pin <b>192</b> of the probe card and detection wirings <b>154</b> for detecting a reference signal from signal lines <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As indicated by the dotted line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, reference pad <b>150</b> is positioned in a reference pad area <b>102</b> of substrate <b>101</b>. Reference pad area <b>102</b> is formed with the same-sized perimeter as bonding pads <b>110</b>, and bonding pads <b>110</b> are substantially aligned with reference pad area <b>102</b>. Due to its positioning relative to bonding pads <b>110</b>, reference pad <b>150</b> can be used to determine the positions of probe pins <b>110</b> on bonding pads <b>110</b>. Moreover, by using a common coordinate system for reference pad area <b>102</b> and each of bonding pads <b>110</b>, positions in reference pad area <b>102</b> and corresponding positions on bonding pads <b>110</b> can be designated with the same coordinate value. For instance, a center position of bonding pads <b>110</b> and reference pad area <b>102</b> can be assigned coordinates (0,0), and outer extreme portions of bonding pads <b>110</b> and reference pad area <b>102</b> having dimensions A&#xd7;B can be assigned coordinates (A,0) and (0,B) along the respective x and y axes.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Probe pins <b>190</b> and reference pin <b>192</b> are controlled simultaneously by the probe card in order to detect the position of probe pins <b>190</b> on bonding pads <b>110</b> (hereinafter, a &#x201c;second contact position&#x201d;) based on the position of reference pin <b>192</b> on reference pad <b>150</b> (hereinafter, &#x201c;first contact position&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Reference pad area <b>102</b> is separated into a number of blocks <b>102</b><i>a </i>through <b>102</b><i>d </i>each comprising a plurality of sensing lines <b>152</b> of reference pad <b>150</b>. Sensing lines <b>152</b> each comprise a conductive material. Typically, sensing lines <b>152</b> are formed of substantially the same material as bonding pads <b>110</b>. In addition, upper surfaces of sensing lines <b>152</b> are coplanar with upper surfaces of bonding pads <b>110</b>, and thus the first and second contact positions are located substantially in the same plane. Sensing lines <b>152</b> are separated from each other by an insulation layer interposed between neighboring sensing lines <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Where the upper surfaces of sensing lines <b>152</b> are not coplanar with the upper surfaces of bonding pads <b>110</b>, the reference contact position of reference pin <b>192</b> can be different from the bonding contact position of probe pins <b>190</b>. In such a case, the bonding contact position of probe pins <b>190</b> are misaligned with the reference contact position of reference pin <b>192</b> and thus it becomes difficult to properly control the position of probe pins <b>190</b> based on the position of reference pin <b>192</b>. However, since sensing lines <b>152</b> are coplanar with bonding pads <b>110</b> and typically comprise the same material as bonding pads <b>110</b>, the bonding contact position of probe pins <b>190</b> can be sufficiently synchronized with the reference contact position of reference pin <b>192</b> and thus probe pin <b>190</b> and bonding pads <b>110</b> can be accurately aligned with each other in accordance with the alignment of reference pad <b>150</b> and reference pin <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In some embodiments, a single reference pad <b>150</b> is sufficient for determining the bonding contact position between probe pins <b>190</b> and bonding pads <b>110</b>. In some embodiments, additional reference pads can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, first through fourth blocks <b>102</b><i>a </i>through <b>102</b><i>d </i>in reference pad area <b>102</b> are shaped as triangles each comprising a pair of diagonal lines extending from a central point to each corner point of the rectangular reference pad area <b>102</b> and an edge line of reference pad area <b>102</b>. A central sensing line adjacent to the central point of reference pad area <b>102</b> is shorter than a lateral sensing line adjacent to the edge line of reference pad area <b>102</b>. Sensing lines <b>152</b> in each block are arranged in parallel with the edge line of reference pad area <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Adjacent sensing lines <b>152</b> are separated from each other by a gap distance &#x201c;d&#x201d;. Gap distance &#x201c;d&#x201d; of sensing lines <b>152</b> is typically smaller than a diameter of reference pin <b>192</b>. Thus, where the electrical test process is performed on the semiconductor device, reference pin <b>192</b> makes electrical contact with at least one of sensing lines <b>152</b> of reference pad <b>150</b> and thus the reference contact position between reference pin <b>192</b> and reference pad <b>150</b> can be readily determined by detecting which of sensing lines <b>152</b> makes contact with reference pin <b>192</b>. The bonding contact position of bonding pads <b>110</b> and probe pins <b>190</b> can be detected based on the first contact position.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Reference pad <b>150</b> further comprises a plurality of detection wirings <b>154</b> connected to respective sensing lines <b>152</b>. Detection wiring <b>154</b> detects which of sensing lines <b>152</b> make contact with reference pin <b>192</b> in performing the electrical test. For example, in one example test, reference pin <b>192</b> and reference pad <b>150</b> are brought into contact with each other and an electrical test signal is applied to reference pin <b>192</b>. Then, the electrical test signal passes through at least one of sensing lines <b>152</b> in contact with reference pin <b>192</b> and is detected by detection wiring <b>154</b>. Therefore, detection wiring <b>154</b> detects the test signal from the at least one of sensing lines <b>152</b> and thus checks which of sensing lines <b>152</b> makes contact with reference pin <b>192</b>. In addition, sensing lines <b>152</b> can be arranged at the blocks <b>102</b><i>a </i>through <b>102</b><i>d </i>of reference pad area <b>102</b> and thus the reference contact position of reference pin <b>192</b> relative to reference pad <b>150</b> can be detected by the positions of the detected signal lines <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, detection wiring <b>154</b> comprises a lower wiring below sensing line <b>152</b> and a contact plug interposed between the lower wiring and sensing lines <b>152</b>. In some alternative embodiments, detection wiring <b>154</b> is coplanar with sensing lines <b>152</b> and is horizontally connected with sensing lines <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some embodiments, each of detection wirings <b>154</b> is connected to a plurality of detection terminals (not shown), and the test signal passing through each signal line <b>152</b> is individually detected by a corresponding one of the corresponding detection terminals to check out which of sensing lines <b>152</b> transfers the test signal.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In a modified embodiment, at least two detection wirings <b>154</b> are commonly connected to a single detection terminal. An electrical resistive structure is respectively connected to each of the two detection wirings <b>154</b> and thus the test signal detected from each of the common detection wirings <b>154</b> is different from the other in accordance with their respective resistive structures. Therefore, the signal level detected by detection wirings <b>154</b> indicates which of signal lines <b>152</b> makes contact with reference pin <b>192</b>. Thus, the bonding contact position and the alignment of reference pin <b>192</b> and reference pad <b>150</b> can be accurately detected or inspected by detection wirings <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Hereinafter, a method of inspecting the alignment or reference contact position of reference pin <b>192</b> and the reference pad <b>150</b> will be described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an enlarged plan view illustrating one of bonding pads <b>110</b> and reference pad <b>150</b> of semiconductor device <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a first slash area S<b>1</b> on reference pad <b>150</b> indicates a reference contact position of reference pin <b>192</b> and reference pad <b>150</b>, and a second slash area S<b>2</b> indicates the bonding contact position of a particular one of probe pins <b>190</b> and a corresponding one of bonding pads <b>110</b> in semiconductor device <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The probe pin <b>190</b> and reference pin <b>192</b> of the probe card are simultaneously brought into contact with the bonding pad <b>110</b> and reference pad <b>150</b> of semiconductor device <b>100</b> at first and second slash areas S<b>1</b> and S<b>2</b>. Thus, the contact point of the probe pin <b>190</b> on the bonding pad <b>110</b> and the alignment failure of the probe pin <b>190</b> and the bonding pad <b>110</b> can be inspected based on the contact and alignment of reference pad <b>150</b> and reference pin <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Where reference pin <b>192</b> contacts a central portion of reference pad <b>150</b>, probe pins <b>190</b> contact central portions of bonding pads <b>110</b> to form accurate alignment between probe pins <b>190</b> and bonding pads <b>110</b>. In contrast, where reference pin <b>192</b> contacts an off-center portion of reference pad <b>150</b>, probe pins <b>190</b> contact off-center portions of bonding pads <b>110</b> to form inaccurate alignment between probe pins <b>190</b> and bonding pads <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example of inaccurate alignment between probe pins <b>190</b> and bonding pads <b>110</b>, since reference pin <b>192</b> makes contact with reference pad <b>150</b> at first slash area S<b>1</b> spaced apart from the central portion thereof and first slash area S<b>1</b> crosses first and second blocks <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>of reference pad area <b>102</b>. In this example, reference pin <b>192</b> makes contact with sensing lines <b>152</b> at both of first and second blocks <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>and at least two sensing lines <b>152</b> make contact with reference pin <b>192</b> in the first block <b>102</b><i>a </i>or in second block <b>102</b><i>b </i>of reference pad area <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Where the electrical test signal is applied to reference pin <b>192</b>, the test signal passes through the sensing lines <b>152</b> contacting reference pad <b>192</b> and is detected by detection wirings <b>154</b>. Sensing lines <b>152</b><i>a </i>through <b>152</b><i>d </i>in different blocks of reference pad <b>150</b> are installed in such a configuration that the test signal is detected at different voltages in accordance with sensing lines <b>152</b><i>a </i>through <b>152</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Accordingly, the detection of the test signals from signal lines <b>152</b> indicates the reference contact position and alignment state of reference pin <b>192</b> and reference pad <b>150</b>. The array sequence of sensing lines <b>152</b> from which the test signal is detected through detection wiring <b>154</b> accurately indicates the reference contact position of reference pin <b>192</b> on reference pad <b>150</b> and how much reference pin <b>192</b> is offset from the central portion of reference pad <b>150</b>. Accordingly, the contact point of the reference pin and the reference pad reveals both the reference contact position and the alignment state.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Where reference pin <b>192</b> fails to make contact with the central portion of reference pad <b>150</b>, the alignment can be corrected using correction values based on the detected reference contact position and the alignment state of reference pin <b>192</b> and reference pad <b>150</b>. In other words, reference pin <b>192</b> can be re-positioned in accordance with the detected reference contact position so that reference pin <b>192</b> is positioned at the central portion of reference pad <b>150</b>. As a result, probe pins <b>190</b> can be re-positioned at central positions of bonding pads <b>110</b> in accordance with the re-positioning of reference pin <b>192</b> on reference pad <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Where reference pin <b>192</b> and reference pad <b>150</b> are aligned slightly off of the central portion of reference pad <b>150</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the test signal is detected simultaneously from the third and fourth sensing lines <b>152</b><i>c </i>and <b>152</b><i>d </i>of the first block <b>102</b><i>a </i>and from the third and fourth sensing lines <b>152</b><i>c </i>and <b>152</b><i>d </i>of second block <b>102</b><i>b</i>. Thus, the detected test signal indicates that reference pin <b>192</b> crosses first and second blocks <b>102</b><i>a </i>and <b>102</b><i>b </i>and is positioned away from the central portion of reference pad <b>150</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. To correct the misalignment, reference pin <b>192</b> can be shifted toward the central portion of reference pad <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">As indicated by the foregoing, where semiconductor device <b>100</b> having bonding pads <b>110</b> and reference pad <b>150</b> undergoes an electrical test using a probe card having probe pins <b>190</b> and reference pin <b>192</b>, the reference contact position between reference pin <b>192</b> and reference pad <b>150</b> is detected using signal lines <b>152</b>. The detected reference contact position can then be used to adjust the relative position of reference pin <b>192</b> and reference pad <b>150</b> if necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a plan view illustrating a reference pad <b>250</b> that can be used as an alternative to reference pad <b>150</b> in semiconductor device <b>100</b>. Reference pad <b>250</b> is connected to other elements of semiconductor device <b>100</b> in a manner similar to reference pad <b>150</b>. Also, reference pad <b>250</b> is arranged in a similar manner to reference pad <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Like reference pad <b>150</b>, reference pad <b>250</b> is positioned adjacent to bonding pads <b>110</b> in a configuration where upper surfaces of reference pad <b>250</b> are coplanar with upper surfaces of bonding pads <b>110</b>. Reference pad <b>250</b> comprises a plurality of signal lines <b>252</b> making contact with reference pin <b>192</b> of the probe card and detection wirings (not shown) for detecting a reference signal from signal lines <b>252</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Reference pad <b>250</b> is positioned in reference pad area <b>102</b> of substrate <b>101</b> and is formed with substantially the same outer dimensions as reference pad <b>150</b>. Reference pad area <b>102</b> is formed with the same size and shape as bonding pads <b>110</b> so that bonding pads <b>110</b> are aligned with reference pad area <b>102</b>. Consequently, different positions of reference pad <b>250</b> in reference pad area <b>102</b> correspond uniquely to different positions on bonding pad <b>110</b>. Thus, where reference pad area <b>102</b> and bonding pads <b>110</b> are defined by the same coordinate system, the positions in reference pad area <b>102</b> and the corresponding positions on bonding pad <b>110</b> are designated with the same coordinate value. Probe pins <b>190</b> and reference pin <b>192</b> are controlled simultaneously with each other in the probe card, so the position of probe pins <b>190</b> on bonding pads <b>110</b> (hereinafter, &#x201c;second contact position&#x201d;) can be controlled based on the position of reference pin <b>192</b> on reference pad <b>250</b> (hereinafter, &#x201c;first contact position&#x201d;).</p>

<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, some of sensing lines <b>252</b> near edge lines of reference pad area <b>102</b> are broken into pieces while other of sensing lines <b>252</b> near a central portion of reference pad area <b>102</b> remain unbroken in the same structure as sensing lines <b>152</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. As examples, sensing lines <b>252</b> broken into two pieces comprise piece lines <b>252</b><i>a</i>, <b>252</b><i>a</i>&#x2032;, <b>252</b><i>b </i>and <b>252</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; in a line parallel with the edge line, respectively. In contrast, unbroken sensing lines <b>252</b> include single lines <b>252</b><i>c</i>.

Thus, where the electrical test process is performed on semiconductor device <b>100</b>, reference pin <b>192</b> makes electrical contact with at least one of sensing lines <b>252</b> of reference pad <b>250</b> and the first contact position between reference pin <b>192</b> and reference pad <b>250</b> can be determined by detecting which of sensing lines <b>252</b> makes contact with reference pin <b>192</b>.

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the method of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, semiconductor device <b>100</b> is brought into contact with a test apparatus comprising a plurality of probe pins and a reference pin (<b>905</b>). The probe pins make contact with respective bonding pads <b>110</b> and the reference pin makes contact with a reference pad such as reference pad <b>150</b>, <b>250</b>, <b>350</b> or <b>450</b>.

Then, the test signal is detected from a portion of sensing lines making contact with the reference pin to determine a reference contact position between the reference pin and the reference pad (<b>915</b>). Finally, the alignment state of the probe pins and the bonding pads is determined based on the reference contact position (<b>920</b>).

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">In some embodiments, the alignment state of the probe pins is determined by detecting whether the reference contact position is in a first block in a central portion of the reference pad, or in a second block surrounding the first block.

In other words, the probe pins are deemed to be misaligned with the bonding pads.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">After the probe pins and bonding pads are properly aligned, an electrical test, such as an electric die sorting process, can be performed by applying test signals to the semiconductor memory device through the probe pins and the bond pads.</p>

The different reference pads allow accurate measurements of the location of the reference pin. The location of the reference pin can be adjusted until it is properly aligned with the reference pad, which results in accurate alignment between the probe pins and the bonding pads.</p>
