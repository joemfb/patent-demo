<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority under 35 USC 119 from Japanese Patent Application No. 2010-290835 filed Dec. 27, 2010, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus and an image forming method.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, there has been known an image forming apparatus that ejects ink droplets to a recording medium such as a sheet by inkjet recording heads.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this image forming apparatus, ink droplets are ejected to recording medium, the ink droplets ejected to the recording medium are dried and fixed by heating, the recording media are sequentially discharged and stacked on a sheet discharge section. In this image forming apparatus, ink transferring (set off, blocking) are generated between the recording media that overlap each other in the vertical direction when recording media are stacked on the sheet discharge section.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the same phenomenon as described above occurs even in offset printing machines in the market, powder containing such as starch is generally sprayed between recording media to avoid set off.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Since there is a lot of moisture contained in ink in a case of an image forming apparatus using inkjet recording heads, as compared to an offset printing machine, set off is apt to occur. For this reason, a powder device, which sprays powder, is used in the image forming apparatus in the similar way as an offset printing machine. However, since much more powder needs to be sprayed than powder used in an offset printing machine, accordingly it is required that the amount of powder be reduced or that powder be made unnecessary.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Further, Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 10-16418 (Patent Document 1) discloses an apparatus that, after printing, cools ink transferred to a recording medium or the vicinity of a portion where ink and ink-curing (hardening) liquid comes into contact with each other by a cooling device and fixes the ink, before, while, or after ink-curing liquid comes into contact with or is applied to an ink-transfer surface of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, a process for cooling a recording medium by a cooling device is not disclosed in Patent Document 1. For this reason, it is not possible to effectively suppress set off when recording media are stacked on a sheet discharge section. Accordingly, improvement is needed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The invention has been made in consideration of the above-mentioned circumstances, and an object of the invention is to provide an image forming apparatus that can suppress the occurrence of set off when recording media are stacked on a discharge unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to a first aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image forming apparatus including a liquid droplet ejection device that ejects liquid droplets onto a recording medium; a fixing device that fixes the ejected liquid droplets to the recording medium by heating; a discharge unit on which the recording medium is sequentially discharged and stacked; and a cooling device that cools the recording medium before the recording medium is stacked on the discharge unit after the recording medium is heated by the fixing device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the first aspect of the present invention, after liquid droplets are ejected to the recording medium by the liquid droplet ejection device, the liquid droplets ejected to the recording medium are heated by the fixing device and fixed to the recording medium. Further, before the recording medium is stacked on the discharge unit after the recording medium is heated by the fixing device, the recording medium is cooled by the cooling device. The recording medium cooled by the cooling device is stacked on the discharge unit. That is, due to that the recording medium having been heated by the fixing device is cooled by the cooling device before the recording medium is stacked on the discharge unit, the temperature of the image fixed to the recording medium is lowered. Accordingly, the generation of ink transferring (set off, blocking) between the recording media stacked on the discharge unit is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a second aspect, in the image forming apparatus according to the first aspect of the present invention, the cooling device includes a fan that blows air to the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to the second aspect, air (wind) is blown to the recording medium by the fan. Accordingly, the recording medium is cooled in a non-contact state, so that the generation of ink transferring (set off) between the recording media stacked on the discharge unit is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to a third aspect, in the image forming apparatus according to the second aspect of the present invention, the fan blows the air toward an upstream side in a conveying direction of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">According to the third aspect, the fan blows air toward the upstream side in the conveying direction of the recording medium, so that the transfer of heat from the fixing device to a cooling position of the recording medium is suppressed. Further, as compared to a case where air is blown toward the downstream side in the conveying direction of the recording medium, the period of time of air being blown against the recording medium is increased due to a relationship between the speed of air and the conveying speed of the recording medium. Accordingly, cooling efficiency is high.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to a fourth aspect, in the image forming apparatus according to any one of the first to third aspects of the present invention, the cooling device includes a cooler, which lowers a temperature around the recording medium, or the cooling device includes a cooler provided together with the fan, the cooler lowering a temperature around the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the fourth aspect, the cooling device includes a cooler, which lowers the temperature around the recording medium, instead of the fan or provided together with the fan. Accordingly, the recording medium is effectively cooled in a non-contact state, so that the generation of ink transferring (set off) between the recording media stacked on the discharge unit is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to a fifth aspect, in the image forming apparatus according to any one of the first to third aspects of the present invention, the cooler is disposed above the recording medium which is conveyed in the cooling device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">According to the fifth aspect, since the cooler is disposed above the recording medium, cold air goes down. Accordingly, the heated image, which is fixed to the recording medium, is more effectively cooled in a non-contact state.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">According to a sixth aspect, in the image forming apparatus according to the first aspect of the present invention, the cooling device is a cooling roller that is rotated while contacting the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to the sixth aspect, the cooling device is the cooling roller that is rotated with coming into contact with the recording medium. Accordingly, the recording medium is cooled by the cooling roller, so that the generation of ink transferring (set off) between the recording media stacked on the discharge unit is suppressed. Further, cooling efficiency is improved as compared to a non-contact type cooling method.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In the above mentioned aspects, it is possible that an air blowing direction of the fan is substantially opposite to a conveying direction of the recording medium.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the above mentioned aspects, it is possible that the fan is disposed at a position against which cool air blown out from a blow-out portion of the cooler is blown.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">According to a seventh aspect of the present invention, there is provided an image forming method including: ejecting liquid droplets onto a recording medium; fixing the ejected liquid droplets to the recording medium by heating; cooling the recording medium that has been heated by the fixing; and discharging the recording medium that has been cooled by the cooling, and stacking the recording medium on a discharge unit.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to the seventh aspect, liquid droplets are ejected to a recording medium by ejecting process, and the liquid droplets, which have been ejected to the recording medium, are fixed by heating by fixing process. Further, in cooling process, the recording medium heated by the fixing process is cooled in a non-contact state. After that, in discharging process, the recording medium cooled by the cooling process is discharged and the recording medium is stacked on the discharge unit. That is, before the recording medium is stacked on the discharge unit after fixing, the recording medium is cooled by the cooling process. Accordingly, the temperature of the image fixed to the recording medium is lowered, so that the generation of ink transferring (set off) between the recording media stacked on the discharge unit is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Since the invention has the above-mentioned configuration, it is possible to suppress the occurrence of set off when recording media are stacked on a discharge unit.</p>

The process solution drum <b>154</b> includes claw-shaped holders (grippers) on the outer peripheral surface thereof, and is adapted to be capable of holding the (leading) end of the sheet <b>122</b> by making the sheet <b>122</b> be interposed between claw of the holder and the peripheral surface of the process solution drum <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Suction holes may be formed at the outer peripheral surface of the process solution drum <b>154</b> and a suction section, which performs section from the suction holes, may be connected. Accordingly, it is possible to closely hold a sheet <b>122</b> on the peripheral surface of the process solution drum <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The process solution applying device <b>156</b> is provided outside the process solution drum <b>154</b> so as to face the peripheral surface of the process solution drum <b>154</b>. The process solution applying device <b>156</b> includes a process solution container in which process solution is stored, an anilox roller of which a part is immersed in the process solution of the process solution container, and a rubber roller that comes into press contact with the anilox roller and the sheet <b>122</b> held on the process solution drum <b>154</b> and transfers measured process solution to the sheet <b>122</b>. According to the process solution applying device <b>156</b>, it is possible to apply process solution to the sheet <b>122</b> while measuring (metering) the process solution. A drying device <b>158</b>, which dries (removes) the process solution applied to the sheet <b>122</b>, is provided on the downstream side of the process solution applying device <b>156</b> in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b>.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The sheet <b>122</b>, to which the process solution has been applied by the process solution applying section <b>112</b>, is delivered to the drawing drum <b>170</b> of the drawing section <b>114</b> from the process solution drum <b>154</b> through an intermediate conveying portion <b>124</b> (a transfer cylinder <b>130</b>). The drawing section <b>114</b> includes the drawing drum <b>170</b> and inkjet heads <b>172</b>M, <b>172</b>K, <b>172</b>C, and <b>172</b>Y. The drawing drum <b>170</b> includes claw-shaped holders (grippers) on the outer peripheral surface thereof, like the process solution drum <b>154</b>. The sheet <b>122</b> fixed to the drawing drum <b>170</b> is conveyed while the recording surface of the sheet facing the outside, and inks are applied to the recording surface from the inkjet heads <b>172</b>M, <b>172</b>K, <b>172</b>C, and <b>172</b>Y.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Each of the inkjet heads <b>172</b>M, <b>172</b>K, <b>172</b>C, and <b>172</b>Y is a full-line type inkjet recording head (an inkjet head) that has the length corresponding to the maximum width of an image forming area of the sheet <b>122</b>. A nozzle array, which is formed of plural ink ejection nozzle arranged over the entire width of the image forming area, is formed on the ink ejection surface of each of the inkjet heads. Each of the inkjet heads <b>172</b>M, <b>172</b>K, <b>172</b>C, and <b>172</b>Y is installed so as to extend in a direction orthogonal to the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b> (the rotating direction of the drawing drum <b>170</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">When liquid droplets of corresponding color inks are ejected toward the recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b>, which is closely held on the drawing drum <b>170</b>, from the respective inkjet heads <b>172</b>M, <b>172</b>K, <b>172</b>C, and <b>172</b>Y, the inks come into contact with the process solution previously applied to the recording surface by the process solution applying section <b>112</b> and resin particles and pigments dispersed in the inks are aggregated. As a result, aggregate-parts are formed. Accordingly, the flows of the pigments or the like on the sheet <b>122</b> are prevented, so that an image is formed on the recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The sheet <b>122</b> on which an image has been formed by the drawing section <b>114</b> is delivered to a drying drum <b>176</b> of the drying section <b>116</b> from the drawing drum <b>170</b> through an intermediate conveying portion <b>126</b>. The drying section <b>116</b> is a mechanism that dries (removes) moisture contained in a solvent separated due to aggregate action. The drying section <b>116</b> includes the drying drum <b>176</b> and a drying device <b>180</b>. Although not shown in the drawings, for example, plural IR (infrared) heaters and hot air heaters disposed between the respective IR heaters are provided in the drying device <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The drying drum <b>176</b> includes claw-shaped holders (grippers) on the outer peripheral surface thereof, like the process solution drum <b>154</b>. The drying drum <b>176</b> is adapted so as to be capable of holding the end of the sheet <b>122</b> by the holder. The temperature of hot air, which is blown toward the sheet <b>122</b> from hot air heater (not shown in the drawings), and the temperature of each of the IR heaters (not shown in the drawings) are detected by temperature sensor and sent to a controller (not shown in the drawings) as temperature information. The temperature and volume of hot air and the temperature of each of the IR heaters are appropriately adjusted on the basis of the temperature information, so that various drying conditions are achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Meanwhile, the surface temperature of the drying drum <b>176</b> may be set to 50&#xb0; C. or more. Heating is performed from the back of the sheet <b>122</b>, so that drying is facilitated. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the destruction of an image at the time of the fixing of the image. Meanwhile, the upper limit of the surface temperature of the drying drum <b>176</b> is not particularly limited, but is preferably set to 75&#xb0; C. or less (more preferably set to 60&#xb0; C. or less) in terms of the safety (the prevention of burns caused by high temperature) of maintenance such as the cleansing of the ink adhering to the surface of the drying drum <b>176</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Further, since it is found that the expansion and contraction of a sheet <b>122</b> are less when drying cylinder temperature (the surface temperature of the drying drum <b>176</b>) is high (a sheet is strongly dried), it is possible to reduce the influence of cockles when the surface temperature of the drying drum <b>176</b> is high without loss of the above-mentioned safety.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The sheet <b>122</b> is held on the outer peripheral surface of the drying drum <b>176</b> so as to allow the recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b> to face the outside (that is, in a state in which the sheet <b>122</b> is curved so that the recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b> becomes a convex side) and is dried while the drying drum conveys the sheet <b>122</b> by being rotated. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the sheet <b>122</b> from creasing and floating and to prevent the uneven drying of the sheet caused by the creasing and floating of the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The sheet <b>122</b>, which has been dried by the drying section <b>116</b>, is delivered to a fixing drum <b>184</b> of the fixing section <b>118</b> from the drying drum <b>176</b> through an intermediate conveying portion <b>128</b>. The fixing section <b>118</b> includes the fixing drum <b>184</b>, a drying device <b>186</b>, a fixing roller <b>188</b> as an example of a fixing device, and an in-line sensor <b>190</b>. Although not shown in the drawings, the drying device <b>186</b> is formed of, for example, IR heater. The drying device <b>186</b> is disposed on the upstream side in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b> by the fixing drum <b>184</b>, and the fixing roller <b>188</b> is disposed on the downstream side of the drying device <b>186</b> in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The fixing drum <b>184</b> includes claw-shaped holders (grippers) on the outer peripheral surface thereof, like the process solution drum <b>154</b>. The fixing drum <b>184</b> is adapted so as to be capable of holding the end of the sheet <b>122</b> by the holder. The sheet <b>122</b> is conveyed by the rotation of the fixing drum <b>184</b> while the recording surface of the sheet faces the outside. Drying performed by the drying device <b>186</b>, fixing performed by the fixing roller <b>188</b>, and inspection performed by the in-line sensor <b>190</b> are performed on the recording surface.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The fixing roller <b>188</b> is a roller member that melts and attaches resin particles contained in the inks (particularly, self-dispersible polymer particles) to the sheet by heating and pressing the inks and forms a film with the inks. The fixing roller <b>188</b> is adapted to heat and press the sheet <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Specifically, the fixing roller <b>188</b> is disposed so as to come into press contact with the fixing drum <b>184</b>, and the fixing roller <b>188</b> and the fixing drum <b>184</b> form nip rollers. Accordingly, the sheet <b>122</b> is interposed between the fixing roller <b>188</b> and the fixing drum <b>184</b>, is nipped at a predetermined nip pressure (for example, 0.15 MPa), and is subjected to the fixing of an image.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Further, the fixing roller <b>188</b> is formed of a heating roller where a halogen lamp is assembled inside a metal pipe made of aluminum or the like having high thermal conductivity, and the temperature thereof is controlled to a predetermined temperature (for example, 60 to 80&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The sheet <b>122</b> is heated by the heating roller, so that thermal energy corresponding to a temperature equal to or higher than Tg (glass-transition temperature) of the resin particles contained in the inks is applied to the sheet, so that the resin particles are melted. Accordingly, pressure fixing is performed on the concaves and convexs of the sheet <b>122</b> and the concaves and convexs of the surface of an image is leveled, so that it is possible to obtain gloss.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The in-line sensor <b>190</b> is a measurement unit that is used to measure check patterns, the amount of moisture, the surface temperature, the gloss level, and the like of the image fixed to the sheet <b>122</b>. A CCD line sensor or the like is used as the in-line sensor <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to the fixing section <b>118</b>, the resin particles in a thin image layer formed by the drying section <b>116</b> are heated and pressed by the fixing roller <b>188</b>, so that the resin particles are melted. Accordingly, it is possible to fix an image to the sheet <b>122</b>. Further, the surface temperature of the fixing drum <b>184</b> is set to 50&#xb0; C. or more and the sheet <b>122</b> held on the outer peripheral surface of the fixing drum <b>184</b> is heated from the back thereof, so that drying is facilitated. Accordingly, it is possible to prevent the destruction of an image at the time of the fixing of the image and to increase the strength of an image by an effect of raising the temperature of the image.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the sheet discharge section <b>120</b> is provided on the downstream side of the fixing section <b>118</b> in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b>. The sheet discharge section <b>120</b> includes a discharge tray <b>192</b> as an example of a discharge unit. A transfer cylinder <b>194</b>, a conveying belt <b>196</b>, and a stretching roller <b>198</b> are provided between the discharge tray <b>192</b> and the fixing drum <b>184</b> of the fixing section <b>118</b> so as to face in contact manner to the discharge tray <b>192</b> and the fixing drum <b>184</b>. In this embodiment, the conveying belt <b>196</b> is formed of an endless chain member. The conveying belt <b>196</b> revolves in the direction of an arrow in a state in which the conveying belt <b>196</b> is stretched by the transfer cylinder <b>194</b> and the stretching roller <b>198</b>. Further, the conveying belt <b>196</b> includes claw-shaped holders (grippers) on the outer peripheral surface thereof, and is adapted to hold the end of the sheet <b>122</b> by making the sheet <b>122</b> be interposed between the claw of the holder and the surface of the conveying belt <b>196</b>. The sheet <b>122</b> is delivered to the conveying belt <b>196</b> through the transfer cylinder <b>194</b>. Furthermore, the sheet <b>122</b> is conveyed while being held on the conveying belt <b>196</b>, and is discharged to the discharge tray <b>192</b>. Sheets <b>122</b> on which images have been formed are sequentially discharged and stacked on the discharge tray <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Moreover, a cooling section <b>200</b>, which cools the sheet <b>122</b> conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b>, is provided between the fixing section <b>118</b> and the discharge tray <b>192</b>. The cooling section <b>200</b> will be described below. In addition, a powder spray device <b>210</b>, which sprays powder on the sheet <b>122</b>, is provided above the sheet <b>122</b>, which is conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b>, on the downstream side of the cooling section <b>200</b> in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Further, although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the inkjet recording apparatus <b>1</b> includes ink storage tanks that supply inks to the respective inkjet heads <b>172</b>M, <b>172</b>K, <b>172</b>C, and <b>172</b>Y; a unit that supplies process solution to the process solution applying section <b>112</b>; a head maintenance unit that performs the cleaning (wiping of nozzle surfaces, purging, suction of nozzles, or the like) of the respective inkjet heads <b>172</b>M, <b>172</b>K, <b>172</b>C, and <b>172</b>Y; a position detecting sensor that detects the position of the sheet <b>122</b> on a medium conveying path; and a temperature sensor that detects the temperature of each part of the apparatus; and the like, other than the above-mentioned structures.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">&#x3c;Details of Cooling Section&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The details of the cooling section <b>200</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cooling section <b>200</b> includes plural fans <b>202</b> as an example of a cooling device that is positioned above the sheet <b>122</b> conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b> (the lower portion of the conveying belt <b>196</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) so as to face the sheet <b>122</b> and blows wind (air) to the sheet <b>122</b>, and a cooler <b>204</b> as an example of a cooling device that lowers the temperature around the sheet <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the plural fans <b>202</b> are arranged in line in a direction orthogonal to the moving direction of the conveying belt <b>196</b> (a direction crossing the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b>), and are provided so as to blow air toward the upstream side in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b> conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b>. That is, the plural fans <b>202</b> are adapted to blow air to the entire recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b> to the upstream side in the conveying direction from the downstream side in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b> conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b> (the lower portion of the conveying belt <b>196</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In this embodiment, the number of the fans <b>202</b> is four but may be appropriately changed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Since the sheet <b>122</b> is conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b> in a state in which the leading end of the sheet <b>122</b> is held by the holder (gripper), the flutter of the sheet <b>122</b> is suppressed due to blowing air to the sheet <b>122</b> toward the upstream side in the conveying direction from the downstream side in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b> by the plural fans <b>202</b>. Further, the transfer of heat from the fixing section <b>118</b> to the sheet <b>122</b> conveyed in the cooling section <b>200</b> is suppressed by blowing air to the sheet <b>122</b> toward the upstream side in the conveying direction from the downstream side in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b>. Furthermore, since the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b> is substantially opposite to the direction of the air blown from the fans <b>202</b>, the period of time of air being blown against the sheet <b>122</b> is increased in a relationship between the relative speed of air and the sheet <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The cooler <b>204</b> is disposed above the revolving conveying belt <b>196</b> on the slightly downstream side of the fans <b>202</b> in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b>. The cooler <b>204</b> includes a blow-out opening <b>204</b>B that is formed at the lower portion of a housing <b>204</b>A and a heat exchanger <b>204</b>C that is disposed inside the housing <b>204</b>A. The heat exchanger <b>204</b>C is to cool gas that is to be introduced into the housing <b>204</b>A from the outside by a fan (not shown in the drawings). The gap cooled by the heat exchanger <b>204</b>C is blown out from the blow-out opening <b>204</b>B by a fan. Cool air blown out from the blow-out opening <b>204</b>B is sent to the lower portion of the conveying belt <b>196</b> (the sheet <b>122</b>, which is being conveyed) through the gaps of the upper portion of the conveying belt <b>196</b> that is formed of a chain member.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In this embodiment, the plural fans <b>202</b> are provided at the position at (against) which cooling air blown out from the blow-out opening <b>204</b>B of the cooler <b>204</b> is blown, and the cooling air is blown to the sheet <b>122</b> by the plural fans <b>202</b>. Further, the blowing direction of the cooling air may be set toward the plural fans <b>202</b> by the adjustment of the direction of a louver provided at the blow-out opening <b>204</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Furthermore, since the cooler <b>204</b> is disposed above the sheet <b>122</b> conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b> and cold air from the cooler <b>204</b> goes down, the sheet <b>122</b> is efficiently cooled.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In this embodiment, the cooler <b>204</b> is adapted to lower the temperature around the sheet <b>122</b>, which is conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b>, to temperature (for example, 15 to 30&#xb0; C.) which is lower than fixing temperature (for example, 60 to 80&#xb0; C.).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The heat exchanger <b>204</b>C circulates a refrigerant and cools gas by condensation and evaporation, but is not limited thereto. Various structures, such as a device for sending cold air using a heat exchanger cooled by water flow and a device using Peltier elements, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In the cooling section <b>200</b>, cooling air is sent by the cooler <b>204</b> and air is blown to the sheet <b>122</b>, which is conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b>, by the plural fans <b>202</b> that are provided at the position at which cooling air is blown. Accordingly, the sheet <b>122</b> having been subjected to the fixing of an image is cooled to about normal temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Meanwhile, in this embodiment, the plural fans <b>202</b> do not have a function of cooling of air blown to the sheet <b>122</b>. However, heat exchangers may be provided inside the plural fans <b>202</b> so that cooling air is blown to the sheet <b>122</b>. Accordingly, for example, the cooler <b>204</b> may be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the sheet discharge section <b>120</b>, the powder spray device <b>210</b> is provided on the downstream side of a position which is positioned below the blow-out opening <b>204</b>B of the cooler <b>204</b> in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b> so as to face the sheet <b>122</b> that is conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b>. The powder spray device <b>210</b> sprays powder, which contains starch or the like, to the recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b>. Since powder is sprayed to the recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b>, the occurrence of set off is suppressed when sheets <b>122</b> are stacked on the discharge tray <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">&#x3c;Operation and Effect&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the sheet <b>122</b> fed from the sheet feed section <b>110</b> is conveyed along the outer peripheral surfaces of the process solution drum <b>154</b> and the sheet feed cylinder <b>152</b> that are rotated. In the process solution applying section <b>112</b>, the process solution applying device <b>156</b> applies process solution (ink aggregate process solution) to the recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b> that is conveyed along the outer peripheral surface of the process solution drum <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Moreover, the sheet <b>122</b> to which the process solution has been applied is conveyed along the outer peripheral surface of the drawing drum <b>170</b> through the intermediate conveying portion <b>124</b>. In the drawing section <b>114</b>, the respective color inkjet heads <b>172</b>M, <b>172</b>K, <b>172</b>C, and <b>172</b>Y eject liquid droplets (inks) to the recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b> conveyed by the drawing drum <b>170</b>, so that an image is formed on the sheet <b>122</b>. In this case, the inks come into contact with the process solution previously applied to the recording surface by the process solution applying section <b>112</b> and resin particles and pigments dispersed in the inks are aggregated. As a result, aggregate parts are formed. Accordingly, the flows of the pigments or the like on the sheet <b>122</b> are prevented, so that an image is formed on the recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Further, the sheet <b>122</b> where the image has been formed on the recording surface is conveyed along the outer peripheral surface of the drying drum <b>176</b> through the intermediate conveying portion <b>126</b>. In the drying section <b>116</b>, moisture contained in the sheet <b>122</b>, which is conveyed by the drying drum <b>176</b> after the ejection of the inks, is dried (removed) (moisture contained in a solvent separated by aggregate action is reduced) by the heat of the IR heaters and the hot air blown from the hot air heaters, of the drying device <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Furthermore, the sheet <b>122</b>, which is heated to high temperature by the drying device <b>180</b>, is conveyed along the outer peripheral surface of the fixing drum <b>184</b> through the intermediate conveying portion <b>128</b>. In the fixing section <b>118</b>, hot air is blown to the sheet <b>122</b> from the hot air heater of the drying device <b>186</b> and the sheet <b>122</b> comes into press contact with the fixing drum <b>184</b> and the fixing roller <b>188</b>, so that the image formed on the sheet <b>122</b> is fixed to the sheet <b>122</b>. In addition, the sheet <b>122</b> passes through an opposite position that faces the in-line sensor <b>190</b>, and the check patterns or the amount of moisture, the surface temperature, the gloss level, and the like on the sheet <b>122</b> passing through the opposite position are measured.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Moreover, the sheet <b>122</b>, which has been measured by the in-line sensor <b>190</b>, is delivered to the conveying belt <b>196</b> by the transfer cylinder <b>194</b> and conveyed to the cooling section <b>200</b> by the conveying belt <b>196</b>. In the cooling section <b>200</b>, cooling air is sent to the vicinity of the plural fans <b>202</b> and the conveying belt <b>196</b> from the blow-out opening <b>204</b>B of the cooler <b>204</b>, and air is blown to the entire recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b> toward the upstream side in the conveying direction from the downstream side in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b> by the plural fans <b>202</b>. For this reason, the cooling air from the blow-out opening <b>204</b>B of the cooler <b>204</b> is efficiently blown to the recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b>, which is conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b>, by the plural fans <b>202</b>. Accordingly, the sheet <b>122</b> having been subjected to the fixing of an image (fixing temperature is in the range of, for example, 60 to 80&#xb0; C.) is cooled to about normal temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In addition, powder is sprayed to the recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b>, which is conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b>, from the powder spray device <b>210</b>. After that, the sheet <b>122</b> is discharged to the discharge tray <b>192</b>. Sheets <b>122</b> on which images have been formed by a series of the above-mentioned processes are sequentially discharged and stacked on the discharge tray <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the inkjet recording apparatus <b>1</b>, cooling air is sent from the blow-out opening <b>204</b>B of the cooler <b>204</b> provided in the cooling section <b>200</b> and air is blown to the sheet <b>122</b> by the plural fans <b>202</b> that are provided at the position at which cooling air is blown, so that the sheet <b>122</b> conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b> is cooled in a non-contact state. Accordingly, the sheets <b>122</b> having been subjected to the fixing of an image are cooled by the cooling section <b>200</b>, and thereafter are stacked on the discharge tray <b>192</b>. For this reason, since the temperature of the recording surface of the sheet <b>122</b> is low as compared to a case where a sheet <b>122</b> is stacked on the discharge tray <b>192</b> without passing through the cooling section <b>200</b> after the fixing of an image, it is possible to suppress the generation of ink transferring (set off) of sheets <b>122</b> on the discharge tray <b>192</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Further, since the leading end of the sheet <b>122</b> is held on the conveying belt <b>196</b> by the holder (gripper), it is possible to suppress the flutter of the sheet <b>122</b> by blowing air to the sheet <b>122</b> toward the upstream side in the conveying direction from the downstream side in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b> by the plural fans <b>202</b>. Furthermore, it is possible to suppress the transfer of heat from the fixing section <b>118</b> to the cooling position of the sheet <b>122</b> in the cooling section <b>200</b> by blowing air to the sheet <b>122</b> toward the upstream side in the conveying direction from the downstream side in the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b>. Moreover, since the conveying direction of the sheet <b>122</b> is opposite to the direction of the air blown from the plural fans <b>202</b>, the period of time of air being blown against the sheet <b>122</b> is increased in a relationship between the relative speed of air and the sheet <b>122</b>. Accordingly, cooling efficiency is high.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Further, since the cooler <b>204</b> is disposed above the sheet <b>122</b> conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b> and cold air from the cooler <b>204</b> goes down, it is possible to more effectively cool the image that is fixed to the sheet <b>122</b> and heated.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Meanwhile, the cooling section <b>200</b> includes the plural fans <b>202</b> and the cooler <b>204</b> in this embodiment, but is not limited thereto. As long as the cooling section can cool a sheet <b>122</b> that has been subjected to the fixing of an image and is conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b>, the structure of the cooling section may be changed to other structures. For example, a cold air blower, which blows cooling air to a sheet <b>122</b>, may be provided instead of the plural fans <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Moreover, in this embodiment, the plural fans <b>202</b> and the cooler <b>204</b> cool the sheet <b>122</b> in a non-contact state. However, a cooling device, which cools the sheet <b>122</b> with coming into contact with the sheet <b>122</b>, may be provided. For example, the sheet <b>122</b> may be cooled by a cooling roller <b>230</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) that is rotated while coming into contact with the sheet <b>122</b>. For example, a method of circulating a refrigerant in the cooling roller <b>230</b>, and the like may be applied to the cooling roller <b>230</b>. Further, it is preferable that the cooling roller <b>230</b> be drivenly rotated by the movement of the sheet <b>122</b>. Since the cooling roller <b>230</b> comes into contact with the sheet <b>122</b>, cooling efficiency is improved as compared to a non-contact type cooling method.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Further, in this embodiment, the sheet <b>122</b> has been cooled during being conveyed by the conveying belt <b>196</b>. However, the invention is not limited thereto. The sheet <b>122</b> may be cooled before being stacked on the discharge tray <b>192</b> after the fixing of an image. For example, fans may be provided at the upper portion of a side wall of the discharge tray <b>192</b>, and air may be blown against the sheet <b>122</b> in the lateral direction so as to cool the sheet <b>122</b> while the sheet <b>122</b> is discharged from the upper side to the discharge tray <b>192</b> which is provided on the lower side.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">&#x3c;Others&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The embodiment of the invention has been described above. However, the invention is not limited to the embodiment at all and it goes without saying that the invention may have various modifications without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">For example, an inkjet image forming apparatus using water-based ink where water is used as a solvent has been described in the embodiment. However, the liquid to be ejected is not limited to ink for the recording of images and the printing of characters, and various kinds of liquid may be applied as the liquid to be ejected as long as using dispersion media or a solvent permeating into a recording medium.</p>
