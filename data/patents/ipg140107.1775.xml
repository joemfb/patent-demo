            <li id="ul0003-0003" num="0006">means for extracting the needle from the patient, including a push element mounted such that it can slide in relation to the base between a needle use position and a needle extraction position;</li>
            <li id="ul0003-0004" num="0007">activatable means for generating excess pressure in the injection conduit, normally inactive,</li>

        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0009">In certain pathologies, it is necessary to inject a daily dose of liquid medication directly into a patient's organ. To that end, it is known to use an injection system including a chamber permanently implanted on the patient's chest and disposed under the skin. This chamber is extended by a catheter traveling in a blood vessel to the organ, where the drug dose must be distributed. The implantable chamber includes a reservoir having a septum that can be perforated along the contact surface of the skin.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0010">To inject the drug dose, the needle of the system is engaged through the patient's skin in the implantable chamber and the drug dose is injected into said chamber through the needle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0011">The injection system includes a holder integral with the needle. The holder is extended by a tube whereof one end is connected to the injection needle, and the other end of which is equipped with a connector making it possible to connect a syringe or a reservoir of a drug dose to be injected.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0012">To remove the needle from the implantable chamber, the practitioner grasps the holder of the device and pulls the needle out of the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0013">The force deployed by the practitioner to remove the needle is relatively significant, such that the risk of pricking by rebound phenomenon is high when the needle leaves the skin. To avoid that risk, the injection device is commonly provided with an extraction assembly comprising a needle protection structure that receives the needle when it is removed to secure the needle and prevent the practitioner from being pricked.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0014">When the needle is removed, it adheres to the septum, which rises, the inner volume of the chamber increases, thereby creating strong suction. This suction is at the catheter end that is generally located in a blood vessel. Blood then comes into the lumen of the catheter. Then, as the needle comes further out of the septum, the adhesion effect decreases, the septum then resumes its initial shape and the inner volume of the chamber decreases without reaching its initial value. A residual volume of blood then remains at the end of the catheter.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0015">This residual volume of blood causes a deposition of fibrin (or other materials) that causes, over time, a decrease in the flow rate of the implantable chambers that can go as far as obstruction. The chamber must therefore be replaced frequently.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0016">This problem was, for example described in the article &#x201c;Variations de pression induites par le retrait de l'aiguille sur une Chambre &#xe0; catheter implantable&#x201d; [&#x201c;Pressure variations caused by the removal of needles from implantable catheter chambers&#x201d;] by S. Millet, L. Mercier, L. Ronchi, published in the Annales Fran&#xe7;aises d'Anesth&#xe9;sie et de R&#xe9;animation, volume 24 2005, page 1117.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0017">To offset this problem, FR 2 886 857 A1 teaches a system of the aforementioned type, in which the means for generating an over-pressure are provided in the extraction assembly to generate an over-pressure in the injection conduit during the extraction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0018">However, with such a system, the generation of the over-pressure in the injection conduit is not optimized during removal of the needle. The means for generating the over-pressure is in fact too significant in light of the volume of blood able to penetrate the catheter during removal of the needle.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0019">The invention therefore aims to improve the generation of the over-pressure generated during a suitable phase of the removal of the needle, in order to avoid an obstruction of the catheter by greatly reducing, or even eliminating the residual volume of blood at the catheter end.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0020">To that end, the invention relates to an injection system of the aforementioned type, characterized in that the synchronization means can actuate the generating means substantially only when the free end of the needle is located in the implantable chamber, during the needle extraction phase.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0021">According to other embodiments, the injection system comprises one or several of the following features, considered alone or according to all technically possible combinations:
<ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0005" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0005-0001" num="0022">the synchronization means is capable of actuating the generating means substantially during the entire duration of the needle extraction phase, during which the free end of the needle is situated in the implantable chamber;</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0002" num="0023">said generating means comprises a flexible segment formed in the injection conduit, a cam surface integral with the push element, and a bearing surface integral with the base, to compress said flexible segment between the cam surface and the bearing surface, during sliding of the push element towards the extraction position of the needle;</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0003" num="0024">the cam surface is formed by two distinct and adjacent faces of the push element, the first face being inclined relative to the direction of movement of the push element and oriented towards the bearing surface, and the second face being substantially parallel to the direction of movement of the push element;</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0004" num="0025">the length of the orthogonal projection of the first face over the direction of movement of the push element is substantially less than or equal to the height of the implantable chamber in the direction of movement of the push element;</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0005" num="0026">the length of the second face in the direction of movement of the push element is greater than or equal to the sum of 3 mm and a securing distance between the free end of the needle in the extraction position and the lower end of the push element, the sliding of the push element towards the extraction position of the needle taking place from top to bottom;</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0006" num="0027">the incline angle between the first face and the direction of movement of the push element is between 10&#xb0; and 35&#xb0;, preferably equal to 14&#xb0;;</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0007" num="0028">the cam surface can be moved substantially perpendicular to the flexible segment during extraction of the needle;</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0008" num="0029">the injection device comprises additional means for covering the injection conduit, arranged upstream of the means for generating the over-pressure;</li>
        <li id="ul0005-0009" num="0030">the base includes a needle holder and a sleeve, said sleeve being hinged relative to the needle holder and defining a sliding passage of the push element.</li>

<p id="p-0050" num="0065">The retaining means <b>86</b> includes a channel <b>102</b> for receiving the flexible segment <b>62</b>, formed in the sleeve <b>38</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

<p id="p-0052" num="0067">The groove <b>80</b> of the rod of the push element is substantially in the direction of the channel <b>102</b> formed in the sleeve <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0068">The operation of the injection system <b>10</b> according to the invention will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0069">Initially, during the product injection, the extraction means <b>32</b> is in its inactive position and folded along the length of the central core <b>40</b> of the needle holder, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. To inject the drug dose, the needle <b>28</b> is engaged through the patient's skin <b>16</b> in the chamber <b>14</b> until the plate <b>46</b> bears on the patient's skin <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0070">The folded extraction means <b>32</b> is then not bothersome for manipulation. Moreover, the push element <b>60</b> being folded down along the central core <b>40</b>, the latter does not protrude along its entire length relative to the patient's skin <b>16</b>, such that the injection device <b>12</b>, after placement, can easily be maintained by an adhesive tape. The means <b>34</b> for generating an over-pressure is inactive.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0071">To remove the injection device <b>12</b>, the sleeve <b>38</b> and the push element <b>60</b> are tilted around axis X-X&#x2032; to be brought into the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. The practitioner then inserts the flexible segment <b>62</b> through the insertion opening <b>106</b> in the channel <b>102</b> of the sleeve, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The push element <b>60</b> is placed in the axis Y-Y&#x2032; of the main segment <b>54</b> of the needle, and the two protuberances <b>94</b> generally extend perpendicular to the axis Y-Y&#x2032;. The head <b>44</b> of the holder is received in the hollowed out push element <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0072">Next, the practitioner covers the injection conduit <b>30</b> by activating the clip <b>100</b> situated upstream of the flexible segment <b>62</b>. He then applies two fingers on either side of the sleeve <b>38</b> under the bearing-fingers <b>94</b> and pushes in the push element <b>60</b> using another finger, for example his thumb, bearing on the bearing-finger <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0073">The front end of the push element <b>60</b> bears on the patient's skin <b>16</b>, while the sleeve <b>38</b> is made to rise along the length of the push element <b>60</b>. The needle <b>28</b> is thus gradually taken inside the push element <b>60</b> until it is brought into the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In this position and due to the securing distance Ds, the main segment <b>54</b> of the needle extends completely inside the inner volume <b>70</b> of the push element and is protected, thereby avoiding any risk of accidental pricking.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0074">When the needle <b>28</b> is removed, the cam surface <b>64</b> moves towards the flexible segment <b>62</b> and perpendicular thereto. The movement of the cam surface <b>64</b> occurs in two successive steps.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0075">During the first step, the flexible segment <b>62</b> is gradually compressed between the first face <b>76</b> and the bearing surface <b>66</b>, generating an over-pressure from upstream to downstream in the conduit <b>30</b> due to the incline of the first face <b>76</b> relative to the bearing surface <b>66</b> and due to the covering of the conduit <b>30</b> upstream of the flexible segment <b>62</b> by the clip <b>100</b>. This first step is completed when the flexible segment <b>62</b> is in contact with the connecting edge <b>79</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. At the end of this first step, the portion of the flexible segment <b>62</b> disposed in the channel <b>102</b> is completely pinched between the flank <b>66</b> and the cam surface <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0076">The generation of the over-pressure from upstream to downstream in the injection conduit <b>30</b> causes a flow of liquid from upstream to downstream. This flow prevents blood from penetrating the tube <b>24</b> connected to the chamber <b>14</b> during extraction of the needle <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0077">The maximum value of the over-pressure, and consequently the injection speed of the liquid, depends on the incline angle A<b>1</b> between the first face <b>76</b> and the direction Y-Y&#x2032; of movement of the push element <b>60</b>, the inner diameter Di of the flexible segment <b>62</b> and the length Lt of the portion of the flexible segment <b>62</b> compressed between the cam surface <b>64</b> and the bearing surface <b>66</b>. For an angle A<b>1</b> equal to 14&#xb0;, an inner diameter Di equal to 2 mm and a length Lt equal to 10 mm, the injection speed is close to 8 &#x3bc;L for 2 mm of needle removal.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0078">During the second step, the flexible segment <b>62</b> is kept compressed between the second face <b>78</b> and the bearing surface <b>66</b>. The second face <b>78</b> and the bearing surface <b>66</b> being parallel, no over-pressure is generated during said second phase of the movement of the cam surface <b>64</b>. This second step is completed when the push element <b>60</b> is in the extraction position of the needle <b>28</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0079">The entire over-pressure that could be generated in the conduit <b>30</b> during removal of the needle was generated during the first step of the movement of the cam surface <b>64</b> and from the beginning of removal of the needle <b>28</b>. This first step corresponds to the duration of the extraction phase of the needle <b>28</b>, during which the free end <b>48</b> of the needle is situated in the chamber <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0080">The shape of the cam <b>64</b> makes it possible to adjust the liquid injection as a function of the removal of the needle.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0081">It will be understood that only the injection of liquid when the free end <b>48</b> of the needle is still in the chamber <b>14</b> is useful to avoid suctioning blood at the catheter end.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0082">The injection system according to the invention makes it possible to guarantee that all of the liquid contained in the portion of the flexible segment <b>62</b> intended to be compressed is injected when the free end <b>48</b> of the needle is still in the chamber <b>14</b>, the synchronization means <b>35</b> being capable of activating the generating means <b>34</b> substantially only when the free end <b>48</b> of the needle is situated in the chamber <b>14</b>, during the extraction phase of the needle <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0083">The generation of the over-pressure is thus improved by only being done during the entire duration of the extraction phase of the needle, during which the free end of the needle is situated in the chamber. The volume of liquid injected in the hose <b>24</b> connected to the chamber <b>14</b> is maximized for the portion of the flexible segment <b>62</b> intended to be compressed, in order to prevent an obstruction of the catheter by greatly reducing, or even eliminating the residual volume of blood at the catheter end.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0084">The volume useful to inject liquid is minimal and the injection system according to the invention does not require dead volume, which is a source of complications due to its difficulty in being rinsed and bled.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0085">According to another embodiment, the retaining means <b>86</b> is capable of maintaining the flexible segment <b>62</b> substantially in the direction of the main segment <b>54</b> of the needle. The compression of the flexible segment <b>62</b> is axial and in the direction of the main segment <b>54</b> of the needle. The channel <b>102</b> for receiving the flexible segment formed in the sleeve extends substantially in the direction of the main segment <b>54</b> of the needle, in the direction of axis Y-Y&#x2032;.</p>
