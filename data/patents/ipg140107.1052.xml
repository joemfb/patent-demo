<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the plastic bag <b>6</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment, each of the pair of handle portions <b>9</b> has a strip-like member. Ends of the strip-like member of each of the handle portions <b>9</b> are connected to the containing portion <b>7</b> at two positions at the edge of the opening portion <b>8</b> that are separated from each other in the front-back direction. Therefore, each of the handle portions <b>9</b> has a loop-like shape, and a space <b>9</b><i>a </i>into which a user may insert his/her finger or arm is formed. In the first exemplary embodiment, the distance between the handle portions <b>9</b> in the left-right direction is larger than the distance between connection portions <b>9</b><i>b </i>at which the handle portions <b>9</b> are connected to the containing portion <b>7</b> in the front-back direction. That is, the pair of handle portions <b>9</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment are disposed on both sides in the longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the first exemplary embodiment, the handle portions <b>9</b> are integrally formed with the containing portion <b>7</b> in order to reduce production cost.

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, each of the handle portions <b>9</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment has a length with which the handle portion <b>9</b> is allowed to protrude away from the upper surface of the printer <b>4</b>, which is a surface of the printer <b>4</b> adjacent to the passage opening <b>3</b><i>a</i>, toward the passage opening <b>3</b><i>a </i>when the plastic bag <b>6</b> containing the printer <b>4</b> is contained in the outer box <b>2</b> and the handle portion <b>9</b> is extended in an upward direction through the passage opening <b>3</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Moreover, each of the handle portions <b>9</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment has a length L<b>1</b> that is equal to or larger than half the length La of the printer <b>4</b> along the passage opening <b>3</b><i>a</i>, when the plastic bag <b>6</b> containing the printer <b>4</b> is contained in the outer box <b>2</b> and the handle portion <b>9</b> is extended in a horizontal direction along the passage opening <b>3</b><i>a</i>. That is, L<b>1</b>&#x2267;La/2, where L<b>1</b> is the length of the handle portion <b>9</b> and La is the width of the printer <b>4</b> in the longitudinal direction. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, when the passage opening <b>3</b><i>a </i>of the outer box <b>2</b> is closed, the handle portions <b>9</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment are contained in the outer box <b>2</b> in a state in which the handle portions <b>9</b> extend in the horizontal direction along the passage opening <b>3</b><i>a</i>.

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the handle portions <b>9</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment, the positions of the connection portions <b>9</b><i>b</i>, at which the handle portions <b>9</b> and the containing portion <b>7</b> are connected each other, are located at positions separated away from the surface of the printer <b>4</b> adjacent to the passage opening <b>3</b><i>a </i>toward the passage opening <b>3</b><i>a </i>when the plastic bag <b>6</b> containing the printer <b>4</b> is contained in the outer box <b>2</b> and the handle portions <b>9</b> are extended upward. That is, in the first exemplary embodiment, the size of the plastic bag <b>6</b> is determined so that corners <b>4</b><i>d </i>of the upper surface of the printer <b>4</b> are not exposed to the outside and covered with the plastic bag <b>6</b> when the printer <b>4</b> is contained in the plastic bag <b>6</b>. Therefore, when the outer box <b>2</b> is closed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, the connection portions <b>9</b><i>b </i>of the plastic bag <b>6</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment are disposed inside the corners <b>4</b><i>d </i>of the outer ends of the printer <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B</figref>, <b>3</b>, and <b>4</b>, when the handle portions <b>9</b> of the plastic bag <b>6</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment extend in the horizontal direction along the passage opening <b>3</b><i>a</i>, excess portions <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the containing portion <b>7</b> are disposed outside the connection portions <b>9</b><i>b </i>and portions <b>7</b><i>b </i>of the containing portion <b>7</b> extending along the outer surface of the printer <b>4</b>. Therefore, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when the handle portions <b>9</b> are held together (by a single hand of a user, for example), the excess portions <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the containing portion <b>7</b> are folded into strip-like shapes so as to extend along directions in which the handle portions <b>9</b> extend and along the outer surface of the printer <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 2B</figref>, in the packaging container <b>1</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment, when the printer <b>4</b> contained in the plastic bag <b>6</b> is contained in the outer box <b>2</b>, a cushioning member <b>11</b>, which is an example of a cushioning member for absorbing an external force, is disposed between the plastic bag <b>6</b> and the outer box <b>2</b>. The cushioning member <b>11</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment includes four lower cushions <b>12</b> and an upper cushion <b>13</b>. The lower cushions <b>12</b> are disposed at four corners in a bottom part of the outer box <b>2</b>. The upper cushion <b>13</b> is disposed on an upper part of the printer <b>4</b>. The upper cushion <b>13</b> includes a frame portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>and cushioning bodies <b>13</b><i>b</i>. An opening is formed in the middle of the frame portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>to reduce the weight. The cushioning bodies <b>13</b><i>b </i>are formed at four corners of a bottom surface of the frame portion <b>13</b><i>a </i>and have shapes that are vertically symmetric with the lower cushions <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the thickness and the size of the cushioning member <b>11</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment are determined so that the width of a gap S<b>1</b> between the inner surface of the outer box <b>2</b> and the outer surface of the printer <b>4</b> is 20 mm. The width of the gap S<b>1</b> is not limited to 20 mm. The width of the gap S<b>1</b> may be equal to or smaller than 30 mm, which is smaller than 40 mm used in existing packaging containers, or may be equal to or smaller than 10 mm if the processing accuracy of the cushioning member <b>11</b> allows.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The cushioning member <b>11</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment may be made of any appropriate known material, such as styrofoam or corrugated fiberboard.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Functions of First Exemplary Embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">To take out the printer <b>4</b> from the packaging container <b>1</b> according to the first exemplary embodiment, which has the structure described above, the lid portions <b>2</b><i>c </i>of the outer box <b>2</b> are opened first and the packaging container <b>1</b> enters a state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Then, the upper cushion <b>13</b> is removed. The plastic bag <b>6</b> is lifted by holding the two handle portions <b>9</b>, and the printer <b>4</b> is taken out of the packaging container together with the plastic bag <b>6</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Then, the printer <b>4</b> is moved to an installation position while holding the handle portions <b>9</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the printer <b>4</b> is taken out of the plastic bag <b>6</b> through the opening portion <b>8</b>, and the printer <b>4</b> is installed in place.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a state in which an object is being taken out of an existing packaging container.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, with the existing structure described in Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2009-35269, it is necessary for a user to insert his/her hands <b>04</b> into a space between the outer box <b>01</b> and the object <b>03</b> to take out an object <b>03</b> from the outer box <b>01</b> because the packaging bag <b>02</b> does not have handles. Therefore, the existing technology has a problem in that it is impossible for a user to insert his/her hands <b>04</b> if the gap between the outer box <b>01</b> and the object <b>03</b> is too narrow. In order to allow a user to inert his/her hands <b>04</b>, the width of the gap between the outer box <b>01</b> and the object <b>03</b> is usually set equal to or larger than about 40 mm. Therefore, in order to allow a user to insert his/her hands <b>04</b> from both sides as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the size of the outer box <b>01</b> is larger than that of the object <b>03</b> by about 40 mm&#xd7;2=80 mm, so that there is a problem in that the size of the package box <b>01</b> is increased.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In contrast, with the first exemplary embodiment, the plastic bag <b>6</b>, which is used to cover the outer surface of the printer <b>4</b> to protect the printer <b>4</b> from dust, has the handle portions <b>9</b>, so that it is possible for a user to take the printer <b>4</b> out of the packaging container <b>1</b> by holding the handle portions <b>9</b> and lifting the plastic bag <b>6</b>. Therefore, the gap S<b>1</b> between the outer box <b>2</b> and the printer <b>4</b> may be narrower than that of existing packaging containers, so that it is possible to reduce the size of the outer box <b>2</b> as compared with existing packaging containers. By reducing the size of the outer box <b>2</b>, it is possible to store a larger number of packaging containers in a warehouse, the area needed to store the packaging containers is reduced, and the cost of storing the packaging containers is reduced. Moreover, by reducing the size of the outer box <b>2</b>, the volume of the outer box <b>2</b> discarded after installing the printer <b>4</b> is reduced, which leads to waste reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">With the existing technology, when handling an object that is relatively large and heavy, such as the printer <b>4</b>, it is necessary for an operator to lift the object with both hands to take out the object from the outer box <b>2</b>. Therefore, if there is large friction between the printer <b>4</b> and the outer box <b>2</b> due to static electricity or the like, it is difficult for a single operator to hold the outer box <b>2</b> with his/her hands occupied. In such a case, two operators are necessary, so that the operability is impaired.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In contrast, with the first exemplary embodiment, it is possible for an operator to hold the two handle portions <b>9</b> with one hand and take out the printer <b>4</b> while holding the outer box <b>2</b> with another hand. As a result, the operability is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In particular, because L<b>1</b>&#x2267;La/2 is satisfied in the first exemplary embodiment, when the lid portions <b>2</b><i>c </i>of the outer box <b>2</b> are closed, the handle portions <b>9</b> are containable in the outer box <b>2</b> so as to overlap in the up-down direction as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Therefore, after the upper cushion <b>13</b> has been removed, a user may easily insert his/her hand into the spaces <b>9</b><i>a </i>of the two handle portions <b>9</b> that overlap in the up-down direction. As a result, as compared with the case where the handle portions <b>9</b> are not contained in the outer box <b>2</b> in an overlapping manner, the two handle portions <b>9</b> may be easily held with a single hand.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, in the first exemplary embodiment, the size of the plastic bag <b>6</b> has a margin when the printer <b>4</b> is contained in the plastic bag <b>6</b>, so that the containing portion <b>7</b> has the excess portions <b>7</b><i>a </i>when the handle portions <b>9</b> are held and lifted. The excess portions <b>7</b><i>a </i>of the containing portion <b>7</b> are disposed so as to overlap the outer sides of the portions <b>7</b><i>b </i>of the containing portion <b>7</b> extending along the outer surface of the printer <b>4</b>. The strength of the plastic bag <b>6</b> is increased because a force that is generated when the handle portions <b>9</b> are held and lifted is applied to both the excess portions <b>7</b><i>a </i>and the portions <b>7</b><i>b </i>extending along the outer surface. Therefore, the plastic bag <b>6</b> is not easily broken when the handle portions <b>9</b> are held and lifted, and occurrence of an accident such that the plastic bag <b>6</b> is broken and the printer <b>4</b> is dropped and broken during operation is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In particular, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, in the first exemplary embodiment, when the printer <b>4</b> is contained in the outer box <b>2</b>, the excess portions <b>7</b><i>a </i>have strip-like shapes and extend along the outer sides of the portions <b>7</b><i>b </i>extending along the outer surface of the printer <b>4</b>. Therefore, when the handle portions <b>9</b> are lifted in this state, strip-shaped portions in which the excess portions <b>7</b><i>a </i>and the portions <b>7</b><i>b </i>extending along the outer surface of the printer <b>4</b> overlap are naturally and easily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the first exemplary embodiment, the two handle portions <b>9</b> are disposed so as to be separated from each other in the longitudinal direction. As compared with the case where the handle portions <b>9</b> are disposed on both sides in the transversal direction, the excess portions <b>7</b><i>a </i>are easily formed into large strips. Therefore, as compared with the case where the handle portions <b>9</b> are disposed on both sides in the transversal direction, the plastic bag <b>6</b> is not easily broken.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the first exemplary embodiment, the connection portions <b>9</b><i>b </i>between the handle portions <b>9</b> and the containing portion <b>7</b> are disposed above the corners <b>4</b><i>d </i>of the printer <b>4</b>, so that the corners <b>4</b><i>d </i>are not exposed to the outside when the printer <b>4</b> is contained in the plastic bag <b>6</b>. Therefore, as compared with the case where the corners <b>4</b><i>d </i>of the printer <b>4</b> are exposed to the outside, the printer <b>4</b> is not easily dropped out of the containing portion <b>7</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">With the packaging container <b>1</b> according to the third exemplary embodiment, which has the structure described above, when a user holds the handle portions <b>9</b> of the plastic bag <b>6</b> and lifts the plastic bag <b>6</b>, the cushioning member <b>11</b> is taken out of the packaging container <b>1</b> together with the printer <b>4</b>. When the user takes out the plastic bag <b>6</b> out of the outer box <b>2</b> and carries the plastic bag <b>6</b> to an installation position of the printer <b>4</b> by holding the handle portions <b>9</b>, the plastic bag <b>6</b> may contact a desk, slip off a user's hand, or a shock may be applied to the plastic bag <b>6</b> if handled roughly. Even in such a case, breakage or the like of the printer <b>4</b> is reduced because the shock is absorbed by the cushioning member <b>11</b>. In the third exemplary embodiment, the plastic bag <b>6</b> is in contact with the inner surface of the outer box <b>2</b>. Therefore, it is expected that the friction is small as compared with the case where the cushioning member <b>11</b> is in contact with the inner surface of the outer box <b>2</b>.
