<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention is related generally to biopsy devices and, more particularly, to an improved process of manufacturing a needle assembly for use with a biopsy device for acquiring a tissue sample.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancerous tumors, pre-malignant conditions, and other disorders has long been an area of intense investigation. Non-invasive methods for examining tissue include palpation, thermography, PET, SPECT, Nuclear imaging, X-ray, MRI, CT, and ultrasound imaging. When the physician suspects that tissue may contain cancerous cells, a biopsy may be done either in an open procedure or in a percutaneous procedure. For an open procedure, a scalpel is used by the surgeon to create a large incision in the tissue in order to provide direct viewing and access to the tissue mass of interest. Removal of the entire mass (excisional biopsy) or a part of the mass (incisional biopsy) is performed. For a percutaneous biopsy, a needle-like instrument is inserted through a very small incision to access the tissue mass of interest and to obtain a tissue sample for later examination and analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The advantages of the percutaneous method as compared to the open method are significant: less recovery time for the patient, less pain, less surgical time, lower cost, less risk of injury to adjacent bodily tissues such as nerves, and less disfigurement of the patient's anatomy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally there are two ways to percutaneously obtain a portion of tissue from within the body: aspiration and core sampling. Aspiration of the tissue through a fine needle requires the tissue to be fragmented into pieces small enough to be withdrawn in a fluid medium. This method is less intrusive than other known sampling techniques, but one may only examine cells in the liquid (cytology) and not the cells and the structure (pathology). In core sampling, a core or fragment of tissue is obtained for histologic examination and/or genetic tests, which may be done via a frozen or paraffin section. The type of biopsy used depends mainly on various factors present in the patient, and no single procedure is ideal for all cases. However, core biopsies seem to be more widely used by physicians.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The following patent documents are incorporated herein by reference for the purpose of illustrating biopsy devices and methods: U.S. Pat. No. 5,526,822 issued Jun. 18, 1996; U.S. Pat. No. 5,895,401 issued Apr. 20, 1999; U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,544 issued Jul. 11, 2000; U.S. Pat. No. 6,620,111 issued Sep. 16, 2003; U.S. Pat. No. 6,626,849 issued Sep. 30, 2003; U.S. Pat. No. 6,638,235 issued Oct 28, 2003; US Patent Application 2003/0109803 published Jun. 12, 2003; US Patent Application 2003/0199753 published Oct. 23, 2003; US Patent Application 2003/0199754 published Oct. 23, 2003; US Patent Application 2003/0199785 published Oct. 23, 2003; and U.S. Ser. No. 08/825,899 filed on Apr. 2, 1997.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is known in the art to use a double lumen biopsy needle incorporating vacuum suction to obtain a tissue sample. With devices of this type, the needle is inserted into a small incision in a patient and is advanced through tissue until the needle is adjacent the tissue of interest. At that point, a vacuum source may be activated, providing suction inside one of the two lumens. The suction is communicated to the second lumen via a passage between the two lumens. The second lumen may contain an aperture through which suspicious tissue may be drawn when the vacuum source is activated. Once tissue is drawn into the aperture, the surgeon may advance a cutter through the second lumen in order to excise a sample from the tissue of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">While biopsy needles of the type described above are useful in obtaining tissue samples, the processes known in the art for manufacturing these needles are often expensive and labor-intensive due to the number of components and steps involved. For instance, certain biopsy needles provide a double lumen structure formed of two separate rigid structures, thus requiring a reliable method of attaching the two structures, such as a weld or adhesive, along the entire length of the lumens. Similarly, many biopsy needles include a sharpened feature on the leading end of the needle that cuts through tissue as the needle is advanced into the body. These sharpened tips often have small components and/or features that require significant time and expense to make and attach to the needle. Further, biopsy needles often include a mounting component that allows the needle to be attached to a handle or other platform. Often, these mounting components are manufactured separately from the body of the needle, and must be joined together after formation, such as by gluing, a process that is heavily reliant on the skill and concentration of a human worker. Even if a more reliable method of attaching the mounting component to the needle is used, such as induction heating or heat staking, such methods still involve the added expense necessitated by the extra assembly equipment as well as the steps of manufacturing the mounting component and attaching it to the needle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Accordingly, while double lumen biopsy needles are known in the art, there exists a significant need for a process of manufacturing a biopsy needle that reduces the number of components that must be separately manufactured, as well as the time and labor that must be expended in manufacturing and assembling the components of the biopsy needle, while still maintaining the necessary strength and rigidity for safe and satisfactory performance during surgery.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The process of the current invention overcomes the above-noted and other deficiencies of the prior art by providing a process for manufacturing a biopsy needle device that reduces the number of components that must be separately manufactured and assembled, thereby reducing the cost of manufacturing the biopsy needle device while maintaining the necessary biomechanical properties.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect consistent with the present invention, a process of manufacturing a biopsy needle may comprise the steps of forming an aperture for receiving tissue to be sampled in an exterior surface of an elongated tube that has a proximal and distal portion, wherein the elongated tube may be configured to receive a cutter; forming a hole in the exterior surface of the elongated tube; and applying a coating of material over the elongated tube to form a lumen for receiving vacuum on the exterior surface of the elongated tube, wherein the hole in the exterior surface of the elongated tube may be adapted to provide communication between an interior of the elongated tube and an interior of the lumen. This process advantageously allows the vacuum lumen to be formed over the elongated tube without requiring separate manufacturing and assembly steps, thus reducing assembly costs.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another version, the process of manufacturing the biopsy needle device may comprise the steps of forming an aperture for receiving tissue to be sampled in an exterior surface of an elongated tube, wherein the elongated tube may be adapted to receive a cutter and may further comprise a proximal portion and a distal portion; forming a hole in the exterior surface of the elongated tube; and placing the elongated tube in a mold and injecting the mold with a material, wherein the mold may be configured such that the material forms a lumen for receiving vacuum on the exterior surface of the elongated tube, and wherein further the hole in the exterior surface of the elongated tube may be adapted to provide communication between an interior of the elongated tube and the interior of the lumen. This version advantageously provides for the formation of a vacuum lumen on an elongated tube by overmolding a coating of material onto the elongated tube, avoiding the need to separately manufacture the vacuum lumen and then attach it to the elongated tube. Further, this process may provide for a stronger attachment between the vacuum lumen and the elongated tube than some previously known methods of attachment of the two components.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another aspect, the process of manufacturing a biopsy needle device may comprise the steps of placing a cutter tube, which may comprise a port adapted to receive a tissue sample and may further comprise a cutter lumen adapted to receive a cutter, in a mold; injecting a material in a liquid state into the mold; cooling the material in order to convert it to a solid state; wherein the mold may be configured to cause the material to form a lumen for receiving vacuum on an exterior surface of the cutter tube, and wherein further the vacuum lumen is in communication with the cutter lumen.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention also extends to a biopsy instrument manufactured according to a process that may comprise the steps of forming an aperture for receiving tissue to be sampled in an exterior surface of an elongated tube for receiving a cutter, wherein the elongated tube may have a proximal portion and a distal portion; forming a hole in the exterior surface of the elongated tube; and applying a coating of material over the elongated tube to form a lumen for receiving vacuum on the exterior surface of the elongated tube, and wherein the hole in the exterior surface of the elongated tube may be adapted to provide communication between an interior of the elongated tube and an interior of the lumen.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a hand-held vacuum-assisted biopsy device <b>10</b> comprising a handle <b>20</b> detachably connected to a needle assembly <b>30</b> having a proximal portion <b>32</b> and a distal portion <b>34</b> manufactured according to a version of the process of the current invention. Together, they constitute a lightweight, ergonomically-shaped, hand-manipulated biopsy device <b>10</b>. In one aspect, needle assembly <b>30</b> may be part of a disposable probe that may mount on handle <b>20</b>. In one aspect, hand-held biopsy device <b>10</b> may be used in conjunction with an ultrasound to guide needle assembly <b>30</b>. Since handle <b>20</b> may be manipulated by the operator's hand, the operator may steer needle assembly <b>30</b> with great freedom towards the tissue mass of interest. The surgeon has tactile feedback while doing so and may therefore ascertain to a significant degree the density and hardness of the tissue being encountered. In addition, handle <b>20</b> may be held approximately parallel to the chest wall of a patient for obtaining tissue portions closer to the chest wall than may be obtained when needle assembly <b>30</b> is attached to another type of device. Alternatively, needle assembly <b>30</b> may be attached to an electromechanical arm, a platform, a table or other suitable support. Such alternative mountings may be used in conjunction with applications in which the needle assembly is guided by stereotactic (x-ray) or MRI modalities.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As controls for obtaining a tissue sample, handle <b>20</b> may include a forward button <b>36</b> which may be used to move a cutter <b>38</b> distally through a cutter lumen <b>40</b> to sever a sample of suspicious tissue collected in a tissue-receiving port <b>42</b>. Handle <b>20</b> may further include a reverse button <b>44</b> which may be used to move cutter <b>38</b> proximally through cutter lumen <b>40</b>, thereby moving the tissue sample in port <b>42</b> to a tissue collection surface <b>46</b>. A vacuum button <b>48</b> on handle <b>20</b> may be used to open or close a first vacuum line <b>50</b> for communicating suction to a vacuum lumen <b>52</b> so as to cause tissue to become disposed within port <b>42</b> and a second vacuum line <b>54</b> for communicating axial suction to cutter <b>38</b> to aid in withdrawal of a severed tissue sample.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, a needle assembly <b>30</b> made by one version of the process of the current invention for use with a biopsy device <b>10</b> is illustrated. Cutter lumen <b>40</b> may comprise a proximal portion <b>56</b> and a distal portion <b>58</b>. Cutter lumen <b>40</b> forms a smooth, uninterrupted passage for receiving cutter <b>38</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>) such that it may be advanced through the proximal portion <b>56</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b> to the distal portion <b>58</b>. Tissue-receiving port <b>42</b> may be formed in an exterior surface <b>60</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b>. Port <b>42</b> may be located on the distal portion <b>58</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b>. Cutter lumen <b>40</b> may also comprise an open proximal end <b>62</b> and an open distal end <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Vacuum lumen <b>52</b> may comprise a proximal portion <b>66</b> and a distal portion <b>68</b>. In one version, cutter lumen <b>40</b> may be oriented above vacuum lumen <b>52</b>. A vacuum source (not pictured) may be attached to vacuum lumen <b>52</b>, possibly at proximal portion <b>66</b> thereof, via first vacuum line <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The needle assembly <b>30</b> may also include one or more passages, also called interlumen vacuum holes <b>70</b>, between cutter lumen <b>40</b> and vacuum lumen <b>52</b>. When the vacuum source is activated, thereby providing suction in vacuum lumen <b>52</b>, interlumen vacuum holes <b>70</b> allow that suction to be communicated into cutter lumen <b>40</b>. As best illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 11</figref>, the interlumen vacuum holes <b>70</b> may be located between cutter lumen <b>40</b> and vacuum lumen <b>52</b> opposite the tissue-receiving port <b>42</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a cutter stop <b>72</b> may also be located in cutter lumen <b>40</b> distally of tissue-receiving port <b>42</b>. A face <b>74</b> of cutter stop <b>72</b> may provide a cutting surface for severing a tissue sample. Face <b>74</b> of cutter stop <b>72</b> may be designed to match the leading profile of cutter <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>). Depending on the means used to advance cutter <b>38</b>, cutter stop <b>72</b> may also provide tactile feedback to a surgeon once cutter <b>38</b> comes into contact with cutter stop <b>72</b> after a sample has been severed. However, if, as known in the art, a computer software program is used to control advancement of cutter <b>38</b>, the surgeon will not be provided with tactile feedback by contact between cutter <b>38</b> and cutter stop <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a hub <b>76</b> having a proximal portion <b>78</b> and a distal portion <b>80</b> may be located on proximal portion <b>32</b> of needle assembly <b>30</b>. Hub <b>76</b> assists in mounting needle assembly <b>30</b> to handle <b>20</b> or other any other suitable support. Hub <b>76</b> may detachably mount on handle <b>20</b> in order to allow disposable needle assembly <b>30</b> to be removed from the multiple-use handle <b>20</b> after surgery. Hub <b>76</b> may also include a flange <b>82</b> on its distal portion <b>80</b>. Flange <b>82</b> may snap into a rib or similar retaining element (not shown) of handle <b>20</b> or another suitable support. Hub <b>76</b> may also include a vacuum manifold <b>84</b> that provides a connection between the vacuum source and vacuum lumen <b>52</b>. Hub <b>76</b> may also allow second vacuum line <b>54</b> to connect with cutter <b>38</b> so that axial suction may be communicated to cutter <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In one aspect consistent with the process of the current invention, a distal tissue-piercing tip <b>86</b> having a proximal portion <b>88</b> and a distal portion <b>90</b> may be disposed on distal portion <b>34</b> of needle assembly <b>30</b>. As best pictured in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, distal portion <b>90</b> of distal tissue-piercing tip <b>86</b> may include a cutting edge <b>92</b> of sufficient sharpness to cut through human tissue and thereby aid in moving needle assembly <b>30</b> adjacent to the tissue of interest. The junction of piercing tip <b>86</b> and cutter lumen <b>40</b> may include a tapered profile <b>94</b> therebetween that further assists needle assembly <b>30</b> in moving smoothly through a patient's tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Piercing tip <b>86</b>, particularly the distal portion <b>90</b>, may comprise a substantially flat blade formed of any suitable material. Piercing tip <b>86</b> may also include tabs <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, <b>11</b>) on proximal portion <b>88</b> thereof to aid in the attachment of piercing tip <b>86</b> to cutter lumen <b>40</b>. Tab <b>96</b> may be located above tab <b>98</b>. In one version, tab <b>98</b> extends further toward proximal end <b>62</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b> than does tab <b>96</b> for reasons addressed below. Piercing tip <b>86</b> may also include an opening <b>100</b>, to aid in formation of tapered profile <b>94</b>, which is also discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In operation, needle assembly <b>30</b> may be inserted into a small incision in the body. When utilized, tissue-piercing tip <b>86</b> helps needle assembly <b>30</b> penetrate through tissue until distal portion <b>34</b> of needle assembly <b>30</b> is located adjacent the tissue of interest. Piercing tip <b>86</b>, along with tapered profile <b>94</b>, may help to minimize tissue drag experienced during insertion and extraction of needle assembly <b>30</b>. Once needle assembly <b>30</b> is properly positioned relative to the tissue of interest, vacuum suction may be applied to vacuum lumen <b>52</b> via first vacuum line <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Suction may be communicated from vacuum lumen <b>52</b> to cutter lumen <b>40</b> via the interlumen vacuum holes <b>70</b>. The suction inside cutter lumen <b>40</b> actively pulls suspicious tissue into tissue-receiving port <b>42</b>. Once the suspicious tissue has been drawn into cutter lumen <b>40</b> through port <b>42</b>, the surgeon may advance cutter <b>38</b> in the distal direction until a sample is severed from the suspicious tissue. Cutter stop <b>72</b> may be located in cutter lumen <b>40</b> distally of tissue-receiving port <b>42</b> to provide a cutting surface to aid cutter <b>38</b> in severing a sample of suspicious tissue. Once the sample has been severed, cutter <b>38</b> may contact cutter stop <b>72</b>. As mentioned above, depending on the means used to advance cutter <b>38</b> through cutter lumen <b>40</b>, contact between cutter <b>38</b> and cutter stop <b>72</b> may provide tactile feedback to the surgeon, indicating that a sample has been obtained and that cutter <b>38</b> may be withdrawn toward proximal end <b>62</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b>. Once cutter <b>38</b> contacts cutter stop <b>72</b>, needle assembly <b>30</b> may be repositioned in the patient's body (e.g., rotated, longitudinally translated) in order to obtain another sample.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As mentioned above, cutter <b>38</b> may be attached to second vacuum line <b>54</b>, thereby providing cutter <b>38</b> with axial suction. After a sample has been obtained, and before a second sample is drawn into port <b>42</b>, axial suction, if utilized, may assist cutter <b>38</b> in pulling the sample through cutter lumen <b>40</b> as cutter <b>38</b> is withdrawn. Once cutter <b>38</b> has been withdrawn from cutter lumen <b>40</b>, the sample may be cleared from cutter <b>38</b> onto the tissue collection surface <b>46</b> located on handle <b>20</b> or platform. At that point, another sample may be obtained by applying vacuum to draw a sample into port <b>42</b> and advancing cutter <b>38</b> to sever the sample. This procedure may be repeated until the desired number of samples has been acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one aspect consistent with the process of the current invention, cutter lumen <b>40</b> may comprise a preformed tube open at each end and cut to the desired length of needle assembly <b>30</b>. The preformed tube may be advantageously straight and round for receiving cutter <b>38</b>. The material of the preformed tube may be rigid to allow insertion of needle assembly <b>30</b> through tissue with minimal deflection. In one version, cutter lumen <b>40</b> may be made of metal. More particularly, cutter lumen <b>40</b> may be made of stainless steel. Cutter lumen <b>40</b> may also be made from other suitable materials, including but not limited to titanium, titanium alloy, aluminum, or aluminum alloy. Alternatively, cutter lumen <b>40</b> may be made from nonmetallic materials having structural characteristics sufficient to allow a coating of material to be applied over cutter lumen <b>40</b> and having the strength and rigidity characteristics sufficient to withstand the force experienced by cutter lumen <b>40</b> when it is pressed through human tissue.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Tissue-receiving port <b>42</b> and interlumen vacuum holes <b>70</b> may be cut into the preformed tube comprising cutter lumen <b>40</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the distal and proximal edges of port <b>42</b> may be cut on an angle relative to the longitudinal edges of port <b>42</b>. The angling of these edges can produce a scissoring effect as needle assembly <b>30</b> is pushed through tissue, aiding in positioning the device <b>10</b>. In addition, a pair of notches <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) may be cut into distal end <b>64</b> of the preformed tube comprising cutter lumen <b>40</b> to provide points of attachment for piercing tip <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Piercing tip <b>86</b> may be formed of a material providing sufficient strength and rigidity to allow it to move through tissue with minimal deflection. In one version, tip <b>86</b>, including the above-described features included thereon, may be stamped from metal sheet stock. More particularly, the metal may be <b>440</b>A stainless steel. However, other suitable materials may be used, including but not limited to titanium, titanium alloy, aluminum, or aluminum alloy. Non-metallic materials, such as MRI compatible resins, including but not limited to Ultem and Vectra, may be used to form tip <b>86</b>. Likewise, tip <b>86</b> may also be formed from ceramics or glass. By stamping piercing tip <b>86</b> out of metal sheet stock, cutting edge <b>92</b> may be sharpened prior to attachment of tip <b>86</b> to cutter lumen <b>40</b>. Cutting edge <b>92</b> may be sharpened after formation of tip <b>86</b> by grinding perpendicular to cutting edge <b>92</b>, which is sometimes thought to be advantageous in producing a sharp cutting surface. Alternatively, cutting edge <b>92</b> may be sharpened by any other suitable method known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Piercing tip <b>86</b> may be attached to cutter lumen <b>40</b>. In one version, piercing tip <b>86</b> may be welded to cutter lumen <b>40</b>. More particularly, piercing tip <b>86</b> may be laser welded to cutter lumen <b>40</b>. In one version, piercing tip <b>86</b> may be welded to cutter lumen <b>40</b> at two preformed locations. Tabs <b>96</b>, <b>98</b> of piercing tip <b>86</b> may each be welded inside the notches <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b>. Alternatively, piercing tip <b>86</b> may be attached to cutter lumen <b>40</b> through any suitable method known in the art that provides satisfactory strength of attachment between tip <b>86</b> and cutter lumen <b>40</b>, including but not limited to adhesive, press-fit, or screws.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Other features of needle assembly <b>30</b> may be formed by applying a coating of material over cutter lumen <b>40</b>. The coating of material may be applied to cutter lumen <b>40</b> as a liquid, and then hardened to the necessary rigidity for use in the human body after formation of the desired features thereon. In one version depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the coating of material may be applied to cutter lumen <b>40</b> by injection molding. In this version, a mold <b>103</b> is designed such that the injected material may flow into predetermined cavities and form the desired features over cutter lumen <b>40</b>, including but not limited to vacuum lumen <b>52</b> and hub <b>76</b>. The gates (not pictured) through which the material is injected into the mold may be located along the mold part line, shown as P<sub>L </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Further, the gates may be located in the mold <b>103</b> underneath cutter lumen <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this version, when the material is injected into the mold <b>103</b>, it may form an outer sheath <b>106</b> over cutter lumen <b>40</b>, as well as tapered profile <b>94</b> between piercing tip <b>86</b> and cutter lumen <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b>, <b>10</b>, <b>11</b>). To assist in formation of tapered profile <b>94</b>, piercing tip <b>86</b> may include opening <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) through which the injected material may flow. Flow of injected material through opening <b>100</b> from each side of tip <b>86</b> may strengthen attachment of the injected material to piercing tip <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The mold <b>103</b> may also be shaped so that the applied material forms hub <b>76</b>, flange <b>82</b>, and vacuum manifold <b>84</b> over proximal portion <b>56</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b>. The mold <b>103</b> may also be designed so that hub <b>76</b> extends past proximal end <b>62</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b> in order to facilitate the mounting of needle assembly <b>30</b> to handle <b>20</b> or another suitable support. Alternatively, hub <b>76</b>, including flange <b>82</b> and vacuum manifold <b>84</b> may be formed separately from the remainder of needle assembly <b>30</b> and be attached by gluing, press-fitting or any other suitable method known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, prior to application of the coating of material, a slide <b>108</b> may be placed along exterior surface <b>60</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b>, substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis thereof. More particularly, slide <b>108</b> may be placed on the underside of exterior surface <b>60</b>. The material then coats cutter lumen <b>40</b> and slide <b>108</b>, forming vacuum lumen <b>52</b> substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis of cutter lumen <b>40</b>. Slide <b>108</b> also serves to prevent the applied material from blocking interlumen vacuum holes <b>70</b>. The mold <b>103</b> may also be designed so that slide <b>108</b> may be placed in alternate locations in order to orient vacuum lumen <b>52</b> above or to either side of cutter lumen <b>40</b>, so long as at least one interlumen vacuum hole <b>70</b> is present between vacuum lumen <b>52</b> and cutter lumen <b>40</b> to allow suction to be communicated therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">While use of slide <b>108</b> is one process for forming vacuum lumen <b>52</b> in the coating of material applied over cutter lumen <b>40</b>, it is recognized that other methods of forming vacuum lumen <b>52</b> in the coating of material are also possible. For example, vacuum lumen <b>52</b> could be drilled out of the coating of material after the material reaches sufficient hardness.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, in one version consistent with the invention, the coating of material provides the combined cutter lumen <b>40</b> and vacuum lumen <b>52</b> with an egg-shaped frontal cross-section <b>110</b>. During surgery, cross-section <b>110</b> promotes efficient motion of the needle assembly <b>30</b> through tissue. However, it is recognized that the application of a coating of material to cutter lumen <b>40</b> may provide needle assembly <b>30</b> with cross-sections of various shapes that are consistent with the process of the current invention. Further, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, slide <b>108</b> may comprise a scoop-shaped cross-section <b>111</b> that provides vacuum lumen <b>52</b> with a generally scoop-shaped frontal cross-section <b>112</b>. While this is helpful in providing the combined cutter lumen <b>40</b> and vacuum lumen <b>52</b> with the egg-shaped frontal cross-section <b>110</b> described above, vacuum lumen <b>52</b> and slide <b>108</b> could comprise various frontal cross-sections that are consistent with the process of the current invention. For instance, slide <b>108</b> could have a circular frontal cross-section, thus providing vacuum lumen <b>52</b> with a circular frontal cross-section.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, tab <b>98</b> on piercing tip <b>86</b> may be elongated and slope downward in the proximal direction. In addition to serving as a point of attachment for welding piercing tip <b>86</b> to cutter lumen <b>40</b>, tab <b>98</b> may also align and help hold slide <b>108</b> in place during molding.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Prior to application of the material to cutter lumen <b>40</b>, a slide <b>112</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) may be inserted into tissue-receiving port <b>42</b>. Slide <b>112</b> prevents any of the applied material from entering port <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, an axial slide <b>114</b> having a proximal end <b>116</b> and a distal end <b>118</b> may be inserted into open proximal end <b>62</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b> prior to application of the coating of material. Axial slide <b>114</b> prevents the applied material from entering proximal end <b>62</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b>. Further, axial slide <b>114</b> may be of a predetermined length such that distal end <b>118</b> extends into cutter lumen <b>40</b> distally of tissue-receiving port <b>42</b> but does not reach open distal end <b>64</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b>. Distal end <b>118</b> of slide <b>114</b> may further comprise an indentation <b>120</b>. Piercing tip <b>86</b> may be attached to distal end <b>64</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b> in a manner that does not prevent material from flowing into open distal end <b>64</b> during application of the material over cutter lumen <b>40</b>. Accordingly, during the application process, material flows into open distal end <b>64</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b> and into indentation <b>120</b> in axial slide <b>114</b>, thereby forming cutter stop <b>72</b> in cutter lumen <b>40</b> distally of tissue-receiving port <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Additionally, in one version of the present invention, one or more slides may be placed against exterior surface <b>60</b> of cutter lumen <b>40</b> in order to hold cutter lumen <b>40</b> in position while the material is applied over cutter lumen <b>40</b> and prevent deformation due to the pressure of the applied material against exterior surface <b>60</b>. As a result, outer sheath <b>106</b> may include windows <b>122</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) through which cutter lumen <b>40</b> is exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The injected material may be selected from materials including, but not limited to, plastics, thermoplastics, thermoresins, and polymers. For instance, the molded features may be formed of a liquid crystal polymer or a glass reinforced polymer. One suitable material is a glass reinforced liquid crystal polymer such as VECTRA A130 available from Ticona Corp. In one version, the injected material may have a melt flow index of at least about 10 grams/minute, more particularly at least about 15 grams/minute. Without being limited by theory, such a mold flow index is thought to be beneficial for molding relatively long, thin-walled cross-sections.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">While various versions of the present invention have been shown and described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that such alternatives are provided by way of example only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from the present invention. Additionally, each component or element may be described in terms of a means for performing the component's function. Accordingly, it is intended that the invention be limited only by the spirit and scope of the appended claims.</p>
