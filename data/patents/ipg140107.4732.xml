<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a speaker, and more particularly, to an electrostatic speaker having a dual electrodes structure, in which a multilayer structure is formed inside a diaphragm assembly, a driving signal, which is generated by amplifying an audio signal, is applied to dual electrodes, the audio signal is rectified, and a bias voltage is applied to the diaphragm assembly.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Generally, when a call signal is received from another person, a mobile communication device outputs via a speaker a ring tone or a melody to notify the user of the reception of the call signal.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, as various functions, e.g., MP3 playback, digital multimedia broadcasting (DMB) service, games, etc., are embedded in mobile communication devices, the performance of speakers of mobile communication devices has become very important.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A speaker is a device for converting electric energy to mechanical energy by using a voice coil placed within a gap. The conversion takes place according to the Fleming's left hand rule, which states that, if a conductor via which a current is flowing is in a magnetic field, a force is applied to the conductor. In other words, a current signal of various frequencies is applied to a voice coil, the voice coil generates mechanical energy according to the intensity and frequency of the current and makes a diaphragm attached to the voice coil oscillate, and thus, a sound pressure of a predetermined magnitude audible to the human ear is generated. A device which generates a relatively low sound pressure and is used close to the human ear is generally referred to as a receiver, whereas a device which generates a relatively high sound pressure and is used a predetermined distance away from the human ear is referred to as a speaker.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Speakers may be categorized according to their structures into, for example, a cone type, a flat-panel type in which a voice coil is directly attached to a diaphragm, a dome type which uniformly spreads reproduced sound, a hone type which is for a megaphone and has high directivity, a ribbon type which precisely reproduces sound characteristics, an electrostatic type (condenser type) which outputs fine sound and has a relatively small size, etc. Furthermore, according to sound quality, speakers may be categorized into a woofer, a tweeter, and a mid-range unit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An electrostatic speaker includes an audio signal electrode plate and a diaphragm. A high voltage is applied to the diaphragm, which is formed of a material with high surface resistance, and thus, the diaphragm can store positive or negative charges. An electrostatic attraction takes place between positive and negative charges between a stator, which is an audio signal electrode, and the diaphragm. An audio signal electrode plate, which is continuously changed according to audio signals, pushes the diaphragm at one side and pulls the diaphragm at another side, and thus, the diaphragm oscillates. The oscillation is reproduced as sound. An audio signal is converted into high pressure by an audio transformer, which is then applied to an audio signal electrode plate. The closer a distance between the audio signal electrode and the diaphragm is or the larger a voltage difference is, a greater force is generated, but there is a restriction. The restriction is a natural discharging phenomenon due to a high voltage difference. Therefore, it is impossible to infinitely increase a voltage difference or to arrange the audio signal electrode and the diaphragm too close to each other. Furthermore, it is necessary to consider a sufficient distance between the audio signal electrode and the diaphragm to reproduce the entire audible frequency band.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a conventional electrostatic speaker, a single electrode plate is arranged, and a diaphragm has a single structure. Therefore, the conventional electrostatic speaker has relatively low sensitivity and low charging density. Furthermore, since a separate external power supply for a diaphragm is required, there are limits in designing an electrostatic speaker.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">Technical Problem</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides an electrostatic speaker which adopts a dual electrode structure, has the multilayer structure formed inside a diaphragm assembly, and is provided with a driving chip that applies a bias voltage to the diaphragm assembly by rectifying an audio signal after applying a driving signal that has amplified the audio signal to the dual electrodes, where the electrostatic speaker does not require any external power and is also capable of maintaining relatively high sensitivity by enhancing the charge density.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Technical Solution</heading>

<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the diaphragm assembly, a conductive layer is formed, insulation layers are formed on both surfaces of the conductive layer, and charging diaphragms are respectively formed on surfaces of the insulation layers.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The second electrode may form a cover-integrated structure by being attached to is the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The electrostatic speaker further includes a driving chip for applying a driving signal generated by amplifying an audio signal to the first electrode and the second electrode, rectifying the audio signal, and applying a bias voltage to the diaphragm assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The driving chip includes an interface unit for receiving inputs of analog or digital audio signals; a signal processing unit for processing signals input via the interface unit; an amplifying unit for driving the first electrode and the second electrode by amplifying the processed audio signal; a rectifying unit for rectifying the audio signal output by the amplifying unit and applying the rectified audio signal to the diaphragm assembly; and a stabilizing unit for detecting a voltage applied to the diaphragm assembly and stabilizing the voltage.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Advantageous Effects</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As described above, according to embodiments of the present invention, a dual electrodes structure is employed, a multilayer structure is formed inside a diaphragm assembly, and a driving chip for applying a driving signal generated by amplifying an audio signal to dual electrodes, rectifying the audio signal, and applying a bias voltage to the diaphragm assembly is employed. As a result, no external power supply is needed, and a relatively high sensitivity may be maintained due to an increased charging density.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0035">The diaphragm assembly <b>150</b> may have a multilayer structure including two layers, four layers, six layers, and so on. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, in the diaphragm assembly <b>150</b>, a conductive layer <b>151</b> may be formed, insulation layers <b>152</b> and <b>152</b>&#x2032; may be formed on both surfaces of the conductive layer <b>151</b>, and the charging diaphragms <b>153</b> and <b>153</b>&#x2032; may be respectively formed on surfaces of the insulation layers <b>152</b> and <b>152</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0036">The second electrode <b>130</b> may form a cover-integrated structure by being attached to the frame <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the electrostatic speaker <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment further includes the driving chip <b>160</b> for applying a driving signal, which is generated by amplifying an audio signal, to the first electrode <b>120</b> and the second electrode <b>130</b>, rectifying the audio signal, and applying a bias voltage to the diaphragm assembly <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0038">The driving chip <b>160</b> includes an interface unit <b>161</b> for receiving analog or digital audio signals as inputs, a signal processing unit <b>162</b> for processing signals input via the interface unit <b>161</b>, an amplifying unit <b>163</b> for amplifying processed audio signals and driving the first electrode <b>120</b> and the second electrode <b>130</b>, a rectifying unit <b>164</b> for rectifying the audio signals output by the amplifying unit <b>163</b> and applying the rectified audio signal to the diaphragm assembly <b>150</b>, and a stabilizing unit <b>165</b> for detecting a voltage applied to the diaphragm assembly <b>150</b> and stabilizing the voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0039">As described above, the driving chip <b>160</b> according to the present embodiment does not use an external bias voltage and applies a bias voltage to the diaphragm assembly <b>150</b> by using a voltage generated by rectifying audio signals.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0040">In the electrostatic speaker <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment as described above, the driving chip <b>160</b> applies a driving signal generated by amplifying an audio signal to the first electrode <b>120</b> and the second electrode <b>130</b>, rectifies the audio signal, and applies a high bias voltage to the conductive layer <b>151</b> of the diaphragm assembly <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0041">Positive or negative charges are stored by the charging diaphragms <b>153</b> and <b>153</b>&#x2032; formed on surfaces of the diaphragm assembly <b>150</b>, and electrostatic attraction between positive and negative charges takes place between the first electrode <b>120</b> and the second electrode <b>130</b>, which are audio signal electrodes, and the diaphragm assembly <b>150</b>. The audio signal electrodes, which are continuously changed according to audio signals, push the diaphragm assembly <b>150</b> at one side and pull the diaphragm assembly <b>150</b> at another side, and thus, the diaphragm assembly <b>150</b> oscillates. The oscillation is reproduced as sound.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0042">Furthermore, the driving chip <b>160</b> according to the present embodiment may detect a voltage applied to the diaphragm assembly <b>150</b> by using a voltage detecting unit <b>166</b>, stabilize the voltage by using the stabilizing unit <b>165</b>, and transmits the stabilized voltage to the signal processing unit <b>162</b> as feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0043">As described above, according to embodiments of the present invention, a dual electrodes structure is employed, a multilayer structure is formed inside a diaphragm assembly, and a driving chip for applying a driving signal generated by amplifying an audio signal to dual electrodes, rectifying the audio signal, and applying a bias voltage to the diaphragm assembly is employed. As a result, no external power supply is needed, and a relatively high sensitivity may be maintained due to an increased charging density.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0044">While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.</p>
