<p id="p-0004" num="0005">It is important here for example with birds and, also reaching into economic areas, especially with poultry the determination whether to develop as individuals for example from previously fertilized eggs either males or females.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0006">There is already described a method for sex determination of chicks by means of infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy in the publication Steiner et al. Sexing of turkey poults by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Analytical and Bio-analytical Chemistry, Vol 396 (1) 2010 pages 465-470 which allows to determine the sex of six-week-old chicks.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007">The use of infrared spectroscopy for the determination of the sex of young birds shows that the method is fast and precise, and can be potentially used by the poultry industry to identify and select eggs with female embryonic stage or male embryonic stage for breeding purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">A multitude of birds, especially nestlings and farmers, veterinarians, aviculturists and ornithologists, however, the exact sex embryonic stages of birds show no external sexual characteristics. For poultry-determination is a fundamental aspect. But for the poultry industry, the knowledge is of paramount importance: fast, objective and inexpensive procedures for possible early sex determination, for example, in chickens and turkeys, are for the poultry industry important because in the preferred gender for incubation can be identified.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy is used for this purpose. The method is based on that cells extracted from the growing contour springs of six weeks old, male and female turkeys are employed. The technique exploits the cellular genetic information and allows a direct determination of the sex of the bird.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">One problem comprises that the effort to determine the specific gender involves many steps and therefore the time expenditure is very high.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">A method for determining the sex of birds is described in the German Patent Application publication DE 10 2007 013 107 A1, wherein DNA-relevant cellular material of the sexually to be determined bird was studied with light and the molecular oscillations are measured, wherein the light generated spectrum of molecular vibrations is recorded and compared with predetermined reference spectra of gender-specific DNA structures of the to be investigated bird species. A sex assignment of the bird is rendered based on the basis of the DNA content of the cell material.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">The molecular oscillations are measured here by means of application of Raman spectroscopy, or IR spectroscopy, it being possible for example, the relevant DNA cellular material can be removed from the stem of a young spring of a bird. The cell material is prepared on a support and is scanned with light.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">In another sub-method the light is focused for measuring the molecular vibrations of the DNA relevant cell material from unhatched birds through the egg shell and onto the embryo or germ-disc, wherein the spectrum of the radiation generated by molecular oscillations in the egg is measured with a probe guided through the shell of the egg.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">At least a microscopically small hole is drilled through the eggshell for the passage of the probe for measuring the spectrum. The light through the small opening through the eggshell is immediately focused on the germinal disc as cell material. The probe is inserted by the same or other access of small opening size, by means of the reflected spectrum and is measured by the probe recorded spectrum of the afore mentioned molecular motion in the interior of the egg.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">The resulting spectral information are compared with reference data in a second step and are fed to a classification algorithm. These represent preferably statistically derived data on the bird species to be examined. The assignment of gender of the DNA material to be investigated is made from this comparison</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">One problem comprises that a high time expenditure is required for the insertion of a probe into pre-made holes for a very large number of bird eggs to be examined. In addition, with a focusing of the light from the probe to the germinal disc, a considerable adjustment has to be furnished for an optical imaging, wherein the focusing plane can exhibit a different position from egg to egg and no determination of the sex can be carried out therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0017">No arrangement is given how the IR spectrum of the germinal disc cells under in-ovo conditions can be taken quickly and reliably.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0018">A spectroscopy device is described in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,835,389 A, which contains a total reflection element which is disposed at the bottom of a long probe tube that is together with the total reflection element deeply immersed in a container with liquid in order to capture with the complete surface of the crystal and immersed in the liquid and many edge side total reflections within the crystal and to receive analytical information on an optical path received and forward them to the spectroscopic device.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0019">An immersion probe is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,459,316 A, which probe is immersed in powder or liquid and an infrared spectroscopy is performed with it. The immersion probe consists of at least one tube, which tube exhibits a built-in attenuated total reflection ATR element operating on the basis of attenuated total reflection (ATR) at the bottom. The ATR element furnished serves as a back reflector.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0020">A refractometric method for a long-term stable measurement of concentrations of dissolved substances and a device for performing the process are described in the publication German patent DE 100 30 927 C1, wherein a linearly polarized electromagnetic measuring radiation beam is guided by total reflection in a prism. Here the longitudinal sides and a narrow side of the prism are in contact with the solution to be measured. Inside the prism made</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0021">Edge side multiple total reflections of the measuring radiation beam are fed to a detector after they emerge from the prism via phase shifter and analyzer to a detector, wherein the concentration is determined from the signals and from a calibration curve.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0022">An ATR-probe for measurement of whole blood is described in the document U.S. Pat. No. 5,170,056 A, wherein measurement solutions can be measured remote from the spectrometer through a light conductor. Here, the ATR probe is a portion of a fiber optic coupled device for carrying out IR-spectroscopy. The long cylindrical ATR probe crossing the solution exhibits coupled connectors of the light guides at the two front sides, wherein the infrared radiation is passed through the ATR probe over the coupled connectors. The detected IR radiation is measured and used for parameter determination of the blood from the many attenuated edge side total reflections within the ATR probe during the passage of the radiation bundle through the ATR probe.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0023">There are problems that can occur in that falsifications can occur in the detected spectra based on the configurations of the recited probes with the multitude of total reflections on the edge sides and that with the total reflection bundles detected no precise positioning of the crystal tip on blastoderm cells is possible. Thus, no precise determination of the sex of bird eggs can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0024">It is therefore the object of the present invention to provide a method and an apparatus for determining the sex of fertilized and non-incubated bird's eggs, which are so designed to be suitable, that sex can be unequivocally determined quickly and reliably already in the eggs.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0025">The object is solved by a method having the features of claim <b>1</b> and an apparatus having the features of claim <b>8</b>.</p>
