<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As one type of field-effect transistor, a thin film transistor whose channel region is formed using a semiconductor layer that is formed over a substrate having an insulating surface is known. Techniques for using amorphous silicon, microcrystalline silicon, and polycrystalline silicon for semiconductor layers in thin film transistors have been disclosed (see References 1 to 5). A typical application of thin film transistors is a liquid crystal display television device, in which thin film transistors have been put to practical use as a switching transistor for each pixel that constitutes a display screen.

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0010">A thin film transistor in which an amorphous silicon layer is used for a channel formation region has problems such as low field-effect mobility and small on-state current. On the other hand, a thin film transistor in which a microcrystalline silicon layer is used for a channel formation region has higher field-effect mobility than a thin film transistor with amorphous silicon, whereas it has a problem of insufficient switching characteristics due to its large off-state current.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0011">A thin film transistor in which a polycrystalline silicon layer is used for a channel formation region has characteristics such as much higher field-effect mobility and larger on-state current than the aforementioned two types of thin film transistors. Because of such characteristics, this thin film transistor can be used not only as a switching transistor provided in a pixel but also in a driver circuit for which high-speed operation is required.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0012">However, a thin film transistor with a polycrystalline silicon layer requires a crystallization step for a semiconductor layer and has a problem of higher manufacturing cost as compared to a thin film transistor formed using an amorphous silicon layer. For example, a laser annealing technique which is needed for formation of a polycrystalline silicon layer has a problem in that laser beam irradiation area is small and a large-area liquid crystal panel cannot be produced efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0013">Now, glass substrates used to manufacture display panels have become larger in area as time passes as in the 3rd generation (e.g., 550 mm&#xd7;650 mm), the 3.5th generation (e.g., 600 mm&#xd7;720 mm, or 620 mm&#xd7;750 mm), the 4th generation (e.g., 680 mm&#xd7;880 mm, or 730 mm&#xd7;920 mm), the 5th generation (e.g., 1100 mm&#xd7;1300 mm), the 6th generation (e.g., 1500 mm&#xd7;1800 mm), the 7th generation (e.g., 1900 mm&#xd7;2200 mm), and the 8th generation (e.g., 2200 mm&#xd7;2400 mm). From now on, it is predicted that the substrates will have much larger area for the 9th generation (e.g., 2400 mm&#xd7;2800 mm, or 2450 mm&#xd7;3050 mm) and the 10th generation (e.g., 2850 mm&#xd7;3050 mm). The increase in size of glass substrate is based on the concept of minimum cost design.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0014">On the other hand, a technique with which a thin film transistor capable of high-speed operation can be manufactured with high productivity over a large-area mother glass substrate like that of the 10th generation (2950 mm&#xd7;3400 mm) has not been established yet, which is a problem in industry.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0015">Thus, it is an object of the present invention to solve the aforementioned problems related to on-state current and off-state current of a thin film transistor. It is another object of the present invention to provide a thin film transistor capable of high-speed operation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0016">In one aspect according to the present invention, a thin film transistor includes a gate insulating layer covering a gate electrode, a microcrystalline semiconductor layer provided over the gate insulating layer, an amorphous semiconductor layer overlapping the microcrystalline semiconductor layer and the gate insulating layer, and a pair of impurity semiconductor layers which are provided over the amorphous semiconductor layer and to which an impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added to form a source region and a drain region. The gate insulating layer has a step adjacent to a portion in contact with an end portion of the microcrystalline semiconductor layer. A second thickness of the gate insulating layer in a portion outside the microcrystalline semiconductor layer is smaller than a first thickness of the gate insulating layer in a portion in contact with the microcrystalline semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0017">In another aspect according to the present invention, a thin film transistor includes a microcrystalline semiconductor layer covering a gate electrode, a gate insulating layer provided between the gate electrode and the microcrystalline semiconductor layer and elevated in a region in contact with the microcrystalline semiconductor layer above a surface of a region not in contact with the microcrystalline semiconductor layer, an amorphous semiconductor layer overlapping the microcrystalline semiconductor layer and the gate insulating layer, and a pair of impurity semiconductor layers which are provided over the amorphous semiconductor layer and to which an impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added to form a source region and a drain region.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0018">In another aspect according to the present invention, a thin film transistor includes a microcrystalline semiconductor layer covering a gate electrode, a gate insulating layer provided between the gate electrode and the microcrystalline semiconductor layer and having a projecting region in contact with the microcrystalline semiconductor layer, an amorphous semiconductor layer overlapping the microcrystalline semiconductor layer and the gate insulating layer, and a pair of impurity semiconductor layers which are provided over the amorphous semiconductor layer and to which an impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added to form a source region and a drain region.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0019">The microcrystalline semiconductor layer is an i-type microcrystalline semiconductor layer, or an n-type microcrystalline semiconductor layer to which an impurity element serving as a donor is added.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0020">The microcrystalline semiconductor layer has a lower electric conductivity than the amorphous semiconductor layer. When the microcrystalline semiconductor layer contains an impurity element serving as a donor, the donor concentration is from 1&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 5&#xd7;10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>. The microcrystalline semiconductor layer extends at least in a channel length direction of the thin film transistor and acts to generate large on-state current due to the aforementioned electric conductivity.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0021">An impurity semiconductor refers to a semiconductor in which most carriers that contribute to electric conduction are supplied by an impurity element imparting one conductivity type which has been added to the semiconductor. The impurity element imparting one conductivity type is an element capable of serving as a donor which supplies electrons as carriers or as an acceptor which supplies holes as carriers. Typically, donors correspond to Group 15 elements of the periodic table, and acceptors correspond to Group 13 elements of the periodic table.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0022">In addition, between the microcrystalline semiconductor layer and the amorphous semiconductor layer, an additional microcrystalline semiconductor layer or a microcrystalline semiconductor layer containing an impurity element serving as a donor may be provided. Note that, when the microcrystalline semiconductor layer provided between the microcrystalline semiconductor layer and the amorphous semiconductor layer contains an impurity element serving as a donor, the concentration of the impurity element serving as a donor is lower than that of the impurity element imparting one conductivity type added to the pair of impurity semiconductor layers to form a source region and a drain region.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0023">A microcrystalline semiconductor refers to, for example, a semiconductor which has a grain size of 2 nm to 200 nm, preferably 10 nm to 80 nm, more preferably 20 nm to 50 nm, a dark conductivity of approximately 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>S/cm to 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>S/cm, and a photoconductivity of 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>S/cm to 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>S/cm and a semiconductor whose electric conductivity can be increased to approximately 10<sup>1 </sup>S/cm by valence control. It should be noted that the concept of microcrystalline semiconductor in the present invention is not only fixed to the aforementioned values of grain size and electric conductivity, and any other semiconductor material that has equivalent physical values can be used instead. An amorphous semiconductor refers to a semiconductor which does not have a crystalline structure (which does not have long-range order in the atomic arrangement). Note that amorphous silicon also includes one that contains hydrogen.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0024">The term &#x201c;on-state current&#x201d; refers to an electric current which flows in a channel formation region when appropriate gate voltage is applied to a gate electrode in order to cause a current to flow in the channel formation region (that is, when a thin film transistor is in an on state). The term &#x201c;off-state current&#x201d; refers to an electric current which flows between a source and a drain when a gate voltage is lower than a threshold voltage of a thin film transistor (that is, when the thin film transistor is in an off state).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0025">When a gate insulating layer has a smaller thickness in a portion not in contact with a microcrystalline semiconductor layer than in a portion in contact with the microcrystalline semiconductor layer over a gate electrode, large on-state current can be obtained and off-state current can be reduced. In addition, field-effect mobility can be increased, which makes high-speed operation possible.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0047" num="0051">Embodiment modes and embodiments of the present invention will be described below with reference to the drawings. Note that the present invention is not limited to the following description, and it is easily understood by those skilled in the art that the mode and detail of the present invention can be changed in various ways without departing from the spirit and scope thereof. Thus, the present invention should not be interpreted as being limited to the following description in the embodiment modes and embodiments. In the modes of the present invention described below, the same components in different diagrams are commonly denoted by the same reference numerals.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0052">In addition, in the following embodiment modes and embodiments, cases are described in which a gate electrode <b>05</b> is a part of a gate wiring. Thus, there are cases where the gate electrode <b>05</b> is referred to as a gate wiring <b>05</b>. In a similar manner, there are cases where a wiring <b>63</b> is referred to as a source wiring <b>63</b> or a source electrode <b>63</b>. Furthermore, in a similar manner, there are cases where a wiring <b>65</b> is referred to as a drain electrode <b>65</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">Embodiment Mode 1</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0053">Here, a structure of a thin film transistor is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which has smaller off-state current than a thin film transistor having a microcrystalline semiconductor layer in a channel formation region and which is capable of operating at higher speed and has larger on-state current than a thin film transistor having an amorphous semiconductor layer in a channel formation region.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0054">In a thin film transistor illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a gate electrode <b>05</b> is formed over a substrate <b>01</b>; a gate insulating layer <b>09</b> is formed over the gate electrode <b>05</b>; first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>which are separated from each other are formed over the gate insulating layer <b>09</b>; and a second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b> is formed over the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>and the gate insulating layer <b>09</b>. In addition, an amorphous semiconductor layer <b>55</b> is formed to cover the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b>. Over the amorphous semiconductor layer <b>55</b>, a pair of impurity semiconductor layers <b>59</b> and <b>61</b> to which an impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added to form a source region and a drain region are formed. Over the impurity semiconductor layers <b>59</b> and <b>61</b> to which the impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added, wirings <b>63</b> and <b>65</b> are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0055">The gate insulating layer <b>09</b> has projecting regions in contact with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b</i>. That is, the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> has a larger thickness in regions overlapped by the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>than in a region not in contact with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>but in contact with the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0056">Here, enlarged views of an end portion <b>40</b> of the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>51</b><i>a </i>are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0057">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an interface <b>43</b> of the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> in contact with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>51</b><i>a </i>is not aligned with an interface <b>42</b> of the amorphous semiconductor layer <b>55</b> in contact with the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b>. Thus, the regions in contact with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>have a projecting shape.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0058">The interface <b>43</b> between the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>51</b><i>a </i>and the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> and the interface <b>42</b> between the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b> and the amorphous semiconductor layer <b>55</b> may be apart from each other at a distance d without being aligned with each other. In such a case, a portion of the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> in contact with the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b> is hollowed relative to a portion of the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> in contact with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>51</b><i>a </i>by a thickness equal to or greater than the thickness of the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b> and thus has a depressed shape.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0059">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, an interface <b>46</b> between the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>51</b><i>a </i>and the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> may be roughly aligned with an interface <b>44</b> between the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b> and the amorphous semiconductor layer <b>55</b>. The second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b> improves its crystallinity as it becomes thicker in a thickness direction. In addition, a portion of the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>51</b><i>a </i>adjacent to the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> is roughly aligned with a region of the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b> having high crystallinity. Thus, carriers induced in the portion of the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>51</b><i>a </i>adjacent to the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> pass a shorter distance in the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b> having high crystallinity. Accordingly, on-state current can be increased and field-effect mobility can also be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0060">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the projecting region of the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> in contact with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>5</b> la may have a tapered shape where a side surface of the projecting region is at an angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> to the substrate surface. The angle &#x3b8;<b>1</b> at this time is equal to or greater than 20&#xb0; and less than 85&#xb0;, preferably equal to or greater than 30&#xb0; and less than or equal to 60&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0061">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the projecting region of the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> in contact with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>51</b><i>a </i>may have a roughly perpendicular side surface which is at an angle <b>02</b> to the substrate surface. The angle &#x3b8;<b>2</b> at this time is equal to or greater than 85&#xb0; and less than 95&#xb0;, preferably equal to or greater than 88&#xb0; and less than or equal to 92&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0062">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2E</figref>, the projecting region of the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> in contact with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>51</b><i>a </i>may have a tapered shape where a side surface of the projecting region is at an angle &#x3b8;<b>3</b> to the substrate surface. The angle &#x3b8;<b>3</b> at this time is equal to or greater than 95&#xb0; and less than or equal to 160&#xb0;, preferably equal to or greater than 120&#xb0; and less than or equal to 150&#xb0;.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0063">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2F</figref>, an end portion of the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>51</b><i>a </i>and an end portion of the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> in contact with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>51</b><i>a</i>, that is, a side surface of the projecting portion of the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> may be at a misaligned position.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0064">The gate insulating layer <b>09</b> can be formed with a single layer structure or a stacked layer structure with the use of a silicon oxide layer, a silicon nitride layer, a silicon oxynitride layer, and/or a silicon nitride oxide layer each having a thickness of 50 nm to 150 nm. As one embodiment of stacked layer structure, there is an example in which a silicon nitride layer or a silicon nitride oxide layer is formed and a silicon oxide layer or a silicon oxynitride layer is stacked thereover. There is also an example in which a silicon nitride layer or a silicon nitride oxide layer is formed, a silicon oxide layer or a silicon oxynitride layer is stacked thereover, and a silicon nitride layer or a silicon nitride oxide layer is stacked thereover.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0065">When the gate insulating layer is formed with a silicon nitride layer or a silicon nitride oxide layer, the adhesion force between the substrate <b>01</b> and the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> can be increased. In addition, in the case where a glass substrate is used as the substrate <b>01</b>, an impurity element, such as sodium, contained in the substrate <b>01</b> can be prevented from diffusing into the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b</i>, the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b>, and the amorphous semiconductor layer <b>55</b>, and furthermore, the gate electrode <b>05</b> can be prevented from oxidizing. That is, film peeling can be prevented and electric characteristics of a thin film transistor to be formed later can be improved. The gate insulating layer <b>09</b> preferably has a thickness of 100 nm or more because the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> having the above thickness can alleviate a decrease in coverage of the gate electrode <b>05</b> due to a step.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0066">Here, a silicon oxynitride layer means a layer that contains more oxygen than nitrogen and, in the case where measurements are performed using Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and hydrogen forward scattering (HFS), includes oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen at concentrations ranging from 50 at. % to 70 at. %, 0.5 at. % to 15 at. %, 25 at. % to 35 at. %, and 0.1 at. % to 10 at. %, respectively. A silicon nitride oxide layer means a layer that contains more nitrogen than oxygen and, in the case where measurements are performed using RBS and HFS, includes oxygen, nitrogen, silicon, and hydrogen at concentrations ranging from 5 at. % to 30 at. %, 20 at. % to 55 at. %, 25 at. % to 35 at. %, and 10 at. % to 30 at. %, respectively. Note that percentages of nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, and hydrogen fall within the ranges given above, where the total number of atoms contained in the silicon oxynitride layer or the silicon nitride oxide layer is defined as 100 at. %.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0067">The gate insulating layer <b>09</b> has projecting regions in contact with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b</i>. That is, the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> has a larger thickness in regions overlapped by the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>than in a region not in contact with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>but in contact with the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b>. Such a shape allows a higher electric field to be generated in a thin region of the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> when voltage is applied to the gate electrode <b>05</b> and allows a larger number of carriers to be induced in the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b> in contact with the thin region. Thus, on-state current and electric field-effect of a thin film transistor can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0068">The first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>are formed with a microcrystalline silicon layer, a microcrystalline silicon germanium layer, a microcrystalline germanium layer, a polycrystalline silicon layer, a polycrystalline silicon germanium layer, a polycrystalline germanium layer, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0069">As the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b</i>, it is possible to use a microcrystalline semiconductor layer to which an impurity element serving as a donor which is an element that supplies electrons as carriers is added. Typical examples of the impurity element serving as a donor include phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony which are Group 15 elements of the periodic table, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0070">In the case where the concentration of the impurity element serving as a donor added to the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b> and <b>51</b><i>b </i>is from 1&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>to 5&#xd7;10<sup>20 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>when measured by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS), the resistance at the interface between the gate insulating layer <b>09</b> and the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers can be reduced and a thin film transistor which can operate at high speed and achieve large on-state current can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0071">Here, a microcrystalline semiconductor layer is a layer which includes a semiconductor having an intermediate structure between amorphous and crystalline (including single-crystalline and polycrystalline) structures. A microcrystalline semiconductor is a semiconductor having a third state that is stable in terms of free energy and a crystalline semiconductor having short-range order and lattice distortion, in which columnar or needle-like crystals having a grain size of 2 nm to 200 nm, preferably 10 nm to 80 nm, more preferably 20 nm to 50 nm have grown in a direction normal to the substrate surface. A microcrystalline semiconductor is also a semiconductor whose electric conductivity that is roughly 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>S/cm to 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>S/cm can be increased to approximately 10<sup>1 </sup>S/cm by valence control. There is a non-single-crystal semiconductor between a plurality of microcrystalline semiconductors. Microcrystalline silicon, which is a typical example of microcrystal semiconductor, has its Raman spectrum shifted to a lower wave number side than 520 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>which represents single crystal silicon. That is, the peak of a Raman spectrum of microcrystalline silicon is within the range from 520 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>which represents single crystal silicon to 480 cm<sup>&#x2212;1 </sup>which represents amorphous silicon. In addition, a microcrystalline semiconductor is made to contain hydrogen or halogen of at least 1 at. % or more for termination of dangling bonds. Moreover, a microcrystalline semiconductor may be made to contain a noble gas element such as helium, argon, krypton, or neon to further enhance lattice distortion, whereby stability is increased and a favorable microcrystalline semiconductor can be obtained. Such a microcrystalline semiconductor is disclosed in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,409,134. It should be noted that, in the present invention, the concept of microcrystalline semiconductor is not only fixed to the aforementioned values of grain size and electric conductivity, and any other semiconductor material that has equivalent physical values can be used instead.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0072">The first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>are formed with a thickness of 5 nm to 50 nm, preferably 5 nm to 30 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0073">The first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>preferably have an oxygen concentration and a nitrogen concentration which are each less than ten times as high as the concentration of the impurity element serving as a donor, typically less than 3&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, more preferably less than 3&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, and has a carbon concentration of 3&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3 </sup>or less. By a decrease in concentration of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon mixed into the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b</i>, generation of defects in the microcrystalline semiconductor layers can be suppressed. Furthermore, oxygen or nitrogen present in a microcrystalline semiconductor layer inhibits crystallization. Thus, when the oxygen concentration and the nitrogen concentration in a microcrystalline semiconductor layer are kept relatively low and an impurity element serving as a donor is added, crystallinity of the microcrystalline semiconductor layer can be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0074">When an impurity element serving as an acceptor is added to the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>at the same time as or after the formation of the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b</i>, threshold voltage control becomes possible. A typical example of the impurity element serving as an acceptor is boron, and an impurity gas such as B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6 </sub>or BF<sub>3 </sub>may be mixed into silicon hydride at a proportion of 1 ppm to 1000 ppm, preferably 1 ppm to 100 ppm. The concentration of boron may be approximately a tenth of that of the impurity element serving as a donor, for example, 1&#xd7;10<sup>14 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>2 </sup>to 6&#xd7;10<sup>16 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0075">Instead of the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b</i>, microcrystalline semiconductor particles may be dispersed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0076">When the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>are formed, these regions have higher electric conductivity than an amorphous semiconductor layer; thus, a large number of carriers are induced in the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>when voltage is applied to the gate electrode. Therefore, on-state current and field-effect mobility of a thin film transistor are increased.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0077">The second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b> is formed with a microcrystalline silicon layer, a microcrystalline silicon germanium layer, a microcrystalline germanium layer, a polycrystalline silicon layer, a polycrystalline silicon germanium layer, a polycrystalline germanium layer, or the like. Alternatively, an i-type semiconductor layer to which an impurity element serving as a donor or an impurity element serving as an acceptor is not added or a substantially i-type (including an n-type to which an impurity element serving as a donor is added at low concentration and a p-type to which an impurity element serving as an acceptor is added at low concentration) semiconductor layer is formed. The second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b> is formed with a thickness of 5 nm to 50 nm, preferably 10 nm to 30 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0078">The amorphous semiconductor layer <b>55</b> is formed with an amorphous silicon layer, an amorphous silicon layer containing germanium, or the like. The amorphous semiconductor layer <b>55</b> is preferably formed with an i-type or a substantially i-type amorphous silicon layer or the like. The amorphous semiconductor layer <b>55</b> may contain fluorine, chlorine, or the like. A portion of the amorphous semiconductor layer <b>55</b> overlapped by a wiring has a thickness equal to or greater than 50 nm and less than 500 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0079">The amorphous semiconductor layer <b>55</b> covers the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers <b>51</b><i>a </i>and <b>51</b><i>b </i>with the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>58</b> interposed therebetween.

<p id="p-0214" num="0218">Here, the pixel electrode <b>71</b> is formed as follows: forming an ITO film by a sputtering method; applying a resist over the ITO film; forming a resist mask by exposing the resist to light with a sixth photomask and developing the resist; and etching the ITO film with the use of the resist mask.

However, a multi-tone mask is used as a photomask for etching to form the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer, the amorphous semiconductor layer, the pair of impurity semiconductor layers to which the impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added, and the wirings of a predetermined shape; thus, one photomask can be reduced with this process.

<p id="p-0269" num="0273">In this embodiment a formation process and a shape of a gate insulating layer having a step are hereinafter described.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0274">A silicon nitride layer, a silicon oxynitride layer, a first microcrystalline semiconductor layer, and a first buffer layer were stacked over a substrate in the same deposition chamber.</p>

<p id="p-0276" num="0280">Next, a resist mask was formed by a photolithography process, and the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer and the first buffer layer were dry-etched using the resist mask, thereby forming a second microcrystalline semiconductor layer and a second buffer layer.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0281">Here, an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) apparatus was used, and the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer and the first buffer layer were etched under etching conditions where the ICP power was 150 W, the bias power was 40 W, the pressure was 1.0 Pa, the etching gas was chlorine at a flow rate of 100 sccm, and the etching time was 57 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0282">Then, oxygen ashing was performed and the resist mask was removed using a stripping solution (a first step).</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0283">Sample 1 was immersed in a hydrofluoric acid for 40 seconds as a second step after the first step.</p>

<p id="p-0282" num="0286">In each of Samples 1 to 3, after the second step, an amorphous semiconductor layer was formed by a plasma CVD method as a third step.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0287">As the amorphous semiconductor layer, an amorphous silicon layer having a thickness of 100 nm was formed by a plasma CVD method. Here, the amorphous silicon layer was formed under conditions where the RF power frequency was 13.56 MHz, the power of the RF power source was 50 W, the deposition temperature was 280&#xb0; C., the flow rate ratio of silane to hydrogen was 14:15, and the pressure was 170 Pa.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0288">The cross sections of Samples 1 to 3 were observed with a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A to 22C</figref> show STEM images of the cross sections of Samples 1 to 3 taken with a scanning transmission electron microscope. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22A</figref> is a cross-sectional STEM image of Sample 1; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22B</figref>, a cross-sectional STEM image of Sample 2; and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref>, a cross-sectional STEM image of Sample 3.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0289">In Sample 3 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref>, a resistive layer <b>404</b> which is shown as a white region can be observed on surfaces of a second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>402</b> and a second buffer layer <b>403</b>. In particular, on side surfaces of the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>402</b> and the second buffer layer <b>403</b> where carriers travel, a thick white region can be observed. On the other hand, in each of Samples 1 and 2 of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22A and 22B</figref>, although a white line can be slightly observed on surfaces of the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>402</b> and the second buffer layer <b>403</b>, the thickness is small as compared to Sample 3.

<p id="p-0286" num="0290">It can be seen that, in Samples 1 and 2, a silicon oxynitride layer <b>401</b> is etched outside the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer <b>402</b>. In Sample 1, the silicon oxynitride layer <b>401</b> is etched 15 nm deep from the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0291">Accordingly, when the first microcrystalline semiconductor layer and the first buffer layer are treated with a hydrofluoric acid after being etched, part of a gate insulating layer can be etched, whereby a gate insulating layer having a step can be formed.</p>

<p id="p-0288" num="0292">In this embodiment, results of simulation of current-voltage characteristics of the thin film transistor described in Embodiment Mode 1 are described.

<p id="p-0290" num="0294">In the device structure used in this embodiment, molybdenum Mo is formed with a thickness of 150 nm as a gate electrode Mo over an insulating substrate (not illustrated). Here, the work function of molybdenum is 4.6 eV. As the insulating substrate, for example, a glass substrate which contains silicon oxide as its main component can be used. In the device simulation, the dielectric constant is 4.1, and the thickness of the glass substrate is 0.5 &#x3bc;m. Although many glass substrates used in an actual manufacturing process of a thin film transistor have thicknesses of about 0.5 mm, 0.7 mm, and the like, the thickness of the glass substrate in device simulation is determined to be large enough to prevent an electric field at the bottom of the insulating substrate from affecting electric characteristics of a thin film transistor, in consideration of computational efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0295">Over the gate electrode, silicon oxynitride (with a dielectric constant of 4.1) is provided as a gate insulating layer SiON.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0296">Note that in Structure 1 illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B-1</figref>, the thickness of the gate insulating layer SiON in regions covered with first microcrystalline semiconductor layers &#x3bc;c-Si(n) is 220 nm, and the thickness of the gate insulating layer in a region not covered with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers &#x3bc;c-Si(n) is 200 nm.

<p id="p-0294" num="0298">In Structure 3 illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25D-1</figref>, as a comparative example, the thickness of the gate insulating layer SiON in regions covered with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers &#x3bc;c-Si(n) is equal to the thickness of the gate insulating layer SiON in a region not covered with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers &#x3bc;c-Si(n). That is, the amount of the gate insulating layer SiON etched in the region not covered with the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers &#x3bc;c-Si(n) is 0 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0299">Over the gate insulating layer SiON, microcrystalline silicon layers &#x3bc;c-Si(n) to which phosphorus is added (with a thickness of 20 nm, a donor concentration of 1&#xd7;10<sup>19 </sup>atoms/cm<sup>3</sup>, and an activation rate of 100%) were stacked as the first microcrystalline semiconductor layers &#x3bc;c-Si(n).</p>

<p id="p-0297" num="0301">Over the second microcrystalline semiconductor layer &#x3bc;-Si(i), an amorphous silicon layer is stacked as an amorphous semiconductor layer a-Si(i). Note that the amorphous silicon layer has a thickness of 90 nm in a region covered with an impurity semiconductor layer to which an impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added and has a thickness of 20 nm in a region not covered with the impurity semiconductor layer to which the impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0302">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25A</figref>, over the amorphous semiconductor layer a-Si(i), amorphous silicon layers to which phosphorus is added (with a thickness of 50 nm) are stacked as a pair of impurity semiconductor layers a-Si(n<sup>+</sup>) to which an impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added. In each of Structures 1 to 3, the distance between the pair of impurity semiconductor layers a-Si(n<sup>+</sup>) to which the impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added corresponds to the channel length L of a thin film transistor.

<p id="p-0299" num="0303">Over the pair of impurity semiconductor layers a-Si(n<sup>+</sup>) to which the impurity element imparting one conductivity type is added, molybdenum (with a thickness of 100 nm) was stacked as a source electrode Source and a drain electrode Drain.

Each shows drain current at drain voltages of 1 V and 10 V and maximum field-effect mobility at a drain voltage of 1 V.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0305">The maximum field-effect mobility of the thin film transistor of Structure 1 illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B-1</figref> is 4.0 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0306">The maximum field-effect mobility of the thin film transistor of Structure 2 illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25C-1</figref> is 4.9 cm<sup>2</sup>/Vs.</p>

<p id="p-0304" num="0308">In the thin film transistor of Structure 1 illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25B-1</figref>, the on-state current at a gate voltage of 20 V and a drain voltage of 1 V is 4.0&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>A and the on-state current at a drain voltage of 10 V is 3.6&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>A.</p>

<p id="p-0307" num="0311">Accordingly, it can be seen that when the thickness of a gate insulating layer is partly decreased in the vicinity of a channel formation region such that the gate insulating layer does not have a flat shape, on-state current and field-effect mobility of a thin film transistor are increased as compared to such a thin film transistor as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25D-1</figref>.</p>
