<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart for implementing the provision of reminder notifications in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. A reminder notification is a type of notification that serves a reminder to a recipient that media content specified in a reminder notification rule may be accessed. In one or more embodiments, the provision of reminder notifications is implemented as a set of instructions that are executed on any combination of the following: a server, a client, and/or a set-top box. Initially, a reminder notification rule for a recipient may be determined (<b>300</b>). A reminder notification rule may be determined by retrieving the reminder notification rule from a database or any other form of computer data storage. The reminder notification rule may be received directly from a user with the use of a notification interface <b>106</b>. Another embodiment may have a user create a reminder notification rule with a user interface, such as the notification interface <b>106</b> or the portal user interface <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A reminder notification preference may consist of one or more reminder notification rules. A reminder notification rule may have one or more descriptors for media content including, but not limited to, a broadcast time, a content category (e.g., drama, comedy, sports, pay-per view, sitcom, movie, etc.), a particular actor, director or producer, a content type (e.g., web page, television broadcast, etc.), a television station, a title, or any keyword that allows for the identification of media content. In one or more embodiments, the reminder notification rule may have a descriptor for media content that relies on the usage information for any number of set-top boxes. For example, a user may create a reminder notification rule to receive a notification for any sitcom episode broadcast during primetime viewing hours that has not been selected to be displayed or stored by a group of set-top boxes according to the usage information collected on the group of set-top boxes.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Next, a database may be queried for one or more selections of scheduled media content in accordance with the reminder notification rule(s) (<b>302</b>). Any number of databases may be queried to satisfy the reminder notification rule(s) for a notification preference, such as a usage information database <b>114</b>, a program guide database <b>112</b>, a notification database <b>110</b>, a metadata database, a media content database, a web index, a file system, or any database that facilitates access to media content. A scheduled media content selection is media content that is scheduled to be available for selection at a set-top box <b>104</b>. The media content may be already available for selection at a set-top box <b>104</b> or may be scheduled to be available at a later date. In one or more embodiments, a query for scheduled media content selections will return any number of address(es), link(s) to access the media content, television station(s), or any information on how to receive the media content.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A reminder notification may then be sent to any number of recipients based on the query result (<b>304</b>). A user may create a reminder notification rule to send content to a recipient with an email address, a phone number, a group in a social network, an address for a set-top box <b>104</b>, a portal, or any device implementing a notification interface <b>106</b>. Alternatively, the query results may indicate that a reminder notification does not have to be sent. The content of reminder notification may be determined by a user or the notification may indicate that reminders or stored content is waiting for retrieval. In one or more embodiments, a user may request that reminder notifications be directly inserted into a calendar in a scheduling/calendaring software application.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart for implementing the provision of notifications in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, a request is received to create a reminder notification preference for a recipient (<b>400</b>). In some embodiments, a user may send a request to create a reminder notification preference by using a portal, such as with the submittal of a form or any input method available on a web page of a portal. In one or more embodiments, the request for a reminder notification may be a response to a previous notification for the user and the reminder notification preference or a reminder notification rule may be created from the earlier notification. For example, if the user received a reminder notification that media content of interest to the user was scheduled to be broadcast that evening, then the user could send a request to receive a reminder notification for the next broadcast of the media content and the notification module <b>108</b> could use the earlier reminder notification to create one or more reminder notification rules.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, input to establish a reminder notification rule is received (<b>402</b>). Input to establish a reminder notification rule may be input by using a portal. In one or more embodiments, input options to establish rules may be provided by a third patty to a user and the user may select that the third party establish rules for reminder notifications received by the user. For example, a user may subscribe to receive reminder notifications from a third-party that reviews media content and allow the third-party to establish rules for their set-top box.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">After a reminder notification rule is established, a request is made to have reminders sent to the recipient based on the reminder notification preference (<b>404</b>). In one or more embodiments, a request is received at a notification module <b>108</b> to send a reminder notification in accordance with a reminder notification preference. Reminder notification preferences and reminder notification rules may be stored in a notification database <b>110</b> for retrieval by the notification module <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, a notification module <b>108</b> may determine if a recipient has requested not to receive reminder notifications and will allow a reminder notification to be sent to the recipient.</p>

It will be understood by those with skill in the art that any number of interfaces may be provided to create, delete, and update reminder notifications. Embodiments of the present invention may request that security information be input in order to create reminder notifications, such as a username and password as shown for &#x201c;Account Number 1234567&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The following examples of input for creating reminder notification preferences and the corresponding reminder notification rules are depicted with <b>504</b>: a drop down menu for the type of notification to be received with &#x201c;Reminder&#x201d; selected, text inputs for tide descriptors for media content with &#x201c;The Office&#x201d; and &#x201c;Lost&#x201d; selected, a drop down menu for the method of receiving notifications with &#x201c;wireless&#x201d; selected, a text input for the reminder notification with &#x201c;You need to get to a TV! The Office is going to be on soon!&#x201d; selected, a drop down menu for a channel descriptor with &#x201c;NBC Only&#x201d; selected, a drop down menu for text descriptor for episodes with &#x201c;New Only&#x201d; selected, a drop down menu for text descriptor for timing with &#x201c;30 mins&#x201d; selected, and a text input for the recipients of the notifications with &#x201c;Mike Goergen and Jane Goergen&#x201d; selected. In one or more embodiments, a phone number, an address, or other contact information may be input to ensure that a recipient receives the notification.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a flow chart for implementing the provision of notifications in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, security information is received (<b>600</b>). Security information may be input at a web portal in some embodiments. The security information allows for the identification of a user authorized to establish rules for receiving notifications regarding the assigned set-top box. In one or more embodiments, the security information includes identification information for a user that has been assigned the set-top box, such as a username and password associated with the set-top box. The identification information may include account information that uniquely identifies a user, a set-top box owner, or a subscriber who receives media content with a set-top box. The security information may be any security mechanism that ensures that an owner of a set-top box controls all content notifications for the set-top box. For example, the set-top box owner may prefer that content notifications and usage information only be retained during times that the set-top box owner is not supervising use of the set-top box.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, a request to create a content notification preference for the set-top box is serviced (<b>602</b>). A content notification preference may have one or more content notification rules. A content notification rule may indicate how media content for a set-top box should be monitored. The request to create a content notification preference may be serviced in response to successful entry of security information. Successful entry of security information may ensure that only authorized users are able to create notification preferences and that unauthorized notifications are not sent to recipients. In one or more embodiments, the security information may be input by a user at a web portal. Alternatively, unsuccessful entry of security information may result in denial of the request to create a content notification preference.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Servicing a request to create a content notification preference may entail creating one or more content notification rules. For example, a content notification preference may have a content notification rule specifying that a recipient be alerted when media content received on a set-top box is pay-per view content. The content notification rules may be input with a user interface, such as the notification interface <b>106</b> or the portal user interface <b>124</b>. A content notification preference and corresponding content notification rules may be updated using a user interface. The content notification preference may be updated by retrieving a current version of a content notification preference from a database or any other form of computer data storage and updating the content notification preference with the new input for the content notification preference. A content notification rule may be received directly from a user with the use of a notification interface <b>106</b>. For example, a user may send an instant message with a content notification rule to monitor a set-top box for receipt of media content selected from channel <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Next, the media content received by a set-top box is determined (<b>604</b>). The media content may have been selected for display or recorded and saved to the set-top box. In one or more embodiments, a usage information database <b>114</b> is accessed to determine the media content received by a set-top box. The usage information may also be retrieved from memory <b>204</b> at the set-top box <b>200</b>. The storage of usage information will be described in further detail below with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">After media content received by a set-top box is determined, a content notification preference associated with the set-top box is determined (<b>606</b>). The content notification preference includes one or more content notification rules to monitor media content received by a set-top box. A content notification rule may be determined by retrieving the content notification rule from a database or any other form of computer data storage. The content notification rule may be received directly from a user with the use of a notification interface <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Another embodiment may have a user create a reminder notification rule with a user interface, such as the notification interface <b>106</b> or the portal user interface <b>124</b>. A user may make requests with the interface for creation of a content notification preference. The content notification rule may be established from input received through a user interface to create the content notification preference. For example, the user may input information in a form on a web portal in order to create a content notification rule.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The content notification rules may provide that media content for a set-top box be monitored in ways including, but not limited to, the following: during a certain time of day, a content rating (e.g., R, PG-13, etc.), a content descriptor, a set-top box identification number, and/or a duration of time. A user may desire to monitor the frequency that a set-top box is viewed on any given day or a user may desire to monitor a set-top box in a child's room. Those skilled in the art will recognize that there are any number of rules that can be provided to the user as options for monitoring content at a set-top box.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">After the content notification preference is determined, a notification is sent to a recipient based on the content notification preference (<b>608</b>). In one or mote embodiments, the provision of content notifications is implemented as a set of instructions that are executed on any combination of the following: a server, a client, and/or a set-top box. A user may create a content notification rule to send a notification to a recipient with an email address, a phone number, a group in a social network, an address for a set-top box <b>104</b>, a portal, or any device implementing a notification interface <b>106</b>. Alternatively, a content notification rule may indicate that a content notification does not have to be sent. The information provided in the content notification may follow a standard template or may be completely customizable by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">One embodiment of the present invention combines notifications for set-top boxes with social networks. A social network is any community of people who share interests and activities, or who ate interested in exploring the interests and activities of others. A social network website provides a variety of ways for users within the network to interact, such as email or SMS. Social network members may permit one or more other social network members access to their usage information for set-top boxes. A social network member that has access to the usage information for another member may create notification preferences and the corresponding notification rules to monitor the media content received at member set-top boxes. A social notification preference may be one or more social notification rules to allow for creation of social notifications to be sent to or received by members of a social network. A social notification is any type of notification that may be sent to members of a social network. A social network member that has access to the usage information for another member may create notification preferences and the corresponding notification rules to receive reminder notifications for content that is of interest to one or more other members. For example, a user may create a content notification rule to receive a content notification when one or more friends that are members of a social network are watching a sports game on ESPN.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Notifications may be sent to social network members in accordance with the notification preferences. Embodiments may utilize the available communication options within the social network and send notifications to recipients through the social network. Notifications may be sent to members of social networks with recipient information provided with the notification preference. Notifications may also be published on the community website for members of the social network with similar interests.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Although reminder and content notifications are described as different types of notifications, the functionality for reminder and content notifications may be applied in combination. For example, a user may request to receive a content monitoring notification for media content selected at set-top boxes by a majority of friends in a social network, and request to receive a content reminder each time the media content identified in a content monitoring notification is scheduled for broadcast.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a flow chart for implementing the provision of usage information in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In one or more embodiments, the provision of usage information is implemented as a set of instructions that are executed on any combination of the following: a server, a client, and/or a set-top box. Initially, a request for usage information for a set-top box is received (<b>700</b>). The request for usage information may concern managing or querying a usage information database <b>114</b>. The request may indicate that usage information for the set-top box should be retrieved and/or stored in a database for later retrieval, such as the usage information database <b>114</b>. The request for storage/retrieval of usage information may be sent by a user through the use of a web portal, a user device <b>102</b>, or from the notification module <b>108</b>. The request may indicate that usage information for the set-top box should begin to be or resume being stored at a database or in memory at a set-top box.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In one or more embodiments, the request for usage information may be a query for the usage information stored at the usage information database <b>114</b>. The query may be written in any database query and/or database management language, such as Structured Query Language (SQL). A query may have criteria for data retrieved from a database. For example, a query for the database may specify that usage information for a set-top box for a particular date be retrieved with &#x201c;Select*from SetTopBoxAInfo where date=&#x2018;04102008&#x2019;.&#x201d; A query result from the query may be a Boolean value, a number of rows, or any data structure providing a result set for row(s) from a table in the database that meets the criteria of the query. Criteria for a query of the database may include, but is not limited to, a user, a show type, a date, commonly watched television shows, an actor's name, an episode, a count for the time spent watching media content, a value for a column in a database table, a column in a database table, a table in a database, and a keyword. The usage information database <b>114</b> may aggregate usage information from a plurality of set-top boxes. The usage information database <b>114</b> may store information under user profiles to differentiate usage information for a plurality of users such as, for example, the members of a household in response to detected viewing patterns, a user identifier, or other behavior or information enabling a set-top box to determine the identity of a user. In such a manner, a set-top box may automatically determine which user profile to update with usage information. In one embodiment, a &#x201c;household profile&#x201d; or other combined profile may be used to aggregate and track the overall use of all viewers of one or more set-top boxes.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A usage information database <b>114</b> may also interface with Internet websites, electronic television guides, or a cable provider's program guide to obtain additional information associated with particular usage information. For example, usage information database <b>114</b> may populate database fields with additional information regarding the television shows viewed based on additional information available on the Internet that is not otherwise available on the set-top box. In one embodiment, predetermined or user-definable query buttons may be utilized. For example, a &#x201c;missed episodes&#x201d; query button may be utilized and selected to display to a viewer those episodes of all of or a particular one of a viewer's favorite shows that the viewer has not yet viewed or recorded. For further example, a &#x201c;favorite actor&#x201d; query button may be utilized to display all upcoming movie broadcasts included in a program guide that include all of or one of the favorite actors of a viewer, as previously indicated by such user or as automatically determined from a viewer's usage information. The results of a query may be sent to a user device <b>102</b>, portal client <b>122</b>, or set-top box <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Next, usage information on media content received at the set-top box is sent (<b>702</b>). The usage information may be sent (<b>702</b>) to a database in order to store the usage information for subsequent retrieval. The usage information may be sent (<b>702</b>) in the form of a query result to be viewed at a user device and/or a portal. The usage information may be retrieved from a usage information database <b>114</b> or sent directly from the set-top box <b>104</b> as requested. The request may indicate that a user desires that the usage information be retrieved in accordance with a notification preference, and a response to the request may be limited to usage information that falls into a particular category of media content. A pattern module <b>118</b> may be used to determine patterns in the usage information to provide information to a user on patterns of content received by a particular set-top box.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A change of media content received at a set-top box and/or displayed at the set-top box may be detected (<b>704</b>). Information regarding the change may be delivered in real-time directly from the set-top box <b>104</b>. The notification module <b>108</b> may need the delivery of usage information in real-time in order to provide accurate notifications to recipients. The change in media content may be needed to fulfill a request (<b>706</b>) and the usage information on the media content is sent in accordance with a request (<b>702</b>). In one or more embodiments, the change in media is sent to a usage information database to ensure that the set-top box usage information is stored.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In one or more embodiments, a notification preference may need the usage information (<b>706</b>) and the usage information for the change in the media content may be sent (<b>702</b>). The usage information may be sent directly to the user in a notification and/or sent to a usage information database <b>114</b> for storage (<b>702</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Alternatively, the usage information (<b>706</b>) may not be retained. For example, a set-top box owner may request that no usage information be stored for the set-top box or that only a select portion of usage information be stored. The usage information database <b>114</b> may be configured to aggregate information from multiple set-top boxes. The usage information database <b>114</b> may aggregate information for a family, a business, a communications service provider, an organization, or any other entity. In an embodiment, a user may be required to grant authorization for a communications service provider or other external organization to aggregate usage information. The usage information database <b>114</b> may aggregate usage and viewing information based on options, settings, and any other user preferences. For example, the user preferences may specify that viewing information is recorded only for children within a home from 3:30 p.m. to 12:00 p.m. and the viewing information is automatically displayed to a parent on one or more specified days or times. In another embodiment, the viewing information may be automatically sent in a message, such as an email or text message to a specified device or posted to a user accessible website.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The usage information database <b>114</b> may store information for multiple user profiles. The viewing information may be tracked individually, for groups of individuals, and/or collectively. For example, the set-top boxes may be utilized by various family members in different locations within a home with the set-top boxes communicating viewing information to one or more of the set-top boxes. The identity of a user may be determined based on viewing patterns and selection or other user behavior or information. In another embodiment, a user may input a password, a name, a pin, any other user identifier and/or identification information. A remote control may also be configured to read a biometric, such as a fingerprint, to determine the user accessing and controlling a specific set-top box.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The usage information database <b>114</b> may track viewing information for any number of topics or contacts. In one embodiment, the usage information database <b>114</b> may track the favorite or most frequently viewed programs, ratings, channels, actors, series, and other information. The usage information database <b>114</b> may interface with Internet websites, electronic television guides, a cable provider's program guide to obtain additional information associated with user viewing information. For example, an external television database may be accessed by the usage information database <b>114</b> to extract additional information, such as actors, directors, and rating. The usage information database <b>114</b> may also extract interactive content or information of interest to a user that is not available through the set-top box, such as actor biographies, quizzes, product placements, and other information. The usage information database <b>114</b> may also be configured to track categories or types of viewer content. The types or categories of viewer content may include educational, movies, cartoons, dramas, comedies, action, nature, horror, and other similar topics.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The viewing information within the usage information database <b>114</b> may be tracked for specific time periods, such as per day, week, month, and year. As a result, a summary or history of selected viewing information may be displayed to one or more authorized users for a specified time period. In another embodiment, a user may track viewing information for a time period, such as winter vacation, the school year, or three specific days.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The usage information database <b>114</b> may compile information regarding episodes, movies, and series watched by the user. The usage information database <b>114</b> may communicate with a DVR integrated with or external to the set-top box to record specified information. The usage information database may interact with a program guide to record content or provide the users content reminders. The content reminders may be output through a display or sent in a message from the set-top box. The usage information database <b>114</b> may interact with the DVR to perform a smart DVR function of automatically recording missed episodes, programs, or movies that the user has not viewed. As a result, the user may be able to watch movie sequels the user has not previously seen based on the compilation of viewing information through the usage information database <b>114</b> and interactivity of the DVR. In one embodiment, missed episodes may also be queried by a user to display upcoming television broadcasts included in a program guide that are unwatched by the user. Any number of criteria or factors may be utilized to record content that may be of interest to one or more users. The usage information database <b>114</b> may specify the content that was automatically recorded for a user and what factors prompted the usage information database <b>114</b> to command the DVR to record the content. Any number of automatic selection elements, content, or interactive features may be utilized to access the viewing information stored for multiple users within the usage information database <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In one embodiment, the user may select to review viewing information based on a specific date or time period. A calendar interface may provide a visual display of viewing information for each day, week, month, or year. For example, the user may select to view movies and televisions reviewed during a fall break to recommend a movie to a friend. The viewing information may also be shared with a friend or other authorized user based on permissions or an invitation.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In one or more embodiments, usage information stored in a usage information database <b>114</b>, as described with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, may be displayed on a web portal. A user of a web portal may personalize their web portal to display usage information for one or more set-top boxes. The usage information may have information on all content received and/or selected for display at a set-top box, including, but not limited to, time received/displayed, set-top identification, title of content, type of content, ratings for content, program guide information, television episode information, and any information regarding the content. The user may choose to view the usage information that pertains to any notification or notification preferences and/or patterns identified in viewing habits.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> depicts a user interface for implementing the provision of notifications in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a reminder notification user interface entitled &#x201c;Content Notification&#x2014;User Settings&#x201d; <b>800</b> is provided as an example of an interface for the present invention. It will be understood by those with skill in the art that any number of interfaces may be provided to create, delete, and update content notifications. Embodiments of the present invention may request that security information be input in order to create reminder notifications, such as a username and password as shown for &#x201c;Account Number 1234567&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The following ways to provide input for creating content notification preferences and corresponding content notification rules are depicted <b>802</b>: a text input for a notification preference entitled &#x201c;Name-Notification Preference,&#x201d; a text input for a notification rule entitled &#x201c;Notification Rule,&#x201d; and a text input for a recipient entitled &#x201c;Notification Receiver.&#x201d; Examples of ways to provide input to edit notification preferences are depicted <b>804</b> and <b>806</b>: a text input for a notification preference entitled &#x201c;Name-Notification Preference,&#x201d; a text input for a notification rule entitled &#x201c;Notification Rule,&#x201d; a text input for identification of a set-top box entitled &#x201c;Set-top Box,&#x201d; a text input for time entitled &#x201c;Time,&#x201d; and a text input for a recipient entitled &#x201c;Notification Receiver.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a flow chart for implementing the provision of responses to notifications in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, a notification is sent in accordance with a notification preference for a set-top box (<b>900</b>). In one or more embodiments, the notification preferences are reminder notification preferences as described above with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> and/or content notification preferences as described above with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The notification may contain information to allow for interpretation of a partial command, such as information on media content available to be received by the set-top box. A user may receive the notification at a user device and send a communication with a partial command in response to the notification to perform commands relating to the notification. A partial command may be a text string that is interpreted with a notification to be a command for a set-top box. For example, a user may send a text message with a partial command as follows, &#x201c;R Office&#x201d; and the text message combined with a reminder notification as follows, &#x201c;The &#x2018;Office&#x2019; television show episode that has not been received for viewing by set-top box A will be broadcast in 15 minutes,&#x201d; the text message can be interpreted to record the Office episode in 15 minutes on set-top box A. A user may leave a voice message for the set-top box that is converted into the following text &#x201c;S R.&#x201d; The partial command &#x201c;S R&#x201d; combined with the following content notification &#x201c;Recording of R rated movie began on set-top box B&#x201d; may be interpreted to be a command to stop the recording of the R rated movie.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Next, a communication with a partial command for a set-top box is received from a user device (<b>902</b>). A user device, such as user device <b>102</b>, may use a Notification/Communication <b>106</b> Interface to send the communication with a partial command for a set-top box. In one or more embodiments, the user may send the communication directly to a server known to have software to handle requests for interpretation of partial commands for a set-top box or the communication may be sent directly to a set-top box. Those skilled in the art will recognize that there are many ways to identify a communication that contains partial commands for a set-top box. The communication may be sent directly to a set-top box with a communication interface and a notification module to interpret the partial command, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, a partial command may be identified in a communication at any server intercepting communications, parsing at least a portion of the communication, and recognizing the portion of the communication as indicated that the communication contains a partial command. For example, the communication may be written in a language developed for communicating partial commands or contain some form of identifier indicating the communication contains a partial command.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">After the communication is received, the partial command is interpreted in view of the notification (<b>904</b>). In order to interpret the partial command, the partial command may be extracted from the communication by parsing the communication and the partial command may be interpreted with a notification retrieved from a database. For example, a communication with a partial command &#x201c;Stop Download&#x201d; that references a monitoring notification &#x201c;Pay per view is being downloaded to set-top box A&#x201d; can be interpreted to be a command to prevent the download of the pay per view content at set-top box A. The communication may reference the appropriate notification to allow for interpretation of the partial command with the correct notification. As described above, the communication may be identified as containing a partial command and any information that makes the partial command incomplete as a command for a set-top box may be inferred or interpreted with the use of a notification.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">A command may then be sent to a set-top box based on the partial command and the notification (<b>906</b>). The command may then be executed by the set-top box. As indicated above, the set-top box may perform the interpretation of the partial command and execute the command.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart for implementing the provision of a web-based content feed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Initially, a content feed is received at a set-top box (<b>1000</b>). A content feed is a summary of frequently updated content. The content feed itself may consist of one or more content summaries for each piece of content provided in the content feed. A content summary provides information on content, such as a description, title, publication date, or any other relevant information on the content. In one or more embodiments, the content feed may be an XML document with one or more document elements provide a summary of content. Embodiments may use a content feed that is an aggregation of content feeds and/or content feed documents from various sources (e.g., RSS). A user may subscribe to receive content feeds from one or more sources. A content feed reader may be employed to extract information on each piece of content from the document to display the content. A web-based content feed may provide links to web pages that provide further information on content summarized in the content feed. In one or more embodiments, a web-based content feed may be subscribed to by a user on a web page.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In one or more embodiments, the content feed may be retrieved from a content feed database <b>130</b> with a content feed module <b>126</b>. The content feed module <b>126</b> may be software executing on a content feed server <b>128</b> that handles requests for links to television programs to be placed in a web-based content feed. The content feed module <b>126</b> may service requests by providing television content identifiers to allow retrieval of the television program or by providing a web-based content feed with embedded links to the television programs. A television content identifier provides enough information to allow for the retrieval of a television program associated with the television content identifier in a television broadcast.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Next, a television broadcast is received at a set-top box (<b>1002</b>). The television broadcast has audio and visual content for one or more television programs. A user may select a particular television program from the television broadcast to be displayed with the user interface for the set-top box.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A television program is then identified from the television broadcast that relates to a portion of the web-based content feed (<b>1004</b>). The television program may relate to content in a web-based content feed if the television program may provide more information on the content summarized within the web-based content feed. In one or more embodiments, metadata associated with a television program may indicate that the television program is related to a content summary within the web-based content feed. Some embodiments may rely on a third-party to provide information on both the content in a web-based content feed and a television programs.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">A determination is made as to whether a portion of the web-based content feed is selected for display at a time that coincides with a broadcast time for the television program (<b>1006</b>). If the portion of the web-based content feed that relates to the content in the feed is displayed when a television program is scheduled to be broadcast, then a link to the television program may be displayed with the web-based content feed. Broadcast times for the television programs may be obtained by querying a program guide database. By providing the link in the web-based content feed, the viewer may select the link and have media content displayed switched to the television program that provides further information on the content displayed in the web-based content feed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In one or more embodiments, the link to the content is only provided in the web-based content feed if the user indicates that the content is of interest to a viewer of the set-top box. A viewer may provide content preferences indicating types of content that the user would like to receive links for in a web-based content feed.
