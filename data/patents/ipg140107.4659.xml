<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Traditional telephony devices utilize dual-tone multi-frequency (&#x201c;DTMF&#x201d;) signaling (also referred to as touch-tone dialing) to establish telephone call connections and perform other functions after a connection is established. With DTMF, each key or digit that is pressed on a telephone generates two tones of specific frequencies. These tones are pulse code modulated and transmitted by way of a public-switched telephone network (&#x201c;PSTN&#x201d;) to a receiving telephony device. The receiving telephony device may then demodulate the received pulse code modulated tones to determine which keys were pressed.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">However, with the advent of the Internet, voice communications are increasingly being transported over IP networks such as the Internet and other packet-switched networks. To this end, numerous types of Voice over Internet Protocol (&#x201c;VoIP&#x201d;) telephony devices have been developed that are configured to transmit and receive packet-based communications instead of DTMF tones. For example, many VoIP telephony devices are configured to send and receive packet-based representations of digits that have been encoded in accordance with a standard known as RFC2833.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To facilitate communication between traditional analog telephony devices and VoIP telephony devices, one or more gateway devices may be provided that translate DTMF tones into packet-based representations and vice versa. For example, DTMF tones representative of a digit sequence that are generated by an analog telephony device may be routed through a gateway device, which translates the DTMF tones into a packet-based representation of the digit sequence that may be received by a VoIP telephony device. The gateway device may similarly translate a packet-based representation of a digit sequence into DTMF tones that may be received by an analog telephony device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">It has been found that some gateway devices do not accurately translate DTMF tones into packet-based representations and vice versa. For example, some gateway devices do not function properly when deployed within a network environment associated with a particular service provider. Hence, it is often desirable to test gateway devices before they are deployed.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Methods and systems for testing a gateway device are described herein. For example, a gateway device under test may be selectively and communicatively coupled to a testing subsystem. The testing subsystem may generate a digit map in response to user input received by way of a graphical user interface. The digit map defines a digit sequence and a plurality of dual-tone multi-frequency (&#x201c;DTMF&#x201d;) properties associated with each digit included in the digit sequence. The testing subsystem may further generate DTMF tones representing the digit sequence in accordance with the DTMF properties and transmit the DTMF tones to the gateway device under test, which translates the DTMF tones into a packet-based representation of the digit sequence and the DTMF properties. The testing subsystem may receive the packet-based representation of the digit sequence and the DTMF properties from the gateway device and determine whether the digit sequence and the DTMF properties included in the packet-based representation substantially match (e.g., are within an acceptable range of) the digit sequence and the DTMF properties defined by the digit map.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As will be described in more detail below, the testing subsystem may be additionally or alternatively configured to generate a digit map, generate a packet-based representation of the digit sequence and the DTMF properties defined in the digit map, and transmit the packet-based representation to the gateway device under test, which translates the packet-based representation into DTMF tones representing the digit sequence. The testing subsystem may receive the DTMF tones from the gateway device, measure a plurality of DTMF properties of the DTMF tones, and determine whether the measured DTMF properties substantially match the DTMF properties defined by the digit map.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As used herein, each &#x201c;digit&#x201d; included within a digit sequence defined by the digit map may be associated with a key that may be pressed on an analog telephony device by a user. For example, a digit may be associated with a number key having a value between 0 and 9, the &#x201c;*&#x201d; key, the &#x201c;#&#x201d; key, and/or any other key that may be a part of an analog telephony device. A digit may additionally or alternatively be associated with any other telephony event that may be generated and transmitted by an analog telephony device. For example, a digit may be associated with a dial tone.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As used herein, a &#x201c;DTMF property&#x201d; associated with a digit specifies a particular property of a DTMF signal generated by an analog telephony device in order to transmit the digit. Exemplary DTMF properties associated with a digit include, but are not limited to, a duration associated with the digit, an inter-digit delay associated with the digit, and an amplitude associated with the digit. Each of these DTMF properties will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As used herein, a &#x201c;packet-based representation&#x201d; of a digit sequence and its corresponding DTMF properties refers to any packet-based format in which the digit sequence and values representative of the DTMF properties may be encoded. An exemplary packet-based format that may be used to encode a digit sequence and a plurality of DTMF properties is known as RFC2833. In RFC2833, DTMF digits and DTMF properties associated with the digits are encoded as packets that may be transported by way of any suitable packet-based communication protocol (e.g., real-time transport protocol (&#x201c;RTP&#x201d;)). Other packet-based formats may be used to encode a digit sequence and DTMF properties as may serve a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The methods and systems described herein facilitate testing of a gateway device before it is deployed in a particular network environment, which may be specific to a particular service provider. In this manner, it may be determined whether the gateway device is suitable for the particular network environment. The methods and systems may further facilitate testing of a gateway device after it has been deployed in a particular network environment. For example, the methods and systems described herein may be utilized to troubleshoot and/or otherwise test a particular gateway device that may not be accurately translating DTMF tones to packet-based representations and/or vice versa.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, testing subsystem <b>102</b> may include a digit map facility <b>302</b>, a DTMF emulation facility <b>304</b>, a packet-based emulation facility <b>306</b>, a communication facility <b>308</b>, a testing facility <b>310</b>, and a storage facility <b>312</b>, which may be in communication with one another using any suitable communication technologies. It will be recognized that although facilities <b>302</b>-<b>312</b> are shown to be separate facilities in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, any of those facilities may be combined into a single facility as may serve a particular application.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Digit map facility <b>302</b> may be configured to generate a digit map in response to user input received by way of a graphical user interface. To this end, digit map facility <b>302</b> may be further configured to generate and display the graphical user interface. As mentioned, a digit map defines a digit sequence that may be transmitted to gateway device <b>104</b> in order to determine whether gateway device <b>104</b> can accurately translate the digit sequence from one type of representation to another (e.g., from DTMF tones to a packet-based representation or vice versa).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The digit map generated by digit map facility <b>302</b> is further configured to define a plurality of DTMF properties associated with each digit included in the digit sequence. Exemplary DTMF properties associated with a digit include, but are not limited to, a duration associated with the digit, an inter-digit delay associated with the digit, and an amplitude associated with the digit.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, a &#x201c;duration&#x201d; associated with a digit refers to a period of time during which one or more tones representative of the digit are played. For example, a duration associated with a digit may correspond to a length of time that a key associated with the digit is pressed by a user. It will be recognized that each digit in a particular digit sequence may have a different duration depending on how long the user presses each key associated with the digits.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An &#x201c;inter-digit delay&#x201d; associated with a digit refers to a period of time after which the digit is input and before a subsequent digit is input. For example, a user may press a key associated with a first digit (e.g., &#x201c;1&#x201d;) and then wait 200 milliseconds before pressing a key associated with another digit (e.g., &#x201c;2&#x201d;). The 200 millisecond time period is referred to as the inter-digit delay associated with the first digit. It will be recognized that a last digit in a sequence of digits need not have an inter-digit delay associated therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An &#x201c;amplitude&#x201d; of a digit refers to a peak amplitude of a sine wave (i.e., a tone) associated with the digit. Each digit in a particular digit sequence may have a distinct amplitude.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some examples, the digit map generated by digit map facility <b>302</b> may further define a duration tolerance value, an inter-digit delay tolerance value, and an amplitude tolerance value associated with each digit in the digit sequence. Each of these tolerance values specifies an acceptable range within which a received DTMF property must fall compared to its corresponding DTMF property defined in the digit map in order for gateway device <b>104</b> to pass a translation test performed by testing subsystem <b>102</b>. In other words, testing facility <b>310</b> may utilize the specified tolerance values to determine whether gateway device <b>104</b> has accurately translated a digit sequence defined by the digit map from one type of representation to another (e.g., from DTMF tones to a packet-based representation or vice versa).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some examples, a user may utilize the graphical user interface generated and displayed by digit map facility <b>302</b> to specify one or more of the values defined by the digit map. For example, a user may specify the digits included within the digit sequence defined by the digit map, the DTMF properties associated with each of the digits, and the tolerance values associated with each of the DTMF properties. In some examples, one or more of the values defined by the digit map may not be specified by the user. In these cases, digit map facility <b>302</b> may automatically select a default value for each non-specified value.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">DTMF emulation facility <b>304</b> may be configured to emulate a telephony device that transmits and receives DTMF tones (e.g., a legacy analog telephone). For example, as will be described in more detail below, DTMF emulation facility <b>304</b> may generate DTMF tones representing the digit sequence defined in the digit map generated by digit map facility <b>302</b> in accordance with the DTMF properties defined in the digit map. As will be described in more detail below, the DTMF tones may be transmitted to gateway device <b>104</b> in order to test one or more translation capabilities of gateway device <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Packet-based emulation facility <b>306</b> may be configured to emulate a telephony device that transmits and receives packet-based representations of digit sequences and DTMF properties associated with the digit sequences (e.g., a VoIP telephone). For example, packet-based emulation facility <b>306</b> may generate a packet-based representation of the digit sequence and the DTMF properties defined in the digit map generated by digit map facility <b>302</b>. As will be described in more detail below, the packet-based representation may be transmitted to gateway device <b>104</b> in order to test one or more translation capabilities of gateway device <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Communication facility <b>308</b> may be configured to facilitate communication between testing subsystem <b>102</b> and gateway device <b>104</b>. For example, communication facility <b>308</b> may be configured to transmit DTMF tones generated by DTMF emulation facility <b>304</b> to gateway device <b>104</b>. Gateway device <b>104</b> may translate the DTMF tones into a packet-based representation of the digit sequence and the DTMF properties represented by the DTMF tones. Communication facility <b>308</b> may be further configured to receive the packet-based representation from gateway device <b>104</b>. As will be described in more detail below, testing facility <b>310</b> may process the received packet-based representation to determine whether the digit sequence and the DTMF properties included in the packet-based representation substantially match the digit sequence and the DTMF properties defined by the digit map.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Additionally or alternatively, communication facility <b>308</b> may be configured to transmit the packet-based representation generated by packet-based emulation facility <b>306</b> to gateway device <b>104</b>. Gateway device <b>104</b> may translate the packet-based representation into DTMF tones having the DTMF properties specified in the packet-based representation. Communication facility <b>308</b> may be further configured to receive the DTMF tones from gateway device <b>104</b>. As will be described in more detail below, testing facility <b>310</b> may measure a plurality of DTMF properties of the received DTMF tones and determine whether the measured DTMF properties substantially match the DTMF properties defined by the digit map.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, as will be described in more detail below, communication facility <b>308</b> may selectively emulate one or more of an analog telephony device interface, a VoIP telephony device interface, and a network monitoring interface in order to selectively receive different types of communications.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Testing facility <b>310</b> may be configured to analyze communications received from gateway device <b>104</b> in order to determine whether gateway device <b>104</b> is accurately translating DTMF tones into packet-based representations and vice versa. For example, as mentioned, testing facility <b>310</b> may analyze a packet-based representation of a digit sequence and associated DTMF properties that is received from gateway device <b>104</b> to determine whether the digit sequence and the DTMF properties included in the packet-based representation substantially match the digit sequence and the DTMF properties defined by a digit map generated by digit map facility <b>302</b>. Likewise, testing facility <b>310</b> may measure DTMF properties of DTMF tones transmitted by gateway device <b>104</b> to determine whether the measured DTMF properties substantially match the DTMF properties defined by the digit map. Exemplary testing heuristics that may be utilized by testing facility <b>310</b> will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Storage facility <b>312</b> may be configured to maintain digit map data <b>314</b> representative of a digit map generated by digit map facility <b>302</b>, test data <b>316</b> representative of a result of one or more tests performed by testing facility <b>310</b>, and/or any other data as may serve a particular application.</p>

While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates exemplary steps according to one embodiment, other embodiments may omit, add to, reorder, and/or modify any of the steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The steps shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may be performed by any component of testing subsystem <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In step <b>402</b>, a digit map is generated in response to user input received by way of a graphical user interface. As described above, the digit map defines a digit sequence and a plurality of DTMF properties associated with each digit included in the digit sequence. The digit map may be generated by digit map facility <b>302</b>, for example, in response to user input received by way of a graphical user interface displayed by digit map facility <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an exemplary graphical user interface (&#x201c;GUI&#x201d;) <b>500</b> that may be generated and displayed by digit map facility <b>302</b> in order to facilitate user creation of a digit map. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, GUI <b>500</b> may include various fields configured to receive user input associated with a digit map. For example, input field <b>502</b> may receive user input representative of a name of a particular digit map and input field <b>504</b> may receive user input representative of a description of the particular digit map. Additional or alternative fields associated with the digit map may be displayed in GUI <b>500</b> as may serve a particular implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, GUI <b>500</b> may include a digit map table <b>506</b> configured to receive user input representative of a particular digit sequence and various DTMF properties associated with each digit in the digit sequence. It will be recognized that the various entries included in digit map table <b>506</b> are merely illustrative of the many different entries that may be included therein. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, digit map table <b>506</b> includes a digit sequence comprising three digits: &#x201c;9,&#x201d; &#x201c;8,&#x201d; and &#x201c;7.&#x201d; Each of these digits has been input by a user and has a plurality of user input DTMF properties associated therewith. For example, row <b>508</b> of digit map table <b>506</b> shows that the digit &#x201c;9&#x201d; has been defined to have a duration of 5000 milliseconds (&#x201c;ms&#x201d;), an inter-digit delay of 5000 ms, and an amplitude of &#x2212;7.00 decibels (&#x201c;dB&#x201d;). Row <b>510</b> shows that the digit &#x201c;8&#x201d; has been defined to have a duration of 1000 ms, an inter-digit delay of 1000 ms, and an amplitude of &#x2212;6.00 dB. Row <b>512</b> shows that the digit &#x201c;7&#x201d; has been defined to have a duration of 2000 ms, an inter-digit delay of 3000 ms, and an amplitude of &#x2212;9.00 dB.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Each digit included in digit map table <b>506</b> also has an associated duration tolerance value, inter-digit delay tolerance value, and amplitude tolerance value. Each of these tolerance values may be specified by a user. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows that the digit &#x201c;9&#x201d; has been defined to have a duration tolerance value of 100 ms, an inter-digit delay tolerance value of 100 ms, and an amplitude tolerance value of 1.00 dB.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, each digit included in digit map table <b>506</b> may be represented by an actual numerical value. Additionally or alternatively, one or more frequency values associated with a digit may be used to represent a digit included in digit map table <b>506</b>. To illustrate, frequency values of &#x201c;350&#x201d; and &#x201c;440&#x201d; may be input into a single field to represent a dial tone.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A user may add one or more digits and associated DTMF properties to digit map table <b>506</b> in order to include the one or more additional digits in the digit sequence defined by the digit map. For example, a user may enter values into row <b>514</b> of digit map table <b>506</b> in order to add another digit and associated DTMF properties to digit map table <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In some examples, a user may select an option (e.g., &#x201c;Import from File&#x201d; option <b>516</b>) to import a digit sequence and/or DTMF properties from a file. In this manner, a user may load a predefined digit map into digit map table <b>506</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in step <b>404</b>, DTMF tones representing the digit sequence defined by the digit map are generated in accordance with the DTMF properties defined in the digit map. DTMF emulation facility <b>304</b> may generate DTMF tones representing the digit sequence in accordance with the DTMF properties in any suitable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In step <b>406</b>, the DTMF tones generated in step <b>404</b> are transmitted to a gateway device. For example, communication facility <b>308</b> of testing subsystem <b>102</b> may transmit the DTMF tones to gateway device <b>104</b>. As described above, the gateway device is configured to translate the DTMF tones into a packet-based representation of the digit sequence and the DTMF properties associated with the DTMF tones.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In step <b>408</b>, the packet-based representation generated by the gateway device is received from the gateway device. Communication facility <b>308</b> may receive the packet-based representation in suitable manner. For example, communication facility <b>308</b> may emulate a VoIP telephony device interface and receive and process the packet-based representation as would a VoIP telephony device. Additionally or alternatively, communication facility <b>308</b> may emulate a network monitoring interface (e.g., a packet sniffer) and intercept the packet-based representation along a transmission path of the packet-based representation.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In step <b>410</b>, a determination is made whether the digit sequence and the DTMF properties included in the packet-based representation received in step <b>408</b> substantially match the digit sequence and the DTMF properties defined by the digit map generated in step <b>402</b>. Testing facility <b>310</b> may perform the determination in any suitable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, testing facility <b>310</b> may compare the digit sequence included in the received packet-based representation to the digit sequence defined by the digit map generated in step <b>402</b>. If the digit sequences are identical, testing facility <b>310</b> may so indicate in a test results GUI (described below) and/or in any other manner. If the digit sequences are not identical, testing facility <b>310</b> may indicate that gateway device <b>104</b> has failed the translation test.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Testing facility <b>310</b> may additionally or alternatively be configured to compare the DTMF properties included in the received packet-based representation to the DTMF properties defined by the digit map. If each received DTMF property is within an acceptable range of its corresponding DTMF property defined in the digit map, testing facility <b>310</b> may indicate in the test results GUI and/or in any other manner that gateway device <b>104</b> has passed the translation test. The acceptable range is defined by one of the tolerance values in the digit map.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">To illustrate, testing facility <b>310</b> may determine whether the DTMF properties of a received digit &#x201c;9&#x201d; match the DTMF properties associated with digit &#x201c;9&#x201d; included the digit map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. For example, testing facility <b>310</b> may determine that the received digit &#x201c;9&#x201d; has a duration of 4953 ms, an inter-digit delay of 5010 ms, and an amplitude of &#x2212;6.75 dB. Testing facility <b>310</b> may then compare the received DTMF properties with those defined in the digit map. For example, testing facility <b>310</b> may determine that the received duration property is within 47 ms of the duration property defined in the digit map, the received inter-digit delay property is within 10 ms of the inter-digit delay property defined in the digit map, and that the received amplitude property is within 0.25 dB of the amplitude property defined in the digit map.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Once the differences between the received DTMF properties and the DTMF properties defined in the digit map have been determined, testing facility <b>310</b> may compare the differences to the tolerance values defined in the digit map to determine whether the received DTMF properties are within an acceptable range of their corresponding DTMF properties defined in the digit map. For example, if the duration tolerance is 100.00 ms, the inter-digit delay tolerance is 100.00 ms, and the amplitude tolerance is 1.00 dB, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, testing facility <b>310</b> may indicate that each of the determined differences are within acceptable ranges of their corresponding DTMF properties defined in the digit map.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some examples, testing facility <b>310</b> may be configured to generate and display a test results GUI configured to indicate one or more results of the comparisons performed by testing facility <b>310</b>.

Test results GUI <b>600</b> may further display the DTMF properties associated with both the transmitted and received digit sequence. Test results GUI <b>600</b> may further indicate (i.e., in a pass/fail column <b>602</b>) whether the received digit sequence and its associated DTMF properties substantially match the transmitted digit sequence and its associated DTMF properties. For example, test results GUI <b>600</b> indicates that digits &#x201c;9&#x201d; and &#x201c;7&#x201d; and their corresponding DTMF properties all passed the comparison test performed by testing facility <b>310</b> and that digit &#x201c;8&#x201d; did not pass the comparison test performed by testing facility <b>310</b>. In particular, test results GUI <b>600</b> indicates that the &#x201c;duration&#x201d; and &#x201c;amplitude&#x201d; properties of the received digit &#x201c;8&#x201d; were not within an acceptable range of the &#x201c;duration&#x201d; and &#x201c;amplitude&#x201d; properties defined in digit map table <b>506</b>.</p>
