<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In these prior art references, warnings are issued during vehicle travel and the driver is provided with information such as a driving skill assessment and points of caution. However, the driver may ignore or not make sufficient use of these warnings and information depending on the circumstances of the driver, the need for special driving operations corresponding to these circumstances, and a degree of urgency,</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a safe driving promotion system that appeals to a driver more forcefully.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In order to achieve this object, a safe driving promotion system according to this invention comprises a distance sensor that detects a target distance from a vehicle to a target in front of the vehicle, a vehicle speed sensor that detects a vehicle speed, and a programmed programmable controller.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The controller is programmed to calculate a stopping distance of the vehicle from the vehicle speed, calculate a collision possibility index corresponding to a ratio between the target distance and the stopping distance, calculate a kinetic energy of the vehicle immediately before a collision with the target from the vehicle speed and the target distance, and provide a driver with information indicating a danger of a collision based on the collision possibility index and collision damage based on the kinetic energy of the vehicle immediately before the collision.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The details as well as other features and advantages of this invention are set forth in the remainder of the specification and are shown in the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of the drawings, a vehicle safe driving promotion system according to this invention comprises a controller <b>11</b>, a monitor <b>12</b>, an operating panel <b>13</b>, an external storage device <b>14</b> constituted by a non-volatile memory or a hard disk, and a sensor group <b>15</b> for detecting driving and travel conditions of a vehicle. These components are installed in all vehicles under the vehicle safe driving promotion system as vehicle installed facilities.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The sensor group <b>15</b> comprises a GPS unit <b>17</b> constituted by a receiver of a Global Positioning System (GPS) for obtaining a current position of the vehicle, a distance measurement sensor <b>18</b> that measures a target distance to a target existing in front of the vehicle in a vehicle advancement direction, a CAN data path <b>19</b> that obtains vehicle driving conditions such as a vehicle speed, an accelerator pedal opening, and an engine torque, and a mass sensor <b>20</b>. The CAN data path <b>19</b> is connected to a vehicle speed sensor, an accelerator pedal opening sensor, a torque sensor, and so on via a control area network (CAN).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The mass sensor <b>20</b> calculates a vehicle mass by, for example, determining a sprung mass from an amount of deformation of a suspension spring of the vehicle and adding an unsprung mass, which is a fixed value, to the sprung mass.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Alternatively, a vehicle driving force F is calculated from an engine rotation speed and the engine torque as the vehicle accelerates on a flat road, a vehicle acceleration &#x3b1; is determined from a detected value of the vehicle speed, and a vehicle mass m is calculated from an operational equation F=&#x3b1;m.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The sensor group <b>15</b> is connected to a controller <b>11</b> via a data input processing circuit <b>16</b>. The data input processing circuit <b>16</b> converts data input from the sensor group <b>15</b> into signals that can be received by the controller <b>11</b>, and then inputs the signals into the controller <b>11</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0081">By executing the safe driving promotion control routine and sub-routines described above, a warning can be issued in relation to the danger of a collision with a target in front of the vehicle in the vehicle advancement direction on the basis of the collision possibility index CPI, and moreover, the driver can be informed of the damage that will occur during the collision using the kinetic energy value KE of the vehicle immediately before the collision.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0082">By providing this information, the importance of safe driving can be impressed on the driver forcefully. Further, by informing the driver of the extent of the damage to be caused by the collision, a sense of danger can be awakened in the driver such that the driver refrains from dangerous driving behavior voluntarily.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0083">Furthermore, the warning is issued on the basis of not only the value of the collision possibility index CPI but also the duration CPIt of the condition in which CPI equals or exceeds 1, and therefore the driver can be encouraged to stop the vehicle and rest after determining a driving load, or in other words the driving tiredness and driving concentration, of the driver. Hence, a favorable effect is also obtained in terms of preventing a phenomenon whereby accidents are brought about by driver stress due to continuous driving in a condition where the danger of a collision is high.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0084">Further, by having the controller <b>11</b> store the collision possibility index CPI calculated in the step S<b>12</b> and the kinetic energy KE of the vehicle immediately before the collision calculated in the step S<b>15</b> in the external storage device <b>14</b>, the controller <b>11</b> can create a risk evaluation map such as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> from the stored data.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0085">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a driving history of the driver, which is stored in the external storage device <b>14</b>, is illustrated by a large number of points plotted on the figure. An abscissa of the figure represents the collision possibility index CPI and an ordinate represents the kinetic energy KE of the vehicle immediately before the collision.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0086">Further, of two straight lines drawn on the figure, a straight line Ld having a gentle incline represents a set of the points on the figure by a straight line drawn using geometrical means such as a method of least squares.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0087">A straight line La having a sharp incline represents an incline of the set of points on the figure by a straight line having CPI=1.0 as an origin. CPI=1.0 means that the stopping distance and the inter-vehicle distance are equal. An incline &#x3b8; of the straight line La indicates an increase rate of the damage to be caused by the collision. When the increase rate is large, the damage to be caused by the collision increases rapidly relative to an increase in the collision possibility index CPI, even if the collision possibility index CPI is not so large.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0088">When a plurality of points are positioned on an identical horizontal line in the figure, this indicates great variation in the collision possibility index CPI relative to a constant kinetic energy KE of the vehicle immediately before the collision. This type of point distribution appears when the inter-vehicle distance to a vehicle traveling ahead varies greatly at a constant vehicle speed.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0089">When a plurality of points are positioned on an identical vertical line in the figure, meanwhile, this indicates great variation in the kinetic energy KE immediately before the collision at an identical collision possibility index CPI. This type of point distribution appears when the vehicle travels while maintaining a constant inter-vehicle distance to the vehicle traveling ahead, regardless of the vehicle speed.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0090">Crossed lines in the figure represent approximate maximum values of the collision possibility index CPI and the kinetic energy KE of the vehicle immediately before the collision. Further, an arc in the figure passes through an intersection between the crossed lines in the figure, centering on a point where CPI is 1.0 and KE is zero. An increase in a diameter of the arc indicates an increase in one or both the collision possibility index CPI and the kinetic energy KE of the vehicle immediately before the collision.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0091">When driving is terminated, the controller <b>11</b> preferably displays the risk evaluation map on the monitor <b>12</b> in response to an operation performed by the driver on the operating panel <b>13</b>. In so doing, the driver can analyze his/her driving operation by viewing the risk evaluation map displayed on the monitor <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0092">On a risk evaluation map shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, on the other hand, an intersection angle &#x3b1; between the straight line Ld and an X axis is smaller than that of the risk evaluation map shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and the diameter of the arc serving as an umbrella for the plotted points drawn using CPI=1.0 as an origin is also comparatively small. The kinetic energy value KE immediately before the collision corresponding to the maximum value of the collision possibility index CPI over the driving history is also small.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0093">It cannot be said that a driver having this driving history is less likely to collide with a vehicle traveling ahead than a driver having the driving history shown on the risk evaluation map in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. However, a collision energy generated during a collision can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0094">The set of points shown on the driving history of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is shaped so as to curve in the horizontal direction at a CPI of approximately 1.9 while the kinetic energy value KE immediately before the collision remains small. It can therefore be seen that this driver has driven so as to vary the inter-vehicle distance while maintaining the vehicle speed. By creating a risk evaluation map plotting the driving history in this manner, the driver can recognize tendencies in his/her driving behavior.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0095">Hence, the dangerousness of the driving behavior can be evaluated from the length and incline of the straight line La or the straight line Ld on the risk evaluation map.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0096">Here, assuming from the risk evaluation map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and the risk evaluation map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> that the driving conditions of the vehicle, apart from the driver, are identical, the length of the straight line Ld is shorter and the incline of the straight line Ld is smaller on the risk evaluation map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> than on the risk evaluation map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. It may be considered from this fact that the driving behavior of the driver represented on the risk evaluation map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is less dangerous than the driving behavior of the driver represented on the risk evaluation map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In other words, the driving of the driver represented on the risk evaluation map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may be considered more dangerous than the driving of the driver represented on the risk evaluation map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0097">By displaying this information on the monitor <b>12</b> when driving of the vehicle is terminated, the driver can objectively grasp the dangerousness of his/her driving operation. By comparing the risk evaluation map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> with the risk evaluation map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it can be seen that the overall dangerousness of the driving, taking into consideration even the damage that would be caused by a collision, is higher in the former than in the latter. By providing the driver with this information, an appeal to the driver for safe driving can be made even more forcefully.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0098">It should be noted that by storing the vehicle position information detected by the GPS <b>17</b> in the external storage device <b>14</b> together with the values of the collision possibility index CPI and the kinetic energy value KE immediately before the collision and creating individual risk evaluation maps in relation to traveling conditions such as an urban area, a suburban area, and an expressway, for example, the driver can be provided with even more detailed information for promoting safe driving.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0099">Next, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a second embodiment of this invention will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0100">In the safe driving promotion system for a road surface traveling vehicle according to the first embodiment, all components are installed in the vehicle. However, a safe driving promotion system for a road surface traveling vehicle according to this embodiment, aims for even greater promotion of safe driving through linkage to a base station on the exterior of the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0101">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, for this purpose, a safe driving promotion system according to this embodiment is constituted by a vehicle installed facility A installed in the vehicle, and a driving management facility B and a database C disposed in a base station E on the exterior of the vehicle. The vehicle installed facility A comprises a communication device D in addition to the configurations of the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0102">The driving management facility B performs driving management on a plurality of vehicles installed with the vehicle installed facility A by communicating with the vehicles. The database C accumulates driving data relating to the individual vehicles, and when necessary communicates with the vehicle installed facilities A of the individual vehicles via the driving management facility B in order to store new data and supply stored data.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0103">A communication method employed by the communication device D to perform communication between the vehicle installed facility A and the driving management facility B may be any communication method enabling mutual recognition and communication as required between the vehicle installed facility A and the driving management facility B.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0104">When a predetermined transmission condition is established, the vehicle installed facilities A of the individual vehicles transmit driving data including the collision possibility index CPI and the kinetic energy KE of the vehicle immediately before the collision, which are stored in the external storage device <b>14</b>, to the driving management facility B via the communication device D.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0105">The database C stores these data using a predetermined management system. The database C also outputs accumulated data in response to an information provision request from the vehicle installed facility A or the driving management facility B. For example, when the driving management facility B requests provision of a risk evaluation map of a certain travel zone for a certain driver and a standard risk evaluation map for comparison, the database C outputs these maps to the driving management facility B.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0106">The driving management facility B analyzes problems relating to driving management of the corresponding driver on the basis of the information input from the vehicle installed facility A by communication, stores analysis results in the database C, and transmits instructions based on the analysis results to the vehicle installed facility A of the information transmission source. For this purpose, the driving management facility B is likewise constituted by a microcomputer including a central processing unit (CPU), a read-only memory (ROM), a random access memory (RAM), and an input/output interface (I/O interface). The driving management facility B may be constituted by a plurality of microcomputers.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0107">The database C is constructed in an external storage device such as a hard disk that is connected to the driving management facility B via the I/O interface.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0108">In the safe driving promotion system configured as described above, the controller <b>11</b> of the vehicle installed facility A executes a safe driving promotion control routine shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> instead of the safe driving promotion control routine shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This safe driving promotion control routine is likewise executed repeatedly in a condition where the ignition switch of the vehicle is ON and stopped when the ignition switch is turned OFF.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0109">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, in a step S<b>1</b> executed immediately after the ignition switch is turned ON, the controller <b>11</b> initializes a part of the data stored in the external storage device <b>14</b> of the vehicle, including the duration CPIt. The controller <b>11</b> also performs a breakdown diagnosis on the respective devices constituting the sensor group <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0110">In a step S<b>2</b>, the controller <b>11</b> determines whether or not the processing of the step S<b>1</b> has been performed correctly and no abnormalities have been diagnosed in the devices. When the determination of the step S<b>2</b> is negative, or in other words when an error occurs during the processing of the step S<b>1</b> or an abnormality is diagnosed in one of the devices, the controller <b>11</b> performs processing of a step S<b>29</b> onward.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0111">When the determination of the step S<b>2</b> is affirmative, the controller <b>11</b> displays a message on the monitor <b>12</b> indicating that the vehicle installed facility A can be operated in a step S<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0112">In a step S<b>4</b>, the controller <b>11</b> determines whether or not a reset request flag relating to data received via the communication device D has been set. An initial value of the reset request flag is zero.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0113">When the determination of the step S<b>4</b> is affirmative, the controller <b>11</b> resets data received from the driving management facility B in a step S<b>5</b>, and then performs processing of a step S<b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0114">When the determination of the step S<b>4</b> is negative, the controller <b>11</b> skips the processing of the step S<b>5</b> and performs the processing of the step S<b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0115">Processing from the step S<b>11</b> to a step S<b>19</b> is identical to that of the safe driving promotion control routine according to the first embodiment, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. It should be noted, however, that in the safe driving promotion system including the communication device D, the reference value CPItE of the duration CPIt used in the step S<b>16</b> may be set upon each execution of the routine rather than taking a fixed value. More specifically, when the current position detected by the GPS <b>17</b> is input into the driving management facility B via the communication device D, the driving management facility B may search the database C to determine the traveling conditions and input a reference value CPItE corresponding to the traveling conditions into the controller <b>11</b> via the communication device D.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0116">In this embodiment, when the determination of the step S<b>18</b> is negative or following the processing of the step S<b>19</b>, the controller <b>11</b> performs processing of a step S<b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0117">In the step S<b>21</b>, the controller <b>11</b> obtains information to be transmitted to the vehicle driving management facility B. The information includes the current position of the vehicle, detected by the GPS unit <b>17</b>, the vehicle speed, the vehicle acceleration, the collision possibility index CPI, the duration CPIt, the kinetic energy KE of the vehicle immediately before the collision, the maximum value of the collision possibility index CPI, and the road surface frictional coefficient &#x3bc;.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0118">In a step S<b>22</b>, the controller <b>11</b> determines whether or not acquisition of the information to be transmitted to the database C is complete.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0119">When the determination of the step S<b>22</b> is affirmative, the controller <b>11</b> performs processing of a step S<b>23</b>. When the determination of the step S<b>22</b> is negative, the controller <b>11</b> sets the reset request flag in a step S<b>31</b> and then repeats the processing of the step S<b>4</b> onward.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0120">In the step S<b>23</b>, the controller <b>11</b> determines whether or not preparation for communication between the controller <b>11</b> and the driving management facility B by the communication device D is complete.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0121">When the determination of the step S<b>22</b> is affirmative, the controller <b>11</b> transmits the data acquired in the step S<b>21</b> to the driving management facility B via the communication device D in a step S<b>24</b>. The driving management facility B stores the received data in the database C. Following the processing of the step S<b>24</b>, the controller <b>11</b> performs processing of a step S<b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0122">When the determination of the step S<b>23</b> is negative, on the other hand, the controller <b>11</b> skips the processing of the step S<b>24</b> and performs the processing of the step S<b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0123">In the step S<b>25</b>, the controller <b>11</b> determines whether or not a problem exists in the driving of the driver. More specifically, when either the step S<b>17</b> or the step S<b>19</b> is executed, the determination of the step S<b>25</b> is affirmative, and in all other cases, the determination of the step S<b>25</b> is negative.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0124">When the determination of the step S<b>25</b> is affirmative, the controller <b>11</b> determines to transmit a warning message to the driving management facility B in a step S<b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0125">In a step S<b>27</b>, the controller <b>11</b> displays a message indicating that a problem exists in the driving management of the vehicle on the monitor <b>12</b>. The message is displayed continuously throughout the processing of the step S<b>27</b> onward.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0126">In a step S<b>28</b>, the controller <b>11</b> transmits the warning message to the driving management facility B.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0127">Following the processing of the step S<b>28</b>, or when the determination of the step S<b>25</b> is negative, the controller <b>11</b> sets the reset request flag in the step S<b>31</b> and then repeats the processing of the step S<b>4</b> onward.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0128">When the determination of the step S<b>2</b> is negative, on the other hand, or in other words when an error occurs during the processing of the step S<b>1</b> or an abnormality is diagnosed in one of the devices, the controller <b>11</b> performs the processing of the step S<b>29</b> onward.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0129">In the step S<b>29</b>, the controller <b>11</b> displays a message indicating that an abnormality has occurred and a code indicating a location of the abnormality on the monitor <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0130">In a step S<b>30</b>, the controller <b>11</b> determines to transmit an abnormality message to the driving management facility B.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0131">Following the processing of the step S<b>30</b>, the controller <b>11</b> continues to display the message indicating that an abnormality has occurred and the code indicating the location of the abnormality on the monitor <b>12</b> in the step S<b>27</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0132">In step S<b>28</b>, the controller <b>11</b> transmits a message indicating that a problem has occurred in the vehicle installed facility A to the driving management facility B. Thereafter, the reset request flag is set in the step S<b>31</b>, after which the processing of the step S<b>4</b> onward is repeated.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0133">This safe driving promotion system differs from the standalone safe driving promotion system according to the first embodiment in that communication is performed between the vehicle installed facility A and the driving management facility B and database C of the base station as required. Therefore, the driving management facility B can grasp the driving performance of the drivers of a plurality of vehicles on the basis of messages from the vehicle installed facilities A of the respective vehicles and make use of this information during driving management of the vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0134">The contents of Tokugan 2010-55508, with a filing date of Mar. 12, 2010 in Japan, are hereby incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0135">Although the invention has been described above with reference to certain embodiments, the invention is not limited to the embodiments described above. Modifications and variations of the embodiments described above will occur to those skilled in the art, within the scope of the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0136">For example, in the second embodiment, the risk evaluation map may be created by the driving management facility B of the base station upon reception of the collision possibility index CPI and the kinetic energy KE of the vehicle immediately before the collision, transmitted from the vehicle installed facility A, instead of by the vehicle installed facilities A of the respective vehicles, whereupon the created risk evaluation map may be transmitted to the vehicle installed facility A of the corresponding vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0137">In both of the above embodiments, a target collision remaining time TTC may be used instead of the collision possibility index CPI. The target collision remaining time TTC is a remaining time to a collision assuming that a relative speed between the vehicle and the target in front of the vehicle remains at a current value.</p>
