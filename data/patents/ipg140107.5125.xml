<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Many people use mobile stations, such as cell phones and personal digital assistants (PDAs), to communicate with cellular wireless networks. These mobile stations and networks typically communicate with each other over a radio frequency (RF) air interface according to a wireless protocol such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), perhaps in conformance with one or more industry specifications such as IS-95 and IS-2000. Wireless networks that operate according to these specifications are often referred to as &#x201c;1xRTT networks&#x201d; (or &#x201c;1x networks&#x201d; for short), which stands for &#x201c;Single Carrier Radio Transmission Technology.&#x201d; Another CDMA protocol that may be used is known as Evolution Data Optimized (EV-DO), perhaps in conformance with one or more industry specifications such as IS-856, Rel. 0 and IS-856, Rev. A. Other protocols may be used as well, such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), WiMax, and/or any others.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">These networks typically provide services such as voice, Short Message Service (SMS) messaging, and packet-data communication, among others, and typically include a plurality of base stations, each of which provide one or more coverage areas, such as cells and sectors. These base stations are typically not associated with any subscriber or small group of subscribers in particular; rather, they are placed in publicly-accessible locations and are used by the service provider's customers generally, and their coverage areas collectively blanket cities, rural areas, etc. When a mobile station is positioned in one of these coverage areas, it can communicate over the air interface with the base station, and in turn over one or more circuit-switched and/or packet-switched signaling and/or transport networks to which the base station provides access.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Mobile stations and base stations conduct communication sessions (e.g. voice calls and data sessions) over frequencies known as carriers, each of which may actually be a pair of frequencies, with the base station transmitting to the mobile station on one of the frequencies, and the mobile station transmitting to the base station on the other. This is known as frequency division duplex (FDD). The base-station-to-mobile-station link is known as the forward link, while the mobile-station-to-base-station link is known as the reverse link.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, using a sector as an example of a coverage area, base stations may provide service in a given sector on one carrier, or on more than one. An instance of a particular carrier in a particular sector is referred to herein as a sector-carrier. In a typical CDMA system, using a configuration known as radio configuration 3 (RC3), a base station can, on a given sector-carrier, transmit forward-link data on a maximum of 64 distinct channels at any time, each corresponding to a unique 64-bit code known as a Walsh code. Of these channels, typically, 61 of them are available as traffic channels (for user data), while the other 3 are reserved for administrative channels known as the pilot, paging, and sync channels.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When a base station instructs a mobile station operating on a given sector-carrier to use a particular traffic channel for a communication session, the base station does so by instructing the mobile station to tune to one of the 61 traffic channels on that sector-carrier. It is over that assigned traffic channel that the base station will transmit forward-link data to the mobile station during the ensuing communication session. And, in addition to that forward-link channel, the traffic channel also includes a corresponding Walsh-coded reverse-link channel, over which the mobile station transmits data to the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When a mobile station seeks to, as examples, originate a communication session (e.g. a voice call) or respond to a page message from a base station, the mobile station sends one or more messages known as access probes to the base station over a reverse-link access channel. As part of this process, the mobile station determines (e.g. computes) a power level at which to send the initial access probe. The mobile station then sends the initial access probe at that initial transmit power level.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In current implementations, mobile stations determine the initial transmit power (IP) by summing a set of values, all of which pertain to forward-link conditions and pilot-signal strength. In particular, when preparing to send an access probe, a mobile station may sum (i) a value that reflects the power at which the mobile station is receiving transmissions from the base station on the forward link, (ii) one or more constants, and (iii) an interference-correction factor that is derived from the signal-to-noise ratio at which the mobile station is currently receiving a pilot signal from the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">If the base station does not acknowledge the initial access probe, the mobile station typically sends a second access probe at an incrementally higher power level (e.g. 3 dB higher than the previous access probe). The mobile station repeats this process (i.e. incrementally increasing the power level) until either receiving an acknowledgement from the base station or reaching a set number (e.g. five) of transmitted access probes. The mobile station may then wait a timeout period, and start again at the initial power level. The mobile station may repeat this entire cycle a set number (e.g. three) of times before concluding that the base station is not reachable, or perhaps waiting a longer timeout period before starting the entire sequence over. And other variations on this access-probe-sending sequence exist as well, as this description is merely an example.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">OVERVIEW</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to IS-2000, the mobile station uses the mean input power (mean_input_pwr), a PCS correction (Correction_PCS), and an interference correction (Interference_Correction) to determine the initial transmit power (IP) at which to transmit an access probe. The interference correction is defined as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Interference_Corr=min(max(&#x2212;7&#x2212;<i>E</i><sub>c</sub><i>/I</i><sub>o</sub>,0),7)).<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Further, a nominal power parameter (Nom_Pwr), a nominal power extension parameter (Nom_Pwr_Ext), and an Initial Power parameter (Init_Pwr) are also provided to adjust the IP calculation. The Correction_PCS is defined as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Correction_PCS=Nom_Pwr&#x2212;(16*Nom_Pwr_Ext)+Init_Pwr<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Thus, under IS-2000, IP is calculated in decibels (dB) as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>IP=&#x2212;(mean_input_pwr)&#x2212;76+Correction_PCS+Interference_Corr=&#x2212;(mean_input_pwr)&#x2212;76+Nom_Pwr&#x2212;(16*Nom_Pwr_Ext)+Init_Pwr+Interference_Corr<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In practice, existing CDMA systems typically use a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as the mean input power, and typically set Nom_Pwr_Ext to be equal to zero. Further, the initial power parameter may also be referred to as the Probe Adjust Power (Probe_Pwr_Adj). Yet further, the interference correction may be based on the interference experienced on the forward link (E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub>), and thus may also be referred to as the E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>Correction. As such, an IS-2000 mobile station may calculate initial transmit power according to the following:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>IP=&#x2212;(RSSI)&#x2212;76+(Nom_Pwr)+Probe_Adj_Pwr+<i>E</i><sub>c</sub><i>/I</i><sub>o</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub>Correction<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
In the above, the RSSI is typically an indication of received signal strength at the mobile station, as measured by the mobile station. The Nominal Power (Nom_Pwr) is typically a network setting that is determined by a base station controller or another network entity and relayed to mobile stations via base stations serving the mobile stations. In practice, Nom_Pwr, is typically a constant value from zero and three. Nom_Pwr is typically provided to a mobile station in a page message that is transmitted when the mobile station powers on, but may be provided using other techniques as well. The Probe Power Adjustment parameter is a constant used to offset the overall transmit power used by the mobile station, and may be provided to a mobile station in a system parameter message from a serving base station. Default values are typically in the range of 0 dB to 3 dB, although values may vary without departing from the scope of the invention.
</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is a measure of the energy of a particular forward-link signal as compared to the energy of all signals perceived by the mobile station. Thus, E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>may vary according to the ratio of the power of a signal having the PN offset for a certain sector (i.e., the energy E<sub>c </sub>associated with the particular PN code) as compared to the total power of all signals being received by the mobile station (i.e., the total energy including and the energy E<sub>c </sub>associated with the PN codes from other sectors, as well as the energy E<sub>other </sub>at the mobile station from all other sources including noise, etc.). In practice, E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is typically determined as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>E</i><sub>c</sub><i>/I</i><sub>o</sub>=10*log(<i>E</i><sub>c</sub>/(<i>E</i><sub>c</sub><i>+E</i><sub>other</sub>))<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Since the power associated with the particular PN code (E<sub>c</sub>) is included in the total power (E<sub>c</sub>+E<sub>other</sub>) by which it is divided, the value of E<sub>c</sub>/(E<sub>c</sub>+E<sub>other</sub>) is always less than one, and thus E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is always zero or negative in value. Once E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is determined, the mobile station may determine E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub>Correction according to the following:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>E</i><sub>c</sub><i>/I</i><sub>o</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub>Correction=Min(Max((&#x2212;7&#x2212;(<i>E</i><sub>c</sub><i>/I</i><sub>o</sub>)),0),7)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The calculation of E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub>Correction thus adds a positive correction when the determined E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is greater than negative seven. And when E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is less than negative seven, the E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub>Correction is always zero. This may lead to inefficient use of network resources and in particular, may result in some mobile stations transmitting access probes with more power than is required for the base station to receive the access probe (since there is no correction when E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is less than negative seven).</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another drawback in current implementations is the use of forward link indicators (such as E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub>) to determine IP. Since access probes are transmitted over the reverse link, such techniques rely on the assumption that conditions on the forward link and the reverse link are similar.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Accordingly, methods and systems are provided for determining the initial transmit power (IP) with more granularity, which may help mobile stations to more efficiently utilize reverse-link resources, among other benefits. In particular, according to an exemplary embodiment, a mobile station may implement a bifurcated technique to determine an E<sub>C</sub>I<sub>O </sub>correction factor, which provides a granularity in determining the correction factor over an extended range of E<sub>C</sub>I<sub>O </sub>values. In addition, the mobile station may include indicators of reverse link conditions when determining IP, in addition to using a bifurcated technique to determine an E<sub>C</sub>I<sub>O </sub>correction factor. As such, an exemplary method may help a mobile station to more precisely determine the IP needed for the access probe to reach a serving base station, and thus, to more efficiently utilize reverse-link resources, among other benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">More generally, in one aspect, an exemplary method involves a mobile station (i) determining an interference level for a link between the mobile station and a base station; (ii) if the determined interference level is greater than a threshold interference level, then using a first technique to determine an interference correction factor; (iii) if the determined interference level is less than the threshold interference level, then using a second technique to determine the interference correction factor; (iv) using the determined interference correction factor as a basis for determining an initial transmit power level; and (v) transmitting an initial access probe to the base station at the determined initial transmit power level.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In an exemplary embodiment, the first technique may involve determining the interference correction factor to be equal to the minimum of (a) the threshold interference level minus the determined interference level and (b) a predetermined constant.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">1. Exemplary Architecture</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a simplified block diagram of a communication system, in accordance with exemplary embodiments. It should be understood that this and other arrangements described herein are set forth only as examples. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that other arrangements and elements (e.g., machines, interfaces, functions, orders, and groupings of functions, etc.) can be used instead, and that some elements may be omitted altogether. Further, many of the elements described herein are functional entities that may be implemented as discrete or distributed components or in conjunction with other components, and in any suitable combination and location. Various functions described herein as being performed by one or more entities may be carried out by hardware, firmware, and/or software, such as by a processor executing instructions (i.e., program code or logic) stored in memory.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a communication system <b>100</b> includes a mobile station (MS) <b>102</b>, a base transceiver station (BTS) <b>104</b>, a base station controller (BSC) <b>106</b>, a switch <b>108</b>, a network access server (NAS) <b>110</b>, a circuit-switched network <b>112</b>, and a packet-switched network <b>114</b>. Additional entities could be present as well, such as additional mobile stations in communication with BTS <b>104</b>, additional BTSs in communication with BSC <b>106</b>, additional BSCs in communication with switch <b>108</b>, and so on. Instead or in addition, there could be one or more devices and/or networks making up at least part of one or more communication links. For example, there could be one or more routers, cable modems, and/or other devices or networks on the link between NAS <b>110</b> and packet-switched network <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Mobile station <b>102</b> may be any mobile device arranged to carry out the mobile-station functions described herein. As such, mobile station <b>102</b> may include a user interface, a wireless-communication interface, a processor, and data storage comprising instructions executable by the processor for carrying out those mobile-station functions. The user interface may include buttons, a touchscreen, a microphone, and/or any other elements for receiving inputs, as well as a speaker, one or more displays, and/or any other elements for communicating outputs.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The wireless-communication interface may include an antenna and a chipset suitable for communicating with one or more base stations over suitable air interfaces. For example, the chipset could be suitable for CDMA communication. The chipset or wireless-communication interface in general may also or instead be able to communicate with other types of networks and devices, such as EV-DO networks, Wi-Fi networks, Bluetooth devices, and/or one or more additional types of networks and devices. The processor and data storage may be any suitable components known to those of skill in the art. As examples, mobile station <b>102</b> could be or include a cell phone, a PDA, a computer, a laptop computer, a hybrid CDMA/EV-DO device, and/or a multi-mode cellular/Wi-Fi device. Further, while the term &#x201c;mobile station&#x201d; is a term of art commonly used for such devices, the term &#x201c;mobile station&#x201d; should be understood to include non-mobile devices, such as a personal computer or any other device capable of the functionality of a mobile station described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">BTS <b>104</b> may be any network element arranged to carry out the BTS functions described herein. As such, BTS <b>104</b> may include a communication interface, a processor, and data storage comprising instructions executable by the processor to carry out those BTS functions. The communication interface may include one or more antennas, chipsets, and/or other components for providing one or more CDMA coverage areas such as cells and sectors, for communicating with mobile stations such as mobile station <b>102</b> over an air interface. The communication interface may also include one or more wired (e.g. Ethernet) and/or wireless (e.g. WiFi or WiMax) interfaces for communicating with at least BSC <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In a further aspect, BTS <b>104</b> may be configured to determine a measure of reverse-link interference referred to as reverse-noise rise (RNR). RNR is generally the result of a calculation of the difference between (a) the current level of noise (i.e. power level of all received transmissions) on the reverse link as received at the base station and (b) a baseline level of noise on the reverse link. In one implementation, the baseline level could be the average of the daily minimums of reverse noise over the previous week, though many other ways of calculating the baseline level could be used. In general, RNR is a measure of how high the reverse noise has risen above the baseline. A higher RNR generally correlates with a lower success rate of base stations being able to receive and acknowledge access probes from mobile stations, while a lower RNR generally correlates with a higher success rate. Alternatively, the BTS <b>104</b> may work with other network entities to determine RNR, or RNR may be calculated by other entities altogether. Furthermore, the BTS <b>104</b> (or another entity) is preferably configured to transmit the RNR to mobile stations operating in its service area.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">BSC <b>106</b> may be any network element arranged to carry out the BSC functions described herein. As such, BSC <b>106</b> may include a communication interface, a processor, and data storage comprising instructions executable by the processor to carry out those BSC functions. The communication interface may include one or more wired (e.g. Ethernet) and/or wireless (e.g. WiFi or WiMax) interfaces for communicating with at least BTS <b>104</b>, switch <b>108</b>, and NAS <b>110</b>. In general, BSC <b>106</b> functions to control one or more BTSs such as BTS <b>104</b>, and to provide those one or more BTSs with connections to devices such as switch <b>108</b> and NAS <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Note that the combination of BTS <b>104</b> and BSC <b>106</b> may be considered a base station. However, BTS <b>104</b> or BSC <b>106</b> could, taken alone, be considered a base station as well. Furthermore, a base station may be considered to be either or both of those devices, and perhaps make use of one or more functions provided by switch <b>108</b>, NAS <b>110</b>, and/or any other entity.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Switch <b>108</b> may be any networking element (e.g. a mobile switching center (MSC)) arranged to carry out the switch functions described herein. Thus, switch <b>108</b> may include a communication interface, a processor, and data storage comprising instructions executable by the processor to carry out those switch functions. The communication interface may include one or more wired (e.g. Ethernet) and/or wireless (e.g. WiFi or WiMax) interfaces for communicating with at least BSC <b>106</b> and circuit-switched network <b>112</b>. In general, switch <b>108</b> acts as a switch between one or more BSCs, such as BSC <b>106</b>, and circuit-switched network <b>112</b>, facilitating communication between mobile stations and circuit-switched network <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">NAS <b>110</b> may be any networking element (e.g. a packet data serving node (PDSN)) arranged to carry out the NAS functions described herein. As such, NAS <b>110</b> may include a communication interface, a processor, and data storage comprising instructions executable by the processor for carrying out those NAS functions. The communication interface may include one or more wired (e.g. Ethernet) and/or wireless (e.g. WiFi or WiMax) interfaces for communicating with at least BSC <b>106</b> and packet-switched network <b>114</b>. In general, NAS <b>110</b> acts as a network access server between one or more BSCs, such as BSC <b>106</b>, and packet-switched network <b>114</b>, facilitating packet-data communication between mobile stations and packet-switched network <b>114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Circuit-switched network <b>112</b> may be the network known generally as the public switched telephone network (PSTN), but may also or instead include one or more other circuit-switched networks.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Packet-switched network <b>114</b> may be the global packet-data network generally referred to as the Internet. However, packet-switched network <b>114</b> may also be or include one or more other packet-data networks. As such, packet-switched network <b>114</b> may include one or more wide area networks, one or more local area networks, one or more public networks, one or more private networks, one or more wired networks, one or more wireless networks, and/or one or more networks of any other type. Devices in communication with packet-switched network <b>114</b> may exchange data using a packet-switched protocol such as the Internet Protocol (IP), and may be identified by an address such as an IP address.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">2. Exemplary Operation</heading>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">a. A First Exemplary Method</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a flowchart of a first exemplary method <b>200</b> carried out by a mobile station, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. In general, exemplary methods, such as method <b>200</b>, may be used to transmit a signal, which is preferably an access probe. However, it should be understood that an exemplary method may also be used in conjunction with other types of signals as well. The signal is preferably transmitted with an initial power level that is determined using with an E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub>Correction value as determined by a bifurcated E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub>Correction technique.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, at block <b>202</b>, the mobile station determines an interference level for a link between the mobile station and a base station, which is typically a measure of interference for the forward-link. At block <b>204</b>, the mobile station determines whether or not the determined interference level is greater than a threshold interference level. If the determined interference level is greater than a threshold interference level, then the mobile station uses a first technique to determine an interference correction factor, as shown by block <b>206</b>. On the other hand, if the determined interference level is less than the threshold interference level, then the mobile station uses a second technique to determine the interference correction factor, as shown by block <b>208</b>. The mobile station then uses the determined interference correction factor as a basis for determining an initial transmit power level, as shown by block <b>210</b>, and transmits an initial access probe to a base station at the determined initial transmit power level, as shown by block <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Preferably, the determined interference level is the E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>on the forward link between the mobile station and the base station. Further, in an exemplary embodiment, the threshold interference level is a threshold E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>value. As such, the mobile station may use two different techniques to determine an E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>correction factor, depending upon whether the E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>on the forward link is greater than or less than the threshold E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub>. Advantageously, both techniques provide an E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>correction factor with at least some granularity, varying the amount of correction depending upon the E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>on the forward link. This may help a mobile station to more precisely determine the IP needed for an access probe to reach the base station, especially as compared to existing techniques which essentially use a correction factor of zero for a range of E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>values (e.g., E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>greater than negative seven).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">It should be understood that, with regards to E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub>, the value of E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is inversely correlated to the level of interference on the forward link. Thus, the more interference exists, the lower the value of E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub>. For instance, an E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>of negative ten is indicates that more interference exists on the forward link than an E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>of negative five or negative two. Thus, the first technique, which is employed when E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is greater than the threshold E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is employed when less interference exists, as compared when E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is less than the threshold E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>and the second technique is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In an exemplary embodiment, the first technique, used when less interference exists on the forward link (i.e., when E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is greater than the threshold), may involve determining the E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>correction factor (E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub>Correction) as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>E</i><sub>c</sub><i>/I</i><sub>o</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub>Correction=MIN((&#x2212;7&#x2212;(<i>E</i><sub>c</sub><i>/I</i><sub>o</sub>),7)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Further, the second technique, used when more interference exists (i.e., when E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is less than the threshold), may involve determining E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub>Correction as equal to MIN(MAX(&#x2212;7&#x2212;(Ec/Io)), 0), 7). However, it should be understood that other techniques may be used without departing from the scope of the invention.
</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one exemplary embodiment, the threshold E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is negative seven. Therefore, the first technique is preferably used when E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is greater than negative seven (i.e.; between zero and negative six), while the second technique is used when E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is less than negative seven. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a chart illustrating E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>correction factor values resulting from using the first technique for E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>values ranging from zero to negative six.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">b. A Second Exemplary Method</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart of a method <b>300</b> that may be carried out by a mobile station, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is similar to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, but illustrates a specific embodiment where the threshold E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is equal to negative seven. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> also shows how additional parameters, such as the RNR, may be incorporated in the process of determining initial transmit power. By incorporating RNR when determining initial transmit power, a mobile station may be able to more precisely determine the traffic load on the reverse-link, as compared to when only forward-link parameters are used. This may help improve accuracy in determining IP, especially when forward and reverse link conditions differ (e.g., when interference levels on the forward and reverse link differ).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The method <b>300</b> involves the mobile station determining the E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>on the forward link, as shown by block <b>302</b>. At block <b>304</b>, the mobile station determines whether or not the determined E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is greater than the threshold E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub>, which in this embodiment is negative seven. If E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is greater than negative seven, then the mobile station determines E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub>Correction to be equal to the minimum of (a) negative seven (i.e., the threshold interference level) minus the determined E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>(or more generally the determined interference level) and (b) seven (or more generally, a predetermined constant), as shown by block <b>306</b>. On the other hand, if E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>is less than negative seven, then the mobile station determines E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub>Correction to be equal to the minimum of (a) the maximum of (i) negative seven (i.e., the threshold interference level) minus the determined E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>(or more generally the determined interference level) and (ii) zero, and (b) seven (or more generally, a predetermined constant), as shown by block <b>308</b>. It should be understood that the threshold of negative seven is used in an exemplary embodiment in accordance with existing CDMA standards, and that the threshold E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>and the predetermined constant may be selected and vary as a matter of engineering design choice.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a further aspect of method <b>300</b>, the mobile station may itself determine various other parameters that are utilized in determining IP (or alternatively, may receive such parameters from other sources such as the base station). In method <b>300</b>, the mobile station receives the Nominal Power (Nom_Pwr) from the base station, as shown in block <b>310</b>. Typically, the mobile station receives Nom_Pwr from the base station when the mobile station powers on, although it is possible for the mobile station to receive or determine Nom_Pwr by other means, without departing from the scope of the invention. The mobile station also receives a Probe Power Adjustment parameter (Probe_Pwr_Adjust) from the base station, as shown by block <b>312</b>, and the RNR for the reverse-link from the base station, as shown in block <b>314</b>. In addition, the mobile station calculates RSSI for the forward-link, as shown by block <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in block <b>318</b>, the mobile station then determines the initial transmit power (IP) as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>IP=&#x2212;RSSI&#x2212;(76*Nom_Pwr)+Probe_Adj_Pwr+<i>E</i><sub>c</sub><i>/I</i><sub>o</sub><sub><sub2>&#x2014;</sub2></sub>Correction+(offset*RNR)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Note that this differs from the standard IP calculation in at least that the E<sub>c</sub>/I<sub>o </sub>correction factor is calculated using a more-granular bifurcated process (as shown in blocks <b>306</b> and <b>308</b>), and that RNR is incorporated in the calculation. The mobile station may then transmit an access probe at the determined IP.
</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the above determination of IP, the RNR is multiplied by an offset value, which is typically a predetermined constant that may be selected as a matter of engineering design choice, and is preferably configurable in the range of 0.5 to 1.0. It should be understood, however, that RNR, and other indicators of reverse-link traffic load or interference, may also be incorporated into the determination of IP. For example, co-owned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/172,102, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein, teaches the use of various reverse-link-loading indicators, including RNR, in the determination of IP, any of which may be incorporated in the methods and systems disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Exemplary embodiments of the present invention have been described above.
