<heading id="h-0008" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The drawings are not necessarily to scale and details, which are not necessary for understanding the present invention, may have been omitted. Further, elements that are at least substantially identical or that perform an at least substantially identical function are denoted by the same numeral.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a container <b>1</b> for fluids, in particular liquids, such as beer or soft drinks under pressure, comprising a spherical and pressure resistant outer casing <b>2</b> having a central opening <b>3</b>, a gastight inner casing <b>4</b> of a flexible material, i.e. a bag, located inside the outer casing <b>2</b>, and a valve part <b>5</b>, located in the central opening <b>3</b>, for filling the container <b>1</b>, more specifically the inner casing <b>3</b>, with a liquid respectively tapping liquid from the container <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this example, the outer casing <b>2</b> was made by blow-moulding a polyester preform, such as a PET (polyethylene terephthalate) or PEN (polyethylene naphthalate) preform. The upper rim <b>7</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the preform and (hence) of the opening <b>3</b> in the outer casing <b>2</b>, comprises a collar <b>8</b> for holding the preform during blow-moulding in a manner known in itself and, above the collar <b>8</b>, one or more, in this example two, annular and upwardly tapering ledges <b>9</b> for establishing a snap-fit connection with the valve part <b>5</b>, as will explained in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Alternatively, the outer casing may be made of e.g. a relatively thick-walled thermoplastic material or even a metal, such as aluminum. As another example, the outer casing is collapsible and made from a blow-molded thermoplastic e.g. PE or a elastomeric liner provided with a filament wound outer reinforcement and an outer layer of latex obtained by immersing the liner (with filaments) in a latex bath. Yet other suitable casings are described in, for example, EP 0 626 338, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the valve part <b>5</b> comprises an outer jacket <b>10</b>, made, in this example, of glass fiber reinforced PP, an inner jacket <b>11</b> slidably received inside the outer jacket <b>10</b>, and a closing element <b>12</b> which, in turn, is slidably received inside the inner jacket <b>11</b>. The inner jacket <b>11</b> and the closing element are both made of a polyolefin. Another example of a valve part of this type is also disclosed in International patent application WO 00/07902 (see especially page 8, line 12 ff. in conjunction with FIGS. 4A and 4B), which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When a probe of a filling unit or a dispense head is pushed into the valve part <b>5</b>, the inner jacket <b>11</b> slides with respect to the outer jacket <b>10</b> providing one or more vents for de-aerating the space between the outer and inner casings <b>2</b>, <b>4</b> during filling respectively letting in pressurized gas to expel liquid from the inner casing <b>4</b>. Further, the closing element <b>12</b> slides with respect to the inner jacket <b>11</b> providing an opening for letting the liquid in respectively out. As shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the outer jacket <b>10</b> comprises, in its bottom surface and preferably on a separate element to facilitate manufacture, a plurality of radially extending channels or, in this case, venting grooves <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The inner wall of the outer jacket <b>10</b> comprises one or more, in this example two, annular and downwardly tapering counter-ledges <b>14</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Thus, the valve part <b>5</b> can be snap-fitted substantially irreversibly to the outer casing <b>2</b> by holding the outer casing <b>2</b> in position, e.g. by means of to semi-circular rings below the collar <b>8</b>, placing the outer jacket <b>10</b>, preferably after heating it to 60&#xb0; C.-80&#xb0; C., over the upper rim <b>7</b>, pushing the valve part <b>5</b> downwards until the counter-ledges <b>14</b> snap-fit over ledges <b>9</b> on the rim <b>7</b> of the outer casing, and allowing the valve part <b>5</b> to cool.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In order to evenly distribute the tension in the upper rim <b>7</b> resulting from pressure inside the outer casing <b>2</b>, the cross-sectional area (A<b>1</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) just below the lower ledge <b>9</b> is approximately twice the cross-sectional area (A<b>2</b>) just below the upper ledge <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The inner casing <b>3</b> comprises two, in this example polygonal, flexible sheets of a gas and liquid tight laminate, preferably a laminate comprising a sealing layer (e.g., PE or PP), a barrier layer (e.g. aluminum) and one or more further layers (e.g. PA and/or PET), sealed together along their edges, e.g. by means of welding. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the inner casing <b>3</b> comprises an opening the perimeter of which has been attached, e.g. welded or glued, to a flange <b>11</b>A (best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) on the inner jacket <b>11</b> of the valve part <b>5</b>. The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> further comprises an intermediate, e.g. a foam or an annular polymer film <b>15</b>, positioned between the inner casing <b>3</b> on the one hand and the outer jacket <b>10</b> and outer casing <b>2</b> on the other. The intermediate fills or bridges any opening between the outer casing <b>3</b> and the outer jacket <b>10</b> or, in this example, the separate element, thus protecting the inner casing <b>3</b>, e.g. when elevated temperatures or internal pressure cause(s) the outer jacket <b>10</b> or, in this example, the separate element and the outer casing <b>2</b> to separate. In this example, the intermediate is attached to the outer wall of the inner casing <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The present container is especially suitable for relatively large volumes, i.e. 10 liters or more, preferably 17.5 liters or more. It was found that installing the valve part and the inner casing on the one hand and filling of the container on the other is facilitated considerably if the inner diameter of the central opening (D<b>1</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the outer casing is larger than 65 mm, preferably larger than 68 mm and preferably smaller than 85 mm, and/or the ratio (D<b>1</b>/D<b>2</b>) of the inner diameter of the central opening (D<b>1</b>; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the outer casing to the inner diameter of the inner jacket (D<b>2</b>) is in a range from 1.8 to 3.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As the (empty) containers according the present invention typically weigh less than 1.5 kilograms, a container having a maximum total weight of e.g. 23 kilogram still has a capacity of 21.5 kilograms (&#x2dc;litres) of liquid. In comparison, an empty metal keg having a capacity of 21.5 kilograms of liquid would weigh at least 8 kilograms, yielding a total of approximately 30 kilograms.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, one or more spacers, in this example two strips <b>16</b> provided with a plurality of longitudinal ridges <b>17</b>, are attached to the valve part <b>5</b> and extend between the inner casing <b>4</b> and the outer casing <b>2</b>. The spacers facilitate significantly faster and more complete filling of the inner casing and/or render the process of filling the inner casing more robust.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">To prevent detrimental interaction between the spacers and the inner casing, it is preferred that the spacers are detached from the inner casing, i.e. not welded or glued to or formed in the wall of the inner casing, as such welding, gluing or forming may affect the said wall, e.g. reduce its barrier properties and allow gas or liquid to escape.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Filling of the container according to the present invention with a fluid, in particular a liquid, such as beer, is typically carried out by</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">placing the container upside down, i.e. with the valve part facing downwards,</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">pushing a filling probe into the valve part, thus establishing fluid communication between the (lumen of the) inner casing and a pump for the fluid, and</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">supplying a liquid to the inner casing, preferably at a flow rate of more than 1 liter per second, e.g. 2 liters per second, thus displacing the gas along the spacers and through the vent(s).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">If the fluid is a carbonated liquid, a pressurized gas is supplied between the inner and outer casings prior to filling the inner casing in order to prevent the carbon dioxide from escaping and causing the liquid to foam.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an alternative embodiment comprising a plurality of filaments <b>18</b> integral with the valve part. The filaments <b>18</b> are, on the one hand, sufficiently rigid to remain substantially upright when the valve part is facing downwards and, on the other hand, sufficiently flexible to be pushed, by the inner casing <b>4</b> during filling, sideways and against the inner wall of the outer casing <b>2</b> thus forming venting paths.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> show an insert <b>19</b> to be mounted on or in an outer casing to form a container as described above, comprising a folded inner casing <b>4</b> and a plurality of strips <b>16</b>, e.g. two strips, provided with longitudinal venting paths in between ridges <b>17</b>. The folded inner casing <b>4</b> and the strips <b>16</b> are held together by means of a rupture element, in this case a paper sleeve <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) or a paper strap <b>21</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Other suitable rupture elements include e.g. wire and plastic sleeves or straps provided with a weak spot, e.g. perforations or creases.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, the bottom of the outer jacket is delimited by a raised edge which extends beyond the circumference of the folded inner casing and which, when the valve part is mounted on the outer casing, extends in the opening of the outer casing, thus preventing the inner casing from becoming jammed between the jacket and outer casing.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The inserts can be readily inserted in and snap fitted to an outer casing, with minimal risk of causing damage to the inner casing. During filling, the expanding inner casing will cause the sleeve or strap to rupture, allowing it to fully deploy.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The invention is not restricted to the above-described embodiments which can be varied in a number of ways within the scope of the claims. For instance, other types of valves, e.g. screwed instead of snap fitted, can be used. Further, the container according to the present invention is in principle also suitable for holding pressurised gasses, for instance medical gasses or industrial gasses, such as LPG or natural gas.</p>
