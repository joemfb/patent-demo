<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Wireless communication systems have become an important means by which many people worldwide have come to communicate. A wireless communication system may provide communication for a number of subscriber stations, each of which may be serviced by a base station. As used herein, the term &#x201c;subscriber station&#x201d; refers to an electronic device that may be used for voice and/or data communication over a wireless communication system. Examples of subscriber stations include cellular phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), handheld devices, wireless modems, laptop computers, personal computers, etc. A subscriber station may alternatively be referred to as an access terminal, a mobile terminal, a mobile station, a remote station, a user terminal, a terminal, a subscriber unit, a mobile device, a wireless device, user equipment, or some other similar terminology. The term &#x201c;base station&#x201d; refers to a wireless communication station that is installed at a fixed location and used to communicate with subscriber stations. A base station may alternatively be referred to as an access point, a Node B, an evolved Node B, or some other similar terminology.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A subscriber station may communicate with one or more base stations via transmissions on the uplink and the downlink. The uplink (or reverse link) refers to the communication link from the subscriber station to the base station, and the downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the base station to the subscriber station.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In current WiMAX standards, the medium access control (MAC) layer supports time division duplexing (TDD). In TDD mode, a frame <b>212</b> may be divided into two subframes: a downlink subframe <b>214</b> followed by an uplink subframe <b>216</b>. The downlink subframe <b>214</b> and the uplink subframe <b>216</b> may be transmitted on the same carrier frequency at different times.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The downlink subframe <b>214</b> includes a DL MAP <b>218</b> for resource allocation of downlink bursts <b>220</b>. The downlink subframe <b>214</b> also includes the downlink bursts <b>220</b>. The information in the DL MAP <b>218</b> makes it possible for a subscriber station <b>104</b> to identify the downlink bursts <b>220</b> allocated to it by the base station <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In current WiMAX standards, the MAC layer allocates time/frequency resources to various users in units of slots <b>322</b>, which is the smallest quanta of the physical (PHY) layer resource that can be allocated to a single user in the time/frequency domain. A burst <b>220</b> is an allocation of one or more continuous slots <b>322</b> with the same modulation and coding scheme.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The present disclosure relates to multicasting in a wireless communication network, such as a WiMAX network. Multicasting enables efficient large-scale content distribution and is becoming more and more popular in network service.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In general terms, multicasting is a tool used in networking that allows for transmitting information to a select group of users. Multicasting allows packets to be sent from one location in the network (the source) to many other locations, without unnecessary packet duplication. The source may send one packet, and this packet may be replicated as needed in the network to reach as many end-users as necessary. Being able to provide multicast services so that bandwidth is not wasted on transmitting identical packets to each and every recipient may be important for wireless networks, as they have limited transmission resources.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Multicast services may be used for applications such as television broadcasting, online games, video conferencing, video surveillance, point-to-multipoint virtual LAN services, etc. Multicast services may be utilized for both fixed and mobile subscribers. Multicast services may be provided to a large number (e.g., thousands) of users in a cell area <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. The concept of a group is relevant to multicasting. A multicast service <b>640</b> is typically associated with a multicast group <b>642</b>. The sender (or source) may transmit to the group address <b>644</b>, so that only members <b>646</b> of the group <b>642</b> receive the multicast data.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">WiMAX supports multicast connections <b>636</b> that can be used for multicast services <b>640</b> on the downlink. The base station <b>102</b> may associate a connection <b>636</b> and a CID <b>638</b> with a particular multicast service <b>640</b>. All the subscriber stations <b>104</b> in the multicast group <b>642</b> may be associated with the connection <b>636</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In a multicast scenario, a wireless virtual private network (VPN) <b>648</b> may be configured between a multicast server <b>650</b> and the subscriber stations <b>104</b> via the base station <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The base station <b>102</b> may establish a downlink multicast service <b>640</b> by creating a connection <b>636</b> with each subscriber station <b>104</b> to be associated with the service <b>640</b>. To ensure proper multicast operation, the CID <b>638</b> used for the service <b>640</b> may be the same for all subscriber stations <b>104</b> on the same channel that participate in the connection <b>636</b>. The subscriber stations <b>104</b> do not need to be aware that the connection <b>636</b> is for a multicast service <b>640</b>, although they may be. The data transmitted on the connection <b>636</b> with the given CID <b>638</b> may be received and processed by the MAC layer <b>530</b><i>b </i>of each involved subscriber station <b>104</b>. The quality of service (QoS) offered and the traffic parameters may be common for all subscriber stations <b>104</b> receiving the multicast service <b>640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A multicast service <b>640</b> may be accessed by a subscriber station <b>104</b> after it becomes aware of it through, for example, an electronic program guide (EPG), a web page, etc. This may be handled in the application layer. The multicast addresses may be available via a multicast portal, an HTTP page, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In accordance with the current WiMAX multicast protocols, the subscriber station <b>104</b> needs to parse all the PDUs <b>528</b> inside each downlink burst <b>220</b> per frame <b>212</b> to identify the multicast PDUs (i.e., the PDUs <b>528</b> that correspond to a multicast service <b>640</b>). Since the PDUs <b>528</b> within a downlink burst <b>220</b> are variable in length, modulation scheme, and encryption key, the corresponding processing time and consumed power may be significant. For a subscriber station <b>104</b> with limited battery life (e.g., a mobile device), any unnecessary waste of power results in a reduction of the service time.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The Unsolicited Grant Service (UGS) is one of the QoS classes in WiMAX standards. It periodically allocates fixed bandwidth for constant bit rate traffic. One application that may benefit from a UGS-like traffic model is multicast services.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In accordance with the present disclosure, a base station <b>102</b> may determine a fixed modulation scheme <b>752</b>, a fixed PDU payload size <b>754</b>, and a fixed number <b>756</b> of PDUs <b>738</b> per downlink burst <b>220</b> for transmission of multicast data <b>758</b> to subscriber stations <b>104</b>. In this context, the term &#x201c;fixed&#x201d; means constant (i.e., not changing or varying from one multicast frame <b>712</b> to another). In other words, in accordance with the present disclosure, the multicast PDUs <b>738</b> that are transmitted by a particular base station <b>102</b> may each have the same modulation scheme <b>752</b>, the same PDU payload size <b>754</b>, and the same number <b>756</b> of PDUs <b>738</b> per downlink burst <b>220</b>. The subscriber stations <b>104</b> may know what the modulation scheme <b>752</b>, PDU payload size <b>754</b>, and number <b>756</b> of PDUs <b>738</b> per downlink burst <b>220</b> are for multicast data <b>758</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Frames <b>712</b> in which the downlink subframe <b>214</b> is used to transmit multicast data <b>758</b> may be referred to herein as multicast frames <b>712</b>. The base station <b>102</b> may allocate downlink bursts <b>220</b> to deliver the multicast data <b>758</b> to the subscriber stations <b>104</b> via PDUs <b>738</b> using the fixed modulation scheme <b>752</b>, the fixed PDU payload size <b>754</b>, and the fixed number <b>756</b> of PDUs <b>738</b> per downlink burst <b>220</b>. The multicast data <b>758</b> may be distributed into multicast frames <b>712</b> that are allocated periodically.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In one implementation, the DL-MAP IE <b>424</b> may include a CID <b>638</b> when the inc_CID flag is turned on. The inc_CID flag can be turned on and off using the CID_SWITCH_IE DLMAP-IE (DICU=15 extended DIUC=04). The DL-MAP IEs <b>424</b> in a DL-MAP may be sent without including a CID <b>538</b> initially (e.g., inc_CID flag=0). Whenever the CID_SWITCH_IE appears, the inc_CID flag may be toggled and subsequent DL-MAP IEs <b>424</b> may include or exclude the CID <b>538</b> depending on the status of the inc_CID flag.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one implementation, the inc_CID flag may be on (e.g., inc_CID flag=1) whenever the base station <b>102</b> is sending multicast traffic. Or a DL-MAP IE <b>424</b> that includes a CID <b>538</b> is assumed to point to multicast bursts. The subscriber station <b>104</b> can then decide to process DL-MAP IEs <b>424</b> after the inc_CID flag is toggled on, based on its association to one or more multicast groups <b>642</b> or no association at all. Thus, a portion of the downlink subframe <b>214</b> may be dedicated to multicast traffic while another portion of the downlink subframe <b>214</b> (when the inc_CID flag is toggled off) can be used for other types of traffic.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Because the modulation scheme <b>752</b>, PDU payload size <b>754</b>, and number <b>756</b> of PDUs <b>738</b> per downlink burst <b>220</b> are fixed for multicast frames <b>712</b>, the size of each downlink burst <b>220</b> becomes fixed (constant) in multicast frames <b>712</b>. This may lead to lower downlink burst <b>220</b> and PDU <b>738</b> processing overhead in the subscriber stations <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As mentioned, the multicast frames <b>712</b> may be allocated periodically. The subscriber stations <b>104</b> may know when the multicast frames <b>712</b> are going to be allocated. Thus, if a subscriber station <b>104</b> does not belong to any multicast groups <b>642</b>, the subscriber station <b>104</b> may simply bypass the processing of multicast frames <b>712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If a subscriber station <b>104</b> belongs to at least one multicast group <b>642</b>, the subscriber station <b>104</b> may search for multicast CIDs <b>638</b> in DL-MAP IEs <b>424</b> in multicast frames <b>712</b>. In response to identifying a multicast CID <b>638</b> in a DL-MAP IE <b>424</b> in a multicast frame <b>712</b>, the subscriber station <b>104</b> may bypass the parsing of each PDU's MAC header <b>732</b> within a corresponding downlink burst <b>220</b> in the multicast frame <b>712</b>. This is because the PDU payload size <b>754</b> is already known (because the base station <b>102</b> has defined a fixed PDU payload size <b>754</b> for multicast frames <b>712</b>) and does not need to be determined from the MAC header <b>732</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The multicast techniques disclosed herein may be utilized in a WiMAX network. Thus, the base station <b>102</b> and the subscriber stations <b>104</b> shown in the drawings may support a WiMAX standard. Also, for simplicity, only a few base stations <b>102</b> and only a few subscriber stations <b>104</b> are shown in the drawings. However, the techniques disclosed herein may be practiced in a wireless communication network that includes multiple base stations <b>102</b> and many more subscriber stations <b>104</b> than are shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, which illustrates an example showing how multicast frames <b>712</b> may be allocated in accordance with the present disclosure. Several frames <b>212</b> are shown. Some of these frames <b>212</b> are multicast frames <b>712</b>. In particular, every third frame <b>212</b> is a multicast frame <b>712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Reference is now made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. The base station <b>102</b> may receive information about a fixed multicast rate <b>960</b> from the multicast server <b>650</b>. The multicast rate <b>960</b> is the rate at which multicast data <b>758</b> should be transmitted to the subscriber stations <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The base station <b>102</b> may calculate a traffic data volume D <b>962</b> based on the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>D=V*T</i>&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where V is the fixed multicast rate <b>960</b> (which may be specified by the multicast server <b>650</b>), and T is time spent <b>964</b> during a multicast data transmission. D may be expressed in terms of slots, and more specifically, as the slots required per multicast allocation.
</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With respect to V, the multicast server <b>650</b> works with the base stations <b>102</b> to deliver a fixed multicast rate <b>960</b> from the multicast server <b>650</b> perspective. Since a CID <b>538</b> is negotiated for multicast traffic, the QoS parameters for the multicast traffic are known before the multicast connection <b>636</b> is set up via the DSx procedure defined in the IEEE 802.16e specification. Depending on the class of service the multicast traffic is using, the data rate <b>960</b> of the multicast traffic should be known.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Once the multicast data rate <b>960</b> is known, the modulation scheme <b>752</b> may be chosen to ensure the subscriber station <b>104</b> with the lowest channel quality in the multicast group <b>642</b> can be serviced. With the data rate <b>960</b> and the modulation scheme <b>752</b> determined, the base station <b>102</b> can calculate the number of resources (in terms of downlink slots <b>322</b>) that are required within a fixed time period, for example, 500 slots/s. If the average data packet size, or Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU), of the multicast service <b>640</b> is known, the previous logic can also yield the number of data packets per second and the number of slots <b>322</b> per packet.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">When the number of data packets per second and/or the number of slots <b>322</b> per second or per packet is known, the base station <b>102</b> can then choose the frequency to allocate the multicast burst. In one implementation, one of the constraints is that the frequency of the allocation and the size of the allocation must meet the required per-second criteria in order to satisfy the QoS requirement of the multicast service <b>640</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">For example, suppose that a video broadcast service of 1.2 Mbps is set up with several subscriber stations <b>104</b> that wish to receive a broadcast television service. The 1.2 Mbps rate requirement may be a provisioning value that is set by the service provider. The Video Broadcast Application interfaces with the base station <b>102</b> so that this requirement is communicated to the subscriber stations <b>104</b> during the service flow setup procedure described in IEEE 802.16e. The subscriber stations <b>104</b> with the worst quality channel can support up to a QPSK-&#xbd; coding rate. Thus, in this example, assume that the QPSK-&#xbd; coding rate is chosen. Each downlink slot with a QPSK-&#xbd; coding can support only 48 bytes of data, including all the IEEE 802.16e overhead. Assuming that the IEEE 802.16e overhead adds about 10 bytes for each data packet sent, if the MTU of the multicast connection <b>636</b> is 1500 bytes, then a 1510 bytes allocation is given per PDU <b>528</b>, or around (1510/48=)32 slots/packet. The 1.2 Mbps requirement means 150 kbytes/s, or 100 packets per second, or 3200 slots per second. If the MTU is not given, then the base station <b>102</b> can decide on the data packet size to be sent. The goal is to convert the rate requirement to a slot requirement. If the size of the packet to be sent is M, then (M+10/48) will determine the slots/packet and (150 kbyte/s/M) determines the number of packets per second. So to support this 1.2 Mbps multicast service, the base station <b>102</b> allocates 3200 slots within one second.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">To determine T, the delay requirement of the multicast service <b>640</b> should be known. Using the above example, if the video broadcast service can tolerate 50 ms of delay, or 10 frames assuming 5 ms per frame, then it means that the base station <b>102</b> should send some data every 10 frames, or 20 multicast allocations per second. Thus, the base station <b>102</b> should allocate 3200 slots/s/20 allocation/s=160 slots every 10 frames to support the multicast service <b>640</b>. Since each packet uses 32 slots, each allocation of 160 slots sends 5 packets. In this example, T=50 ms, V=3200 slots/s so D=3200 slots/s*50 ms=160 slots.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As the above example shows, the number of packets and the size of the packets may be interrelated. In fact, defining one parameter, relative to the required data rate, automatically defines the other. In the above example, defining the size of the packet (M) determined the number of packets to be transmitted per allocation. The reverse is also true.</p>

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The techniques disclosed herein may provide several advantages relative to known approaches. For example, the techniques disclosed herein may save power on a per-frame basis by reducing the number of frames to be processed. For example, a subscriber station that does not belong to any multicast group may skip (i.e., not process) multicast frames <b>712</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, the techniques disclosed herein may decrease the processing overhead of multicast traffic on a per-PDU basis, which may result in higher throughput. For example, by recognizing the multicast CID(s) <b>638</b> in the DL MAP IEs <b>424</b>, a subscriber station <b>104</b> can bypass the parsing of each PDU's MAC header <b>732</b>. This is because the PDU payload size is already known (because the base station has defined a fixed PDU payload size <b>754</b> for multicast frames <b>712</b>) and does not need to be determined from the MAC header <b>732</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Moreover, the techniques disclosed herein may increase the power savings on a per-PDU basis. This is because the techniques disclosed herein may reduce the processing overhead (as described above), which may have the effect of increasing the power savings on a per-PDU basis.</p>

Examples of such communication systems include Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems, Single-Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) systems, and so forth. An OFDMA system utilizes orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which is a modulation technique that partitions the overall system bandwidth into multiple orthogonal sub-carriers. These sub-carriers may also be called tones, bins, etc. With OFDM, each sub-carrier may be independently modulated with data. An SC-FDMA system may utilize interleaved FDMA (IFDMA) to transmit on sub-carriers that are distributed across the system bandwidth, localized FDMA (LFDMA) to transmit on a block of adjacent sub-carriers, or enhanced FDMA (EFDMA) to transmit on multiple blocks of adjacent sub-carriers. In general, modulation symbols are sent in the frequency domain with OFDM and in the time domain with SC-FDMA.</p>
