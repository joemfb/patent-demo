<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a high-frequency signal transmission line, and more particularly to a thin flexible high-frequency signal transmission line.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a high-frequency signal transmission line of a tri-plate stripline structure wherein a signal line is sandwiched between an upper and a lower grounding conductor, one way of decreasing the resistance to high-frequency waves is to increase the width of the signal line. Specifically, by increasing the width of the signal line, the surface area of the signal line is increased, and accordingly, the areas of the grounding conductors opposed to the signal line are increased. Therefore, the resistance of the signal line to high-frequency waves can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, the increase in the areas of the grounding conductors opposed to the signal line caused by the increase in width of the signal line leads to an increase in capacitances among the signal line and the grounding conductors. Also, the increase in width of the signal line leads to a decrease in inductance of the signal line. Still in this state, in order to achieve predetermined characteristic impedance (for example, 50&#x3a9;) of the high-frequency signal transmission line, the distances among the signal line and the grounding conductors are increased so that the capacitances can be reduced. However, the increase in distances among the signal line and the grounding conductors leads to an increase in thickness of the high-frequency signal transmission line, which is an obstacle to achievement of a flexible high-frequency signal transmission line.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In order to avoid this problem, it is possible that the signal line is arranged so as not to be opposed to a grounding conductor. This arrangement is described referring to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> is a top view of a high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b>, viewed from a lamination direction, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref> shows that a signal line <b>502</b> is not covered by a grounding conductor <b>504</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref> is a cross-sectional view of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b> includes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>, a signal line <b>502</b> and grounding conductors <b>504</b> and <b>506</b>. The signal line <b>502</b> is a linear conductor. The grounding conductor <b>506</b> is located at a lower level than the signal line <b>502</b> with respect to the lamination direction and is opposed to the signal line <b>502</b> via a dielectric layer. The grounding conductor <b>504</b> is located at an upper level than the signal line <b>502</b> with respect to the lamination direction and has an opening. The signal line <b>502</b> is located within the opening when viewed from the top in the lamination direction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>, the signal line <b>502</b> and the grounding conductor <b>504</b> are not overlaid with each other when viewed from the lamination direction. Therefore, the capacitance generated between the signal line <b>502</b> and the grounding conductor <b>504</b> in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b> is smaller than that generated between a signal line and a grounding conductor in a high-frequency signal transmission line wherein the signal line and the grounding conductor are opposed to each other. In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b>, therefore, it is possible to shorten the distance between the signal line <b>502</b> and the grounding conductor <b>504</b>. Consequently, the thickness of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b> can be decreased, and the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b> can be made flexible so as to be usable while bent.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b> has a problem in that unnecessary radiation from the signal line <b>502</b> occurs. The signal line <b>502</b> is not covered by the grounding conductor <b>504</b>. For this reason, the electromagnetic field generated by a current flow in the signal line <b>502</b> is radiated outward from the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b> through the opening, and unnecessary radiation occurs. Moreover, the signal current partly leaks out as unnecessary radiation, which causes another problem of an increase in insertion loss of the signal current in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As a high-frequency signal transmission line suggested to solve the problems above, for example, a flexible board disclosed by Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2007-123740 is known. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a top view of the flexible board <b>600</b> described in Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 2007-123740, viewed from a lamination direction.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The flexible board <b>600</b> includes a signal line <b>602</b> and a grounding layer <b>604</b>. The signal line <b>602</b> is a linear conductor. The grounding layer <b>604</b> is located at an upper level than the signal line <b>602</b> with respect to the lamination direction via a dielectric layer. Although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, another grounding layer is located at a lower level than the signal line <b>602</b> with respect to the lamination direction. In the flexible board <b>600</b>, a plurality of openings <b>606</b> are provided in the grounding layer <b>604</b>. The openings <b>606</b> are rectangular and are aligned over the signal line <b>602</b> in the extending direction of the signal line <b>602</b>. Therefore, as viewed from the top of the lamination direction, the signal line <b>602</b> is partly overlaid with the grounding layer <b>604</b>. Thus, since the signal line <b>602</b> is partly covered by the grounding layer <b>604</b>, the flexible board <b>600</b> reduces unnecessary radiation from the signal line <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">With respect to the flexible board <b>600</b>, however, there is still a problem in that it is difficult to suppress unnecessary radiation while maintaining flexibility and realizing predetermined characteristic impedance of the whole signal line <b>602</b>. This problem is described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The signal line <b>602</b> has portions covered by the grounding layer <b>604</b> (covered by bridges <b>607</b>) and portions exposed by the openings <b>606</b> that are arranged alternately in the extending direction thereof. In order to reduce unnecessary radiation from the signal line <b>602</b>, it is necessary that the openings <b>606</b> have small dimensions X<b>1</b> and Y, wherein X<b>1</b> is a dimension in the extending direction of the signal line <b>602</b>, and Y is a dimension in a direction perpendicular to the extending direction of the signal line <b>602</b>. However, if the dimensions X<b>1</b> and Y of the openings <b>606</b> are set smaller, these exposed portions of the signal line <b>602</b> will exhibit too small impedance, whereby the characteristic impedance of the whole signal line <b>602</b> will be small. On the other hand, if the dimension X<b>1</b> is set larger to make the dimension X<b>2</b> of the bridges <b>607</b> smaller, the characteristic impedance will be greater, but unnecessary radiation through the openings <b>606</b> will be increased. Even if only the dimension Y of the openings <b>606</b> is set larger, the characteristic impedance will be too small because the other grounding conductor is provided at a lower level than the signal line <b>602</b> in the lamination direction. Therefore, in order to avoid this, the thickness of the flexible board will need to be increased. Thus, it is necessary to design the dimensions X<b>1</b>, X<b>2</b> and Y simultaneously so as to achieve predetermined characteristic impedance and to suppress unnecessary radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">From an industrial viewpoint, it is a preferable method to determine the dimension Y including an allowance to eliminate the possibility that the openings <b>606</b> may be displace from the signal line <b>602</b> due to lamination errors (for example, Y=the width of the signal line+200 &#x3bc;m) before determining the dimensions X<b>1</b> and X<b>2</b>. However, actually, the dimension X<b>2</b> depends on the limitation of industrial thin line processing technology and is determined to be, for example, 200 &#x3bc;m. Then, the minimum value for the dimension X<b>1</b>, which determines the characteristic impedance, is automatically determined. The minimum value for the dimension X<b>1</b> corresponds to the wavelength of a signal with the highest frequency the signal line is transmittable, and accordingly, when the minimum value for the dimension X<b>1</b> is large, it means that the signal line has a poor transmission characteristic. Instead, when the dimension X<b>2</b> is determined before the dimensions X<b>1</b> and Y, the openings <b>606</b> will be designed such that the dimension X<b>1</b> will be greater than X<b>2</b> and such that the dimension Y will be, for example, about 1 mm. In this case, the length of the diagonal line of each of the openings <b>606</b> determines the frequency characteristic of unnecessary radiation and the frequency characteristic of transmission loss of the signal line.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The width X<b>2</b> of the bridges <b>607</b> of the grounding layer <b>604</b> is very small and for example, 100 &#x3bc;m, and the length Y (corresponding to the width of the openings <b>606</b>) of the bridges is about 1 mm as mentioned above. In this case, inductance occurs at the bridges. By arranging the signal line <b>602</b> and the grounding layer <b>604</b> as close as possible to each other, the high-frequency signal transmission line can be made as flexible as possible. By narrowing the bridges, for example, by reducing the width X<b>2</b> of the bridges <b>607</b> from 100 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m and further to 30 &#x3bc;m, the lamination of the signal line <b>602</b> and the grounding conductor <b>604</b> can be made thinner. However, the reduction in width X<b>2</b> of the bridges <b>607</b> also makes the inductance occurring at the bridges <b>607</b> greater, thereby causing fluctuation of the grounding potential of the grounding conductor <b>604</b>. That is, great inductance unnecessarily occurs between the signal line <b>602</b> and the bridges X<b>2</b>, which degrades the grounding effect of the grounding conductor <b>604</b>. Thereby, great unnecessary radiation may occur, and the grounding current concentrates on the bridges <b>607</b>, which may cause a great loss. In sum, the trouble is caused by two problems. One is as follows: since the bridges <b>607</b> are thin and narrow electrodes, a high-frequency current is generated in the center portion of each of the bridges <b>607</b> by electromagnetic coupling between each of the bridges <b>607</b> and the signal line <b>602</b>, and due to the high-frequency current, inductance unnecessarily occurs. The other is as follows: the unnecessary inductance is magnetically coupled with inductance that occurs due to a current flow in the signal line <b>602</b>, which further causes mutual inductance, thereby making the unnecessary inductance at the bridges <b>607</b> greater.</p>

The signal line <b>20</b>, however, circumvents the connection conductors <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b </i>so as not to come into contact with the connection conductors <b>26</b><i>a </i>and <b>26</b><i>b</i>.

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the openings <b>30</b> are formed over the signal line <b>20</b> when viewed along the z-axis, and each of the openings <b>30</b> has a shape that is symmetrical with respect to the signal line <b>20</b>. That is, the signal line <b>20</b> crosses the y-axis centers of the openings <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Further, each of the openings <b>30</b> is symmetrical with respect to a line A passing the x-axis center of each opening <b>30</b> and extending in a direction perpendicular to the signal line <b>20</b> (that is, extending along the y-axis). A detailed description of the openings <b>30</b> will be given below.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is divided into areas A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b> and A<b>3</b> along the x-axis. The area A<b>1</b> is an area including the x-axis central portion of each opening <b>30</b>. The area A<b>2</b> is an area including each bridge <b>60</b>. The area A <b>3</b> is an area between the area A<b>1</b> and the area A<b>2</b>. There are areas A<b>3</b> in both sides of each area A<b>1</b>, and each of the areas A<b>3</b> borders an area A<b>1</b> and an area A<b>2</b>. The x-axis dimension of the area A<b>2</b>, which is equal to the x-axis dimension of each bridge <b>60</b>, may be, for example, about 25 &#x3bc;m to about 200 &#x3bc;m. In this preferred embodiment, the x-axis dimension of the area A<b>2</b> preferably is about 100 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the line A passes the x-axis center of the area A<b>1</b>. In the area A<b>1</b>, the opening <b>30</b> has a dimension in a direction perpendicular to the signal line <b>20</b> (a y-axis dimension or a width) W<b>1</b>, and in the areas A<b>3</b>, the opening <b>30</b> has a y-axis dimension (a width) W<b>2</b>. The width W<b>1</b> is greater than the width W<b>2</b>. Thus, the opening <b>30</b> is of such a symmetrical shape with respect to the line A that the x-axis central portion has a greater width than x-axis peripheral portions. In this preferred embodiment, the area where the opening <b>30</b> has the y-axis dimension (width) W<b>1</b> is the area A<b>1</b>, and the areas where the opening <b>30</b> has the y-axis dimension (width) is W<b>2</b> are the areas A<b>3</b>. Accordingly, the opening <b>30</b> has rectangular bends among the areas A<b>1</b> and A<b>3</b>. The width W<b>1</b> may be, for example, about 500 &#x3bc;m to about 1500 &#x3bc;m. In this preferred embodiment, the width W<b>1</b> preferably is about 900 &#x3bc;m, for example. The width W<b>2</b> is, for example, 250 &#x3bc;m to 750 &#x3bc;m. In this preferred embodiment, the width W<b>2</b> preferably is about 480 &#x3bc;m, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The x-axis dimension (length) G<b>1</b> of the opening <b>30</b> may be, for example, about 1 mm to about 5 mm. In this preferred embodiment, the length G<b>1</b> preferably is about 3 mm, for example. The length G<b>1</b> of the opening <b>30</b> is longer than the maximum width W<b>1</b> of the opening <b>30</b>. Further, it is preferred that the length G<b>1</b> is equal to or greater than twice the width W<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the grounding conductor <b>22</b>, no other openings are made among the openings <b>30</b>. More specifically, a conductive layer evenly spreads over the area A<b>2</b> between adjacent openings <b>30</b>, and no openings are present in the areas A<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the grounding conductor <b>24</b> (the second grounding conductor) is provided inside of the dielectric body <b>12</b> and is located in the negative side of the signal line <b>20</b> along the z-axis. More specifically, the grounding conductor <b>24</b> is provided on the front surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>c</i>. The grounding conductor <b>24</b> is a rectangular conductor that extends along the x-axis to spread evenly over the front surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>c</i>. The grounding conductor <b>24</b> is opposed to the signal line <b>20</b> via the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>b</i>. However, the grounding conductor <b>22</b> is not necessarily required to completely cover the signal line <b>20</b>, and for example, minute openings may be provided in the grounding conductor <b>22</b> at specified points so that gases generated by thermocompression bonding of the thermoplastic resin material of the dielectric sheets <b>18</b> can be evacuated. The grounding conductor <b>24</b> preferably is made of a metal with low specific resistance that contains silver or copper as a base, and is preferably made of a metal foil, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As described above, the signal line <b>20</b> is sandwiched between the grounding conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> along the z-axis. Thus, the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> define a tri-plate stripline structure. The interval between the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b> is substantially equal to the thickness T<b>1</b> of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and may be, for example, about 10 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m. In this preferred embodiment, the interval between the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b> preferably is about 50 &#x3bc;m, for example. The interval between the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>24</b> is substantially equal to the thickness T<b>2</b> of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and may be, for example, about 50 &#x3bc;m to about 300 &#x3bc;m, for example. In this preferred embodiment, the interval between the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>24</b> preferably is about 150 &#x3bc;m, for example. Thus, the thickness T<b>2</b> is greater than the thickness T<b>1</b>. In other words, the signal line <b>20</b> is located in a position to be closer to the grounding conductor <b>22</b> than to the grounding conductor <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The via-hole conductor b<b>1</b> penetrates through the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>a </i>along the z-axis and connects the relay terminal <b>16</b><i>a </i>to the x-axis negative end of the signal line <b>20</b>. The via-hole conductor b<b>2</b> penetrates through the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>a </i>along the z-axis and connects the relay terminal <b>16</b><i>b </i>to the x-axis positive end of the signal line <b>20</b>. Thereby, the signal line <b>20</b> is connected between the relay terminals <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b. </i></p>

<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> of the above-described structure, the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> changes depending on the portion relative to the locations of the bridges <b>60</b>. Specifically, between two adjacent bridges <b>60</b>, when going farther from one bridge <b>60</b> and closer to the other bridge <b>60</b>, the characteristic impedance rises from a minimum value Z<b>2</b> to an intermediate value Z<b>3</b> and further to a maximum value Z<b>1</b> and falls from the maximum value Z<b>1</b> to the intermediate value Z<b>3</b> and then to the minimum value Z<b>2</b>. The reason is as follows. The opening <b>30</b> between two adjacent bridges <b>60</b> has the greater width W<b>1</b> in the area A<b>1</b> and has the smaller width W<b>2</b> in the areas A<b>3</b>. Accordingly, the distance between the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b> in the area A<b>1</b> is greater than the distance between the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b> in the areas A<b>3</b>. Therefore, the magnetic field strength acting on the signal line <b>20</b> in the area A<b>1</b> is greater than the magnetic field strength acting on the signal line <b>20</b> in the areas A<b>3</b>, and the inductance in the area A<b>1</b> is greater than the inductance in the areas A<b>3</b>. Thus, in the area A<b>1</b>, the inductance effect is dominant.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The bridges <b>60</b> are present in the areas A<b>2</b>. Accordingly, the distance between the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b> in the areas A<b>3</b> is greater than the distance between the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b> in the areas A<b>2</b>. Therefore, the capacitance of the signal line <b>20</b> in the areas A <b>2</b> is greater than the capacitance of the signal line <b>20</b> in the areas A<b>3</b>, and the magnetic field strength acting on the signal line <b>20</b> in the areas A<b>2</b> is smaller than the magnetic field strength acting on the signal line <b>20</b> in the areas A<b>3</b>. Thus, in the areas A<b>2</b>, the capacitance effect is dominant.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">For the reasons above, the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> exhibits the maximum value Z<b>1</b> in the area A<b>1</b>. In other words, the opening <b>30</b> has the width W<b>1</b> in a position where the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> exhibits the maximum value Z<b>1</b>. Also, the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> exhibits the intermediate value Z<b>3</b> in the areas A<b>3</b>. In other words, the opening <b>30</b> has the width W<b>2</b> in a position where the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> exhibits the intermediate value Z<b>3</b>. Further, the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> exhibits the minimum value Z<b>2</b> in the areas A<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Thus, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> has a circuit configuration shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Specifically, in the area A<b>1</b>, since almost no capacitance occurs between the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b>, the characteristic impedance Z<b>1</b> of the signal line <b>20</b> mostly depends on the inductance L<b>1</b> of the signal line <b>20</b>. In the areas A<b>2</b>, since great capacitance C<b>3</b> occurs between the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b>, the characteristic impedance Z<b>2</b> of the signal line <b>20</b> mostly depends on the capacitance C<b>3</b>. In the areas A<b>3</b>, since capacitance C<b>2</b> smaller than the capacitance C<b>3</b> occurs between the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b>, the characteristic impedance Z<b>3</b> of the signal line <b>20</b> depends on the inductance L<b>2</b> of the signal line <b>20</b> and the capacitance C<b>2</b>. The characteristic impedance Z<b>3</b> is, for example, about 55&#x3a9;. The characteristic impedance Z<b>1</b> preferably is higher than the characteristic impedance Z<b>3</b> and, for example, about 70&#x3a9;. The characteristic impedance Z<b>2</b> is lower than the characteristic impedance Z<b>3</b> and, for example, about 30&#x3a9;. The characteristic impedance of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, in whole, preferably is about 50&#x3a9;, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Next, the usage of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is described. The high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is fitted into an electronic device while bent as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is to connect a first high-frequency circuit and a second high-frequency circuit that are incorporated in the electronic device to each other. For example, the first high-frequency circuit is an antenna element, and the second high-frequency circuit is a feed circuit. The x-axis negative-side end portion of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is connected to a connector of a board supporting the first high-frequency circuit (a first circuit board). In this moment, the relay terminal <b>16</b><i>a </i>contacts with a signal terminal provided in the connector of the first circuit board, and the relay terminal <b>16</b><i>d </i>contacts with a grounding terminal provided in the connector of the first circuit board. Also, the x-axis positive-side end portion of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is connected to a connector of aboard supporting the second high-frequency circuit (a second circuit board). In this moment, the relay terminal <b>16</b><i>b </i>contacts with a signal terminal provided in the connector of the second circuit board, and the relay terminal <b>16</b><i>c </i>contacts with a grounding terminal provided in the connector of the second circuit board. Thereby, the grounding potential is applied to the relay terminals <b>16</b><i>c </i>and <b>16</b><i>d</i>, and a high-frequency signal (for example, a signal of 2 GHz) is sent to the relay terminal <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A production method of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> will be hereinafter described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In the following, a production method of one high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> will be described. Practically, however, large-size dielectric sheets are laminated and cut, whereby plural high-frequency signal transmission lines <b>10</b> are produced at a time.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">First, copper foils are provided entirely on the respective front surfaces of thermoplastic resin sheets used as the dielectric sheets <b>18</b> (<b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>c</i>). The surfaces of the copper foils on the front surfaces of the dielectric sheets <b>18</b> are galvanized for corrosion proof, and thereby, the surfaces of the copper foils are smoothed. The dielectric sheets <b>18</b> preferably are liquid crystal polymer and have thicknesses of about 20 &#x3bc;m to about 80 &#x3bc;m, for example. The thicknesses of the copper foils preferably are 10 &#x3bc;m to 20 &#x3bc;m, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Next, the relay terminals <b>16</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b> are formed on the front surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by photolithography. Specifically, a resist having a pattern of the relay terminals <b>16</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is printed on the copper foil on the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>a</i>. Next, etching is applied to the copper foil so as to remove the copper foil except for the portion covered by the resist. Thereafter, the resist is removed. In this way, the relay terminals <b>16</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b> are formed on the front surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Next, the signal line <b>20</b> and the connection conductors <b>26</b> are formed on the front surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by photolithography. Also, the grounding conductor <b>24</b> is formed on the front surface of the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>c </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by photolithography. The photolithography to form the signal line <b>20</b> and the connection conductors <b>26</b> and the photolithography to form the grounding conductor <b>24</b> are the same as the photolithography to form the relay terminals <b>16</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b>, and a description thereof is omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Next, the positions of the dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b </i>where the via-hole conductors b<b>1</b> to b<b>6</b>, B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> are to be formed are irradiated with a laser beam from the back surfaces of the dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b</i>, whereby via holes are formed at the positions. Then, conductive paste is filled in the via holes formed in the dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>and <b>18</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Next, the dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>c </i>are laminated in this order from the positive side to the negative side along the z-axis such that the grounding conductor <b>22</b>, the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>24</b> define a stripline structure. Heat and pressure are applied to the laminated dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>c </i>from the positive side and the negative side along the z-axis. Thereby, the dielectric sheets <b>18</b><i>a </i>to <b>18</b><i>c </i>are softened and integrated, and the conductive paste filled in the via holes is hardened to become the via-hole conductors b<b>1</b> to b<b>6</b>, B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b>. Instead of applying heat and pressure to the dielectric sheets <b>18</b>, an adhesive such as epoxy resin may be used to bond the dielectric sheets <b>18</b> together. Also, the via-hole conductors b<b>1</b> to b<b>6</b>, B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b> may be formed after the integration of the dielectric sheets <b>18</b> by making via holes in the integrated dielectric sheets <b>18</b> and by filling conductive paste in the via holes or plating the via holes.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">At the end, resin paste is coated on the dielectric sheet <b>18</b><i>a </i>to form the protector <b>14</b>. In this way, a high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> as shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is produced.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, between two adjacent bridges <b>60</b>, when going farther from one bridge <b>60</b> and closer to the other bridge <b>60</b>, the characteristic impedance rises from the minimum value Z<b>2</b> to the intermediate value Z<b>3</b> and further to the maximum value Z<b>1</b> and falls from the maximum value Z<b>1</b> to the intermediate value Z<b>3</b> and then to the minimum value Z<b>2</b>. Hence, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> can be made thinner. Moreover, although the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is thin, the width of the signal line <b>20</b> can be made wider, and accordingly, the surface areas of electrode regions of the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> in which a high-frequency current flows can be enlarged, which results in a reduced transmission loss of the high-frequency signal. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, since the cycle length C (from the center of an area A<b>2</b> to the center of the next area A<b>2</b> through one area A<b>1</b> and two areas A<b>3</b>) is short (e.g., about 1 mm to about 5 mm), even in a higher-frequency area, unnecessary radiation and transmission loss can be sufficiently reduced and prevented. The areas A<b>3</b> located in both sides of the area A<b>1</b> prevents direct transmission of the strong magnetic field caused by the current flow in the signal line <b>20</b> to the areas A<b>2</b>. Thereby, the grounding potential in the areas A<b>2</b> is stable, and the shielding effectiveness of the grounding conductor <b>22</b> holds. Hence, unnecessary radiation can be prevented. Thus, in the structure of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, even when the distances among the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are made smaller, the width of the signal line <b>20</b> can be made greater. Accordingly, a thin high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> having desired characteristic impedance, reduced transmission loss and reduced unnecessary radiation can be obtained. Thereby, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> bends readily, and the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> can be used while bent.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> has the advantage of reduced transmission loss and improved shielding effectiveness due to stability of the grounding potential on the grounding conductor <b>22</b>. In a transmission line of a stripline structure, a high-frequency current in a signal line and a high-frequency current in a grounding line flow in mutually opposite directions instantaneously. In order to reduce the transmission loss of the whole transmission line, it is necessary to lower both the high-frequency resistance of the signal line and the high-frequency resistance of the grounding line. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, when bridges <b>607</b> of a grounding layer <b>604</b> have a reduced width X<b>2</b>, inductance unnecessarily occurs at the bridges <b>607</b>, and the high-frequency resistance of the grounding layer <b>604</b> becomes greater. In this case, moreover, since mutual inductance is caused by magnetic field coupling between the bridges <b>607</b> and the signal line <b>602</b> (more specifically, magnetic coupling between the inductance unnecessarily occurring at the bridges <b>607</b> and the inductance of the signal line <b>602</b>), the unnecessary inductance at the bridges <b>607</b> appears to be even greater.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In the flexible board <b>600</b> shown by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the signal line <b>604</b> includes portions covered by the grounding layer <b>604</b> and portions exposed by the openings <b>606</b> provided in the grounding layer <b>604</b>, and the covered portions and the exposed portions are arranged alternately. The magnetic energy on the exposed portions of the signal line <b>602</b> causes eddy currents in the other grounding layer at the portions opposed to the exposed portions of the signal line <b>602</b>. Thus, the grounding potential on the grounding layer at the portions opposed to the exposed portions of the signal line <b>602</b> changes due to the magnetic field. For this reason, the grounding layer loses the shielding effectiveness at the portions opposed to the exposed portions of the signal line <b>602</b>, and unnecessary radiation occurs therefrom. Thus, the signal line <b>602</b> has a transmission loss.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">When only the width of the bridges <b>607</b> is reduced, great inductance unnecessarily occurs at the bridges <b>607</b>. Accordingly, the grounding potential of the grounding layer <b>604</b> fluctuates, and the grounding layer <b>604</b> loses the shielding effectiveness. Therefore, unnecessary radiation occurs. As the width X<b>2</b> of the bridges <b>607</b> decreases, the loss of shielding effectiveness and the occurrence of unnecessary radiation become more noticeable.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> according to the present preferred embodiment, on the other hand, the width W<b>1</b> of the opening <b>30</b> in the area A<b>1</b> is greater than the width W<b>2</b> of the opening <b>30</b> in the areas A<b>3</b>. Therefore, the magnetic energy on the signal line <b>20</b> in the area A<b>1</b> is higher than the magnetic energy on the signal line <b>20</b> in the areas A<b>3</b>. Also, the magnetic energy on the signal line <b>20</b> in the areas A<b>2</b> is lower than the magnetic energy on the signal line <b>20</b> in the areas A<b>3</b>. Accordingly, the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> changes from Z<b>2</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>1</b>, Z<b>3</b>, Z<b>2</b> . . . periodically. Thus, the change in the magnetic energy on the signal line <b>20</b> in the x-axis is gradual. At the borders among unit structures, the magnetic energy is small. Thereby, the grounding potential of the grounding conductor is prevented from fluctuating, and occurrence of unnecessary radiation and transmission loss of the high-frequency signal is significantly reduced and prevented. In other words, the presence of the areas A<b>3</b> prevents unnecessary inductance at the bridges, which further significantly reduces and prevents mutual inductance between the bridges and the signal line and stabilizes the grounding potential. Hence, although the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is thin and has relatively large openings in the grounding conductor, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> has reduced unnecessary radiation and reduced transmission loss.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Further, by arranging the via-hole conductors B<b>1</b> in positions extended from the bridges, occurrence of inductance at the bridges are further reduced and prevented. Especially by setting the x-axis dimension G<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> (the intervals among the bridges) to be longer than the width W<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> in the areas A<b>1</b>, it becomes possible that the openings <b>30</b> have greater areas, which enables achievement of desired characteristic impedance and prevention of unnecessary radiation.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The openings <b>30</b> are arranged periodically in the extending direction of the signal line <b>20</b> (in the x-axis), and each of the openings <b>30</b> is a unit structure of the periodical structure. Therefore, the frequency characteristic of the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> within each of the openings <b>30</b> is determined by the x-axis dimension of the openings <b>30</b>. Specifically, when the x-axis dimension G<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> is set to be shorter, the signal line <b>20</b> has characteristic impedance with such a frequency characteristic to permit transmission of signals in a higher frequency range. On the other hand, when the x-axis dimension G<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> is set to be longer, the width W<b>1</b> of the areas A<b>1</b> can be set smaller, that is, the openings <b>30</b> can be made narrower. In this case, unnecessary radiation can be further reduced and prevented, and accordingly, transmission loss can be further prevented. Thus, by setting the x-axis dimension G<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> appropriately, a high-frequency signal transmission line that can perform stable transmission of signals in a broader frequency range while having reduced unnecessary radiation and reduced transmission loss can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Also, for the reason below, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> can be used while bent. In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, the openings <b>30</b> have the maximum y-axis dimension in the areas A<b>1</b>, and accordingly, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> most easily bends at the areas A<b>1</b>. On the contrary, since the openings <b>30</b> are not provided in the areas A<b>2</b>, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> most hardly bends at the areas A<b>2</b>. Accordingly, when the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is used while bent, the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is bent at the areas A<b>1</b> and is hardly bent at the areas A<b>2</b>. For this reason, the via-hole conductors B<b>1</b> and B<b>2</b>, which are less flexible than the dielectric sheets <b>18</b>, are located at the areas A<b>2</b>. Thus, it is possible to bend the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> easily at the areas A<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>, also by adjusting the distance T<b>1</b> between the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b> and the distance T<b>2</b> between the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>24</b>, it is possible to achieve desired characteristic impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Further, for the reason below, the x-axis dimension G<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> is greater than the maximum y-axis dimension W<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b>. The high-frequency signal transmission mode of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is a TEM mode. In the TEM mode, an electric field and a magnetic field occur in directions perpendicular to the signal transmission direction (x-axis). Specifically, the magnetic field occurs in a circular pattern from the signal line <b>20</b>, and the electric field occurs radially from the signal line <b>20</b> to the grounding conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>. Since the magnetic field occurs in a circular pattern, the provisions of the openings <b>30</b> in the grounding conductors <b>22</b> only causes the circular magnetic field to have a little increased radius at each of the openings <b>30</b>, and the magnetic field hardly leaks out from the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>. On the other hand, due to the presence of the openings <b>30</b>, the electric field partly leaks out from the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>. Thus, unnecessary radiation from the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is attributed mostly to the electric field emission.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The electric field is perpendicular to the signal transmission direction (x-axis). Therefore, the greater the y-axis dimension W<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b>, the greater the amount of the electric field emission through the openings <b>30</b>, that is, the greater the unnecessary radiation. In the meantime, the greater the y-axis dimension W<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b>, the higher the characteristic impedance of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>. Further, the electric field strength becomes almost zero in a position located at a distance of three times the width of the signal line <b>20</b> from the signal line <b>20</b> in the direction perpendicular to the signal transmission direction (x-axis). Therefore, even if the y-axis dimension W<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> is increased from a value to make the distance between the grounding conductor <b>22</b> and the signal line <b>20</b> at the openings <b>30</b> equal to the distance where the electric field strength becomes zero, the increase in the y-axis dimension W<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> no longer contributes to increasing the characteristic impedance. Therefore, considering that an increase in the y-axis dimension W<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> causes an increase in the unnecessary radiation, it is not desirable to increase the y-axis dimension W<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> more than necessary. Moreover, when the y-axis dimension W<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> becomes almost a half wavelength of the high-frequency signal, the openings <b>30</b> function as a slot antenna to radiate electromagnetic waves, and in this case, unnecessary radiation further increases.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Also, the greater the x-axis dimension G<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b>, the smaller the area of the signal line <b>20</b> opposed to the grounding conductor <b>22</b>. Accordingly, by increasing the x-axis dimension G<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b>, it becomes possible to widen the signal line <b>20</b>, whereby the high-frequency resistance of the signal line <b>20</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">When the x-axis dimension G<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> is greater than the y-axis dimension W<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b>, the high-frequency resistance of the counter electricity (eddy current) on the grounding conductor <b>22</b> can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">From the considerations above, it is preferred that the y-dimension G<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> is set greater than the x-dimension W<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b>, and more preferably, the x-axis dimension G<b>1</b> is equal to or greater than twice the y-axis dimension W<b>1</b>. It is to be noted that when the x-axis dimension G<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> becomes almost a half wavelength of the high-frequency signal, the openings <b>30</b> function as a slot antenna to radiate electromagnetic waves, and therefore, the x-axis dimension G<b>1</b> shall be sufficiently short relative to the wavelength of the high-frequency signal.</p>

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>d </i>is different from the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>b </i>in that the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>d </i>further includes an area A<b>4</b>, which is a partial area in the x-axis, wherein the grounding conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are not provided.

<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The characteristic impedance in the area A<b>4</b> wherein the grounding conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> are not provided is high.

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>e </i>is different from the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> in that openings <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>b </i>made in the grounding conductor <b>22</b> in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>e </i>are of different shapes from the openings <b>30</b>. Specifically, an opposed set of openings <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>b </i>are of the shapes formed by dividing an opening <b>30</b> into two portions, namely, the y-axis positive-side portion and the y-axis negative-side portion. In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>e</i>, there is provided a linear conductor <b>46</b> extending in the x-axis between the openings <b>44</b><i>a </i>and <b>44</b><i>b</i>. The linear conductor <b>46</b> is a portion of the grounding conductor <b>22</b>, and is located over the signal line <b>20</b> when viewed along the z-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>e</i>, a plurality of openings <b>44</b><i>a </i>are arranged in a line along the signal line <b>20</b>, and a plurality of openings <b>44</b><i>b </i>are arranged in a line along the signal line <b>20</b>.

However, the width of the linear conductor <b>46</b> may be larger than the width of the signal line <b>20</b>, and the signal line <b>20</b> does not necessarily protrude from the linear conductor <b>46</b> when viewed along the z-axis.

Likewise, the openings <b>30</b>, <b>30</b><i>a </i>and <b>31</b> do not necessarily overlap the signal line <b>20</b>. In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>e</i>, since the direction of a high-frequency current flow on the linear conductor <b>46</b> and the grounding conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> is opposite to the direction of a high-frequency current flow on the signal line <b>20</b>, even with the signal line <b>20</b> protruding from the linear conductor <b>46</b>, the effect of preventing unnecessary radiation is stronger than in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Seventh Preferred Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In the following, a high-frequency signal transmission line according to a seventh preferred embodiment will be described with reference to the drawings. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is an exploded view of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>f </i>according to the seventh preferred embodiment. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a transparent view of the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>f</i>, viewed from the top of a lamination direction (from the positive side in the y-axis).</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">A first difference between the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>f </i>and the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is that the signal line <b>20</b> in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>f </i>has a reduced width in the portions opposing the bridges <b>60</b>, that is, the width of the signal line <b>20</b> in the portions opposing the bridges <b>60</b> are smaller than the width of the signal line <b>20</b> in the portions having a maximum characteristic impedance Z<b>1</b>. A second difference between the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>f </i>and the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is that each of the openings <b>30</b> in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>f </i>tapers from the portion where the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> exhibits the maximum value Z<b>1</b> (the portion having a y-axis dimension W<b>1</b>) to the portions where the characteristic impedance of the signal line exhibits an intermediate value Z<b>3</b> (the portions having a y-axis dimension W<b>2</b>). A third difference between the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>f </i>and the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b> is that each of the openings <b>30</b> in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>f </i>tapers from the portions where the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> exhibits the intermediate value Z<b>3</b> (the portions having a y-axis dimension W<b>2</b>) to the bridges <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Now, areas A<b>1</b> to A<b>3</b> in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>f </i>are defined. The areas A<b>1</b> are areas where the respective openings <b>30</b> have the y-axis dimension W<b>1</b>. The areas A<b>2</b> are areas opposed to the bridges <b>60</b>. The areas A<b>3</b> are areas among the areas A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>, and the areas A<b>3</b> include areas where the respective openings <b>30</b> have the y-axis dimension W<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The above-mentioned first difference is described in more detail. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the signal line <b>20</b> has a width Wb in the areas A<b>2</b> and has a width Wa, which is greater than Wb, in the areas A<b>1</b>. The width Wa may be, for example, about 100 &#x3bc;m to about 500 &#x3bc;m. In this preferred embodiment, the width Wa preferably is about 350 &#x3bc;m, for example. The width Wb may be, for example, about 25 &#x3bc;m to about 250 &#x3bc;m. In this preferred embodiment, the width Wb preferably is about 100 &#x3bc;m. Thus, the width of the signal line <b>20</b> in the areas A<b>2</b> is smaller than the width of the signal line <b>20</b> in the areas A<b>1</b>, and accordingly, the overlapping area of the signal line <b>20</b> with the bridges <b>60</b> becomes smaller. Thereby, floating capacitance occurring between the signal line <b>20</b> and the bridges <b>60</b> is reduced. Also, since the signal line <b>20</b> has the larger width Wa in the areas overlapping the openings <b>30</b>, the inductance of the signal line <b>20</b> is inhibited from rising in these areas. Further, since the signal line <b>20</b> is not entirely but partly narrowed, the resistance of the signal line <b>20</b> is inhibited from rising.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The width of the signal line <b>20</b> tapers from Wa to Wb. Thereby, the resistance of the signal line <b>20</b> in the tapering areas changes gradually, and reflections of a high-frequency signal in the tapering areas can be significantly reduced and prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The above-mentioned second difference is described in more detail. Each of the openings <b>30</b> has tapering portions among the portion having the y-axis dimension W<b>1</b> and the portions having the y-axis dimension W<b>2</b>. That is, each opening <b>30</b> tapers in both x-axis ends of the area A<b>1</b>. Thereby, the current loss on the grounding conductor <b>22</b> is prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The above-mentioned third difference is described in more detail. Each of the openings <b>30</b> has tapering portions among the portion having the y-axis dimension W<b>2</b> and the bridges <b>60</b>. Accordingly, each of the bridges <b>60</b> has broadened y-axis ends. That is, each of the bridges <b>60</b> has a reduced x-axis dimension in the portion crossing over the signal line <b>20</b>. Thereby, floating capacitance between the bridges <b>60</b> and the signal line <b>20</b> can be significantly reduced and prevented. Also, since each of the bridges <b>60</b> is not entirely but partly narrowed, the resistance and the inductance of each of the bridges <b>60</b> are inhibited from rising.</p>

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The floating conductor <b>50</b> is not electrically connected to any other conductors such as the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b>, and the floating conductor <b>50</b> has a floating potential.

<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The floating conductor <b>52</b> is not electrically connected to any other conductors such as the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductor <b>24</b>, and the floating conductor <b>52</b> has a floating potential.

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The provisions of the floating conductors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> inhibit fluctuations in characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b>. This is described in more detail. For example, when the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>g </i>is provided in a mobile telephone, there are arranged dielectrics and metals around the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>g</i>. Due to the dielectrics and metals, the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> may change. Especially when the signal line <b>20</b> is opposed to the dielectrics and/or the metals via the openings <b>30</b> and <b>31</b>, the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> drastically changes.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In order to avoid this trouble, the floating conductors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are provided in the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>g</i>. The floating conductors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> prevent the signal line <b>20</b> from being opposed directly to the dielectrics and/or the metals. Therefore, a change in characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In the high-frequency signal transmission line <b>10</b><i>g</i>, further, since the floating conductors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are opposed to the signal line <b>20</b>, the characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> hardly changes even when floating capacitance occurs among the signal line <b>20</b> and the floating conductors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b>. This is described in more detail. Since the floating conductors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are not electrically connected to the signal line <b>20</b> and the grounding conductors <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, the floating conductors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> have a floating potential. Therefore, the floating capacitance between the signal line <b>20</b> and the floating conductor <b>50</b>, the floating capacitance between the floating conductor <b>50</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b> and the floating capacitance between the floating conductor <b>52</b> and the grounding conductor <b>24</b> are connected in series to one another.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The width W<b>3</b> of the floating conductors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> are smaller than the width W<b>1</b> of the openings <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> in the areas A<b>1</b> and greater than the width W<b>2</b> of the openings <b>30</b> and <b>31</b> in the areas A<b>3</b>. Therefore, the area where the grounding conductor <b>22</b> is opposed to the floating conductor <b>50</b> and the area where the grounding conductor <b>24</b> is opposed to the floating conductor <b>52</b> are small, and the floating capacitance between the grounding conductor <b>22</b> and the floating conductor <b>50</b> and the floating capacitance between the grounding conductor <b>24</b> and the floating conductor <b>52</b> are small. Accordingly, the total capacitance of the floating capacitance between the signal line <b>20</b> and the floating conductor <b>50</b>, the floating capacitance between the floating conductor <b>50</b> and the grounding conductor <b>22</b> and the floating capacitance between the floating conductor <b>52</b> and the grounding conductor <b>24</b>, which are connected in series to one another, is small. Thus, also for this reason, the provisions of the floating conductors <b>50</b> and <b>52</b> inhibit fluctuations in characteristic impedance of the signal line <b>20</b>.</p>

Also, the dielectric body may have a signal line on one main surface and have a first grounding conductor on the other main surface.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">In each of the high-frequency signal transmission lines <b>10</b> and <b>10</b><i>a </i>to <b>10</b><i>g</i>, between two adjacent bridges <b>60</b>, the impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> rises from a minimum value Z<b>2</b> to an intermediate value Z<b>3</b> and to a maximum value Z<b>1</b>, and falls from the maximum value Z<b>1</b> to the intermediate value Z<b>3</b> and to the minimum value Z<b>2</b> in this order. However, between two adjacent bridges <b>60</b>, the impedance of the signal line <b>20</b> may rise from a minimum value Z<b>2</b>, an intermediate value Z<b>3</b> to a maximum value Z<b>1</b>, and may fall from the maximum value Z<b>1</b> to an intermediate value Z<b>4</b> and to the minimum value Z<b>2</b> in this order. That is, the intermediate values Z<b>3</b> and Z<b>4</b> may be different from each other. In this case, each of the openings <b>30</b>, <b>31</b>, <b>44</b><i>a </i>or <b>44</b><i>b </i>may be of a shape asymmetrical with respect to the line A. The intermediate value Z<b>4</b> is preferably greater than the minimum value Z<b>2</b> and smaller than the maximum value Z<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Also, the minimum impedance value Z<b>2</b> of the signal line <b>20</b> between two adjacent bridges <b>60</b> may not be always the same. In sum, it is not necessary that the signal line <b>20</b> exhibits the same minimum impedance value Z<b>2</b> between any two adjacent bridges <b>60</b>, as long as each of the high-frequency signal transmission lines <b>10</b> and <b>10</b><i>a </i>to <b>10</b><i>g </i>as a whole can achieve the desired characteristic impedance. The minimum value Z<b>2</b> the signal line <b>20</b> exhibits at one bridge <b>60</b> is preferably smaller than the intermediate value Z<b>3</b>, and the minimum value Z<b>2</b> that the signal line <b>20</b> exhibits at the other bridge <b>60</b> is preferably smaller than the intermediate value Z<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">As described above, various preferred embodiments of the present invention are advantageously applicable to high-frequency signal transmission lines. Particularly, various preferred embodiments of the present invention provide a flexible high-frequency transmission line that can prevent unnecessary radiation, reflections of a signal in the signal line and a transmission loss.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">While preferred embodiments of the present invention have been described above, it is to be understood that variations and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention. The scope of the present invention, therefore, is to be determined solely by the following claims.</p>
