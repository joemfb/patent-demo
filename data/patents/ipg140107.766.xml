<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0013">An important environmental control for interferometric systems, and in particular interferometric measurement systems, is temperature control, since temperature affects the range and stability of measurement results. Lack of accurate temperature control can therefore greatly deteriorate time matching or system to system matching</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0014">Accordingly, an aspect of the inventive system is providing a thermally stable mini environment that encloses an interferometric measurement system so as to improve its measurement repeatability and system to system matching. Another aspect of the inventive system is providing a thermally stable enclosure with air circulation designed to meet the requirements of the SEMI S2 standards for a clean mini environment.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0015">Thermal control and air circulation as disclosed above can cause acoustic noise and vibration, both of which can contribute to measurement error and other adverse effects on vibration sensitive systems such as interferometric measurement systems. In order to keep the temperature in the enclosed environment controlled within a desired range, the air circulation or the fan speed of a system has to be fast enough. The faster fan speed, however, generates large acoustic noises and mechanical vibration that results in large measurement error. Accordingly, another aspect of the inventive system is providing a method for minimizing the measurement error resulting from the acoustic noises and the vibration induced from such sources as air circulation. This method includes setting the fan speed at a very low speed or turning off the fan during data acquisition, while maintaining the fan speed at a fast speed during times other than data acquisition.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0016">Prior methods 1-3 mentioned above do not address all of the aspects. Whereas prior method 1 provides a mini environment in a modular chamber, it provides neither temperature nor acoustic noise control. Prior method 2 is capable of controlling temperature and airflow; however it does not control acoustic noise, nor does it control temperature at different locations within the mini-enclosure. Further, its control is independent of the measurement or metrology system within the enclosure. Similarly, prior method 3 has no temperature control, no acoustic noise control, and its control is independent of the measurement or metrology system inside the enclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0017">The inventive system is designed to address the above issues. In order to keep the temperature in the enclosed environment within a desired controlling range, the air circulation or the fan speed of a system has to be fast enough. The faster fan speed, however, generates large acoustic noises and mechanical vibration that results in large measurement error. Therefore, for the inventive system, the faster fan speed is not allowed during the system data acquiring time: the fan is set at a very low speed during data acquisition, and at a fast speed at other times.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>illustrates an embodiment of the inventive system. Whereas the inventive concept can be employed in conjunction with many types of temperature- and vibration-sensitive equipment (as an example, medical instrumentation), the invention will be illustrated herein with an embodiment directed to interferometric measurement systems. The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>takes advantage of an existing system that has skin panels <b>105</b> which enclose interferometers <b>110</b> to create an enclosed minienvironment having forced air circulation. This existing system may be modified as follows: the air circulation unit <b>115</b> that delivers air into the enclosure <b>120</b> may be modified such that the temperature and the speed of its output to the enclosure are controllable. Note that varying the speed of air circulation or the fan speed changes the amplitude and the frequency of the acoustic noise and mechanical vibration. Multiple temperature sensors <b>125</b> may be mounted on interferometers <b>110</b> or at any other positions where temperature control is desired. Thus the positioning of the sensors can be customized according to the details of the measurement or metrology system within the enclosure, to provide more accurate temperature feedback to control unit <b>130</b>. Heating element <b>135</b> may be inserted between fan <b>140</b> and air filter <b>145</b> of unit <b>115</b>. Optional cooling element <b>137</b> may be inserted at any position near air inlet <b>139</b>. Computer <b>150</b> may connect to control unit <b>130</b>, and may also be used for data acquisition. Control unit <b>130</b> controls heating element <b>135</b>, cooling element <b>137</b>, and speed of fan <b>140</b>. It has been found that a single heating element and a single cooling element provides sufficient temperature control, and the multiple sensors provide accurate temperature measurement at multiple points of interest.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0019">Note that the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>is exemplary and not limiting. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, the fan that blows air into the mini-enclosure is not required to be directly at an opening, i.e. proximal, to the mini-enclosure. It can be placed in a position removed from the mini-enclosure, and a duct <b>155</b> can be used to bring air into the mini-enclosure. In such a case, the air circulation would still cause vibration and acoustic noise.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a flow diagram of a method embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0021">In step <b>200</b>, determine a desired temperature for the controlling unit to achieve, and determine a lower bound and an upper bound, i.e., a range about the desired temperature, for acceptable temperature. Utilizing an acceptable temperature range rather than attempting to maintain the temperature at one precise temperature prevents the heating and/or cooling elements from turning on and off too frequently.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0022">In step <b>202</b>, set the controlling temperature (i.e., the temperature which is set as the desired temperature for the controlling unit to achieve) a few degrees higher than the ambient temperature if there is only heating available. The controlling temperature may be close to the ambient temperature if both heating and cooling are available. The controlling temperature should be set a few degrees lower than the ambient temperature if only cooling is available.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0023">In step <b>205</b>, set the heating element to turn on if the temperatures collected by the sensors are lower than the heating lower bound of the user-determined desired temperature. Conversely, set the heating element to turn off if the temperatures collected by the sensors are higher than the heating upper bound of the user-determined desired temperature. If a cooling element is included, the cooling element is set to turn on if the temperatures collected by the sensors are higher than the cooling upper bound of acceptable temperature range, and are set to turn off if the temperatures collected by the sensors are lower than the cooling lower bound of the acceptable temperature range. In general, the upper and lower bound settings for heating and cooling are different, to avoid the situation where both the heating and cooling elements are on.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0024">In step <b>210</b>, during non-data acquisition times, set the fan at a sufficiently high speed to provide sufficient air circulation and temperature stability, as determined by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0025">In step <b>215</b>, during data acquisition times, set the fan at sufficiently low speed or turn off the fan to maintain acoustic noise and system vibration below user-determined levels.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0026">The method and system as described above enables control of the temperature, acoustic noises, and vibration of the mini-enclosed environment. The accuracy of the temperature control may be improved by locating temperature sensors directly on the metrology instrument. The ability to synchronize data acquisition with air circulation control improves the measurement precision by minimizing acoustic noises and vibration during data acquisition. Experimental results using this method and system with such instruments such as the WaferSight interferometric measuring tool made by KLA-Tencor have demonstrated major precision improvement of the tool. This improves the ability of the tool to meet the stringent requirements demanded by microlithography at the 11 nm node and beyond.</p>
