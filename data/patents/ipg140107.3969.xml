<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A data signal voltage on a signal line <b>102</b> is held in a voltage holding capacitor <b>106</b> through an n-type MOS transistor <b>103</b> switched on by a gate scan voltage, and supplied to an analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>. The analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> is formed of an MOS transistor having a double gate structure, and the operating point thereof is set at an operating range in which dependence of Ids on Vds is substantially nullified. Even when Vds is varied due to a response of liquid crystal <b>109</b>, Ids is substantially fixed. Accordingly, the pixel voltage which is substantially proportional to the data signal voltage can be applied to the liquid crystal <b>109. </b></p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a method for setting a transistor operating point and a circuit therefor, a method for changing a signal component value and an active-matrix liquid crystal display device for use in a projector, a notebook-sized PC, a monitor, a viewer, Personal Digital Assistance (PDA), a portable telephone, a game machine, electrical household appliances, etc.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Following developments of multi-media agent, various types liquid crystal display devices covering from compact-scale type display devices used in a projector device, a portable telephone, etc. to large-scale type display devices used in a notebook-sized PC, a monitor, a television set, etc. have been rapidly popular. Besides, middle-scale type liquid crystal display devices have been indispensable for electronic equipment such as a viewer, PDA, etc., and further for even playing machines such as a portable game machine, a pachinko machine, etc. On the other hand, liquid crystal display devices have been used over various fields containing electrical household appliances such as freezers, microwave ovens, etc. Particularly, an active-matrix liquid crystal display device operated by thin film transistors has been mainly used because it provides higher resolution and higher image quality as compared with a simple matrix type liquid crystal display device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref> shows a pixel circuit for one pixel of a conventional active-matrix liquid crystal display device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>, the pixel of the active-matrix liquid crystal display device comprises an MOS transistor (Qn) (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;transistor (Qn)&#x201d;) in which a gate electrode is connected to a scan line <b>901</b>, any one of a source electrode and a drain electrode is connected to a signal line <b>902</b> and the other of the source and drain electrodes is connected to a pixel electrode <b>903</b>, a storage capacitor <b>906</b> formed between the pixel electrode <b>903</b> and a storage capacitor electrode <b>905</b>, and liquid crystal <b>908</b> sandwiched between the pixel electrode <b>903</b> and an opposed electrode Vcom <b>907</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In notebook-sized PCs which have dominated a large application market for liquid crystal display devices, an amorphous silicon thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;a-SiTFT&#x201d;) or a polysilicon thin film transistor (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;p-SiTFT&#x201d;) is used as the transistor (Qn) <b>904</b>, and twisted nematic liquid crystal (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;TN liquid&#x201d;) is used as liquid crystal material. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref> shows an equivalent circuit to TN liquid crystal. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>, the equivalent circuit of TN liquid crystal can be represented by a circuit comprising a capacitance component C<b>3</b> of liquid crystal (electrostatic capacitance of Cpix) and both of a resistor R<b>1</b> (resistance value Rr) and a capacitor C<b>1</b> (electrostatic capacitance of Cr), the capacitance component C<b>3</b> and both the resistor R<b>1</b> and the capacitor C<b>1</b> being connected in parallel. Here, the resistance value Rr and the electrostatic capacitance Cr are components for determining the response time constant of liquid crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref> is a timing chart showing the relationship of a gate scan voltage Vg, a data signal voltage Vd and a voltage Vpix of the pixel electrode <b>903</b> (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;pixel voltage&#x201d;) when TN liquid as described above is operated by the pixel circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, during a horizontal scan period, the gate scan voltage Vg is set to high level Vgh to set an n-type MOS transistor (Qn) <b>904</b> to ON state, and the data signal voltage Vd inputted on a signal line <b>902</b> is transferred through the transistor (Qn) <b>904</b> to the pixel electrode <b>903</b>. TN liquid normally operates in a so-called normally white mode in which light is transmitted through the TN liquid under no applied voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In this case, a voltage at which light transmission through TN liquid is high is applied as the data signal voltage Vd over several fields. When the horizontal scan period is finished and the gate scan voltage Vg is set to low level, the transistor (Qn) <b>904</b> is set to OFF state, and the data signal voltage transferred to the pixel electrode <b>903</b> is held by the storage capacitor <b>906</b> and the capacitance Cpix of the liquid crystal. At this time, the pixel voltage Vpix undergoes a voltage shift called as a field through voltage via the capacitance between the gate and source of the transistor (Qn) <b>904</b> at the time when the transistor (Qn) <b>904</b> is set to OFF state. This voltage shift is represented by Vf<b>1</b>, Vf<b>2</b>, Vf<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, and the amount of the voltage shift Vf<b>1</b> to Vf<b>3</b> can be reduced by setting the capacitance of the storage capacitor <b>906</b> to a large value.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The pixel voltage Vpix is held until the gate scan voltage Vg is set to high level to select the transistor (Qn) <b>904</b> again during the next field period. The TN liquid is switched in response to the pixel voltage Vpix thus held, and the display state based on transmission light from the liquid crystal transits from a dark state to a light state as indicated by variation in light transmittance T<b>1</b>. At this time, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, the pixel voltage Vpix is varied by &#x394;V<b>1</b>, &#x394;V<b>2</b>, &#x394;V<b>3</b> during the holding period in each field. This is because the capacitance of the liquid crystal is varied in conformity with the response of the liquid crystal. Normally, for suppressing the fluctuation of the capacitance, the storage capacitor <b>906</b> is designed to have capacitance which is several times (two or three times) or more as large as the pixel capacitance Cpix. As described above, the TN liquid is driven by the pixel circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, as is apparent from the variation of the light transmittance shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, the response time of the TN liquid is normally large, that is, it ranges from 30 to 100 msec, and thus an after-image remains when an object moving at high speed is displayed, so that there is a disadvantage that no clear display can be achieved. Furthermore, there is a disadvantage that the angle of visual field is small. Therefore, there has been actively studied and developed liquid crystal material having polarization and liquid crystal display devices using the liquid crystal material with which high response is achieved and a broad angle of visual field is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref>, the equivalent circuit of high-response liquid crystal having polarization can be represented by a circuit having a circuit comprising a resistor R<b>2</b> (resistance value Rsp) and a capacitor C<b>2</b> (electrostatic capacitance Csp) connected to each other in series, and a high-frequency pixel capacitor C<b>3</b> (electrostatic capacitance Cpix) which is not varied even when polarization is rotated, the circuit concerned and the high-frequency pixel capacitor C<b>3</b> being connected to each other in parallel. The construction of the equivalent circuit is similar to the equivalent circuit of the TN liquid crystal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 73</figref>, however, the resistor R<b>2</b> and the capacitor C<b>2</b> for determining the response time of liquid crystal is different from that of TN liquid crystal, and they are illustrated in another diagram to be discriminated as components contributing to the response of polarization.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As such liquid crystal material having polarization may be used ferroelectric liquid crystal, antiferroelectric liquid crystal, thresholdless antiferroelectric liquid crystal, deformed helix ferroelectric liquid crystal, twisted ferroelectric liquid crystal, monostable ferroelectric liquid crystal or the like. Particularly, when thresholdless antiferroelectric liquid crystal, deformed helix ferroelectric liquid crystal, twisted ferroelectric liquid crystal or monostable ferroelectric liquid crystal is used for a liquid crystal display device, not only high response and a broad angle of visual field are achieved, but also gradation display can be performed by using an active-matrix liquid crystal display device as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>, which is described by using thresholdless antiferroelectric liquid crystal as an example in &#x201c;JAPAN JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS, Volume. 36, p720 (Japan Journal of Applied Physics, Volume 36, p. 720 (hereinafter referred to as reference document 1)).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref> is a timing chart showing a gate scan voltage Vg a data signal voltage Vd and a pixel voltage Vpix when thresholdless antiferroelectric liquid is driven by the conventional pixel circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref>, the gate scan voltage Vg is set to high level VgH during the horizontal scan period to set the transistor (Qn) <b>904</b> to ON state, and the data signal voltage Vd input to the signal line <b>902</b> is transferred to the pixel electrode <b>903</b> through the transistor (Qn) <b>904</b>. The thresholdless antiferroelectric liquid crystal normally operates in a so-called normally black mode in which light is not transmitted through the thresholdless antiferroelectric liquid crystal when a voltage is not applied.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">When the horizontal scan period is finished and the gate scan voltage Vg is set to low level, the transistor (Qn) <b>904</b> is set to OFF state, and the data signal voltage Vd transferred to the pixel electrode <b>903</b> is held by the storage capacitor <b>906</b> and the high-frequency pixel capacitor C<b>3</b> of the liquid crystal. At this time, the pixel voltage Vpix undergoes a voltage shift called as a field through voltage via the gate-source capacitance of the transistor (Qn) <b>904</b> at the time when the transistor (Qn) <b>904</b> is set to OFF state like the case where the TN liquid crystal described above is driven.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, after the horizontal scan period is finished, the pixel voltage Vpix is varied by &#x394;V<b>1</b>, &#x394;V<b>2</b>, &#x394;V<b>3</b> in each field by re-distribution of the charges held in the high-frequency capacitor C<b>3</b> and the polarization-based capacitor Csp as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>. According to the driving method disclosed in the reference document 1, the gradation control is performed on the basis of the pixel voltage Vpix after the voltage variation described above. At this time, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref>, the light transmittance is varied as indicated by T<b>1</b>, and the thresholdless antiferroelectric liquid crystal can be driven by the pixel circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Furthermore, a liquid crystal display device using liquid of OCB mode is described as high-response liquid crystal having no polarization in IDRC 97, P.L-66). OCB-mode liquid crystal uses bend orientation of TN liquid crystal, and it can be switched at a speed higher than the conventional TN liquid crystal by single figure. Furthermore, a display having a broad angle of visual field can be achieved by using a biaxial phase-contrast compensating film. In addition, time-divisional driving type color liquid crystal devices using high-response liquid crystal such as ferroelectric crystal, OCB-mode liquid crystal or the like have been recently actively studied and developed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">For example, JP-A-7-64051 discloses a time-divisional driving type of liquid crystal device using ferroelectric liquid. Furthermore, IDRC 97, p37 reports a time-divisional driving type color liquid crystal display device using OCB-mode liquid crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the time-divisional driving type liquid crystal display device, color display is implemented by successively switching light incident to liquid crystal among red, green and blue during one-field period. Therefore, high-response liquid crystal responding within at least one-third of the one-field period is needed. When the time-divisional driving type liquid crystal display device is applied to a direct-view type liquid crystal display device such as a notebook-sized PC, a monitor or the like, no color filter is required, and thus the liquid crystal display device can be manufactured at low price. Furthermore, when it is applied to a projector device, a high aperture ratio having the same level as a three-plate type liquid light valve and color display can be implemented by a single-plate liquid crystal display device, thereby providing a compact, light, low-price and high-brightness liquid projector device.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">When TN liquid, ferroelectrics liquid crystal or antiferroelectric liquid crystal having polarization, high-response TN liquid responding within one-field period is driven according to the conventional pixel circuit and driving method as described above, the following disadvantages occur.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As described above, when TN liquid is driven by the pixel circuit shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref>, the pixel voltage Vpix undergoes the voltage variation of &#x394;V<b>1</b> to &#x394;V<b>3</b> due to the variation of the liquid crystal capacitance during the holding period as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>. The voltage variation amount is also varied in accordance with the operation amount of liquid crystal molecules. Therefore, there occurs a disadvantage that even when the same data signal voltage is written, the voltage to be originally written to the liquid crystal cannot be applied at all times over the holding period because it is dependent on the data signal voltage written in the previous field. As a result, although the light transmittance of the liquid crystal should originally varies like a curved line indicated by T<b>0</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, it actually varies like a curved line indicated by T<b>1</b> described above. Therefore, accurate gradation display cannot be performed. In order to reduce the voltage variation &#x394;V<b>1</b> to &#x394;V<b>3</b>, a solving method of setting the accumulative capacitance to a large value has been hitherto utilized. In this case, however, the aperture ratio can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When ferroelectric liquid crystal or antiferroelectric liquid crystal having polarization is driven, the pixel voltage Vpix undergoes voltage variation of &#x394;V<b>1</b> to &#x394;V<b>3</b> by polarization switching during the holding period as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>. AS described above, this voltage variation is caused by the redistribution of the charge held in the high-frequency capacitor C<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 75</figref> and the charge held in the capacitor C<b>2</b> due to the polarization Here, Csp has a large value which is five to one hundred times as large as Cpix.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Therefore, the voltage variation &#x394;V<b>1</b> to &#x394;V<b>3</b> becomes a large value exceeding 1 to 2 voltages, and thus it is required to magnify the amplitude of the data signal voltage. As a result, the power consumption of the liquid crystal display device is increased, and the signal processing circuit, the peripheral driving circuit and the pixel transistor are required to be designed to have large withstand voltages, and it results in rise-up of the price of the liquid crystal display device. Furthermore, the amount of the voltage variation &#x394;V<b>1</b> to &#x394;V<b>3</b> is varied by the data signal voltage written in the previous field, so that the light transmittance of liquid crystal should originally vary like the curved line indicated T<b>0</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 76</figref>, however, it actually vary like the curved line indicated by T<b>1</b> as described. Therefore, it is impossible to perform the accurate gradation control every filed. Accordingly, when the liquid crystal having polarization described above is applied to the time-divisional driving system of liquid crystal device, color display having excellent color reproducibility cannot be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The same disadvantage as the liquid crystal display device using the liquid crystal material having polarization as described above occurs in the liquid crystal display device using OCB-mode liquid crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to solve these disadvantages, JP-A-7-64051 discloses a liquid crystal display device using a monocrystal silicon transistor. The construction of the liquid crystal display device shown in FIG. 18 in JP-A-7-64051 has a disadvantage that a transistor Q<b>2</b> operating as a source follower type analog amplifier circuit is not reset. Therefore, the transistor Q<b>2</b> is kept under OFF state when a data signal voltage lower than a data signal voltage written previously is input, and the voltage corresponding to the data signal voltage cannot be output. Furthermore, in the construction shown in FIG. 18 of JP-A-7-64051, the transistor Q<b>2</b> is set to OFF state after it outputs a data signal voltage to a picture electrode <b>10</b>. Therefore, when polarization current of ferroelectric liquid crystal flows afterwards, there occurs the same disadvantage as described above in which the voltage of the picture electrode is varied.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A liquid crystal display device disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 003042493 (hereinafter referred to as reference patent) (JP-A-11-326946) is provided as a liquid crystal display device for solving the above disadvantage. According to this liquid crystal display device, in an active-matrix liquid crystal display device in which pixel electrodes are driven by MOS transistor circuits disposed in the neighborhood of the respective cross points of plural scan lines and plural signal lines, each of the MOS transistor circuits comprises an MOS transistor having a gate electrode connected to one of the scan lines and source and drain electrodes any one of which is connected to one of the signal lines, an MOS type analog amplifier circuit having an input electrode connected to the other of the source and drain electrodes of the MOS transistor and an output electrode connected to the pixel electrode, and a voltage holding capacitor formed between the input electrode of the MOS type analog amplifier circuit and a voltage holding capacitance electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">According to the reference patent described above, the pixel voltage Vpix during the holding period can be kept to a fixed voltage. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> attached to the reference patent) is a diagram showing an example of the pixel circuit having the analog amplifier circuit. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>, a scan line <b>101</b> is connected to the gate electrode of a switching MOS transistor (Qn) <b>1101</b>, a signal line <b>102</b> is connected to the source electrode, the drain electrode of the MOS transistor <b>1101</b> is connected to the input electrode (the gate electrode of the n-type MOS transistor <b>1102</b>) of an analog amplifier circuit (comprising an n-type MOS transistor <b>1102</b> and an n-type MOS transistor <b>1103</b>), and the pixel electrode <b>107</b> of liquid crystal display element <b>109</b> is connected to the output electrode of the analog amplifier circuit, and a voltage is applied to liquid crystal between the pixel electrode <b>107</b> and an opposed electrode <b>108</b> to drive the liquid crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">When no analog amplifier circuit is used, the storage capacitor <b>906</b> is formed between the pixel electrode <b>903</b> and the accumulative capacitance electrode <b>905</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 72</figref> (corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 59</figref> attached to the reference patent).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref>, when the analog amplifier circuit is used, a voltage holding capacitor <b>106</b> is formed between the voltage holding capacitance electrode <b>105</b> and the contact point between the switching MOS transistor (Qn) <b>1101</b> and the analog amplifier circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The power supply source lines of the analog amplifier circuit are respectively connected to amplifier positive power supply source electrode and amplifier negative power supply source electrode which are separately provided, or one of the lines is connected to the scan line while the other line is connected to an existing electrode such as the voltage holding capacitance electrode or the like, thereby simplifying the circuit construction.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 77</figref> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 52</figref> attached to the reference patent) shows a case where the amplifier positive power supply source electrode is provided, and the amplifier negative power supply source electrode is connected to the voltage holding capacitance electrode <b>105</b>. According to this circuit construction, when the switching MOS transistor is set to OFF state, a predetermined voltage is continued to be applied to the liquid crystal element <b>109</b> from the analog amplifier circuit, so that the voltage variation can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">However, when the conventional MOS analog amplifier circuit described above is constructed by Poly-Si TFT or the like, the following disadvantages occur.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A first disadvantage resides in that the gain of the analog amplifier circuit is low. The gain of the amplifier is ideally equal to 1. In the case of a prototype produced by the inventor of this application, a gain of 0.78 was achieved by a resistance load type analog amplifier circuit, and a gain of 0.84 was achieved by an active load type analog amplifier circuit having a TFT current source as a load.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The reason why reduction in gain as described above occurs resides in that Ids (drain-source current) is greatly varied dependently on Vds (drain-source voltage) even under the condition that Vgs (gate-source voltage) is fixed. Particularly Ids is remarkably increased in an area where Vds is large. This phenomenon is estimated to be mainly caused by the kink effect. Furthermore, since it is observed that Ids is dependent on Vds in an area where Vgs is low, there may be other causes than the kin effect. When the dependence of Ids on Vds occurs as described above, Vds varies at the operating point of the analog amplifier circuit. The output voltage of the source follower amplifier circuit is represented by the following equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>V</i>out=<i>V</i>in&#x2212;<i>Vgs </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the above equation, Vin represents an input voltage to the source follower amplifier circuit, and Vout represents an output voltage from the source follower amplifier circuit. Accordingly, when Vgs is varied, the linearity between Vin and Vout is lost, and the gain of the analog amplifier circuit is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention has been implemented in view of the above situation, and has an object to provide transistor operating point setting method and circuit that effectively use the characteristics of unipolar transistor having a multi-gate structure, a signal component value changing method and an active-matrix liquid crystal display device.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The liquid crystal display device <b>10</b>-<b>1</b> is equipped with pixel circuits having the same construction as the pixel circuit <b>20</b>-<b>1</b>, the number of the pixel circuits being equal to the number of pixels to be displayed on the display screen. Even if all the pixel circuits are not illustrated, it would not disturb the understanding of the liquid crystal display device, and thus only one pixel circuit <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The n-type MOS transistor (Qn) <b>103</b> of the pixel circuit <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> comprises a p-SiTFT. The analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> comprises a p-SiTFT (MOS transistor) (amplifier circuit portion) having a multi-gate structure and a load element. The gain of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> is ideally set to 1.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Next, the operation of this embodiment will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a time chart of a gate scan voltage Vg, a data signal voltage Vd, an amplifier input voltage Va and a pixel voltage Vpix and also shows variation of light transmittance of liquid crystal <b>109</b> when the liquid crystal <b>109</b> is driven by the pixel circuit <b>20</b>-<b>1</b> in a normally black mode in which the liquid crystal <b>109</b> is kept dark under no voltage applied state. The liquid crystal <b>109</b> is formed of high-response liquid crystal such as ferroelectric or antiferroelectric having polarization, OCB mode liquid crystal responding within one field period, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the gate scan voltage Vg is set to high level VgH during the horizontal scan period, the n-type MOS transistor <b>103</b> is set to ON, and the data signal voltage Vd input to the signal line <b>102</b> is transferred through the n-type MOS transistor <b>103</b> to the input electrode of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">When the horizontal scan period is finished and the gate scan voltage Vg is set to low level, the n-type MOS transistor (Qn) <b>103</b> is set to OFF state, and the data signal voltage Vd transferred to the input electrode of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> is held in the voltage holding capacitor <b>106</b>. At this time, the amplifier input voltage Va undergoes a voltage shift called as a field through voltage via the gate-source capacitance of the n-type MOS transistor (Qn) <b>103</b> at the time when the n-type MOS transistor (Qn) <b>103</b> is set to OFF state. This voltage shift is represented by Vf<b>1</b>, Vf<b>2</b>, Vf<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and the amount of the voltage shift Vf<b>1</b> to Vf<b>3</b> can be reduced by setting the value of the voltage holding capacitor <b>106</b> to a large value.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The amplifier input voltage Va is held until the gate scan voltage Vg is set to high level and the n-type MOS transistor (Qn) <b>103</b> is selected during the next field period. The analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> can output the analog gradation voltage corresponding to the amplifier input voltage Va thus held until the amplifier input voltage Va is varied in the next field.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The amplifier circuit portion of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> is designed to contain an MOS transistor having a multi-gate structure, and the reason why the MOS transistor having the multi-gate structure is used will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show measurement examples for p-SiTFT of p-ch (p-Si thin film transistor) under the condition:channel length of 4 microns and channel width of 4 microns. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> show the Ids-Vgs characteristic indicating the relationship between the source-drain current Igs and the gate-source voltage Vgs, and the ordinate axis represents Ids while the abscissa axis represents Vgs (represented by Vg in the figures). The measurements were carried out while the drain-source voltage Vds is varied from &#x2212;2 V to &#x2212;16 V by 2 V.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, eight curved lines are achieved as a result of the variation from &#x2212;2 V to &#x2212;16 V by 2 V, and the curved line group is drawn so that the curved line for the drain-source voltage Vds having the smallest absolute value thereof is located at the lowermost side of the curved line group, and the curved line for the drain-source voltage Vds having the largest absolute value thereof is located at the uppermost side of the curved line group.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the measurement result for an MOS thin film transistor (TFT) having a single gate structure. As is apparent form <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, Ids is greatly dependent on Vds. Paying attention to an area satisfying the condition that Vgs=&#x2212;6 V, which indicates that Ids is equal to 10<sup>&#x2212;7 </sup>(IE-07(=10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>) in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), Ids is varied by the amount corresponding to nearly double figures when the drain-source voltage Vds is varied from 2 V to 16 V.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Even when the operating point of TFT having the single gate structure is set to an operating area where the variation of Ids is little, that is, the operating area where the dependence of Ids on Vds is little, there is still some dependence of Ids on Vds. Therefore, variation occurs in the gate-source voltage Vgs. Accordingly, when the MOS transistor having the single gate structure is used in the analog amplifier circuit, an output voltage which is not varied at a fixed rate, but at a different rate in accordance with the value of the amplifier input voltage appears at the output terminal of the analog amplifier circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">On the other hand, when the MOS transistor having the double gate structure is used as the MOS transistor constituting the analog amplifier circuit, the disadvantage appearing when the MOS transistor having the single gate structure is used can be substantially overcome.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">That is, by representing the MOS thin film transistor (TFT) having the double gate structure with an equivalent circuit, it is estimated to be equivalent to a circuit structure that plural sub TFTs are connected to one another in series while the gates thereof are commonly connected to one another. Therefore, the source-drain voltage Vds of a single TFT constituting TFT having the multi-gate structure is apparently divided to the plural sub TFTs.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">As a result, only a voltage equal to one-kth (1/k) of Vds which is actually applied to the MOS thin film transistor is applied between the source and the drain of each sub TFT (here, k represents the number of multi-gates, and the case of k=2 corresponds to the double gate structure).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Accordingly, each single TFT can be avoided from being used in the high-voltage area where the dependence of Ids on Vds is remarkable. As a result, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, Ids varies hardly even when the drain-source voltage Vds is varied from 2V to 16V, and the dependence of Ids on Vds is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">The same as described above is applied to the kink effect. That is, the voltage at both the ends of the sub TFT is not increased to the kink occurrence voltage due to the voltage division, and thus the kink effect is also suppressed. The kink effect is a drain-current variation phenomenon appearing in p-SiTFT or SOI (Silicon on Insulator), particularly in an n-channel device, and in this phenomenon the drain current is sharply increased and some crooked site occurs in the characteristic.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">In this phenomenon, as the drain current is increased, collision ionization occurs in an area close to the drain region. Generated electrons are collected to the drain electrode, and generated holes are accumulated in an island of the device until the source and the island are set to ON. As a result, the drain current is abnormally increased to induce the above phenomenon.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">By these actions, the constancy of the gain of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> is enhanced, in other words, the linearity between the amplifier input voltage Va and the pixel voltage Vpix is enhanced even when the electrostatic capacitance of the liquid crystal <b>109</b> is varied in responsibility of liquid crystal <b>109</b> for even a fixed amplifier input voltage (gate input voltage) Va, or even when the amplifier input voltage is varied every field or at the time when the period of several fields has elapsed. Furthermore, as a result of voltage division, an effect of increasing the withstanding voltage can be achieved without using any MOS thin film transistor having high withstanding voltage. Accordingly, an MOS type thin film transistor which is normally unusable because of its low withstanding voltage can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Still furthermore, the increase in the withstanding voltage can enhance reliability for a long term.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">As described above, by using the MOS transistor having the double gate structure, the dependence of Ids on Vds is remarkably reduced, and occurrence of the kink effect can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">As in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> while attention is paid to voltages corresponding to the neighborhood of Ids=10<sup>&#x2212;7</sup>, it is clearly apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that Ids is hardly varied around Vgs=&#x2212;7 V.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">As is apparent from the foregoing description, the analog gradation voltage (which is also called as the pixel voltage Vpix) substantially proportional to the amplifier input voltage Va held in the voltage holding capacitor <b>106</b> is continued to be output from the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> until the amplifier input voltage Va is varied in the next field.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">After the horizontal scan period is finished, the pixel electrode <b>107</b> is driven by the pixel voltage Vpix output from the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> during the field period concerned.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">As described above, according to the construction of this embodiment, since the MOS transistor having the double gate structure is used for the amplifier circuit portion of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>, the dependence of Ids on Vds is greatly reduced. Therefore, the gate-source voltage Vgs is hardly varied, and the withstanding voltage of the MOS thin film transistor can be enhanced. Accordingly, an MOS thin film transistor which cannot be normally used because the withstanding voltage thereof is low can be used in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Since the withstanding voltage can be increased, the long-term reliability can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Since the liquid crystal <b>109</b> is driven with the pixel voltage Vpix having such linearity as described above during the field period after the horizontal scan period. Therefore, in the image display operation, even when the electrostatic capacitance of the liquid crystal <b>109</b> is varied by applying the pixel voltage Vpix to the liquid crystal <b>109</b> or the data signal voltage Vd is changed every field period or at the time when the period of plural fields has elapsed to drive the liquid crystal <b>109</b>, so that Vds is varied, ID is kept substantially constant. Therefore, the pixel voltage Vpix applied from the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>1</b> to the pixel electrode <b>107</b> is substantially proportional to the data signal voltage Vd, the variation of the pixel voltage Vpix is further less than the patent document described above, and the gain of the pixel electrode <b>107</b> is not reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The variation of the pixel voltage Vpix can be more greatly reduced than the patent document described above.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">By using the MOS transistor having the multi-gate structure, even when a relatively high voltage is applied to the MOS transistor concerned, the voltage applied to each of the single MOS transistors each having the single gate structure which are represented as being equivalent to the MOS transistor having the multi-gate structure is a divided value, that is, it is close to a value achieved by dividing the applied high voltage by the number of gates, so that the withstanding voltage performance can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">As a result, as indicated by the waveform of the pixel voltage Vpix in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the pixel voltage having the linearity of the input-output voltage characteristic which is more greatly enhanced than the patent document described above can be applied to liquid crystal, and more excellent gradation can be achieved every field as also indicated with respect to the light transmittance of the liquid crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">An MOS transistor having a short channel can be used by using the MOS transistor having the double gate structure, so that the aperture ratio can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Furthermore, in liquid crystal display devices using TN liquid, ferroelectric or antiferroelectric liquid crystal having polarization, and other high-response liquid crystal responding within one field period, a compact-and-light liquid crystal display device which is designed in low price to have a high aperture ratio, high responsibility, a high visual field, high gradation and low power consumption is provided by eliminating the voltage variation &#x394;V<b>1</b> to &#x394;V<b>3</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0152">The construction of this embodiment is greatly different from that of the first embodiment in that the load element in the analog amplifier circuit of each pixel circuit constituting the liquid crystal display device <b>10</b>-<b>2</b> is constructed by an active element, that is, the analog amplifier circuit is constructed by an active load type analog amplifier circuit.</p>

<p id="p-0171" num="0170">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, during the horizontal scan period, the gate scan voltage Vg is set to high level VgH, whereby the n-type MOS transistor (Qn) <b>103</b> is set to ON state, and the data signal voltage Vd input to the signal line <b>102</b> is transferred to the gate electrode of the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b> via the n-type MOS transistor (Qn) <b>103</b>. On the other hand, during the horizontal scan period, the gate scan voltage VgH is transferred through the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>), whereby the pixel electrode <b>107</b> is set to reset state.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">That is, when the pixel voltage Vpix is set to VgH during the horizontal scan period, the reset of the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b>, that is, the transition of the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b> to the normally black state is simultaneously carried out.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">After the horizontal scan period is finished, the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b> operates as the amplifier circuit portion of the source follower type analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>. This operation will be described hereunder.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">When the horizontal scan period is finished and the gate scan voltage Vg is set to low level, the n-type MOS transistor (Qn) <b>103</b> is set to OFF state, and the data signal voltage Vd transferred to the gate electrode of the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b> is held in the voltage holding capacitor <b>106</b>. At this time, the gate input voltage Va of the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b> undergoes a voltage shift called as a field through voltage via the gate-source capacitance of the n-type MOS transistor (Qn) <b>103</b> at the time when the n-type MOS transistor <b>103</b> is set to OFF state.

<p id="p-0176" num="0175">As described above, in order to make the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b> operate as the amplifier circuit portion of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>, a voltage higher than at least (Vdmax&#x2212;Vtp) is kept to be supplied to the voltage holding capacitance electrode <b>105</b>.

The abscissa axis represents the gate input voltage (Va), the left ordinate axis represents the pixel voltage (Vpix) and the right ordinate axis represents current (Ids). The voltage is represented by only solid lines, and the current is represented by solid lines having marks. Furthermore, the measurement was made for two bias voltage voltages Vb, that is, the bias voltage Vb=13 V and the bias voltage Vb=14 V The bias voltage Vb is the voltage VCH supplied to the voltage holding capacitance electrode <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the characteristic of the analog amplifier circuit constructed by two TFTs having the single structure. Each of TFT is designed to have a channel length of 6 microns and a channel width of 3 &#x3bc;m. Under the condition of Vb=13 V, the gate input voltage Va ranges from 2.8 V to 10.6 V in the range in which the relationship between the gate input voltage and the pixel voltage keeps linearity. At this time, the pixel voltage Vpix ranges from 5.8 V to 13.2 V, and the gain is equal to about 0.949.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Under the condition of Vb=14 V, linearity is kept under the condition that the gate input voltage Va=5.0 V to 11.6 V and the pixel voltage Vpix=7.2 V to 13 V, and the gain is equal to about 0.879. As described above, the voltage range which can be output with keeping linearity is equal to 7.4 V under the bias voltage Vb=13 V and 5.8 V under the bias voltage Vb=14 V.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows the characteristic of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> constructed by two TFTs having the double gate structure. The size of each TFT is set so that the channel width is equal to 1.5 micron and the channel length of the sub TFT of the equivalent circuit is equal to 3 microns. Under the condition of Vb=14 V, the gate input voltage Va at which the relationship between the gate input voltage and the pixel voltage keeps linearity ranges from 0 V to 13 V. At this time, the pixel voltage Vpix ranges from 2.4 V to 14.8 V, and the gain is equal to about 0.954. Under the condition of the gate input voltage Vb=15 V, linearity is kept under the condition that the gate input voltage Va=0 V to 14.8 V and the pixel voltage Vpix=1.3 V to 15.6 V, and the gain is equal to about 0.966. As described above, the voltage range which can be output with keeping linearity is equal to 12.4 V under the bias voltage Vb of 14 V and also to 14.3 V under the bias voltage Vb of 14 V As is apparent from the result, the gain is enhanced, and the voltage range which can be output with keeping linearity is broadened about twice.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Furthermore, the relationship between the data signal voltage Vd and the light transmittance which is difficult to read in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>. Both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> show the light transmittance when a voltage ranging from 0 V to 10.4 V is applied as the data signal voltage Vd.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the ordinate axis represents light transmittance (%), and the ordinate axis represents the absolute value of the difference between the data signal voltage Vd and the intermediate voltage (Vc) of the data signal voltage Vd, that is, the amplitude (|Vd&#x2212;Vc|). The data signal voltage Vd is represented as having positive polarity when the data signal voltage Vd is larger than the intermediate voltage Vc and as having negative polarity when the data signal voltage Vd is smaller than the intermediate voltage Vc. The light transmittance is represented by using values which are achieved under the state that the light transmittance is stabilized in each field with time lapse of the light transmittance of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a case where an MOS transistor having a single gate structure is used, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a case where an MOS transistor having a double gate structure is used.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In the case of the single gate structure, since the gain of the analog amplifier circuit is low, the maximum light transmittance is equal to be slightly smaller than 94%, and to make matters worse, the light transmittance is greatly different between positive polarity and negative polarity because the input/output characteristic of the analog amplifier circuit is bad. This difference reaches 9% at maximum.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In the case of the double gate structure, since the gain of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> is high, the maximum light transmittance is equal to 100%. Furthermore, the input/output characteristic of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> has high linearity, and there is little difference in light transmittance between positive polarity and negative polarity, and the difference does not reach even 0.1%.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">In the foregoing description, only the double structure is used as an example to achieve the effect of the multi-gate structure, however, it is clear that an excellent characteristic is achieved by using a multi-gate structure having a larger number of gates. However, when the multi-gate structure is applied to a light transmission type, it is required to be designed so as to suppress reduction of the aperture ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In the double gate structure of this embodiment, the aperture ratio can be increased as compared with the normal single gate structure.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The reason will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref> show the structure of single TFTs used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, respectively. With respect to the TFTs under this condition, in the case of the channel length of 6 microns, the withstanding voltage is equal to 16V or more. However, in the case of the channel length of 3 microns, some TFTs are broken under application of 16V.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">Therefore, the channel length of 3 microns cannot be used in the single gate structure. However, by adopting the double gate structure, TFTs having a small channel length such as 3 microns or the like can be used because only about 8V is applied to sub TFT.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">As a result, TFT achieving the same function as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> can be constructed by sub TFT having a small channel length as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. As is apparent from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the occupation area of TFT is smaller in the double gate structure of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, and thus the aperture ratio is enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Next, a case where TN liquid s driven by the pixel circuit <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> constituting the liquid crystal display device <b>10</b>-<b>2</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> in the normally white mode in which the TN liquid is kept to be light under no voltage application will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a timing chart showing the gate scan voltage Vg, the data signal voltage Vd, the gate input voltage Va of the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b> and the pixel voltage Vpix and also shows variation of light transmittance of liquid crystal in this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">In this example, a signal voltage under which a light state is kept over several fields is applied as the data signal voltage Vd. The same driving method as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is used. The display state of TN liquid transits to a light display state while taking the time corresponding to several fields as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> because its response time is equal to several tens sec to about 100 msec. During this period, molecules of the TN liquid are switched and the capacitance of the liquid crystal is varied. Therefore, in the conventional liquid crystal display device, the original light transmittance T<b>0</b> of the liquid crystal cannot be achieved because the pixel voltage Vpix is varied as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">On the other hand, in the liquid crystal display device <b>10</b>-<b>2</b> of this embodiment, the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b> operates as the amplifier circuit portion of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>, and thus it can continue to apply a fixed voltage to the liquid crystal <b>109</b> without being effected by the variation of the capacitance of the TN liquid crystal, so that the original light transmittance can be achieved and thus accurate gradation display can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">That is, the pixel voltage Vpix and the light transmittance of the light crystal when TN liquid crystal is driven by the pixel circuit <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> are coincident with the pixel voltage Vpix and the light transmittance of the liquid crystal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">Accordingly, in the case where TN liquid crystal is driven by the pixel circuit <b>20</b>-<b>2</b>, substantially the same effect as the case where high-response liquid crystal is driven by the pixel circuit <b>20</b>-<b>2</b> is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">As described above, according to the construction of this embodiment, the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> is constructed by the active load type analog amplifier circuit, and thus the dependence of Ids on Vds can be greatly reduced. Therefore, the variation of the gate-source voltage Vgs is slight.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">Accordingly, linearity is achieved in the relationship between the gate input voltage and the pixel voltage of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>. Therefore, even when the data signal voltage Vd on the signal line <b>102</b> is varied every field, the pixel voltage Vpix applied from the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> to the pixel electrode <b>107</b> is substantially proportional to the data signal voltage Vd, and no reduction in gain of the pixel electrode <b>107</b> appears.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">As described above, linearity is achieved in the relationship between the gate input voltage and the pixel voltage of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>, and the liquid crystal <b>109</b> is drive by the pixel voltage Vpix during the filed period after the horizontal scan period.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">Accordingly, in the image display operation, even when the data signal voltage Vd is supplied and the pixel voltage Vpix substantially proportional to the data signal voltage Vd is applied to the crystal liquid <b>109</b>, so that the electrostatic capacitance of the liquid crystal <b>109</b> is varied, or even when the data signal voltage Vd is changed every field or at the time when the period of plural fields has elapsed and the pixel voltage Vpix substantially proportional to the data signal voltage Vd is applied to the liquid crystal <b>109</b> to vary the electrostatic capacitance of the liquid crystal <b>109</b>, so that Vds is varied, Ids is substantially fixed and thus the variation of the pixel voltage Vpix can be further reduced as comparison with the patent document described above.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">As a result, the pixel voltage Vpix shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, that is, the pixel voltage Vpix output from the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> is more enhanced in the linearity of the pixel voltage to the gate input voltage as compared with the patent document described above as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, and the pixel voltage Vpix can be applied to liquid crystal, so that more excellent gradation can be achieved every field as shown by the light transmittance of liquid crystal of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Furthermore, by using the p-type MOS transistor having the double gate structure, a p-type MOS transistor having a short channel length can be used, so that the aperture ratio can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The liquid crystal display device of this embodiment is designed with keeping the above effect so that the scan voltage is used as the power supply source and reset power supply source of the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b> operating as the amplifier circuit portion of the analog amplifier <b>104</b>-<b>2</b>, and the reset of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> is carried out by the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b> itself. Therefore, wires and circuits such as power supply source wires, reset power supply source lines, reset switch, etc. are not needed, so that the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>2</b> can be constructed in a small area.</p>

<p id="p-0278" num="0277">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>, when the value of the resistor <b>306</b> is larger than the resistance value Rsp of the RL liquid ((3)), the pixel voltage Vpix exhibits great variation in fields in which positive-polarity signals are written. On the other hand, when the value RL of the resistor <b>306</b> is not more than the liquid crystal resistance Rsp ((1), (2)), the pixel voltage Vpix varies little. When the value RL of the resistor <b>306</b> is equal to the value Rsp of the resistor R<b>2</b> of the liquid crystal <b>109</b> ((2)), slight variation is observed. However, the variation period is extremely shorter than the one-field period and it has no effect on the gradation display control.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">For the reason described above, the value RL of the resistor <b>303</b> in the liquid crystal display device <b>10</b>-<b>5</b> of this embodiment is set so as to satisfy the equation (2) described above. Actually, the value RL of the resistor <b>306</b> is settled in consideration of the variation of the pixel voltage Vpix and the power consumption. In order to reduce the power consumption, it is favorable that the value RL of the resistor <b>306</b> is set to be as large as possible to the extent that the variation of the pixel voltage Vpix does not affect the light transmittance.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">As described above, like the second embodiment, according to the construction of this embodiment, the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b> having the double structure is used for the amplifier circuit portion of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>5</b>, so that the dependence of Ids on Vds is greatly reduced and there occurs no variation in the source-gate voltage Vgs.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">Accordingly, linearity is achieved in the relationship between the gate input voltage and the pixel voltage of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>5</b>, and irrespective of the changing style of the data signal voltage Vd on the signal line <b>102</b> (every field or change at the time when the period of plural fields has elapsed) and even when the pixel voltage Vpix is applied from the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>5</b> through the pixel electrode <b>107</b> to the liquid crystal <b>109</b> and thus the electrostatic capacitance of the liquid crystal <b>109</b> is varied, the pixel voltage Vpix applied to the liquid crystal <b>109</b> is substantially proportional to the data signal voltage Vd data on the signal line <b>102</b>, and no reduction appears in the gain of the pixel voltage applied to the pixel electrode <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">The linearity is achieved in the gate input voltage-pixel voltage characteristic of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>5</b>. Therefore, in the case where the pixel voltage Vpix output from the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b> is applied to the pixel electrode <b>107</b> to drive the liquid crystal <b>109</b> during the field period after the horizontal scan period, and the same driving operation is carried out on each pixel circuit to display an image, even if the data signal voltage Vd is changed or Vds is changed within a permissible range due to response of the liquid crystal <b>109</b> under the state that the data signal voltage Vd is changed, Ids is substantially kept constant, so that the variation of the pixel voltage Vpix can be further reduced as compared with the patent document described above. The light transmittance of the liquid crystal <b>109</b> and the gradation every field are also further enhanced as compared with the patent document described above.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">As a result, like the waveform of the pixel voltage Vpix of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 14</figref> in the second embodiment, the pixel voltage for which the linearity of the gate input voltage-pixel voltage characteristic is more enhanced over the one-field period as compared with the patent document described above can be applied to the liquid crystal, and more excellent gradation can be achieved every field as indicated by the light transmittance of the liquid crystal <b>109</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">Furthermore, by using the MOS transistor having the double gate structure, an MOS transistor having a short channel length can be used. Therefore, the aperture ratio can be enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">The liquid crystal display device of this embodiment is designed with keeping the above effect so that the scan voltage is used as the power supply source and reset power supply source of the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b> operating as the amplifier circuit portion of the analog amplifier <b>104</b>-<b>5</b>, and the reset of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>5</b> is carried out by the first p-type MOS transistor (Qp<b>1</b>) <b>302</b> itself. Therefore, wires and circuits such as power supply source wires, reset power supply source lines, reset switch, etc. are not needed, so that the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>5</b> can be constructed in a small area and there can be achieved a remarkable effect to enhance the high aperture ratio.</p>

<p id="p-0298" num="0297"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a timing chart showing the gate scan voltage Vg, the data signal voltage Vd, the gate input voltage Va of the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b> and the pixel voltage Vpix and also shows the variation of the light transmittance of liquid crystal when high-response liquid crystal such as ferroelectric or antiferroelectric liquid crystal having polarization, OCB mode liquid crystal responding within the one-field period or the like is driven by the pixel circuit <b>20</b>-<b>6</b>.

<p id="p-0299" num="0298">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, the gate scan voltage Vg is set to low level VgL during the horizontal scan period, whereby the p-type MOS transistor (Qp) <b>701</b> is kept to ON state and the data signal voltage Vd input to the signal line <b>102</b> is transferred through the p-type MOS transistor (Qp) <b>701</b> to the gate electrode of the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>. Furthermore, during the horizontal scan period, the gate scan voltage VgL is transferred through the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b> to the pixel electrode <b>107</b>, whereby the pixel electrode <b>107</b> is shifted to the reset state.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">That is, the pixel voltage Vpix is set to VgL during the horizontal scan period, whereby the reset of the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>, that is, the display switching to the normal black state can be simultaneously performed. The first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b> operates as the amplifier circuit portion of the source follower type analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>6</b> after the horizontal scan period is finished. This will be described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">When the horizontal scan period is finished and the gate scan voltage Vg is set to high level, the p-type MOS transistor (Qp) <b>701</b> is set to OFF state, and the data signal voltage transferred to the gate electrode of the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b> is held in the voltage holding capacitor <b>106</b>.

This voltage shift is represented by Vf<b>1</b>, Vf<b>2</b>, Vf<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, and the amount of the voltage shift Vf<b>1</b> to Vf<b>3</b> can be reduced by setting the value of the voltage holding capacitance <b>106</b> to a large value.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">The gate input voltage Va of the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b> is held until the gate scan voltage Vg is set to low level again in the next field period and the p-type MOS transistor (Qp) <b>701</b> is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">On the other hand, the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b> has been already reset during the horizontal scan period, and it operates as the amplifier circuit portion of the source follower type analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>6</b> with the pixel electrode <b>107</b> as a source electrode. In order to induce this operation, the voltage holding capacitance electrode <b>105</b> is supplied with a voltage lower than at least (Vdmin&#x2212;Vtn) as a voltage at which the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b> is operated as the amplifier circuit portion of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>6</b>. Vdmin represents the minimum value of the data signal voltage Vd, and Vtn represents a threshold voltage of the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">The first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b> can output the analog gradation voltage (pixel voltage) corresponding to the gate input voltage Va thus held until the gate scan voltage is set to VgL in the next field and it is reset.</p>

<p id="p-0306" num="0305">Next, the driving method when TN liquid crystal <b>109</b> is used as the liquid crystal of the pixel circuit <b>20</b>-<b>6</b> of the liquid crystal display device will be described.</p>

Here, in this example, the liquid crystal <b>109</b> is operated in the normally white mode in which it is kept in bright state under no voltage application. Furthermore, in this example, a signal voltage under which the light display state is kept over several fields is applied as the data signal voltage Vd. The same driving method as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is used.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">Since TN liquid crystal has a response time from several tens msec to about one hundred msec, it transmits to the light display state while taking the time corresponding to several fields as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. During this period, the molecules of TN liquid are switched to vary the liquid crystal capacitance. Therefore, in the conventional liquid crystal display device, the pixel electrode Vpix is varied as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 74</figref>, and thus the original light transmittance T<b>0</b> of the liquid crystal cannot be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">On the other hand, the liquid crystal display device <b>10</b>-<b>6</b> of this embodiment is designed so that the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b> operates as the amplifier circuit portion of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>6</b>, and the second n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>2</b>) <b>702</b> is operated in a voltage area where Ids has substantially no dependence on Vds, that is, in the weak inversion area. Therefore, even when the TN liquid crystal is driven and the capacitance thereof is varied, the pixel voltage Vpix which is substantially proportional to the data signal voltage Vd can be applied to the liquid crystal <b>109</b> every field without being affected by the variation of the capacitance of the TN liquid, so that the original light transmittance can be achieved and images can be displayed with accurate gradation.</p>

<p id="p-0311" num="0310">The liquid crystal display device of this embodiment is designed with keeping the above effect so that the scan voltage is used as the power supply source and reset power supply source of the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b> operating as the amplifier circuit portion of the analog amplifier <b>104</b>-<b>6</b>, and the reset of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>6</b> is carried out by the first p-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b> itself.

The pixel voltage Vpix is set to VgH during this selection period of the (N&#x2212;1)-th scan line <b>101</b>(N&#x2212;1), whereby the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>(N) is also reset. After the selection period of the (N&#x2212;1)-th scan line <b>101</b>(N&#x2212;1) is finished, the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>(N) operates as the amplifier circuit portion of the source follower type analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>(N). This will be described hereunder.</p>
<p id="p-0422" num="0421">Next, during the period when the N-th gate scan voltage Vg(N) is set to high level VgH, the p-type MOS transistor (Qp) <b>701</b>(N) is set to ON state, and the data signal voltage Vd input to the signal line <b>102</b> is transferred through the p-type MOS transistor (Qp) <b>701</b>(N) to the gate electrode of the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>(N). When the horizontal scan period is finished and the gate scan voltage Vg is set to low level, the p-type MOS transistor (Qp) <b>701</b>(N) is set to OFF state, and the data signal voltage Vd transferred to the gate electrode of the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>(N) is held by the voltage holding capacitor <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0423" num="0422">At this time, the gate input voltage of the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>(N) suffers a voltage shift called as a field through voltage via the gate-source capacitance of the p-type MOS transistor (Qp) <b>701</b>(N) at the time when the p-type MOS transistor (Qp) <b>701</b>(N) is set to OFF state. This voltage shift is represented by Vf<b>1</b>, Vf<b>2</b>, Vf<b>3</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, and the amount of the voltage shift Vf<b>1</b> to Vf<b>3</b> can be reduced by setting the voltage holding capacitor <b>106</b> to a large value.

<p id="p-0424" num="0423">On the other hand, the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>(N) has been already reset during the (N&#x2212;1)-th horizontal scan period, and it operates as a source follower type analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>14</b>(N) using the pixel electrode <b>107</b>(N) as the source electrode. At this time, the voltage holding capacitance electrode <b>105</b> is supplied with a voltage higher than at least (Vdmax&#x2212;Vtp) in advance in order to make the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>(N) as the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>14</b>(N). Here, Vdmax represents the maximum value of the data signal voltage Vd, and Vtp represents the threshold voltage of the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>(N). The first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>(N) can output the analog gradation voltage corresponding to the gate input voltage thus held until the (N&#x2212;1)-th gate scan voltage is set to VgH to reset the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>(N) again.</p>
<p id="p-0425" num="0424">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>, the relationship between data signal voltage Vd which is difficult to read and the light transmittance will be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42 and 43</figref>. Each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42 and 43</figref> shows the light transmittance when the data signal voltage Vd is set to a voltage ranging from 5.6V to 16V.</p>
<p id="p-0426" num="0425">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42 and 43</figref>, the ordinate axis represents the light transmittance (%), and the abscissa axis represents the absolute value of the difference between the data signal voltage Vd and the intermediate voltage (Vc=10.8 V) of the data input voltage, that is, the amplitude (|Vd&#x2212;Vc|) (represented as the amplitude of the data voltage in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42 and 43</figref>). When the data signal voltage Vd is larger than the intermediate voltage Vc, it is represented as positive polarity, and when the data signal voltage Vd is smaller than the intermediate voltage Vc, it is represented as negative polarity. The light transmittance represents a value under the state that the light transmittance is stabilized in each field with respect to time lapse in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0427" num="0426"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42</figref> shows a case where the MOS transistor having the single gate structure is used, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43</figref> shows a case where the MOS transistor having the double gate structure is used.</p>
<p id="p-0428" num="0427">In the case of the single gate structure, the gain of the analog amplifier circuit is low and the maximum light transmittance is less than 94%. To make matters worse, the input/output characteristic of the analog amplifier circuit is bad, so that the light transmittance is greatly different between positive polarity and negative polarity and the difference is equal to 9% at maximum.</p>
<p id="p-0429" num="0428">In the double gate structure, the gain of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>14</b> is high, and the maximum light transmittance is equal to 100%. Furthermore, the linearity of the input/output characteristic of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>14</b> is high, and there is little difference in light transmittance between positive polarity and negative polarity. The difference does not reach even 0.1%.</p>
<p id="p-0430" num="0429">Furthermore, it is needless to say that TN liquid crystal is driven by the pixel circuit <b>20</b>-<b>14</b> according to this embodiment.

<p id="p-0431" num="0430">On the other hand, in the liquid crystal display device according to this embodiment, the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b> operates as the amplifier circuit portion of the analog amplifier circuit <b>104</b>-<b>14</b>, and a fixed voltage can be continued to be applied to the liquid crystal <b>109</b>(N) without being affected by the capacitance variation of the TN liquid crystal. Therefore, original light transmittance can be achieved and accurate gradation display can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0432" num="0431">As described above, according to the construction of this embodiment, there can be substantially the same effect as the sixth embodiment except that the driving of the first n-type MOS transistor (Qn<b>1</b>) <b>702</b>(N) is carried out with the gate scan voltage Vg(N&#x2212;1) applied to the scan line <b>101</b> (N&#x2212;1).</p>
<p id="p-0433" num="0432">That is, there can be achieved the effect that the pixel voltage Vpix substantially proportional to the data signal voltage Vd can be applied to the liquid crystal <b>109</b>(N), and thus the effect that more excellent gradation can be achieved every field and the aperture ratio can be more enhanced as compared with the patent document described above.</p>

The phase-compensating circuit <b>830</b> compensates for the phase lag of the voltage output from the differential amplification circuit <b>810</b>, which occurs due to the voltage variation of the voltage of the bias power supply source <b>802</b> and/or the voltage supplied to the scan line <b>101</b>. In the phase compensation, the voltage of the bias power supply source <b>802</b> and/or the voltage supplied to the scan line <b>101</b> is used as a control signal for the phase compensation in the phase compensating circuit <b>830</b>.</p>

Since the MOS transistor having the double gate structure is used as the current supply source in the output buffer gate <b>840</b>, the linearity of the pixel voltage Vpix to the amplifier input voltage is enhanced, and thus the gradation is also more enhanced from the viewpoint of the image display on the liquid crystal <b>109</b> in the output buffer <b>840</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0758" num="0757">As described above, according to the construction of this embodiment, in both the differential amplification circuit <b>810</b> and the output buffer <b>840</b>, the MOS transistor having the double gate structure is used and also the operating area of the MOS transistor is set to the operating point at which the dependence of Ids on Vds is substantially nullified or to an operating point in the neighborhood of the above non-dependence operating point within a permissible range as in the case of the second embodiment. Therefore, as described above, the pixel voltage Vpix output from the operating amplification circuit <b>104</b>-<b>35</b> as the analog amplification circuit is set to a voltage which is substantially proportional to the amplifier input voltage Va, or a voltage represented by a deviation from the voltage concerned within a permissible range.</p>
<p id="p-0759" num="0758">Accordingly, more excellent gradation can be achieved every field as compared with the patent document described above.</p>

However, the present invention is not limited to these embodiments, and even if these embodiments are modified in design or the like without departing from the subject matter of the present invention, these modifications are contained in the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0783" num="0782">For example, the feature of the present invention which is intrinsic in each embodiment, that is, the feature that the dependence of Ids on Vds can be substantially eliminated is applied to devices other than the liquid crystal display device, and the present invention can be implemented by these devices.</p>
<p id="p-0784" num="0783">Accordingly, it is needless to say that the amplifier input voltage of each embodiment may be set to other signals to be amplified, and these signals may be modulation and demodulation signals in modulation and demodulation circuits, etc.</p>

<p id="p-0786" num="0785">In each of the above embodiments, the MOS transistor having the multi-gate structure may be used for not only the MOS transistor constituting the analog amplifier circuit, but also the MOS transistor for switching the data signal voltage to the analog amplifier circuit.

<p id="p-0787" num="0786">In each of the above embodiments, the n-type MOS transistor <b>103</b>, the n-type MOS transistor <b>701</b>, the first p-type MOS transistor <b>302</b>, the second p-type MOS transistor <b>303</b>, the first n-type MOS transistor <b>702</b> and the second n-type MOS transistor <b>703</b> are formed of p-SiTFT.

<heading id="h-0042" level="1">INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY</heading>
<p id="p-0790" num="0789">As described above, according to the construction of the present invention, the unipolar transistor is operated in the operating area where Ids of the unipolar transistor having the multi-gate structure on Vds can be substantially eliminated, so that the voltage for driving liquid crystal or the like can be prevented from being varied due to response of the liquid crystal or the like and at the same time the withstanding voltage of the transistors being used can be extremely enhanced.</p>
<p id="p-0791" num="0790">As a result, the above function makes it possible to drive the circuit with a signal having a broad input/output voltage range. For example, there can be implemented an analog amplifier circuit having a broad dynamic range in which the gain thereof is substantially fixed over a broad input voltage range.</p>
<p id="p-0792" num="0791">Furthermore, by increasing the withstanding voltage of the unipolar transistor described above, the area needed for each sub unipolar transistor can be reduced, so that a high aperture ratio can be implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0793" num="0792">Accordingly, for example, in the liquid crystal display device actively using the effect described above, more accurate gradation display can be performed as compared with the prior art. Particularly, even in the case of high-response liquid crystal such as ferroelectric or antiferroelectric liquid crystal having polarization, OCB mode liquid crystal responding within one-field period, etc., the high-response liquid crystal can be driven without inducing variation in the pixel voltage. As a result, more accurate gradation display can be performed every field (frame).</p>
<p id="p-0794" num="0793">When the liquid crystal display device is driven in the time-divisional driving system by applying the above characteristic, the color reproduction in the liquid crystal display device is better, and high-gradation display can be performed.</p>
<p id="p-0795" num="0794">Furthermore, according to the liquid crystal display device of the present invention, the scan voltage is used as the power supply source and the reset power supply source for the unipolar transistor operating as, and also the reset of the analog amplifier circuit is carried out by the unipolar transistor itself. Therefore, there can be achieved such a remarkable effect that with keeping the above effect, the wires and the circuits such as the power supply source wires, the reset power supply source wires, the reset switches, etc. are never needed, the analog amplifier circuit can be constructed in a small area and the high aperture ration can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0796" num="0795">The pixel circuit can be constructed by all unipolar transistors having the same type, so that the manufacturing process can be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0797" num="0796">The load resistance of the source follower type analog amplifier or the resistance of the active load transistor in the liquid crystal display device of the present invention is equal to a high value, for example, 1 G&#x3a9;, and thus constantly flowing consumption current can be suppressed with keeping the above effect, so that the power consumption can be saved.</p>
<p id="p-0798" num="0797">The above feature can provide a projector device, a notebook-sized PC, a monitor liquid crystal display, etc. which are compact and light in size and weight, high in aperture ratio, response, visual field and gradation and low in power consumption and price.</p>
