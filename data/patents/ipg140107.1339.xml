<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. Section 119 of Korean Patent Application Serial No. 10-2011-0075076, entitled &#x201c;Apparatus for Ejecting Droplets&#x201d; filed on Jul. 28, 2011, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety into this application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to an ejecting apparatus which includes a plurality of nozzles, and more particularly, to an ejecting apparatus which can control sizes of droplets to be ejected more minutely and more precisely, stably maintain a nozzle chip under high ejection pressure, and improve durability and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In recent years, there is an attempt to apply a technique of ejecting droplets having a uniform size for a precise process such as ejecting, coating, or printing. For example, since an ink-jet head has a precise nozzle and uses an actuator suitable for the nozzle, the ink-jet head is suitable for ejecting droplets with a uniform size.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a cross sectional view schematically illustrating a structure of a related art ink-jet head.</p>

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The nozzle chip <b>13</b> has a minute pattern and is made of a material having high brittleness such as silicon or glass. In this case, if high pressure is applied to an inlet <b>11</b><i>a </i>in order to discharge droplets at a high speed, the nozzle chip <b>13</b> and the upper bezel <b>11</b> may be separated from each other or the nozzle chip <b>13</b>, which has high brittleness, may be damaged due to high pressure exerted to a channel <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Due to the above problems, it is difficult to apply the related art ink-jet head to the case in which the droplets should be ejected at high speed.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In this configuration, the first and the second packing members may be made of the same material as that of the first, the second, and the third sealing members such as silicon rubber, but are not limited to this material and may be formed of any other material that can achieve tightness and buffering.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Meanwhile, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 9</figref>, the nozzle chip <b>130</b> is connected to a flexible printed circuit board (FPCB) <b>151</b> for controlling driving of the actuator <b>132</b>, a connector board <b>152</b> connected to the FPCB <b>151</b>, and a connector <b>153</b> connected to the connector board <b>152</b> in sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The upper body <b>110</b> may include a cavity <b>110</b><i>a </i>fluidly communicating with the upper mounting portion <b>113</b> and the outside so as to provide a space in which the FPCB <b>151</b>, the connector board <b>152</b>, and the connector <b>153</b> are mounted.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The ejecting apparatus <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment may further include a sealing cover <b>140</b> to expose an end portion of the connector <b>153</b> to the outside so that the connector <b>153</b> is connected to a cable (not shown), and also to seal the cavity <b>110</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Accordingly, the ejecting apparatus <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment may increase a waterproofing property against mist caused by scattering of very minute moisture. At this time, since the connector <b>153</b> is exposed to the outside, a waterproofing connector may be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref>, the nozzle chip <b>130</b> may include a plurality of flow cells to receive the ejectable fluid from the channel <b>112</b> of the upper body <b>110</b> and discharge the ejectable fluid into the nozzle slit <b>122</b> of the lower body <b>120</b> in the form of a plurality of droplets.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">All of the plurality of flow cells fluidly communicate with the channel <b>112</b>, but may be configured in the form of an independent channel.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">More specifically, the nozzle chip <b>130</b> may include a nozzle body <b>131</b> manufactured by performing an MEMS process with respect to a silicon wafer as described above, and the plurality of flow cells may be formed on the nozzle body <b>131</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Each of the flow cells includes an inlet <b>131</b><i>a </i>fluidly communicating with the channel <b>112</b> to receive the ejectable fluid, a chamber <b>131</b><i>c </i>fluidly communicating with the inlet <b>131</b><i>a</i>, a restrictor <b>131</b><i>b </i>to connect the inlet <b>131</b><i>a </i>and the chamber <b>131</b><i>c</i>, and an ejection nozzle <b>131</b><i>d </i>to discharge the ejectable fluid supplied to the chamber <b>131</b><i>c </i>into the nozzle slit <b>122</b> in the form of droplets. A channel between the chamber <b>131</b><i>c </i>and the ejection nozzle <b>131</b><i>d </i>is funnel-shaped such that a size of the channel gradually decreases toward the ejection nozzle <b>131</b><i>d</i>, and serves as a damper.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The actuator <b>132</b> may be disposed on an upper portion of the nozzle body <b>131</b> adjacent to the ejection nozzle <b>131</b><i>d</i>, a lower electrode <b>133</b><i>b </i>may be disposed between the nozzle body <b>131</b> and the actuator <b>132</b> to propagate driving by an electric pulse of the actuator <b>132</b> toward the nozzle body <b>131</b>, and an upper electrode <b>133</b><i>a </i>may be disposed between the FPCB <b>151</b> and the actuator <b>132</b> to input the electric pulse to the actuator <b>132</b> through the aforementioned FPCB <b>151</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The actuator <b>132</b> may include a plurality of independent piezoelectric elements corresponding to the plurality of flow cells and accordingly is able to drive the plurality of flow cells of the nozzle chip <b>130</b> independently and thus control the sizes of the droplets of the ejectable fluid minutely and precisely.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Meanwhile, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows photographed images of the size of droplets of ejectable fluid ejected by the ejecting apparatus of the present invention according to a driving frequency and an ejection pressure of the actuator. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, if ejection pressure of 3, 4, and 5 bar is applied and a speed is constantly fixed, and if driving frequency of 50, 100, and 150 kHz of the actuator <b>132</b>, that is, of the piezoelectric elements is applied in sequence, as the driving frequency increases, the size of the droplet is reduced and the droplet has a uniform size, while merging of the droplets is prevented. That is, it can be seen that, by controlling the driving frequency of the actuator, the size of the droplet can be easily controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As described above, the ejecting apparatus according to the present invention can maintain the nozzle chip even under high ejection pressure, thereby preventing damage to the nozzle chip and the ejecting apparatus having the same and thus improving durability and reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Also, according to the ejecting apparatus of the present invention, it is possible to drive the plurality of flow cells of the nozzle chip independently and thus control the size of the droplets of the ejected fluid minutely and precisely. Therefore, the ejecting apparatus can be applied to various fields that require precise ejecting.</p>
