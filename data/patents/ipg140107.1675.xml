<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to systems and methods for hydraulic hybrid vehicles, and more specifically to hydraulic hybrid systems that utilize a planetary gear train to replace a torque converter and couple a hydraulic pump/motor to the output of a prime mover and input of a transmission.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Rising fuel costs and concern for the environment are providing more and more incentive for automobile and heavy duty vehicle manufacturers to increase the fuel economy of the vehicles they produce. New vehicles are including new and improved technologies that continue to reduce the amount of fuel used per mile driven. One such technology is the hybridization of vehicles in which two or more power sources are used in various combinations to propel the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Depending on the exact method of hybridization of a vehicle the fuel savings may be realized from one or more of the following: optimizing the operating speed and load point at which the prime mover or engine operates, recovering braking energy normally lost to heat, increasing the efficiency of the powertrain, enabling stop-start operation, and by allowing for engine downsizing.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Electric hybrids utilize an internal combustion engine in combination with one or more electric motors. Similarly, hydraulic hybrids utilize hydraulic pumps and motors as a second source of power and store the energy as pressurized fluid in accumulators. Hydraulic systems have higher power density than electric systems, making hydraulics ideally suited for vehicles intended to recover large amounts of braking energy. Typical examples of vehicles that could benefit from hydraulic hybrids include refuse trucks, delivery vehicles, or other vehicles that undergo frequent stopping and starting.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Researchers and suppliers have been developing both parallel and series hydraulic hybrid systems for some time, but many of the limitations of these systems have yet to be overcome. Parallel hybrid systems can typically be characterized as simpler systems that rely largely on regenerative braking to generate a majority of the fuel savings, which tends to be considerably less than those achieved with series systems. Series systems tend to be more complicated, cost more as a retrofit, but save larger amounts of fuel largely due to their ability to decouple the engine load from the required driving load. Finally, series hydraulic hybrid systems tend to be more difficult to make financially viable for retrofit applications due to the large amount of hardware needed for the system.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Most parallel hydraulic hybrid systems are installed in the driveline downstream of the transmission resulting in multiple disadvantages. The first disadvantage is that by locating the pump/motor downstream of the transmission the pump/motor does not get the benefit of the torque multiplication of the transmission, and more importantly the ability to easily employ multiple ratios. This requires that the system either incorporate large gear reductions, thus limiting the vehicle speeds at which the hybrid system can be operated, or that the system be designed to use larger pump/motors which are larger, heavier and more expensive than smaller pump/motors.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Secondly, installing the system after the transmission requires that the driveline needs to be modified in the case of retrofits and makes integration more difficult in new designs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Additionally, the larger pump/motors required in the driveline systems are heavier, require more space which can be in very short supply, and tend to cost more due to increased materials cost and reduced economies of scale associated with lower production numbers. There is a compounding affect as the pump/motors get larger, because the bigger pump/motors will require more fluid which results in larger reservoirs with more oil in them. Furthermore, the heavier pumps and gearboxes and larger reservoirs will require heavier mounts and reduce the vehicle payload and fuel savings.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Finally, one of the largest shortcomings of existing parallel hydraulic hybrids is that they are designed to be integrated primarily into vehicles that utilize automatic transmissions. Vehicles with automatic transmissions have poorer fuel economy than manual transmissions do in almost all cases. This decreased efficiency comes primarily from the use of a torque converter that is known to be very inefficient, especially during launch. A &#x201c;torque converter&#x201d; is a hydrodynamic torque converter that is commonly used to couple automotive and heavy truck engines to automatic transmissions. Many newer transmissions now utilize a torque converter clutch (TCC) to lock up the converter, thereby eliminating most of those losses in some of the operating regions, but the TCC cannot be applied during vehicle launch (a time during which there is a large amount of power loss). While a TCC can increase efficiency and reduce the fuel consumption, the overall efficiency is still usually lower than that of manual transmissions.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A planetary gearset is used to couple a prime mover, a hydraulic machine (pump/motor) and the input to a transmission in such a manner as to provide one or more of the following seven modes of operation: vehicle launch, extra low reduction ratio, direct drive (into the transmission), hydraulic retardation, hydraulic assist, neutral and neutral with hydraulic supply, and engine off operation. This architecture allows for a smooth vehicle launch without the use of a torque converter or starting clutch, providing greater efficiency both during launch and normal operation. Furthermore, energy normally wasted during vehicle launch can be stored and used later to assist vehicle acceleration. Once the vehicle has been launched the system can be configured to operate as a conventional parallel hydraulic hybrid system.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Installing a hybrid system upstream of the transmission permits the pump/motor to cover a larger range of speeds as the transmission is shifted. A design that allows an automatic transmission to start without using a torque converter could have significant fuel savings potential. A hydraulic hybrid design that provides full parallel hybrid functionality in addition to replicating the functionality of the torque converter (e.g. the ability to idle a vehicle that is in gear and to smoothly launch a vehicle from stop and have torque multiplication without the power and energy losses of the torque converter) has clear advantages over existing systems.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0106">While the invention is amenable to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments have been shown by way of example in the drawings and are described in detail below. The intention, however, is not to limit the invention to the particular embodiments described. On the contrary, the invention is intended to cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0064" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically illustrates a hydraulic hybrid system that provides hydraulic hybrid functionality to motor vehicles, especially large vehicles that tend to stop and start repeatedly such as refuse trucks, yard hostlers and city buses, according to embodiments of the present invention. The system is comprised of a planetary, or epicyclic, gearset <b>101</b> which is comprised of a sun gear, a carrier and a ring gear. One element of the gearset <b>101</b> is coupled to the output of the prime mover <b>100</b> (the prime mover <b>100</b> is an internal combustion engine in this case) and a second element of the gearset <b>101</b> is coupled to the input of a transmission <b>102</b>, which is preferably an automatic variety that is designed to shift under load, but can be of any type including, but not limited to, a manual transmission. In this embodiment a driveshaft <b>103</b> couples the output of the transmission <b>102</b> to a differential <b>106</b> that is coupled to axle shafts <b>107</b> and <b>108</b>, which are in turn coupled to the wheels <b>109</b> and <b>110</b>. A third element of the planetary gearset <b>101</b> is also coupled to a hydraulic machine, also referred to as pump/motor <b>104</b> by a coupling <b>105</b> that may, or may not have an effective gear ratio of unity. In this case a chain and sprocket assembly of the type used in automotive and light truck transfer cases is used. Many other mechanisms can be employed to provide the functionality of coupling <b>105</b> and include, but are not limited to, belts and pulleys, shafts, chains and sprocket, gears and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0108">As used herein, the term &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; is used in its broadest sense to refer to elements which are connected, attached, and/or engaged, either directly or integrally or indirectly via other elements, and either permanently, temporarily, or removably. As used herein, the term &#x201c;rotatably coupled&#x201d; is used in its broadest sense to refer to elements which are coupled in a way that permits one element to rotate with respect to another element. As used herein, the terms &#x201c;fluidly coupled&#x201d; or in &#x201c;fluid communication&#x201d; are used in their broadest sense to refer to elements which are coupled in a way that permits fluid flow between them. As used herein, the term &#x201c;mechanically coupled&#x201d; is used in its broadest sense to refer to elements which are coupled in a way that permits the torque or force of one element to be transmitted to another element.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a schematic diagram of the system described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in greater detail, according to embodiments of the present invention. The system is comprised of an engine <b>100</b>, which is mechanically coupled to an input shaft <b>200</b> through torsional damper <b>201</b>, which may be comprised of springs and friction elements. The damper <b>201</b> may be used to attenuate driveline vibrations which can be caused by many factors, including the firing pulses of the engine and shifting of the transmission. In other embodiments the damper may be comprised of one or more of the following non-limiting examples: helical springs and friction elements, viscous coupling elements, dual mass flywheels, friction elements designed to have some slippage, active elements that control the amount of friction between the input and the output, special lubricants, and friction modifiers. The damper may also be in a predominantly dry environment or may be immersed or in regular contact with a lubricating or working fluid such as automatic transmission fluid, hydraulic fluid, engine operating oil, or the like. The system may also be configured so as to not incorporate a damper assembly but instead couple the engine <b>100</b> directly to the input shaft <b>200</b> or to the input shaft through a clutch (not shown), but both of these alternative configurations may lead to undesirable vibrations in certain operating modes.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0110">According to the hydraulic hybrid system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the input shaft <b>200</b> is coupled to the ring gear <b>202</b> of the planetary gear set <b>101</b>, the carrier <b>203</b> of the planetary gearset <b>101</b> is coupled to the input of the transmission <b>102</b>, and the sun gear <b>204</b> of the planetary gear set <b>101</b> is coupled to a hydraulic machine <b>104</b>. Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a one-way roller clutch <b>205</b> that couples the sun gear <b>204</b> to a second hydraulically actuated multi-plate wet clutch <b>206</b>, such that the two parts may rotate only in one direction relative to each other. One side of the clutch <b>206</b> is coupled to a ground such as, for example, the transmission case, and the other side of the clutch <b>206</b> is coupled to the one-way clutch <b>205</b> such that when clutch <b>206</b> is engaged, the one way clutch <b>205</b> will allow the sun gear <b>204</b> to rotate in one direction, which may be referred to as the forward direction, but not in the other (reverse) direction.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0111">Also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a hydraulically actuated multi-plate wet clutch <b>207</b> that is used to selectively couple the carrier <b>203</b> to the ring gear <b>202</b>, according to embodiments of the present invention. Once clutch <b>207</b> has been applied and the ring gear <b>202</b> and the carrier <b>203</b> are rotating at the same speed, the sun gear <b>204</b> will rotate at the same speed as the other two elements of the planetary gearset, according to kinematic principles. Coupling any two elements of the planetary <b>101</b> gear set (carrier, sun gear, or ring gear) together will achieve similar results, and one skilled in the art will recognize, based on the present disclosure, that there are many configurations and locations for a clutch that would accomplish the same desired output.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0112">The one-way clutch <b>205</b> may be of many designs including, but not limited to a roller clutch, a sprag clutch, a ratchet, and/or any other one-way clutch known to one of ordinary skill in the art, based on the present disclosure. According to embodiments of the present invention, clutches <b>206</b> and <b>207</b> may be of various designs including, but not limited to, multi-plate wet clutches, dry clutches, band clutches, cone clutches, synchronizers, dog clutches, electromagnetic clutches, and the like, and may be controlled electronically, hydraulically, pneumatically, mechanically, manually, passively or by any other means. Clutch <b>207</b> may be eliminated or omitted, according to embodiments of the present invention. Similarly, clutch <b>205</b> and/or clutch <b>206</b> may be eliminated and/or omitted, according to embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0113">According to the embodiment of the present invention shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a hydraulically actuated multi-plate wet clutch <b>208</b> can be used to selectively couple the hydraulic machine <b>104</b> to the sun gear <b>204</b> via chain <b>105</b>. Similarly to clutches <b>206</b> and <b>207</b>, clutch <b>208</b> can take many different forms and actuation means including, but not limited to, those previously described for clutches <b>206</b> and <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0114">The embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> can be configured or adapted to operate in one of multiple modes by using one more of the following mechanisms: engaging or disengaging clutches, controlling the engine torque, opening or shutting valves in the hydraulic system, adjusting regulator pressures in the hydraulic system, adjusting the displacement of the hydraulic machine, selecting specific gears in the transmission, shutting the engine off, and controlling valves in the auxiliary hydraulic circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0115">The laws of kinematics and dynamics of planetary gearsets dictate that the maximum steady state torque that can be transmitted between the engine <b>100</b> (coupled to the ring gear <b>202</b>) and the input to the transmission <b>102</b> (coupled to the carrier <b>203</b>) will be limited to some ratio of the torque reaction that the hydraulic machine <b>104</b> exerts on the sun gear <b>204</b> of the planetary gearset <b>101</b> through chain <b>105</b>. According to embodiments of the present invention, this reaction torque created by the pump/motor <b>104</b> can be used to control various modes of the vehicle operation including, but not limited to, vehicle idle and launch.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0116">According to the embodiment of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a vehicle idle mode can be achieved with the transmission <b>102</b> engaged in a forward or reverse gear by controlling the magnitude of the pump/motor <b>104</b> torque to zero or a substantially low level. This can be accomplished by one or more of the following mechanisms: setting the pump/motor <b>104</b> displacement to zero or low value, connecting the output of the pump/motor to low pressure, disengaging clutch <b>208</b> or starving the pump/motor of fluid. By not providing a torque reaction to the sun gear, little torque can be transmitted between the engine and the transmission. In this configuration with little, or no, reaction torque at the pump/motor <b>104</b>, the engine <b>101</b> can be commanded to operate at a wide variety of speeds, including idle, and the resulting pump/motor <b>104</b> speed will be a function of both the engine <b>101</b> speed and the transmission <b>102</b> input speed. If the transmission is in gear with clutch <b>208</b> engaged, the transmission input speed will be a ratio of the vehicle speed; this will be zero if the drive wheels are not rotating, and therefore the pump <b>104</b> speed will be a ratio of the engine <b>101</b> speed. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the pump/motor <b>104</b> will be rotating in a direction opposite to that of the engine <b>101</b>, and will be faster in magnitude.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0117">In this configuration the vehicle can be controlled to idle similar to other vehicles with conventional powertrains. This and other embodiments of the present invention are applicable to a wide variety of powertrain configurations including, but not limited to, a manual transmission and clutch assembly, an automatic transmission and a torque converter, a hydrostatic drive, a direct drive system, a fixed ratio driveline, and a continuously variable transmission (CVT).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0118">According to embodiments of the present invention, the amount of torque transmitted to transmission <b>102</b> can be controlled by varying the amount of torque reaction of the pump/motor <b>104</b> and/or the engine <b>101</b> torque. These levels can be set to levels that transfer a small amount of torque to the transmission <b>102</b> and emulate what is known as &#x201c;driveline creep,&#x201d; a situation in which a vehicle with an automatic transmission has a tendency to slowly accelerate on a level grade if in gear without a brake or other retarding mechanism in place.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0119">Various launch modes can be accomplished in multiple ways, including, without limitation, various combinations of increasing the reaction torque of the hydraulic machine, engaging the clutch <b>208</b>, increasing the engine torque, engaging or disengaging clutches <b>206</b>, and/or engaging or disengaging clutch <b>207</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0120">According to the embodiments of the present invention, vehicle launch can be initiated in a vehicle that is already in gear, and has clutch <b>208</b> applied, by increasing the torque reaction of the pump/motor <b>104</b> while controlling the torque on the engine <b>101</b>; this will increase the torque transmitted between the engine <b>101</b> and transmission <b>102</b> input. The torque reaction of the pump/motor can be controlled by one or more of the following mechanisms: adjusting the displacement, controlling the pressure at the pump outlet, controlling the shaft speed, and controlling the flow area into and out of the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0121">As the reaction torque increases to large enough values, the pump/motor <b>104</b> will start to decelerate as the input shaft <b>200</b> to the transmission <b>102</b> increases in speed and the vehicle starts to accelerate. The rate of acceleration can be controlled by multiple mechanisms, including, but not limited to, controlling the engine torque and controlling the pump torque. The configuration of the gear set <b>101</b> results in a torque multiplication between the engine and the transmission input, which assists the launch, according to embodiments of the present invention. According to embodiments of the present invention, the gear set <b>101</b> may be configured such that, if the clutch <b>207</b> is not engaged, the torque available at the carrier <b>203</b> (which is coupled to the input of the transmission <b>102</b>) will be a multiple of the engine torque, by a ratio determined by the geometry of the planetary gear set. In some embodiments of the present invention, the carrier torque will be approximately 1.6 times that of the engine torque.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0122">As the vehicle accelerates, the speed of the hydraulic machine will become less and less negative until it approaches zero. During this time the engine can be controlled in a variety of ways including, but not limited to, speed control, torque control, constant power, and minimum energy. Furthermore, the engine can be controlled using a variety of control algorithms that can optimize or affect the fuel consumption, vehicle acceleration, driver comfort, or any other objective function.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0123">According to some embodiments of the present invention, a second launch, or &#x201c;low&#x201d; mode can be accomplished by applying clutch <b>206</b>, which provides a reaction for the one way clutch <b>205</b> and prevents the pump/motor <b>104</b> from rotating backwards. If the clutch <b>206</b> is applied before the pump/motor <b>104</b> reaches zero speed, the combination of the one-way clutch <b>205</b> and clutch <b>206</b> will cause the pump/motor speed to go to zero. If clutch <b>206</b> is applied after the pump/motor <b>104</b> has reached zero speed, it will prevent the pump/motor <b>104</b> from rotating backwards until the clutch <b>206</b> is disengaged. With the sun gear <b>204</b> at zero speed and capable of imparting a torque reaction, the gearset <b>101</b> continues to multiply the torque of the engine <b>100</b>. The torque multiplication is beneficial, particularly in systems which do not use a torque converter. Once in this mode, the engine speed will increase as the vehicle speed increases and at some point will get high enough to warrant selection of a new gear.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0124">According to embodiments of the present invention, a direct drive mode can be accomplished by applying clutch <b>207</b>, which will cause all of the elements of the planetary gear set <b>101</b> to rotate in unison and thereby reduce the engine speed due to the relative inertias of the engine and the vehicle. Once in this mode, the torque multiplication from the engine to transmission will be 1.0. Thus, by selectively engaging clutches <b>206</b> and <b>207</b>, the planetary <b>101</b> can either multiply engine torque or become a direct drive connection. Once clutch <b>207</b> is engaged, the vehicle can operate much as conventional vehicle, with the exception that it will have no torque converter.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents a clutch state diagram that details which clutch (of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is applied for each mode. According to embodiments of the present invention, there are three modes for this planetary system. The first mode is the &#x201c;launch&#x201d; mode in which the vehicle is accelerated from rest. The second mode is a &#x201c;low&#x201d; gear ratio that multiplies the engine torque and can make up for the torque multiplication that would normally be achieved with the torque converter in systems having torque converters. The last mode is a &#x201c;direct drive&#x201d; mode.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0126"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> depicts a graph of the speeds of the different elements of the gearset <b>101</b> as a function of time, according to some embodiments of the present invention. In this example, the launch mode, indicated as <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, occurs between time 0 and 2 seconds. During that time, the speed of the hydraulic unit or pump/motor <b>104</b> changes from a negative value to zero. Once the sun gear <b>204</b>, connected to the pump/motor in this embodiment, has stopped rotating and is kept from rotating either by clutches <b>205</b> and <b>206</b>, or by restricting the output of the pump/motor <b>104</b> and hydraulically locking it, the planetary gearset <b>101</b> will be operating in a &#x201c;low&#x201d; mode, indicated as <b>301</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, with a combined gear ratio that will be equal to the low (1<sup>st </sup>gear) ratio of the transmission <b>102</b> multiplied by the multiplication created by the planetary gearset. This &#x201c;low&#x201d; mode is shown as occurring from 2 to 8 seconds in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0127">Once the planetary gearset <b>101</b> is in the &#x201c;low&#x201d; mode, indicated as <b>301</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the vehicle can continue to accelerate with both the engine speed and the transmission input speed increasing. When desired, clutch <b>207</b> can be engaged and the speeds of all of the elements of the planetary gearset (sun gear, carrier, and ring gear) will approach the same speed and rotate together resulting in a direct drive coupling of the engine and transmission input, providing a &#x201c;direct drive&#x201d; mode, indicated by <b>303</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and occurring after 8 seconds in the graph. At this time, the combined ratio will be equal to the first gear ratio of the transmission <b>102</b>. In the &#x201c;direct&#x201d; mode, the vehicle can be accelerated using the engine alone or can benefit from the hydraulic hybrid adding power stored in the accumulator. Similarly, the hydraulic hybrid can be configured to absorb power from the driveline, feasibly increasing overall fuel economy by allowing the engine to operate at higher load than the conditions might require. This can be an effective method to increase the efficiency of the powertrain as the higher load point may be a more efficient operating point. Once in the &#x201c;direct&#x201d; mode, the hydraulic hybrid has the ability to absorb power, add power, or be in a neutral mode.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0128">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the planetary gearset <b>101</b> and related hardware such as, but not limited to, the coupling mechanism <b>105</b>, bearings, shafts and the like, may be in one or more separate housing that mates with a transmission and engine either of which may, or may not, be modified. This modular approach provides benefit for embodiments of the present invention intended for retrofitting existing powertrains but is equally applicable for new powertrains as well. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. illustrates an example of an axial piston pump with displacement of approximately 135 cc/rev coupled to an automatic transmission without a torque converter, according to embodiments of the present invention. Similarly, other embodiments of the present invention incorporate the gearset <b>101</b>, and other required hardware into the transmission itself and use one or more separate housings that contain the coupling to the hydraulic machine <b>104</b> and is external to the transmission. Other embodiments of the present invention incorporate all, or most of, the parts required to provide system functionality (transmission functionality, pump functionality, coupling functionality, and other systems to make the system function) into substantially one housing or package.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0129">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the planetary gearset <b>101</b> and the transmission <b>102</b> are integrated to such an extent that they may be considered part of the same gearbox or gear assembly. Furthermore, in some cases, the functionality of the planetary gearset <b>101</b> can be achieved within some transmission designs, eliminating the need to add an additional gearset. Some embodiments of the present invention use a hydraulic machine (also referred to as a pump/motor) that is substantially coaxial and/or collinear with one or more shafts in the transmission and/or engine, and other embodiments use pumps that are oriented with shafts parallel to the centerline of one or more transmission and/or engine shafts. Still other embodiments include the pump assembly mounted in a manner that is not coaxial, collinear, or parallel to any shafts in the prime mover or engine and/or transmission or driveline. Based on the disclosure provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that there are numerous combinations and arrangements for assembling the individual components into one or more sub assemblies and housings that provide substantially the same function, and the examples given are intended to be exemplary and non-limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0130">Operation of the hydraulic hybrid can benefit greatly from integrating the controls of the hybrid and the automatic transmission and/or other controllers. There are multiple mechanisms and methods for controlling the system including, but not limited to, a separate controller that runs autonomously, a separate controller that communicates with other controllers such as a transmission controller and/or an engine controller and/or a vehicle controller, combining with another controller, and the like, and the communications protocols between the controller and the controlled devices (e.g. valves, clutches) could be sent over various media including, but not limited to, wireless, dedicated lines, serial data and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0131"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a hydraulic hybrid system, according to embodiments of the present invention. In this embodiment, a clutch disc <b>600</b> is coupled to the output of an engine, such as for example an International DT466E, and the disc is coupled to a spring damper assembly <b>601</b> which is in turn coupled to the input splines on the clutch housing shaft <b>602</b>. A ring gear <b>603</b> is splined to the clutch housing <b>602</b> so as to transfer torque between the two.

<p id="p-0089" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a hydraulic schematic for an embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment a pump/motor <b>104</b> is coupled to a planetary gearset <b>101</b>, which is also coupled to the engine and transmission input in an arrangement similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. According to various embodiments of the present invention, various types of pump/motors can be used for the system including, but not limited to, axial piston pumps, radial piston pumps, ball pumps, vane pumps, internal gear pumps, external gear pumps, geroter pumps, swashplate pumps, and bent axis pumps. Furthermore, the pump/motors may be of any size or displacement, may be fixed or variable displacement, may be unidirectional or bidirectional, may operate as both pumps and motors, may be designed for open loop applications, may be designed for closed loop applications, may be designed for &#xbd; closed loop allocations, may be designed for hydrostats, may be capable of doing what is known in the art as &#x201c;going over center,&#x201d; may be incapable of &#x201c;going over center,&#x201d; may be operated digitally, may have the ability to control the flow in and/or out of one or more cylinders independently or in unison, and may have intelligent controls. Similarly, alternate embodiments of the present invention utilize a plurality of pumps, and/or accumulators and/or reservoirs. The pump may be an axial piston pump with displacement of 135 cc/rev, according to embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0133">The low pressure side <b>700</b> of the pump/motor <b>104</b> is connected to a reservoir <b>701</b>, with sufficient capacity to supply operating fluid for the pump/motor and other circuits. Alternate embodiments include a mechanism to ensure fluid is supplied to the pump/motor <b>104</b> at pressures above atmospheric; such a mechanism may include, but is not limited to, low pressure accumulators, pressurized reservoirs, intensifiers, charge pumps, and the like. The reservoir may be vented to atmospheric pressure and may be approximately 30 gallons in capacity, according to embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0134">The high pressure side <b>702</b> of the pump/motor is in fluid communication with a valve <b>703</b>, which in turn is in fluid communication with one or more hydraulic storage devices, such as a bladder accumulator <b>704</b>, such that the valve <b>703</b> can selectively allow fluid to flow between the accumulator <b>704</b> and the pump <b>104</b> in the presence of a pressure differential. The valve <b>703</b> may be an electronically controlled two-position, two way solenoid valve made by Sun Hydraulics, but valves of a wide variety can be used including, but not limited to, poppet valves, spool valves, single stage valves, multi-stage valves, proportional valves, servovalves, digital valves, and the like, and the valves can be controlled electronically, pneumatically, hydraulically, mechanically, actively, passively, and the like, according to embodiments of the present invention. Similarly, other embodiments of the present invention use accumulators of various types including, but not limited to, piston accumulators, bladder accumulators, gas filled accumulators, weight biased accumulators, spring biased accumulators, steel accumulators, composite accumulators, and foam filled accumulators. One reasonably skilled in the art would recognize, based on the present disclosure, that a wide variety of valves, accumulators, pumps, hoses, reservoirs and other hydraulic components could be used with substantially the same functionality, and the examples given are for illustration purposes and are intended to be non-limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0135">The outlet of the pump/motor <b>104</b> is in fluid communication with a valve <b>706</b>; valve <b>706</b> is, in turn, in fluid communication with line <b>708</b>, which is, in turn, in fluid communication with the accumulator <b>704</b>, a second regulating valve <b>707</b> and valve <b>703</b>. Valve <b>706</b> may be an electronically controlled pressure regulating valve that can be used to limit the maximum pressure at the pump outlet <b>702</b> to a value that can be varied using an electronic controller, according to embodiments of the present invention. A relief valve is in fluid communication with line <b>708</b> and the reservoir and is used to limit the maximum pressure in line <b>708</b> and therefore the accumulator to maximum level. Any fluid vented by the relief valve <b>707</b> will return to the reservoir <b>701</b>. Valve <b>707</b> may be a manually set relief valve which operates to prevent the system from over pressurizing, according to embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0136">The outlet of the pump/motor may also be in fluid communication with a valve <b>705</b>, which is, in turn, also in fluid communication with the reservoir. Valve <b>705</b> may be used to unload the pump by allowing the output flow to return to the reservoir with minimal restriction.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0137">When the hydraulic hybrid system depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is in the &#x201c;idle&#x201d; mode, the pump/motor will be rotating backwards. When the transmission is in gear and the vehicle launch is desired, valve <b>705</b> is shut, and the displacement of the pump/motor is increased such that it will act as pump and pull fluid from the reservoir and pump it to the pump outlet <b>702</b>. The pressure at the pump outlet can be controlled in multiple ways. One method involves setting the regulation pressure of valve <b>706</b> to a maximum value and opening valve <b>703</b> to allow the pump outlet to be connected to the accumulator. In this case, the pressure at the pump outlet will be approximately equal to that of the accumulator. In this mode of operation, the fluid being pumped to create the torque reaction is being stored in the accumulator for use later. The pump/motor <b>104</b> torque can be controlled by controlling the displacement and/or the pressure at the pump outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0138">If the accumulator pressure is lower than desired to get maximum pump/motor torque, valves <b>703</b> and <b>705</b> can be shut and valve <b>706</b> can be used to adjust the pressure on the pump outlet. In this case some of the energy used to pump the fluid is still recovered unless the accumulator is at a pressure greater than that at which relief valve <b>707</b> is set.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0139">Once the vehicle has started the launch and the planetary is in the &#x201c;direct&#x201d; mode, the system can be used to absorb torque from the powertrain by adjusting the displacement of the pump/motor and opening valve <b>703</b> to recover the hydraulic energy into the accumulator. If greater retarding torque is desired, valve <b>703</b> can be shut and the pressure controlled by valve <b>706</b>. In this mode, the system operates similarly to most conventional hydraulic hybrids, with the exception being an option to restrict the pump outlet to raise the system pressure and increase braking torque. Similarly, the hydraulic energy stored in the accumulators can be used to assist the vehicle acceleration by opening valve <b>703</b> and controlling the pump/motor displacement. A neutral mode can be achieved by combinations of one or more of the following: setting the pump/motor <b>104</b> displacement to zero, shutting the valve <b>703</b> off, opening valve <b>705</b>, and/or disengaging the pump/motor from the planetary gearset using clutch <b>208</b>. In the charging, discharging, and neutral modes, the system functions similarly to a conventional parallel hydraulic hybrid.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0140">It is not necessary that an over-center pump is used, according to embodiments of the present invention. Instead, valving can be used to reverse the input and output of the pump/motor <b>140</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. illustrates a two-position, four-way valve <b>802</b> used to reverse the inlet and outlet plumbing on the pump/motor <b>104</b>. Similarly, two two-position, three-way valves or four two-position, two-way valves can be used to switch the inlet and the outlet of the pump. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> also illustrates that a plurality of accumulators can be used on the either the high pressure and/or the low pressure side according to embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0141">Alternate embodiments of the present invention utilize one or more of the following features: a charge pump to supercharge the pump/motor <b>101</b> inlet, a pressurized reservoir on the inlet to the pump/motor, one or more low pressure accumulators on the inlet to the pump/motor, a check valve to allow flow to recirculate from the low pressure side of the pump to the high pressure side, a pump for cooling and/or filtration and/or to control pressure, a control pressure circuit, a filtration circuit, relief valves, drain ports, case cooling, and a cooling circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates an embodiment in which a pair of two-way valves <b>900</b> and <b>901</b> are employed by the system. These valves allow the fluid from the pump outlet to circulate back to the tank by opening valve <b>900</b> and closing valve <b>901</b> if a high amount of pump torque is not desired. If a high pump torque is desired, valve <b>900</b> would be closed and valve <b>901</b> would be opened so that fluid from the pump outlet would flow to the high pressure accumulator <b>704</b>. If the two way valves used are normally open two way valves, when the vehicle is turned off and these valves are no longer powered, the high pressure accumulator will automatically empty into the sump or low pressure accumulator, according to embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0143"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates how a two-position, three-way valve <b>1000</b> can be used to direct the fluid flow from the pump outlet to the system tank/sump if little torque is desired from the pump <b>104</b>, or to direct the fluid flow from the pump outlet to the high pressure accumulator in the system if more torque is desired from the pump.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0144"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 through 16</figref> illustrate the speed profiles for the three different elements of the planetary gearset (sun gear, carrier and ring gear) when the vehicle is launching with constant engine speed according to embodiments of the present invention. The six figures correspond to six different configurations of connecting the three elements of the gearset to the pump/motor, the prime mover, and the output. The notation used for these figures consists of three letters, with the first letter corresponding to the element to which the pump/motor is coupled (directly or indirectly), the second letter corresponding to the element to which the prime mover is coupled (directly or indirectly), and the last letter indicating the element to which the transmission input or driveline is coupled (directly or indirectly), with &#x201c;S&#x201d; denoting the sun gear, &#x201c;C&#x201d; denoting the carrier, and &#x201c;R&#x201d; denoting the ring gear, according to embodiments of the present invention. Thus, a SRC system is one similar to that illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in which the pump/motor <b>104</b> is coupled to the sun gear <b>204</b>, the engine <b>100</b> is coupled to the ring gear <b>202</b>, and the carrier <b>203</b> is coupled to the transmission <b>102</b> input.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0145"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> illustrate speed profiles for two embodiments of the present invention in which the engine speed remains relatively constant while the pump/motor <b>104</b> starts at a negative speed and approaches zero due to the reaction torque created by pumping. The reaction torque of the pump/motor <b>104</b> allows torque from the prime mover <b>100</b> to be transmitted to the driveline, thereby accelerating the vehicle if the torque is high enough. Once the pump/motor speed approaches zero, the torque reaction will diminish, leaving several options to continue the launch. One method, described previously, consists of mechanically preventing the pump/motor <b>104</b> shaft from rotating backwards and utilizing the planetary gearset <b>101</b> for torque multiplication, while continuing to increase the engine speed and therefore bringing the transmission <b>102</b> input speed up. When desired, all of the elements in the planetary gearset <b>101</b> can be made to rotate in unison by engaging a clutch <b>207</b> that couples two or more elements of the gearset <b>101</b> together in a mechanical shift. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. According to other embodiments of the present invention, hydraulic pressure can be used to power the pump/motor <b>104</b> to continue to provide torque reaction and aid with the launch, or another gear ratio may be utilized in order to bring the vehicle speed up manually. This is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref>. When the pump/motor <b>104</b> is pumping fluid to create a reaction torque, the resulting hydraulic power can be stored in the accumulator and recovered at a later time.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0146"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> illustrate rotational speeds over time for two embodiments in which the hydraulic branch starts at a higher speed than that of the prime mover and the pump/motor is used to create a reaction torque to allow engine torque to be transmitted to the driveline and/or transmission. In these configurations, the pump/motor can be decelerated to speeds close enough to the other elements to allow a clutch to be engaged that couples two elements of the planetary system together and causes all of the elements to rotate in unison. The engine speed can be controlled during this time to affect the operation. According to some embodiments, the engine speed and the pump speed are both controlled with the elements operating at different speeds. This can be beneficial for maximizing fuel economy and/or minimizing emissions. These configurations can also be used to store energy while launching the vehicle and be used later to add that energy back into the system after launch.</p>

<p id="p-0105" num="0148"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a hydraulic hybrid system that employs multiple planetary gear sets to achieve multiple gear ratios and provide launch functionality, according to embodiments of the present invention. This embodiment employs a Simpson planetary gear set, in which the sun gear of the first gear set <b>2000</b> is mechanically coupled to the sun gear <b>2001</b> of the second gear set and the ring from the first gearset <b>2002</b> is mechanically coupled to the planetary carrier from the second gearset <b>2003</b>. The torque from the engine <b>100</b> is applied to the Simpson gearset via the ring on the second planetary gearset <b>2004</b>, the hydraulic pump/motor unit <b>104</b> is connected to the first gearset planetary carrier <b>2005</b>, and the transmission <b>102</b> is attached via the first ring <b>2002</b>. Other combinations of two or more gearsets may be used to both mix and multiply torques, in addition to the one shown here, according to embodiments of the present invention. According to some embodiments of the present invention, vehicle launch is achieved by allowing the hydraulic unit <b>104</b> to spin backwards and operating as a pump to slow the speed of the member <b>2006</b> towards zero. In this case, the one way, roller, or sprag clutch <b>2007</b> is locked but clutch <b>2008</b> is not engaged and the pump/motor <b>104</b> can spin backwards freely. While the speed of the hydraulic unit is reduced, the engine rotational speed is held constant with a closed loop speed controller and the reactions drive the output <b>2009</b> to an intermediate positive rotational velocity, according to embodiments of the present invention. The gearset may be selected in such a way to have an associated gear reduction for this mode. Once the hydraulic unit is slowed to near zero rotational velocity, clutch <b>2008</b> may be applied, preventing the velocity from becoming negative again. The Simpson gearset is now in its &#x201c;low&#x201d; mode and the engine speed, and hence the vehicle speed, may be increased to the appropriate level for the shift to the &#x201c;medium&#x201d; mode.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0149">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the &#x201c;medium&#x201d; mode is achieved by applying clutch <b>2010</b>. This will accelerate the hydraulic unit off of the one way clutch <b>2007</b> and fix the suns <b>2000</b> and <b>2001</b> to zero rotational velocity. This mode also provides a torque multiplication and speed reduction, but to a lesser extent than the &#x201c;low&#x201d; mode, hence the engine speed is dropped during the shifting event. Again, the engine and vehicle may be accelerated until the engine speed requires an additional shift event. In the current embodiment, a third mode that directly transmits rotation and torques can be achieved by releasing clutch <b>2010</b> and applying clutch <b>2011</b>. This clutch couples the sun gears <b>2000</b> and <b>2001</b> to the second ring <b>2004</b>, thereby locking the entire Simpson gearset to rotate as one unit. A similar result can be achieved by locking other members of the gearset together to provide direct drive. This &#x201c;direct drive&#x201d; mode essentially couples the hydraulic unit directly to the engine and the transmission, providing for multiple modes of operation including both hybrid and non-hybrid modes. With the gearset locked in the medium or direct drive mode, the hydraulic unit can be used as either as a pump or motor for regenerative braking and hydraulic assist. The hydraulic unit may be hard coupled to the first planetary carrier <b>2005</b> or selectively coupled through a clutch to remove the unit from the system. According to embodiments of the present invention, a system has a direct drive mode and one or more overdrive modes.</p>

The launch mode <b>2100</b> shows how the hydraulic unit <b>104</b> is slowed to zero speed and transitions into the low mode <b>2101</b>. Next, a shift <b>2102</b> switches to medium mode <b>2103</b>, and lastly, a second shift <b>2104</b> makes the unit rotate together in a direct drive mode <b>2105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0152">The dynamics involved with shifting ratios in a vehicle can cause vibrations in the powertrain and driveline that are both undesirable from a driver or passenger comfort viewpoint and can be detrimental to the hardware. Because of this, it is not uncommon for vehicles with lock up torque converter clutches (TCC) to unlock, or partially unlock, the TCC and allow the fluid coupling and/or slipping TCC to attenuate the vibrations when shifting. Similarly, the TCC in torque converters and clutch discs in manual transmission systems and automatically shifted manual transmissions, and couplings in CVTs, usually include a torsional damper or some other mechanism to attenuate driveline vibrations. As previously mentioned, a wide variety of devices are used for this in conventional applications and are applicable to embodiments of the present invention as well.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0153">Many powertrain control system algorithms employ engine management strategies which alter the torque of the engine when a shift is being performed, and those control methods may be employed with embodiments of the present invention. These engine and transmission systems may be integrated into the same controller, or multiple controllers, and may communicate with each other in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, serial buses, dedicated wires, wireless communications, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0154">According to embodiments of the present invention, one or more of the clutches associated with the mixing planetary gearset in the hybrid system and/or the transmission if a separate system, can be controlled to affect the disturbance created by a shift and/or affect how much of that disturbance will be transmitted to the rest of the driveline and powertrain. Additionally, in retrofit applications, it may be advantageous to communicate with the transmission and/or powertrain controller to adjust or disable diagnostics or parameters that could be affected by the hybrid system.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0155"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> represents a graph of the speeds of the different elements of the gearset as a function of time when the transmission is undergoing a typical shift such as from 1<sup>st </sup>gear to 2<sup>nd </sup>gear, or from 2<sup>nd </sup>gear to 3<sup>rd</sup>, for example. According to embodiments of the present invention, clutch <b>207</b> can be released for a brief instance, perhaps 200-1000 msec, to allow the pump/motor <b>101</b>, to accelerate and smooth out the shift. By controlling the speed and pressures on the pump and/or the torque capacity of the clutch <b>207</b>, the torque disturbance of the shift and therefore the loads generated can be attenuated.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0156">According to embodiments of the present invention, the hydraulic hybrid system can be used to for &#x201c;stop-start&#x201d; applications where the prime mover is shut off for periods of time. In one mode of &#x201c;stop-start&#x201d; operation, the input to the transmission can be prevented from rotating in multiple ways by applying multiple clutches to mechanically lock or &#x201c;bind up&#x201d; the transmission so that it cannot rotate, by applying a brake and/or clutch that couples the input shaft to the ground and having the transmission in gear, and/or by applying a parking brake or other means to prevent the drive wheels from rotating, according to embodiments of the present invention. Once the input shaft to the transmission is prevented from rotating, torque from the pump/motor can be used to rotate the engine and start it. According to other embodiments, the vehicle inertia can be high enough such that, if the vehicle is in gear, the engine will rotate with less resistance and start when torque is supplied by the pump/motor. In other situations, an electric starter can be used to start the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0157">According to other embodiments of the present invention, when the engine has been stopped it can be prevented from rotating in various ways, including the non-limiting example of a clutch or brake attached to the engine shaft that grounds the engine shaft to the block. Once the engine shaft is prevented from rotating, the hydraulic pump/motor can be used to propel the vehicle forward using stored hydraulic fluid, and can be used to recover braking energy slowing the vehicle down.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0158">According to some embodiments of the present invention, this arrangement would allow a vehicle to decelerate from speed with the engine off using the hydraulic pump/motor to recover the kinetic energy of the vehicle and store it in the accumulators. If the vehicle needs to move around or creep, the hydraulic power is available to do that using the hydraulic pump/motor with the prime mover off. Furthermore, if auxiliary hydraulic loads are required, they can be provided for using the stored energy without turning the engine on. It is possible to accelerate the vehicle and/or start the engine using the stored hydraulic power.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0159">Hydraulic control fluid for the clutches can come from a variety of sources including one or more of the following non-limiting examples: an engine driven pump, a transmission input shaft driven pump, a transmission output shaft driven pump, an electrically driven pump, an accumulator, a pressurized reservoir, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0160">According to embodiments of the present invention, the gearset <b>101</b> can be of designs other than a planetary or epicyclic, yet perform similar functionality in which the speed of one element is a function of two or more other elements. For example, a differential in which the pump/motor, prime mover and transmission input can be connected to the two side gears and the differential housing, in a variety of configurations, may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0161">According to embodiments of the present invention, various mechanisms can be used to couple the pump to the gearset which is also coupled with the engine or prime mover. Examples of this include, but are not limited to, metal chains, polymer chains and/or belts, sprockets, gears, shafts and hydraulic systems. Furthermore, the coupling <b>105</b> may be of fixed or variable ratio design such as a continuously variable transmission, a hydrostatic transmission, electric motor/generator set, and the like. Based on the disclosure provided herein, one skilled in the art will appreciate the numerous other methods to transfer the torque between the planetary gearset and the pump/motor.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0162">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the system may incorporate a torque converter and the gear set may be located between the torque converter output (turbine) and the input to the transmission or driveline. In other embodiments, the planetary gear set may be located between the output of the engine and the input to the torque converter (pump). Other embodiments of the present invention are used in conjunction with a manual type transmission that may, or may not, be automatically shifted. In these embodiments, the gearset may be located between the engine output and the input to the one or more clutches used to selectively couple the engine torque to the transmission, and in other embodiments the gearset is located between one or more of the clutches and the transmission input. Still other embodiments of the present invention may be used with other powertrain configurations including, but not limited to, a CVT, a transfer case, no fixed ratio transmission, a single reduction ratio, a differential and a direct drive. In all of these examples, the gearset may be located between the engine and any driveline damper assembly or between the driveline damper assembly and the downstream driveline.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0163">According to embodiments of the present invention, the electronic controls for the clutches, valves, sensors or any other components that can be sensed, actuated or used in the control of the system can be coordinated with other control algorithms in the vehicle, including but not limited to, the engine controller, the transmission controller, anti-lock brake controller, vehicle dynamics controller, and the like. Coordination and communication of the various control algorithms can be accomplished in a variety of ways including the non-limiting examples of integrating the control algorithms into the same controller or using multiple controllers that communicate with each other in a variety of ways, including but not limited to serial buses, dedicated wires, wireless communications and the like. Based on the disclosure provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize the many different ways to coordinate a plurality of control algorithms to achieve the desired result, and the examples listed are intended to be non-limiting. In cases where a torque converter is used and contains a TCC, it can be advantageous to take control of the TCC and this can be done using the methods outlined above, and/or by having the hybrid controller control the actuation of the TCC directly.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0164">Embodiments of the present invention integrate a through-shaft pump/motor, or pump/motor with through-shaft functionality, with a gear set that allows torque multiplication between the pump/motor and the through-shaft. Some embodiments also permit the torque multiplication ratio to be changed between more than one ratio. Some embodiments of the present invention effectively decouple the pump/motor from the system such that there are few, if any, parasitic losses when the system is not engaged. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the elements for pump/motor functionality, the elements for through-shaft functionality, and any other elements are packaged within a common housing. According to other embodiments of the present invention, some or all of the valving and other hydraulic elements are also situated within the common housing.

<p id="p-0123" num="0166"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> illustrates a vehicle powertrain that utilizes an input coupled, torque split hydraulic hybrid transmission according to some embodiments of the present invention. The system is comprised of the prime mover or engine <b>7101</b>, which transmits power to an input shaft <b>7103</b> through torsional damper <b>7102</b>. The damper <b>7102</b> is used to attenuate vibrations generated by the engine firing events from by the rest of the powertrain. The damper <b>7102</b> may be comprised of one or more of: helical springs and friction elements, viscous coupling elements, dual mass flywheels, friction elements designed to have some slippage, active elements that control the amount of friction between the input and the output, special lubricants and/or friction modifiers. The damper <b>7102</b> may also be in a predominantly dry environment or may be immersed or in regular contact with a lubricating or working fluid such as automatic transmission fluid, hydraulic fluid, engine operating oil, or the like. In some cases, no damper assembly <b>7102</b> is present, and the engine output is instead coupled directly to the input shaft <b>7103</b> or to the input shaft <b>7103</b> through a clutch (not shown). Elimination of the damper assembly <b>7102</b> may lead to increased vibrations in certain operating modes.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0167">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the input shaft <b>7103</b> is coupled to the input of a planetary gear set <b>7112</b> either directly via shaft <b>7105</b>, or through a clutch (not shown) or through a gear set, planetary gear train, belt drive, chain drive, or other mechanism <b>7106</b> capable of magnifying or reducing the speed ratio between the input and output shaft <b>7105</b>.

<p id="p-0125" num="0168">According to some embodiments of the present invention, a planetary gear set <b>7112</b> or the like is used to couple some or all of the power to, or from, the engine <b>7101</b> being transmitted via shaft <b>7105</b> and power transmitted to, or from, the hydrostat via chain, gear set, or other means <b>7111</b>, and the connection <b>7113</b> between the gear set <b>7112</b> and the transmission or other gear set <b>7114</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0169">The power carried in the hydraulic branch <b>7107</b> is carried into the hydrostat <b>7108</b>. Within the hydrostat, power is carried into a first hydraulic pump/motor <b>7109</b> which in one embodiment may be an axial piston pump/motor, but many other types of positive displacement pumps could be used. Through a series of pipes and valves not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, power flows through a second hydraulic pump/motor <b>7110</b> in the hydrostat, which also can also be an axial piston pump/motor, or other positive displacement pump/motors. Power at the output of the hydrostat is carried through a gear ratio, or other form of torque reduction or amplification <b>7111</b> and into one of the three elements (sun, ring, planet carrier) of a simple planetary gear <b>7112</b>. Gear ratio <b>7111</b> can be a sprocket and chain or belt, a planetary gear, or spur gears, for example. At the planetary <b>7112</b> the mechanical branch <b>7105</b> and the hydraulic branch <b>7107</b> are recombined by attaching one element in the planetary to the mechanical branch, one element to the hydraulic branch, and the third element to the output shaft <b>7113</b>. During steady state operation, the torque carried on each branch is defined by the torque carried by the output and by the geometry of the planetary gear. The speeds of two elements in the planetary may be used to determine the speed of the third element, according to embodiments of the present invention. The output shaft <b>7113</b> is also the input shaft to the gear ratio <b>7114</b> or other mechanism to reduce or amplify the speed and torque, which may be a single gear ratio or a gear box containing several gears. Finally, the power is transmitted to the output <b>7115</b>. The output is the driveshaft or a connection to the transmission to the vehicle, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0170">During the process of launching the vehicle it may be desirable to regulate the torque and/or the speed of the engine such that the torque created in the hydraulic branch and the mechanical branch are in correct proportions. Similarly, the torque generated in the pump/motor <b>7110</b> and the torque of the engine <b>7101</b> may be controlled, according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0171">To achieve launch, fluid may be pumped through the second hydraulic pump/motor <b>7110</b> to the relief valve <b>7708</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. As the fluid flows through the relief valve <b>7708</b>, the high pressure accumulator <b>7706</b> begins to fill. This system allows the high pressure fluid to be stored for later use in assisting the vehicle launch. In this case, some of the power that would normally be lost in a torque converter or mechanical clutch launch is captured for later use. Once the high pressure accumulator is filled to its maximum pressure, fluid begins to flow over the relief valve <b>7709</b> back to the low pressure accumulator <b>7710</b>. Additional valving (not shown) may be employed to route fluid from the relief valve <b>7708</b> back to the inlet side of the pump/motor <b>7110</b>, which is connected to the low pressure accumulator <b>7710</b> in this embodiment, rather than the high pressure accumulator <b>7706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0172">The flow restriction <b>7708</b> creates the torque in the pump/motor <b>7110</b> by restricting the output flow and can be created through any sort of restriction device such as a valve or an orifice. If the pressure in the accumulator is sufficiently high, there may be no need to restrict the fluid through the pump/motor device, but the output flow of the pump can be routed directly to the high pressure accumulator <b>7706</b>. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the flow can be routed through valves <b>7704</b> and <b>7705</b>, where pressure is developed as the volume of hydraulic fluid increases in the accumulator. According to other embodiments of the present invention, the output of the pressure relief valve <b>7708</b> is plumbed directly back to the low pressure side rather than to the high pressure accumulator <b>7706</b>.</p>

In some embodiments, the shaft <b>5103</b> is coupled at end <b>5104</b> to a source of torque such as, but not limited to, the output of a transmission, transfer case, engine, torque converter, or other prime mover or power transmission device. In certain modes of operation these devices may absorb torque from the shaft <b>5103</b>, and in other modes no torque is transmitted at all.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0175">The device also has another shaft end <b>5105</b> that is connected to a load device such as, but not limited to, the input of a differential, transmission, transfer case, torque converter, or other power transmission device. In certain modes of operation these devices may supply torque to the shaft <b>5103</b>, and in other modes no torque is transmitted at all.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0176">The shaft <b>5103</b> may be continuous and of such design that substantial amounts of torque can be transmitted from end <b>5104</b> to end <b>5105</b> and vice-versa. In some embodiments of the present invention, this shaft handles as much, if not more, torque than the original driveshaft of the system. Alternatively, the shaft may be made of multiple pieces, but have operational modes in which it acts as one common shaft, such that large amounts of torque can be transmitted between end <b>5104</b> and <b>5105</b> and vice-versa.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0177">In certain embodiments, the gear train is comprised of an epicyclic, or planetary, gear set <b>5102</b> that is comprised of a sun gear <b>5106</b>, one or more planet gears <b>5107</b>, a planet carrier <b>5108</b>, and a ring gear <b>5109</b>. According to some embodiments of the present invention, one of the members (sun gear, carrier or ring gear) of the epicyclic gear set may be coupled directly to, or be part of, the pump/motor such that the pump/motor <b>5101</b> and the element rotate together as one unit and torque is readily passed back and forth between the two. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, the sun gear <b>5106</b> is connected to the pump/motor <b>5101</b> via connection <b>5111</b>. Connection <b>5111</b> may take on many forms and may be, but is not limited to, a solid shaft, a coupling, a spline, extra material, a dog clutch, or a hollow shaft of dimensions that would permit shaft <b>5103</b> to pass through the inside dimensions of it with little if any contact between the two.

The ring gear <b>5109</b> is coupled to the shaft <b>5103</b>, which is indicated by <b>5112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, such that the torque of the ring gear can be transmitted between the ring gear and shaft in both directions.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0179">In one mode of operation the pump/motor receives high pressure fluid and operates as a hydraulic motor. In this case the torque of the pump/motor <b>5101</b> is transmitted through connection <b>5111</b> to the sun gear <b>5106</b>. The torque applied to the sun gear <b>5106</b> is reacted by the planetary gears <b>5107</b> which is, in turn, reacted by the ring gear <b>5109</b> which is attached to the output shaft <b>5103</b>, such that large amounts of torque can be transmitted between the two. In this embodiment, the carrier <b>5108</b> is prevented from rotating by the reaction <b>5110</b> causing the ring gear <b>5109</b> to rotate. This arrangement results in the torque output from the pump/motor <b>5101</b> being multiplied by the gear train <b>5102</b> to provide a larger torque input at lower speed to shaft <b>5103</b>, according to embodiments of the present invention.</p>

According to embodiments of the present invention, the sun gear <b>5322</b> transmits torque to and from one or more planet gears <b>5323</b>, which have reactions from the ring gear <b>5325</b> and the planet carrier <b>5324</b>, which is coupled to, or is part of, the shaft <b>5302</b> such that the two do not rotate appreciably relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0188">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the ring gear <b>5325</b> is coupled to the housing such that it cannot rotate appreciably relative to it (e.g. such that the ring gear <b>5325</b> is substantially prevented or inhibited from rotating with respect to the housing). In some embodiments, the ring gear <b>5325</b> is always prevented from rotating, and in other embodiments the ring gear <b>5325</b> may be selectively allowed to rotate to effectively decouple the transfer of torque between the pump/motor and the shaft <b>5303</b>. Many different members can be used to function as a clutch and selectively couple the torque between the ring gear <b>5325</b> and the housing <b>5301</b>, including, but not limited to, wet plate clutches, dog clutches, dog clutches with synchronizers, synchronizers, dry clutches, band brakes, pins that engage both the ground and the ring gear, cone clutches, disc brakes, electromagnetic brakes, and other functionally equivalent or similar devices recognized by one of ordinary skill in the art, based on the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0189"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention. A shaft <b>5200</b> is mounted in a multi-piece housing <b>5252</b> and is supported by bearings <b>5202</b> and <b>5203</b> such that it can rotate freely. A pump barrel <b>5204</b> rotates on bearing <b>5262</b> which in turn rotates upon the shaft <b>5200</b>. The pump barrel has a plurality of pistons <b>5205</b> that can translate in and out of the bores in the cylinder barrel. The pistons have shoes <b>5272</b> that slide upon the swash plate <b>5282</b>. The barrel is contact with a valve plate <b>5206</b> that contacts the end housing <b>5292</b> that has ports <b>5207</b> in it. The angle of the swashplate is controlled by pistons <b>5208</b>. The assembly incorporates a valve body <b>5211</b> that is contained inside the pan <b>5209</b>. The high flow area pickup <b>5210</b> is used to draw fluid from the pan and into the main pump. The small pickup <b>5211</b> is used to pick up oil for the smaller control pressure circuit pump <b>6201</b> that pulls the fluid up through pickup <b>5213</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0190">The shaft <b>5200</b> is splined to accept a carrier <b>5214</b> that has planet gears that rotate on the carrier pins and remain in contact with the sun gear <b>5216</b> and the ring gear <b>5215</b>. Clutch <b>5217</b> is used to couple the ring gear to the housing and provide a reaction torque for the system. The clutch is actuated by hydraulic fluid acting on piston <b>5218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0191">According to embodiments of the present invention the clutch <b>5217</b> can be engaged to couple the ring gear to the housing and thereby create a reaction torque allowing the torque generated by the pump be multiplied and transmitted to the shaft <b>5200</b>. Disengaging the clutch allows the driveline to be uncoupled from the hydraulic pump/motor.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0192"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of an integrated system, according to embodiments of the present invention. According to some embodiments of the present invention, a cylinder block <b>5401</b> is coupled to a sun gear <b>5406</b> which is in turn in mesh with one or more planet gears <b>5407</b> that also mesh with ring gear <b>5409</b>. The planet gears are coupled with carrier <b>5408</b> which is coupled to the shaft <b>5403</b>. According to some embodiments of the present invention, a multi-plate wet clutch <b>5413</b> couples the ring gear <b>5409</b> with the housing <b>5411</b> and is actuated by a hydraulic piston <b>5412</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0193"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref> illustrates a system that uses a dog clutch <b>5501</b>, which may include a synchronizer, to couple the sun gear <b>5506</b> to the cylinder block <b>5502</b>, according to embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0194"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref> illustrates a system that is comprised of two clutches that provide for multispeed gear box operation, according to embodiments of the present invention. In this embodiment, a first clutch <b>5610</b> is used to selectively provide a torque reaction to the ring gear <b>5609</b> such that a torque multiplication between the pump/motor <b>5101</b> and the shaft <b>5103</b> can be realized. During this mode of operation, a second clutch <b>5615</b> is released. In a second mode of operation the first clutch <b>5610</b> is released and the second clutch <b>5615</b> is applied thereby coupling the shaft <b>5103</b> to sun gear <b>5614</b>, which is coupled to the pump/motor <b>5101</b> by connection <b>5611</b>. When both of the clutches <b>5610</b>, <b>5615</b> are released, no appreciable torque is transmitted between the pump/motor <b>5101</b> and the shaft <b>5103</b>. The advantages of such a system include its ability to be used for a wider range of vehicle speeds.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0195"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is a state diagram for the system described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0196"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the present invention that is comprised of two clutches and a one-way clutch. Similar to the system described with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28</figref>, the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref> provides for multi speed operation. The addition of the one way clutch <b>5713</b> constrains the ring gear to rotate in one direction. In one mode of operation the system is started with clutch <b>5710</b> disengaged. If torque is being generated by the pump/motor that will tend to assist the vehicle acceleration, there will be a torque reaction against the one way clutch that will prevent the ring from rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0197">When it is desired to reduce the pump/motor <b>5101</b> speed by operating the gearbox in a direct drive mode, this can be accomplished by simply applying the second clutch <b>5715</b> and the one way clutch will allow the ring gear to rotate in the same direction as the input. Similarly, if the system speed is being reduced and it is desired to operate the system with a reduction gear ratio, then the second clutch <b>5715</b> can simply be released and the one way clutch will reengage as the ring gear tries to rotate in the other direction. Such a configuration makes shifts up and down much simpler and consequently of higher quality feel in most cases.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0198">If it is desired to operate the system in the reduction ratio and absorb power from the vehicle, the first clutch <b>5710</b> may be applied in parallel to the one way clutch <b>5713</b>. This permits reversal of torque, to permit the pump/motor to be used to absorb power from the vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0199"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> is a state diagram for the system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0200"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 32</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of a system in which a band brake <b>6102</b> is used to prevent the ring gear <b>6101</b> from rotating appreciably relative to the housing, according to embodiments of the present invention. A band brake may also be used in any of the other systems described herein, to substantially prevent an element of the gear train from rotating relative to the housing.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0201">There are other gear train types, and power transmitting devices, that can be used to modify the torque and speed of the pump/motor before it is connected to the shaft. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 33</figref> illustrates an embodiment according to which a pair of spur or helical gears are used to connect the pump/motor <b>6403</b> with the shaft <b>6401</b>. Based on the disclosure provided herein, one of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate the many different combinations of types of gears used, numbers of gears used, sizes and pitches of the gears used and combinations of how the gears may be arranged, and those shown and discussed herein are exemplary and non-limiting.</p>

Examples include, but are not limited to, chains used in front wheel drive automatic transmission or transfer case, one non-limiting example being the &#x201c;Silent Chain&#x201d; product made by Ramesy, or the Poly chain GT carbon belts made by Gates.

<p id="p-0160" num="0203">According to some embodiments of the present invention, the system can be designed such that it can readily couple to the output of a transmission or transfer case. This functionality includes significant packaging advantages and may eliminate the need for one driveshaft. The housing according to some embodiments of the present invention may be configured to interface with a transmission or transfer case and bolt directly to it, for example.</p>
