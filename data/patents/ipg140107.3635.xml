<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Magnetic inductors and transformers are often the bulkiest, costliest, and most inefficient components in a power system. These components can limit the size and performance of a power system, and thus a larger system as a whole. In mobile, wireless, or autonomous devices, size and efficiency play an even more prominent role. For example, the power supply of an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) limits both mission duration and useful payload. Additionally, many consumer electronic devices demand small, efficient power supplies to enhance mobility and useful lifespan between battery recharging/replacement. Since most existing portable systems rely on dc primary power sources (such as batteries, fuel cells, and solar cells), switch-mode dc:dc power converters are commonly used to step up or down the voltage levels for various electronic subsystems. Thus, size reduction of these circuits is critical to enhance mobility and stealth.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">To deliver clean, stable voltages from relatively unstable sources such as batteries or energy harvesting devices, switch-mode dc:dc power converters currently provide the highest power conversion efficiency, typically 80-95%, in the smallest form factor (dimensions). These converters employ solid-state switches (transistors and diodes) and passive energy storage elements (inductors or capacitors) to temporarily store energy from the input and then deliver the stored energy to the output at a different voltage. A standard switched-inductor boost converter is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the converter includes a transistor switch S<sub>1</sub>, a diode D<sub>1</sub>, an inductor L<sub>1</sub>, and a capacitor C<sub>1</sub>. When the transistor switch S<sub>1 </sub>is closed, magnetic energy builds in the inductor L<sub>1</sub>; when the switch S<sub>1 </sub>is opened, that energy is dumped onto the load R<sub>L</sub>. The diode D<sub>1 </sub>is used to prevent current backflow, and the capacitor C<sub>1 </sub>smoothes the ripple on the load R<sub>L</sub>. The output load voltage V<sub>0 </sub>is controlled by the percentage of time that the switch S<sub>1 </sub>is closed (i.e. the duty cycle). Standard switching speeds for commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) power converters are currently in the 100 kHz-10 MHz range.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The size and efficiency of switch-mode dc:dc converters are currently limited by the required passive components (inductors/capacitors). While the physics of semiconductor devices have enabled extreme size-reduction of solid-state devices (i.e. Moore's Law), electrical passive elements have not benefited from the same favorable scaling. Currently the silicon electronics of a dc:dc converter can be made much smaller than the required passives, which must be capable of storing a certain amount of energy. Thus, while small power IC chips are commercially available, off-chip inductors and capacitors are typically required to realize a functional power converter. For example, one related art silicon-based dc:dc buck regulator is available with a co-packaged inductor in a 3&#xd7;3&#xd7;1.1 mm<sup>3 </sup>package. However, the inductor dominates the package volume, and the two external capacitors used for this regulator doubles the total solution volume/mass.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">To enable physically smaller passive elements, the switching frequency of the electronics can be increased. Higher switching frequencies can be used to reduce the physical size of the passive elements, since less energy must be stored per cycle to maintain the same energy transfer rate (power) at higher switching speeds. However, higher switching frequencies lead to higher power losses in both the electronics and the passive elements, and thus lower overall efficiencies. For example, with current technologies, frequencies in excess of 10-100 MHz are required to enable the passive elements to shrink to a size comparable to that of the silicon-based IC portion. At these frequencies, transistor switching losses begin to limit the overall efficiency. Additionally, frequency-dependent power losses in magnetic materials present roadblocks for realizing high-Q inductors, which again limits efficiency. Thus, existing size and performance limitations of electrical passive elements inhibit the realization of single-chip power converter solutions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To meet the needs for fully-integrated power converter solutions, both energy density and process integrability must be addressed. Monolithic integration (fabrication of passive elements directly on the silicon) or co-packaging (interconnecting separate passive and silicon components within a package) are of equal interest, so long as high performance is achieved with small mass and volume. Accordingly, research is being conducted to achieve sufficient inductance and capacitance in a small enough form factor to enable for integration with the silicon electronics.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Researchers are actively exploring new materials and micro/nanofabrication solutions for achieving high-energy-density, low-loss inductors and capacitors. For capacitors, much attention has been focused on high-permittivity dielectrics, nanoscale dielectric gaps, and/or high-surface-area electrodes to increase the net capacitance. For example, deep trenches in silicon are being explored to increase capacitance density.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For inductors, however, there continues to be difficulties in achieving both the high inductances and high quality factors used to maintain overall converter efficiency. High permeability soft magnetic cores have attracted the most attention as means for increasing the inductance density, since the inductance ideally scales proportional with the relative permeability. While suitable magnetic films have exhibited relative permeabilities of 200-1000 in the MHz range, actual microfabricated inductors have not attained such a performance gain. This shortfall has been attributed to geometric demagnetization effects, surface defects that inhibit domain wall motion, and the difficulties in achieving fully-closed magnetic cores.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For inductors, the quality factor (the ratio of energy stored to energy lost per cycle, where Q=&#x3c9;L/R) presents another major design challenge. In microscale inductors, thick electroplated coil windings are used to mitigate conduction losses, but the use of magnetic materials introduces additional power loss mechanisms, including hysteresis, eddy current, and excess loss in the magnetic cores. This additional loss is weighed against the inductance benefit offered by the magnetic core when designing the inductor. In particular, if a magnetic core introduces more energy loss than energy storage, the Q will be less than that of an air core.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The use of magnetic cores becomes more challenging as the switching frequency is increased because the magnetic eddy current losses scale quadratically with frequency. For example, one microfabricated high-inductance-density inductor using high permeability soft magnetic cores exhibited a maximum Q of only 8 at 40 MHz. For comparison, small surface-mount air-core inductors commonly used in power converter circuits typically have Q's in excess of 100. Thus, there exists a need in the art for inductor structures that exhibit high inductance density and high Q.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">An embodiment of the present invention provides devices and systems for power electronic circuits. Embodiments of the present invention enable high density inductive energy storage by using electromechanical coupling between an electrically conducting inductive element and a mechanical resonator to passively store energy via both electromagnetic and mechanical mechanisms. As opposed to traditional magnetic core inductors, ultra high energy density and high Q are achieved in devices according to embodiments of the present invention via kinetic energy storage, thus avoiding the magnetic loss mechanisms and efficiency penalties associated with magnetic cores. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, the beneficial energy storage occurs over a limited frequency range, near the coupled system resonance. For switch-mode power converters, this is acceptable because switch-mode power converter circuits tend to operate at a constant switching frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one embodiment, a resonating inductor element is provided. The subject inductor can be achieved through electromechanical energy storage elements. In a further embodiment, the subject inductor can enhance the performance and reduce the size/mass of switch-mode dc:dc power supplies for small-scale (&#x3c;100 W) power systems. In yet a further embodiment, the subject inductor can be designed to exhibit extreme inductance density (&#x3e;100 &#x3bc;H/mm<sup>2</sup>) and low loss in the 50 kHz-50 MHz range. Applications of the subject inductors include ultra-miniaturized, single-chip power converters with order-of-magnitude size/mass reduction compared to the existing state-of-the art.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In a further embodiment, a resonating transformer element is provided. The subject transformer can be achieved through a combination of a resonating inductor element having electromechanical energy storage elements and a second coil in which a voltage is induced by the resonating inductor element.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The subject devices can be manufactured via bulk microfabrication, augmenting existing micro-inductor process technologies. This enables co-integration or co-fabrication with silicon power IC's. Moreover, by appropriate design and material selection, the system resonance can be tuned from the low kHz to high MHz range or possibly higher.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Electromagnetic energy (electric and magnetic energy) storage is well understood and ubiquitously employed for electrical inductors and capacitors. Potential energy storage via an electric field is generally limited by the dielectric strength of the dielectric material; similarly, kinetic energy storage via magnetic fields is usually limited by the saturation of magnetic materials. In practice, these theoretical energy density limits can often be achieved because of the relative ease of creating strong electric and magnetic fields.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In contrast, mechanical energy (strain and inertial energy) storage of electrical energy is not as widespread, despite its potential for higher energy densities. Similar to electromagnetic energy storage, the theoretical limits of mechanical energy storage are limited by material properties, such as the yield or fracture strength. One challenge for mechanical energy storage is achieving large strain/inertial energy uniformly throughout a material volume. Uniaxial loading can be used to impart unifoini strain, but this usually requires large forces. Alternatively, bending or torsion can be used to concentrate the strain in a small region of the total material volume. Regardless of the approach, if even a small fraction of the theoretical energy density limits can be reached, there exists the possibility for very large energy storage.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While mechanical energy storage may not be practical for addressing many macroscale energy storage problems that require large amounts of energy storage for long durations of time, mechanical storage can be used to address problems involving small storage systems in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. For example, switching power converters involve small storage problems (the magnitude of energy is usually small) and the energy storage is periodic at a known cyclical frequency. Accordingly, the incorporation of mechanical energy storage in accordance with the invention can be used to address the needs of switching power converter.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to an embodiment, electromechanical devices are provided that employ magnetic energy storage plus strain energy storage. In one embodiment, a resonating inductor can be provided by a combination conductor and magnet. The subject electromechanical device can be configured as a microelectromechanical inductor (MEMI).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The self-inductance (L) of an inductor is given by the ratio of magnetic flux linkage (number of coil terms (N) times magnetic flux (&#x3a6;)) and input current (i), L=N&#x3a6;/i. In a standard inductor, current flows in the coil, and the resulting magnetic flux is dependent on the magnetic properties of the materials comprising the core. In contrast, embodiments of the present invention incorporate a resonating inductor. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> show a planar and cross-sectional view, respectively, of a resonating inductor in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The resonating inductor includes a conductor and magnet. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, magnetic material <b>100</b> can be arranged to move with respect to a planar spiral coil <b>120</b>, which functions as the conductor. A spring <b>115</b> or compliant mechanism can be used to allow movement of the magnetic material <b>100</b>. According to one implementation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, the magnetic material <b>100</b> sits on a compliant layer <b>110</b> at the center of a planar spiral coil <b>120</b>. The compliant layer <b>110</b> can include an elastomer such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). In another embodiment, the compliant layer <b>110</b> includes carbon nanotubes. According to another implementation as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, the magnetic material <b>100</b> is fixed to a flexure <b>105</b> (or beam) and disposed over the coil <b>120</b>. The flexure <b>105</b> (or beam) can extend from a sidewall as a cantilever.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In operation, when current flows in the coil <b>120</b>, a magnetic force attracts or repels the magnetic material <b>100</b>, depending on the direction of current. The resulting motion acts to increase or decrease the flux in the coil <b>120</b>, resulting in an apparent boost in inductance. The displacement may conform to x=x<sub>0 </sub>cos(&#x3c9;t). Moreover, if the current is cycled near the resonant frequency of the mechanical resonator, large displacements will occur (proportional to the mechanical Q), resulting in a very large inductance boost. In certain embodiments, the magnetic material includes ferrite, NdFeB, SmCo, Alnico, Fe alloys, Co alloys, or Ni alloys. In a specific embodiment, the magnetic material <b>100</b> can be a permanent magnet. When using a permanent magnet, the magnet magnetization remains effectively fixed, and there are no major magnetic losses. However, embodiments are not limited to permanent magnets. For example, the magnetic material <b>100</b> can include a soft magnet.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Though <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2D</figref> depict a single-layer spiral coil and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> depicts the magnet sitting atop a compliant layer, embodiments are not limited thereto. For example, one or more magnets can be fixed on a substrate, and the coil can be permitted to move (see e.g., <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</figref>, <b>11</b>B, and <b>12</b>). In another embodiment, different winding patterns can be utilized for the conductor instead of a spiral coil winding pattern. In addition, the conductor can be provided having no winding patterns. For example, a conductor having a straight, curved, or staggered shape can be used in place of the coil. According to embodiments, the conductor can be of any material capable of creating a magnetic field to interact with the magnetic material.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In further embodiments, flexures can be used to enable translational or rotational vibration modes between the magnet and conductor. Additionally, high strain-density materials, such as carbon nanotubes can be integrated in the device.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The coupled system dynamics can be modeled to first-order using lumped electromechanical analysis tools. An equivalent circuit representing the system behavior is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The electrical side contains the electrical coil resistance (R) and inductance (L). The mechanical side contains an RLC-network representing the effective mass (m), compliance (1/k) and damping (b) of the mechanical resonator. The two energy domains are coupled using an electrical gyrator (G) that models the electrodynamic coupling between the magnet <b>100</b> and coil <b>120</b>. Equation (1) below provides the total impedance (Z<sub>tot</sub>) of the system.</p>

<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an example plot of the predicted inductance and Q-factor for one concept resonating inductor design, such as a MEMI with a 100 &#x3bc;m&#xd7;100 &#x3bc;m footprint. The data indicates increasing perfoimance vs. frequency, with a sharp electromechanical resonance at 91.9 kHz. Just below the resonance, an inductance of 2 &#x3bc;H is observed with Q=1.5. Just above the resonance, the electrical load becomes capacitive, but above 93 kHz, it is again inductive. The data indicates a 500&#xd7; boost over the low-frequency inductance of 4 nH. The inductance density of &#x3e;200 &#x3bc;H/mm<sup>2 </sup>represents a two order-of-magnitude improvement over the state-of-the-art. The relatively low Q is a consequence of the modest operating frequency and limited electromechanical coupling. Higher Q's are possible by optimizing the design. It should be noted that the results presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> are for illustrative purposes and should not be construed as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Devices in accordance with embodiments of the present invention can be fabricated to provide microscale structures capable of integration with silicon electronics. The microfabrication can provide physical dimensions at a size enabling high-Q mechanical structures with resonant frequencies in the kHz-MHz range, which are in line with the converter switching speeds. Though microfabrication is described herein, embodiments are not limited to micro-scale feature sizes. For example, the subject resonating inductor can be larger or smaller than described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In one example microfabrication implementation, the spiral coil inductor windings can be formed through electroplating a copper coil as described by Arnold et al. in &#x201c;Magnetic induction machines integrated into bulk-micromachined silicon,&#x201d; <i>J. Microelectromech. Syst., vol. </i>15, no. 2, pp. 406-414, April 2006; and by Bowers et al. in &#x201c;A method to form bonded micromagnets embedded in silicon,&#x201d; Tech. Dig. 14<sup>th </sup>Int. Conf. Solid-State Sensors, Actuators, and Microsystems (Transducers '07), Lyon, France, June 2007, vol. 2, pp. 1581-1584). In addition, the permanent micromagnet can be formed in accordance with Wang et al. in &#x201c;Wax-bonded NdFeB micromagnets for microelectromechanical systems applications,&#x201d; <i>J. Appl. Phys</i>., vol. 103, no. 7, pp. 07E109-1-3, April 2008.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">According to a further embodiment, a second conductor is positioned nearby to the magnet of the resonating inductor to provide a resonating transformer. Electrical energy from the circuit having the resonating inductor can then be transferred to a circuit having the second conductor. Current flowing in the first conductor attracts or repels the magnetic material of the resonating inductor, which generates an oscillating magnetic field and varies the flux in the first conductor. The second conductor positioned near the first conductor can pick up the energy generated by the resonating inductor.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The leakage inductance of the second conductor can be used in combination with external capacitors to create one or more resonant circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">For conventional transformers, an efficiency trade-off occurs based on the transformer's operating frequency. In particular, because the magnetizing reactance X<sub>M </sub>is proportional to frequency, low frequency operation indicates a smaller X<sub>M</sub>. A small X<sub>M </sub>indicates small total impedance looking in to the primary winding. For a given primary side input voltage V<sub>P</sub>, this means higher current through primary coil equivalent circuit resistor R<sub>P</sub>, and more copper loss to the winding. Moreover, since the ratio between magnetizing branch impedance (of the parallel equivalent circuit magnetizing resistance R<sub>c </sub>and magnetizing reactance X<sub>M</sub>) and the primary winding impedance (R<sub>P</sub>+X<sub>P</sub>) is reduced, the voltage across X<sub>M </sub>is reduced, which means less power transferred to magnetic core.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For high frequency operation, the power transfer to the magnetic core can be improved. However, the hysteresis loss and eddy current loss all increase with frequency. In addition, skin depth of the primary coil reduces, which also increases copper loss to the winding.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">It is generally desirable to maximize the magnetizing reactance in order to minimize the magnetizing current required to establish flux in the magnetic core. However, in practice, low frequency is preferred when efficiency is the key because the low magnetizing reactance problem can be solved by increasing the magnetizing inductance. In order to increase the magnetizing inductance, conventional transformers utilize solutions resulting in higher volume and weight to the transformer. In most power distribution applications, size and weight are not an issue. Therefore, bigger sized transformers are used, resulting in &#x3e;95% efficiency. Even higher efficiency can be achieved when a superconductor is used.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">However, when size and weight matters, increasing the magnetizing inductance is not feasible, and a higher frequency is required to increase the magnetizing reactance. In some applications radio frequency is used to achieve high magnetizing reactance. To reduce high frequency associated loss, air core transformers are used to substantially avoid hysteresis loss and eddy current loss. However, to avoid the hysteresis and eddy current loss present air core transformers operate at frequencies in the MHz to GHz range, and the power is radiative, which creates a safety issue as well as electromagnetic interference.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Therefore, given that the magnetizing reactance is high enough, low frequency operation is desired to minimize core loss due to hysteresis and eddy current, and copper loss due to reduced conductor skin depth. By introducing resonance in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, the magnetizing reactance X<sub>M </sub>can be canceled by the impedance of a capacitor, resulting in effectively infinite magnetizing reactance. According to certain embodiments, this magnetizing reactance cancellation can be implemented without significantly increasing the size of the overall device.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In wireless power transmission, an additional capacitively loaded winding is used to cancel the magnetizing reactance X<sub>M </sub>at resonant frequency. In contrast, an embodiment of the present invention uses movement between a magnet and the coils. As an example where the magnet is a moving magnet, ac current in a primary coil can cause the magnet to move, creating a time varying magnetic flux. The movement of the magnet (and creating of the time varying magnetic flux) induces voltage in the secondary coil. In the mechanical domain, resonance can be implemented by connecting a spring to the moving magnet, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a magnet <b>300</b> attached to a spring <b>305</b> is caused to move (or resonate) by an ac current in the first coil <b>320</b>, which induces voltage in the second coil <b>330</b>. The spring <b>305</b> may take a variety of forms and shapes. Alternatively, a cantilever arrangement can be used.</p>

This is similar to the equivalent circuit model of a traditional transformer, except that a capacitor is added in parallel to the inductor. At the natural frequency of the mechanical system, the inductor and the capacitor cancel out. This is equivalent to making the magnetizing reactance term in a traditional transformer infinite. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> shows the equivalent circuit for the resonance behavior in the magnetic domain. Here, a &#x201c;magnetic inductor&#x201d; L<sub>mag </sub>is introduced.</p>
