<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A filler tube assembly is used with a fuel pump nozzle having a pressure sensing port. The filler tube assembly includes a receiver having an inner wall defining an aperture, which receives the pump nozzle. The inner wall defines an orifice and a seal is coupled to the inner wall about the orifice for defining a chamber between the inner wall, the seal, and the fuel pump nozzle when the fuel pump nozzle is disposed in the aperture. A vacuum tube has a coupled end in fluid communication with the orifice and an open end in fluid communication with the fuel tank. The receiver defines a rim for seating the fuel pump nozzle in the aperture to align the pressure sensing port with the orifice. When fuel covers the open end of the vacuum tube, a pressure change is transmitted through the filler tube assembly to the pressure sensing port.</p>

Federal law prohibits spilling fuel into a lake, river, or waterway, and penalties for violating such laws may be severe. Such fuel overflow has been reduced by advancements in fuel pump nozzles, but such advancements have not eliminated overflow and the resulting pollution of waterways.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Boats generally include a fuel tank and a filler tube assembly extending from a surface of the boat to the fuel tank. The filler tube assembly includes a receiver that receives a fuel pump nozzle. Standard fuel pump nozzles generally have an automatic shut-off system. When activated, the automatic shut-off system discontinues the flow of fuel through the fuel pump nozzle. Specifically, the automatic shut-off system responds to a pressure change at the pressure sensing port. The fuel pump nozzle draws a vacuum through the pressure sensing port and when the pressure sensing port is covered, e.g., with fuel, the automatic shut-off system senses the change in pressure and discontinues the flow of fuel through the fuel pump nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Generally, as the fuel tank is filled with fuel, the fuel level rises to the top of the tank, into the filler tube assembly, and into the receiver. When the fuel level covers the pressure sensing port on the fuel pump nozzle, the pressure sensing port senses a pressure change which activates the automatic shut-off system on the fuel pump nozzle. Fuel flow is thereby terminated, thus preventing fuel overspill from the fuel fill neck.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Fuel tanks on boats typically include a vent tube to dissipate pressure increases in the fuel tank and to prevent vacuum when an engine is drawing fuel from the fuel tank. The vent tube is generally in the form of a tube connecting from the fuel tank to a side of the boat, thereby allowing the fuel tank to remain at atmospheric pressure. In today's boats, the height of the vent tube may be below the height of the receiver fitting. Therefore, as the fuel tank is filled, and as the fuel level rises to the top of the fuel tank into the filler tube assembly, fuel also rises at a corresponding level in the vent tube. If the height of the vent tube on the side of the boat is lower than the receiver, and hence lower than the pressure sensing port, fuel evacuates through the vent tube and onto the waterway surface before the fuel flow is terminated by the automatic shut-off system on the fuel pump nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Fuel overflow also occurs when, upon filling the tank, the tank belches, thereby expelling some fuel back through the receiver fitting. Belching is generally caused by turbulent flow in the fuel fill neck. Belching may also be caused by air that is trapped with the fuel as the fuel enters the fuel fill neck. As a result the backpressure created by the air restricts or eliminates fuel flow, generally at which point the fill neck belches, or releases, the air through the receiver fitting, which may result in fuel splashing out of the receiver fitting.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, underground fuel reservoirs are generally at a temperature substantially cooler than the temperature of the boat's fuel tank and the fuel undergoes thermal expansion after it is pumped from the cool reservoir to the warm fuel tank. Generally expansion continues after the fuel tank is filled and the fuel fill receiver is capped, resulting in excess fuel being expelled through the vent tube and onto the waterway surface.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Accordingly, it would be desirable to manufacture a filler tube assembly that activates the automatic shut-off system on the fuel pump nozzle when the fuel reaches a predetermined level to prevent leakage of fuel through the vent tube and to leave excess volume to accommodate for thermal expansion of fuel.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND ADVANTAGES</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention is a filler tube assembly for communicating fuel from a fuel pump nozzle to a fuel tank with the fuel pump nozzle having a pressure sensing port. The filler tube assembly includes a receiver having an inner wall defining an aperture for receiving the fuel pump nozzle. The inner wall defines an orifice extending through the inner wall transverse to the aperture. A seal is coupled to the inner wall about the orifice for defining a chamber between the inner wall, the seal, and the fuel pump nozzle. A vacuum tube has a coupled end coupled to the receiver and in fluid communication with the orifice and an open end for disposition in fluid communication with the fuel tank. The receiver defines a rim rigidly extending from the inner wall into the aperture for seating the fuel pump nozzle in the aperture to dispose the pressure sensing port in the chamber and to align the pressure sensing port with the orifice.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Accordingly, the operator of the fuel pump nozzle may seat the fuel pump nozzle against the rim to assure that the pressure sensing port is aligned with the orifice. Because the vacuum tube provides fluid communication between the fuel tank and the orifice, a pressure change at the open end of the vacuum tube is transmitted to the orifice. Further, the pressure difference at the orifice is sensed by the fuel pump nozzle through the pressure sensing port. As such, when the open end of the vacuum tube is covered, e.g., with fuel, a pressure change at the open end is transmitted through the vacuum tube to the orifice and to the pressure sensing port of the fuel pump nozzle. The open end of the vacuum tube may be located at a predetermined level to prevent leakage of fuel through the vent tube and/or to leave excess volume to accommodate for thermal expansion of fuel.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to the Figures, wherein like numerals indicate like or corresponding parts throughout the several views, a fuel storage system <b>11</b> is generally shown. The fuel storage system <b>11</b> receives fuel from a fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> having a pressure sensing port <b>42</b>. For example, the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> may be found in a standard fuel filling station and may be coupled to a fuel pump <b>15</b>. As is known in the art, the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> includes an automatic shut-off system. When activated, the automatic shut-off system discontinues the flow of fuel through the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>. Specifically, the automatic shut-off system responds to a pressure change at the pressure sensing port <b>42</b>. The fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> draws a vacuum through the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> and when the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is covered, e.g., with fuel, the automatic shut-off system senses the change in pressure and discontinues the flow of fuel through the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The fuel storage system <b>11</b> is shown throughout the Figures in use with a boat <b>10</b>; however it should be appreciated that the fuel storage system <b>11</b> is not limited to use in boats. For example, the fuel storage system <b>11</b> may be used in vehicles such as marine craft, automobiles, construction equipment, tractors, and spacecraft. The fuel storage system <b>11</b> may also be used with any type of machinery such as an electric generator. Alternatively, the fuel storage system <b>11</b> may be used with portable or stationary liquid storage devices, e.g., portable gasoline tanks. It should also be appreciated that the fuel storage system <b>11</b> may be used in a power boat as well as a sail boat.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the fuel storage system <b>11</b> includes a fuel tank <b>22</b> and a filler tube assembly <b>12</b> coupled to the fuel tank <b>22</b>. The filler tube assembly <b>12</b> communicates fuel from a fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> to the fuel tank <b>22</b>. In other words, fuel is pumped from the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> through the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> and into the fuel tank <b>22</b>. Specifically, the fuel tank <b>22</b> defines an interior <b>17</b> for storing fuel and fuel is pumped through the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> and into the interior <b>17</b> of the fuel tank <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the boat <b>10</b> may include a deck fitting <b>19</b> that is rigidly attached to a surface of the boat <b>10</b>. In such an embodiment, a fuel hose <b>13</b> extends between the deck fitting <b>19</b> and the fuel tank <b>22</b>. The receiver <b>18</b> is disposed within the deck fitting <b>19</b>. The receiver <b>18</b> is integral with or an insert to the deck fitting <b>19</b>. The receiver <b>18</b> may be pivotable within the deck fitting to aid in the ease of insertion of the fuel pump nozzle into the receiver <b>18</b>. The receiver may be manufactured from a flexible material to aid in the ease of insertion of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> into the receiver <b>18</b>. It should be appreciated that the receiver <b>18</b> and the deck fitting <b>19</b> may be sealed to one another and the receiver <b>18</b> may be sealed to the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> when disposed in the receiver <b>18</b> such that air may not exhaust through the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> during fueling. Alternatively, the receiver <b>18</b> and the deck fitting <b>19</b> may be configured to allow for exhaust of air through the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> during fueling.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-6</figref>, the fuel tank <b>22</b> may include a vent tube <b>44</b> including a first end <b>45</b> for communication with ambient atmosphere and a second end <b>46</b> coupled to the fuel tank <b>22</b>. Specifically, the first end <b>45</b> is in fluid communication with the interior <b>17</b> of the fuel tank <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> includes a receiver <b>18</b> having an inner wall <b>21</b> defining an aperture <b>24</b> for receiving the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>. The inner wall <b>21</b> defines an orifice <b>23</b> extending through the inner wall <b>21</b> transverse to the aperture <b>24</b>. The fuel hose <b>13</b> is coupled to the receiver <b>18</b> in alignment with the aperture <b>24</b> for coupling with the fuel tank <b>22</b> to communicate fuel from the receiver <b>18</b> to the fuel tank <b>22</b>. The aperture <b>24</b> of the receiver <b>18</b> may be sized, for example, such that the receiver <b>18</b> may receive a fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> that pumps gasoline or is sized, for example, such that the receiver <b>18</b> receives a fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> that pumps diesel fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The filler tube assembly <b>12</b> includes a seal <b>29</b> coupled to the inner wall <b>21</b> about the orifice <b>23</b> for defining a chamber <b>34</b> between the inner wall <b>21</b>, the seal <b>29</b>, and the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>. In other words, the chamber <b>34</b> is aligned with the orifice <b>23</b> when the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> is disposed in the aperture <b>24</b>. Specifically, upon fueling, the receiver <b>18</b> receives the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>. More specifically, the aperture <b>24</b> receives the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> and the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> abuts the rim <b>26</b>. When the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> is inserted in the receiver <b>18</b>, the seal <b>29</b> sealingly engages the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>. The seal <b>29</b> creates an air-tight seal with the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> thus creating the chamber <b>34</b>. Because the chamber <b>34</b> is aligned with the orifice and the seal <b>29</b> sealingly engages the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>, fluid communication with the chamber <b>34</b> is limited to fluid communication through the orifice <b>23</b>. The seal <b>29</b> is preferably made from conductive material such that static electricity is discharged through the seal <b>29</b> to an electrical ground and is preferably resistant to fuels and/or the seal is preferably self lubricating. It should be appreciated that without departing from the nature of the present invention, the seal <b>29</b> may have any configuration such that the seal <b>29</b> is coupled to the inner wall <b>21</b> about the orifice <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The receiver <b>18</b> defines a rim <b>26</b> rigidly extending from the inner wall <b>21</b> into the aperture <b>24</b> for seating the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> in the aperture <b>24</b>. Specifically, the rim <b>26</b> seats the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> in the aperture <b>24</b> to dispose the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> in the chamber <b>34</b> and to align the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> with the orifice <b>23</b>. In other words, when the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> is seated on the rim <b>26</b>, the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is aligned with the chamber <b>34</b> and is therefore aligned with the orifice <b>23</b>. The aperture <b>24</b> extends along an axis A and the rim <b>26</b> may extend annularly about the axis A and may project perpendicularly from the inner wall <b>21</b>. The rim <b>26</b> and the inner wall <b>21</b> may be integrally formed from a common material. Alternatively, the rim <b>26</b> may be formed separately from the inner wall <b>21</b> and subsequently coupled to the inner wall <b>21</b>. It should be appreciated that the rim <b>26</b> may have any configuration that acts to seat the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> in the aperture <b>24</b>. For example, the rim <b>26</b> may be a bar extending across the aperture <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> includes a vacuum tube <b>16</b> having a coupled end <b>25</b> coupled to the receiver <b>18</b> and in fluid communication with the orifice <b>23</b> and an open end <b>27</b> disposed in fluid communication with the fuel tank <b>22</b>. In other words, the coupled end <b>25</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b> is coupled to the orifice <b>23</b> and the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b> is disposed at a predetermined vertical position. An air path through the vacuum tube <b>16</b>, orifice <b>23</b>, and the chamber <b>34</b> is unobstructed so a pressure change at the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b> is communicated through the vacuum tube <b>16</b> and through the orifice <b>23</b> to the chamber <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Because the vacuum tube <b>16</b> is in fluid communication with the orifice <b>23</b> and the fuel tank <b>22</b>, a pressure change at the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b> is communicated through the vacuum tube <b>16</b> to the chamber <b>34</b>. Upon fueling, when the fuel level reaches the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b>, a pressure change is created at the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b> which is transferred to the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> which in turn stops the fuel flow through the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">For example, the receiver <b>18</b> defines a nipple <b>38</b> with the orifice <b>23</b> extending from the inner wall <b>21</b> through the nipple <b>38</b>. The vacuum tube <b>16</b> is coupled to the nipple <b>38</b>. The vacuum tube <b>16</b> is preferably self clearing. In other words, the vacuum tube <b>16</b> should be sized such that the surface tension of the fuel is not able to bridge across the vacuum tube <b>16</b>, rather fuel empties from the vacuum tube <b>16</b> by gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the seal <b>29</b> may include a first seal <b>30</b> and a second seal <b>32</b> spaced from the first seal <b>30</b>. In such a configuration, the first and second seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> enclose the orifice <b>23</b> for defining the chamber <b>34</b> between the inner wall <b>21</b>, the first and second seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>. The first and second seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> may each extend annularly about the axis A. In other words, the first and second seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> may be referred to in the art as O-rings.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">When the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> is inserted in the receiver <b>18</b>, the first and second seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> seal around the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>. When fuel is pumped through the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>, the fuel may not travel past the second seal <b>32</b> and the fuel travels through the fuel hose <b>13</b> toward the fuel tank <b>22</b>. Each seal <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> may, for example, include a rigid portion and a flexible portion. The rigid portion guides the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> into the aperture <b>24</b> and the flexible portion seals around the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>. For example, the rigid portion may be a metal and the flexible portion may be a rubber. The first and second seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> each define an inner diameter D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>. The inner diameter D<b>2</b> of the second seal <b>32</b> may be less than the inner diameter D<b>1</b> of the first seal <b>30</b>. In such a configuration, additional force is required to insert the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> past the first seal <b>30</b> such that the user may feel when the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> is approaching the rim <b>26</b> to assure full insertion of the nozzle <b>28</b> in the receiver <b>18</b>. The first and second seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> create an air-tight seal with the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> thus creating the chamber <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first and second seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> are located such that when the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> is inserted into the receiver <b>18</b>, the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is located between the first and second seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. The pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is exposed to the pressure of the chamber <b>34</b> and is therefore exposed to the pressure of the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b>. Upon fueling, when the fuel level in the fuel tank <b>22</b> reaches the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b>, a pressure change is created at the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b> which is transferred to the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> which in turn stops the fuel flow through the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the receiver may include a guide seal <b>36</b>. The guide seal <b>36</b> may guide the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> into the aperture <b>24</b>. It should be appreciated that the receiver <b>18</b> may include any number of guide seals and each guide seal may guide the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> through the aperture <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In such an embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the distance between each seal is less than or equal to the distance between a tip of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> and the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> such that the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is always disposed within the chamber <b>34</b> between the seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. In such an embodiment, the automatic shut-off system of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> is activated when the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> is disposed on the guide seal <b>36</b> or on the first seal <b>30</b> or when the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is disposed between the guide seal <b>36</b> and the first seal <b>30</b>. Because the automatic shut-off system is activated when the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is disposed on the guide seal <b>36</b> or on the first seal <b>30</b> or when the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is disposed between the guide seal <b>36</b> and the first seal <b>30</b>, fuel may only be pumped from the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> if fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> is properly engaged with the receiver <b>18</b> such that the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is disposed between the first seal <b>30</b> and the second seal <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in another embodiment, the receiver <b>18</b> defines a second orifice <b>48</b> extending from the inner wall <b>21</b> through the receiver <b>18</b>. The seal <b>29</b> encloses the second orifice <b>48</b> and separates the second orifice <b>48</b> from the orifice <b>23</b> for defining the second chamber <b>50</b> in communication with the second orifice <b>48</b> between the inner wall <b>21</b>, the seal <b>29</b>, and the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>. In other words, the second orifice <b>48</b> is aligned with the second chamber <b>50</b>. In the embodiment including the first and second seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, the seal <b>29</b> may further include a third seal <b>58</b> spaced from the second seal <b>32</b> opposite the first seal <b>30</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The third seal <b>58</b> and the second seal <b>32</b> create the second chamber <b>50</b>. In such an embodiment, the first, second, and third seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>58</b> may each extend annularly about the axis A. In other words, each of the seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>58</b> may be referred to in the art as O-rings and each of the seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>58</b> create an air-tight seal with the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> thus creating the chamber <b>34</b> between the first and second seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, and creating the second chamber <b>50</b> between the second and third seals <b>32</b>, <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In such an embodiment, the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> includes a second vacuum tube <b>52</b> including a second coupled end <b>54</b> coupled to the receiver <b>18</b> in fluid communication with the second orifice <b>48</b> and a second open end <b>56</b> for disposition in fluid communication with the fuel tank <b>22</b>. It should be appreciated that, without departing from the nature of the present invention, the seal <b>29</b> may have any configuration such that the seal <b>29</b> encloses the second orifice <b>48</b> and separates the second orifice <b>48</b> from the orifice <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b> is located at a different location than the second open end <b>56</b> of the second vacuum tube <b>52</b>. For example, the open end <b>27</b> and the second open end <b>56</b> may be disposed at different vertical levels. If the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is in fluid communication with the chamber <b>34</b>, the automatic shut-off system will be activated when the fuel level covers the open end <b>27</b>. If the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is in fluid communication with the second chamber <b>50</b>, the automatic shut-off system will be activated when the fuel level covers the second open end <b>56</b> of the second vacuum tube <b>52</b>. As such, a person operating the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> may select whether the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is in fluid communication with the chamber <b>34</b> or the second chamber <b>50</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the open end <b>27</b> may be located such that the automatic shut-off system is activated when the fuel tank <b>22</b> is full, thereby eliminating any room for thermal expansion. The second open end <b>56</b> may be located such that the automatic shut-off system is activated before the fuel tank <b>22</b> is full, thereby leaving excess volume for thermal expansion. In such a configuration, the person operating the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> may align the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> with the chamber <b>34</b> when the fuel tank is being filled immediately prior to fuel consumption in anticipation that the fuel will be consumed before it thermally expands. The person operating the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> may align the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> with the second chamber <b>50</b> when immediate fuel consumption is not anticipated and unfilled volume in the fuel tank <b>22</b> accommodates for thermal expansion of the fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the embodiment including the first, second, and third seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>58</b>, the second and third seals <b>32</b>, <b>58</b> may enclose the second orifice <b>48</b>. Specifically, the second orifice is defined in the inner wall between the second and third seals <b>32</b>, <b>58</b>. In other words, the third seal <b>58</b> may be disposed between the second seal <b>32</b> and the rim <b>26</b>. In such an embodiment, the operator of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> may move the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> to selectively align the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> between the first and second seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> or between the second and third seals <b>32</b>, <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the first, second, and third seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>, <b>58</b> may each define an inner diameter D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>, D<b>3</b>. The inner diameter D<b>3</b> of the third seal <b>58</b> may be less than the inner diameter D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b> of the first and second seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b>. In such a configuration, additional force is required to insert the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> past the third seal <b>30</b> such that the user may feel when the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> is approaching the rim <b>26</b> to assure full insertion of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> in the receiver <b>18</b>. Because the inner diameter D<b>3</b> of the third seal <b>58</b> is less than the inner diameters D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b> of the first and second seals, the operator of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> may feel the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> passing by the third seal <b>58</b> and may thereby align the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> with the chamber <b>34</b> or the second chamber <b>50</b> by feeling from the third seal <b>58</b> with the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in the embodiment with the third seal <b>58</b> disposed between the second seal <b>32</b> and the rim <b>26</b>, the receiver includes a variable positioning device <b>60</b> disposed in the aperture <b>24</b> between the rim <b>26</b> and the third seal <b>58</b> for selectively aligning the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> along the axis A. For example, the variable positioning device <b>60</b> includes a resilient member <b>62</b> resiliently compressible between a first position and a second position for selectively adjusting the alignment of the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> along the axis A between the chamber <b>34</b> and the second chamber <b>50</b>. The resilient member <b>62</b> is further defined as a coil spring. The variable positioning device <b>60</b> may also include a seat disposed on the resilient member <b>62</b> to seat the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> on the variable positioning device <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In such an embodiment as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the operator of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> inserts the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> into the aperture <b>24</b> and the resilient member <b>62</b> aligns the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> with the chamber <b>34</b>. The operator may pump fuel into the fuel tank <b>22</b> until the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b> becomes covered with fuel, thereby activating the automatic shut-off system. If the operator desires to pump additional fuel into the fuel tank <b>22</b>, the operator exerts force on the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> to compress the resilient member <b>62</b> thereby aligning the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> with the second chamber <b>50</b>. When the resilient member <b>62</b> is compressed, the rim <b>26</b> provides rigid support for the resilient member <b>62</b>. The operator may then pump additional fuel into the fuel tank <b>22</b> until the second open end <b>56</b> of the second vacuum tube <b>52</b> is covered by fuel, thereby activating the automatic shut-off system.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It should be appreciated that the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> may be selectively aligned with the chamber <b>34</b> and the second chamber <b>50</b> in any way without departing from the nature of the present invention. For example, the chamber <b>34</b> and the second chamber <b>50</b> may be configured such that the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> may be rotated relative to the receiver <b>18</b> to align the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> with the chamber <b>34</b> or the second chamber <b>50</b>. In such a configuration, the receiver <b>18</b> or the deck fitting <b>19</b> may include visual indicators to aid the operator of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> to determine if the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is aligned with the chamber <b>34</b> or the second chamber <b>50</b>. The receiver <b>18</b> or the deck fitting <b>19</b> may include a rotational stop that enables the operator of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> to feel through the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> whether the pressure sensing port <b>42</b> is aligned with the chamber <b>34</b> or the second chamber <b>50</b>. It should also be appreciated that in such an embodiment, the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> may rotate relative to the receiver <b>18</b>, or alternatively, the receiver <b>18</b> and the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> may rotate together relative to the deck fitting <b>19</b>. Alternatively, the receiver <b>18</b> may rotate relative to the deck fitting <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, another embodiment includes a maximum-capacity filler tube assembly <b>81</b> and a below-capacity filler tube assembly <b>82</b>. The maximum-capacity filler tube assembly <b>81</b> includes a vacuum sensing tube <b>16</b> with the open end <b>27</b> that is located such that the automatic shut-off system is activated when the fuel tank <b>22</b> is full, thereby eliminating any room for thermal expansion. The below-capacity filler tube assembly <b>82</b> includes a vacuum sensing tube <b>16</b> with the open end <b>27</b> that is located such that the automatic shut-off system is activated before the fuel tank <b>22</b> is full, thereby leaving excess volume for thermal expansion. The maximum-capacity filler tube assembly <b>81</b> may used, for example, when the fuel tank is being filled immediately prior to fuel consumption in anticipation that the fuel will be consumed before it thermally expands. The below-capacity filler tube assembly <b>82</b> may used, for example, when immediate fuel consumption is not anticipated and the excess volume accommodates for thermal expansion of the fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The receiver <b>18</b> may be formed from metal and the seal <b>29</b> may be formed from an elastomer. For example, the receiver <b>18</b> may be formed from stainless steel, brass, aluminum, or copper. Alternatively, the receiver <b>18</b> may be formed from materials such as nylon. Further, the receiver <b>18</b> is formed from conductive material such that static electricity is discharged through the fill neck <b>12</b> to the deck fitting <b>19</b>, which is grounded.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-9</figref>, the receiver <b>18</b> may include a projection <b>20</b> and the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> may include an auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> coupled to the projection <b>20</b>. In such a configuration, the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> extends within the fuel hose <b>13</b>. Specifically, the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> extends from the projection <b>20</b> through the fuel hose <b>13</b> toward or into the fuel tank <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> may extend along a portion of the fuel hose <b>13</b> such that the fuel is pumped into the receiver <b>18</b>, through the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b>, into the fuel hose <b>13</b>, and into the fuel tank <b>22</b>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> may extend further than the length of the fuel hose <b>13</b> and into the fuel tank <b>22</b> such that fuel is pumped into the receiver <b>18</b>, through the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b>, and into the fuel tank <b>22</b>. The diameter of the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> is generally equal to the diameter of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>. Because the diameter of the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> is generally equal to the diameter of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>, the fuel pumped from the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> is pumped into the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> without trapping and without forcing air along with the fuel into the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b>. The absence of trapped air allows for a laminar flow of the fuel through the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> and eliminates belching that may be caused by trapped air. More specifically, if air becomes trapped with the fuel, the air will build up in the fuel hose, most likely at a bend in the fuel hose. When enough air is trapped in the fuel hose, the air belches out of the receiver <b>18</b> and may splash fuel out of the receiver <b>18</b>. Additionally, the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> increases the rate at which fuel may be pumped into a fuel hose <b>13</b> that has a contorted shape thereby decreasing the time to fill the fuel tank <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the vacuum tube <b>16</b> may be disposed within the fuel hose <b>13</b>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the vacuum tube <b>16</b> may be disposed outside of the fuel hose <b>13</b> and extend from the nipple <b>38</b> into the fuel tank <b>22</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, if the vacuum tube <b>16</b> is disposed within the fuel hose <b>13</b>, the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b> is preferably located such that it does not extend beyond the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> to prevent splashing fuel inside the fuel tank <b>22</b> or splashing fuel from the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> from contacting the open end <b>27</b> and activating the automatic fuel shut-off system on the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The predetermined vertical position of the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b> is such that when fuel in the fuel tank <b>22</b> reaches a desired level, the fuel level reaches the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b>. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> the predetermined vertical position of the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b> may be such that the fuel level does not reach a vent tube <b>44</b> of the fuel tank <b>22</b>. Additionally, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the predetermined vertical position of the open end <b>27</b> may be such that the fuel tank <b>22</b> is filled with fuel before the automatic fuel shut-off system on the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> is activated. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the predetermined vertical position of the open end <b>27</b> may be such that the fuel does not fill the fuel tank <b>22</b>, thus leaving excess volume to accommodate, for example, for thermal expansion of the fuel. Alternatively, in an embodiment where the vent tube <b>44</b> includes a carbon canister, the predetermined vertical position of the open end <b>27</b> may be such that the automatic fuel shut-off system is activated before fuel rises into contact with the carbon canister.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Due to packaging constraints and other constraints, the fuel tank <b>22</b> may receive the fuel fill hose <b>12</b> on a side of the fuel tank <b>22</b>. For such a configuration, the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b> may be fixed in a specified position in the fuel tank <b>22</b> such that the automatic fuel shut-off system is activated when the fuel reaches a specified level in the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in another embodiment the receiver <b>18</b> is formed from a flexible material. The seals <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> are formed from the flexible material. When the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> is inserted in the receiver <b>18</b>, the rim <b>26</b> positions the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> and each seal <b>30</b>, <b>32</b> creates an air-tight seal around the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> thus creating the chamber <b>34</b>. The orifice <b>23</b> connects to the chamber <b>34</b>, which connects to the vacuum tube <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In another embodiment, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> may be portable. In other words, the filler tube assembly <b>12</b>, may be separate from the fuel tank <b>22</b> and may attached to a fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> for insertion into the deck fitting along with the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>. The fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> may be inserted into the receiver <b>18</b> and the receiver <b>18</b> may be attached to the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> to attach the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> to the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>. In such an embodiment, the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> may be permanently or removably attached to the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>. The filler tube assembly <b>12</b> is then inserted into the fuel hose <b>13</b> such that fuel may be pumped through the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> and into the fuel hose <b>13</b>. Preferably, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> and the vacuum tube <b>16</b> are connected. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a protective cover (not shown) may surround the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> and the vacuum tube <b>16</b> to protect the auxiliary fuel hose <b>14</b> and the vacuum tube <b>16</b> and to aid the insertion of the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> into the deck fitting and the fuel hose <b>13</b>. The filler tube assembly <b>12</b> that is attached to the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> may extend from the nozzle <b>28</b> through the fuel hose <b>13</b> into the fuel tank <b>22</b> or may extend from the nozzle <b>28</b> partially through the fuel hose <b>13</b>. When the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is attached to the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>, when the nozzle <b>28</b> is removed from the fuel hose <b>13</b> when fueling is completed, the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> is removed along with the nozzle <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-14</figref>, the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> can include a control unit <b>64</b> in communication with the orifice <b>23</b> of the receiver <b>18</b>. The control unit <b>64</b> can selectively activate the automatic shut-off system of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> independently of the fuel level relative to the vacuum tube <b>16</b>. Specifically, the control unit <b>64</b> senses the fuel level in the fuel tank <b>22</b> and selectively activates the automatic shut-off system by interrupting communication between the orifice <b>23</b> and the chamber <b>34</b>. The filler tube assembly <b>12</b> can include the control unit <b>64</b> as an alternative to the vacuum tube <b>16</b> or in addition to the vacuum tube <b>16</b> to selectively activate the automatic shut-off system of the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The control unit <b>64</b> typically includes a valve <b>66</b> in fluid communication with the chamber <b>34</b> through the orifice <b>23</b>, an actuator <b>68</b> in communication with the valve <b>66</b> to actuate, i.e., open and close, the valve <b>66</b>, and a level sensor <b>70</b> in communication with the actuator <b>68</b>. When the valve <b>66</b> is open, air can flow through the orifice <b>23</b> to the chamber <b>34</b>. When the valve <b>66</b> is closed, the valve <b>66</b> blocks air flow through the orifice <b>23</b> to the chamber <b>34</b> to activate the automatic shut-off system. The valve <b>66</b> is open under normal conditions and when the level sensor <b>70</b> senses that the fuel level as at a predetermined level, the level sensor <b>70</b> causes the actuator <b>68</b> to close the valve <b>66</b>. It should be appreciated that the level sensor <b>70</b> could be in direct communication with the actuator <b>68</b> to actuate the valve <b>66</b> or, alternatively, the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> could include a controller (not shown) in communication with the actuator <b>68</b> and the level sensor <b>70</b> to control the actuator <b>68</b>. It should be appreciated that the level sensor <b>70</b> can be in communication with the actuator <b>68</b> or the controller either by wired connection, radiofrequency, or any other type of communication.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The fuel level sensor <b>70</b> can alternatively be in communication, for example, wirelessly, electronically, etc., directly with either the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> and/or the fuel pump <b>15</b> to stop the flow of fuel from the fuel pump <b>15</b> when the desired fuel level is reached. In other words, when the fuel level sensor <b>70</b> senses that the fuel level is at a predetermined level, the level sensor <b>70</b> instructs the fuel pump nozzle <b>28</b> or the fuel pump <b>15</b> to stop the flow of fuel.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The valve <b>66</b> can be any type of valve for interrupting communication between the orifice <b>23</b> and the chamber <b>34</b>. For example, the valve <b>66</b> can be of the type commonly referred to as a shut-off valve. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the valve <b>66</b> can be disposed in the receiver <b>18</b>. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the valve <b>66</b> can be disposed in the vacuum tube <b>16</b>. It should be appreciated that the valve <b>66</b> can be disposed anywhere such that the valve <b>66</b> can interrupt communication between the orifice <b>23</b> and the chamber <b>34</b>. The actuator <b>68</b> can be of any type and for example, could be a solenoid.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The level sensor <b>70</b> can be of any type without departing from the nature of the present invention. For example, the level sensor <b>70</b> could ultrasonically measure the fuel level. In such a configuration, the level sensor <b>70</b> is typically mounted to the fuel tank <b>22</b> above the fuel. The level sensor <b>70</b> sends an ultrasonic signal toward the fuel and measures the time for the ultrasonic signal to reach the fuel, reflect off the fuel, and return to the level sensor <b>70</b> to determine the fuel level. One such ultrasonic level sensor <b>70</b> is the type commercially available from SSI Technologies Inc., of Janesville, Wis., U.S.A. under the tradenames Fluid-Trac&#xae; and Acu-Trac&#xae;. However, it should be appreciated that the ultrasonic level sensor <b>70</b> is set forth above is for exemplary purposes and the level sensor <b>70</b> can be of any type. For example, the level sensor could include a sensor (not shown) and a float (not shown) connected to the sensor by an arm. In such a configuration, the float floats on the surface of the fuel and the sensor determines the fuel level by the rotational position of the arm relative to the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">When the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> includes the control unit <b>64</b> in addition to the vacuum tube <b>16</b>, control unit <b>64</b> can be used as a primary source for activating the automatic shut-off system. In such a configuration, the vacuum tube <b>16</b> can be used as a secondary source for activating the automatic shut-off system in case the control unit <b>64</b> malfunctions. In other words, if for some reason the control unit <b>64</b> does not properly activate the automatic shut-off system, i.e., during an electrical malfunction, the automatic shut-off system will be activated when the fuel level reaches the open end <b>27</b> of the vacuum tube <b>16</b>, as set forth above.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the filler tube assembly <b>12</b> includes the control unit <b>64</b> as an alternative to the vacuum tube <b>16</b>, filler tube assembly <b>12</b> need not include the vacuum tube <b>16</b>. In such a configuration, the orifice <b>23</b> of the control unit <b>64</b> need not be in fluid communication with the fuel tank <b>22</b> but can instead be in fluid communication with atmospheric pressures when the valve <b>66</b> is open.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than of limitation. Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the above teachings, and the invention may be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.</p>
