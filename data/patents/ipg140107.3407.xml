<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Japan Patent Application No. 2010-069131, filed on Mar. 25, 2010 in the Japan Patent Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure pertains to, inter alia, surface-mount type piezoelectric devices.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One conventional type of &#x201c;piezoelectric device&#x201d; includes a &#x201c;board&#x201d; (substrate) of AT-cut quartz crystal enclosed in a &#x201c;package.&#x201d; The crystal board has upper and lower main surfaces on which respective excitation electrodes have been formed. When electrically excited via the excitation electrodes, the AT-cut crystal exhibits &#x201c;thickness shear&#x201d; vibration. The fundamental resonance frequency at which the AT-cut crystal substrate vibrates is a function of substrate thickness (between the upper and lower main surfaces), wherein the frequency varies inversely with substrate thickness.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Excitation electrodes formed directly on the main surfaces of the crystal board can adversely affect its vibration. One reason is that excitation electrodes add mass to the vibrating portion of the crystal substrate. Even a crystal substrate configured to vibrate at a fundamental frequency of 300 MHz or higher can exhibit vibrational interference caused by the presence of excitation electrodes formed directly on the main surfaces of the crystal substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One conventional way in which to solve this problem is to excite the crystal board using &#x201c;space electrodes.&#x201d; A space electrode is an excitation electrode that is separated from the respective main surface of the piezoelectric substrate by a defined narrow gap. Electrical energy necessary to induce vibration is supplied from the respective space electrodes across the respective gaps to the respective main surfaces of the crystal board.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Spatially separating the excitation electrodes from respective surfaces of the crystal vibrating board is discussed in Japan Unexamined Patent Application No. 2002-118440. In an exemplary piezoelectric device according to this reference, a piezoelectric board or substrate (called an &#x201c;electrode-less&#x201d; substrate) is sandwiched between two additional piezoelectric boards (each called an &#x201c;electroded&#x201d; substrate), but with defined gaps between the electrode-less substrate and each of the electroded substrates. Each electroded substrate comprises a respective space electrode that faces the respective main surface of the electrode-less substrate across the respective gap. To induce vibration of the electrode-less substrate, a suitable electrical waveform is applied to the space electrodes on the electroded substrates. The electrode-less substrate is excited to vibrate by induction of the electrical waveform from the energized space electrodes to the electrode-less substrate. Actual vibration in the electrode-less substrate occurs mainly in a central region thereof, which usually has a &#x201c;mesa&#x201d; configuration in which the central region is thicker than regions of the substrate surrounding the central region.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In the package, the electrode-less substrate is bonded to the electroded substrates using an electrically conductive adhesive applied in respective peripheral recesses in the bondable main surfaces of each substrate. This bonding step also establishes certain electrical connections to the electrodes. In this particular bonding scheme, thicker portions of the substrates (located inboard of the recesses) contact each other but are not bonded together. Consequently, the devices are susceptible to air leaks from outside to inside the package. These leaks can cause the device to exhibit excessive temporal drift of vibration parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further regarding the devices disclosed in JP '440, the space electrodes are connected to respective mounting-board terminals on the package using electrically conductive adhesive raised from the terminals up the sides of the device. This technique cannot be performed using common solder paste or conventional mounting steps; rather, a special procedure is required. Furthermore, to ensure formation of good electrical interconnections using the adhesive, the adhesive must be applied with a constant width and at a highly accurate dispensing rate to allow the width of each piezoelectric device thus formed to be minimized as much as possible.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The problems with conventional devices and methods summarized above are addressed by various aspects of the invention disclosed herein. The aspects are directed to, inter alia, piezoelectric devices that have a predetermined gap between the piezoelectric vibrating substrate and its respective excitation &#x201c;space&#x201d; electrodes, while also providing reliable hermetic sealing of the piezoelectric device thus formed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A first aspect of the invention is directed to piezoelectric devices. Each piezoelectric &#x201c;device&#x201d; comprises a piezoelectric vibrating board enclosed in a &#x201c;package.&#x201d; The package is defined, at least in part, by the piezoelectric vibrating board, an upper &#x201c;cover board,&#x201d; and a lower &#x201c;cover board,&#x201d; wherein the vibrating board is sandwiched between the cover boards. In most, but not all, embodiments the vibrating board is electrode-less and each of the cover boards is electroded to provide respective &#x201c;space electrodes&#x201d; serving as excitation electrodes for the vibrating board and separated from the vibrating board by respective gaps. Thus, the vibrating board is induced to vibrate by electrically energizing the space electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A first embodiment of a piezoelectric device comprises a piezoelectric vibrating substrate including a vibrating portion that exhibits a thickness-shear vibration mode when appropriately energized. The device also includes a frame portion that extends around and supports the vibrating portion. A first cover board, bonded to an upper main surface of the frame portion, includes a respective excitation electrode capable of exciting the vibrating portion across a gap. The excitation electrode is aligned with the vibrating portion and with a region peripheral to the vibrating portion. A second cover board, bonded to a lower main surface of the frame portion, includes a respective excitation electrode capable of exciting the vibrating portion across a gap. The excitation electrode of the second cover board is also aligned with the vibrating portion and with a region peripheral to the vibrating portion. The first and second cover boards sandwich the piezoelectric vibrating substrate therebetween. The frame portion, first cover board, and second cover board collectively form the package in which the vibrating portion is supported and sealed from the external environment. The excitation electrodes are connected to respective external electrodes situated outside the package, such as on the outer main surface of one of the cover boards, or on outer main surfaces of respective cover boards. A first convexity is defined on the upper main surface of the frame portion and/or on a peripheral region of the inner main surface of the first cover board. The first convexity surrounds the excitation electrode formed on the inner main surface of the first cover board to maintain a predetermined gap between the piezoelectric vibrating substrate and the excitation electrode. The first cover board and piezoelectric vibrating substrate are bonded together using an adhesive applied as a continuous bead inboard of the first convexity (but not on the first convexity) so as to surround the vibrating portion. Alternatively, the adhesive can be applied outboard of the first convexity.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The first cover board can further comprise a second convexity, situated outboard of the first convexity. The second convexity desirably has the same height as the first convexity. The second convexity can be defined on the main surface of the frame portion facing the first cover board or on the inner main surface of the first cover board, or on both main surfaces. In these configurations involving two convexities, the adhesive is located between the first and second convexities.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The second cover board has a respective space electrode (excitation electrode) that, in concert with the space electrode on the first cover board, excites the vibrating portion to vibrate. The space electrode of the second cover board is aligned with the vibrating portion and with regions of the piezoelectric vibrating substrate surrounding the vibrating portion. A third convexity can be defined on either the inner main surface of the second cover board or on the lower main surface of the frame portion. The third convexity substantially extends circumferentially around the excitation electrode, and the height of the third convexity establishes the gap between the excitation electrode and the vibrating portion. The second cover board is bonded to the frame portion using an adhesive, of which a continuous bead is applied just inboard of the third convexity so as to extend completely around the vibrating portion.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Certain embodiments of the subject piezoelectric devices further comprise a fourth convexity, situated outboard of the third convexity but having the same height as the third convexity. The fourth convexity is situated on either the lower main surface of the frame portion of the piezoelectric vibrating board or the upper main surface of the second cover board. In either event, the adhesive is applied as a continuous bead between the third convexity and the fourth convexity.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Various embodiments of piezoelectric devices described herein establish a predetermined gap between the piezoelectric vibrating board and each of its excitation &#x201c;space&#x201d; electrodes. The embodiments also provide effective hermetic sealing of the packages of the piezoelectric devices using adhesive applied adjacent convexity(ies) surrounding respective excitation electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The subject devices are easier than conventional devices to surface-mount because the subject devices provide one or two external electrodes on the outer surface of a respective cover board.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref> are respective schematic views of this embodiment <b>100</b> of a piezoelectric vibrating device <b>100</b>. The device <b>100</b> comprises an electrode-less piezoelectric substrate having first and second main surfaces, and two electroded substrates each having a respective main surface on which a respective space electrode has been formed. Each space electrode is separated from the respective main surface of the electrode-less substrate by a respective gap. Each electroded substrate is actually a respective cover board, thereby providing an upper and a lower cover board.

<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a plan view of the first (upper) cover board <b>10</b> of this embodiment, as viewed from the electrode-less piezoelectric substrate <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a plan view of the electrode-less piezoelectric substrate <b>20</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> is a plan view of the second (lower) cover board <b>40</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> is a cross-sectional view of this embodiment <b>100</b> along the line A-A&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, and <b>1</b>C. Thus, this piezoelectric vibrating device <b>100</b> comprises an electrode-less piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b>, a first cover board <b>10</b>, and a second cover board <b>40</b>, collectively forming a package <b>80</b>.

As referred to herein, the longitudinal direction of the piezoelectric device <b>100</b> is in the Y-axis direction, the width direction of the piezoelectric device is in the X-axis direction, and the thickness direction is in the Z-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the first cover board <b>10</b> has a peripheral convexity <b>11</b> surrounding a middle region. In the package <b>80</b> the middle region and peripheral convexity face the piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b>. The convexity <b>11</b> is formed by etching away material of the first cover board <b>10</b> corresponding to the middle region, inboard of the convexity <b>11</b>. In the middle region is an excitation electrode <b>30</b>. A respective extraction electrode <b>32</b> extends from one corner of the excitation electrode <b>30</b> to a respective corner of the first cover board <b>10</b>, on the convexity. The excitation electrode <b>30</b> and the extraction electrode <b>32</b> each comprise a gold (Au) layer of 400 &#x212b; to 2000 &#x212b; thickness formed on a chromium (Cr) layer of 150 &#x212b; to 700 &#x212b; thickness. In the middle region, just inboard of the convexity, is a continuous bead of electrically conductive adhesive <b>23</b> that thus surrounds the excitation electrode <b>330</b>. A respective notch Y is located at each of the four corners of the first cover board <b>10</b>, in which conduction wiring is formed. The conduction wiring <b>31</b> is electrically connected to the extraction electrode <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> the piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b> is made of an AT-cut crystal vibrating piece. A respective notch Y is formed at each of the four corners of the piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b>, in which conduction wiring <b>31</b> is formed. The piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b> includes a vibrating portion SB that exhibits, when energized, a thickness-shear vibration mode. The vibrating portion SB is located in the middle of the piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b>. The piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b> also includes a supporting-frame portion SW extending circumferentially around the vibrating portion SB. The vibrating portion SB and the supporting-frame portion SW desirably are defined by through-hole grooves MB that fully penetrate the thickness dimension of the piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b>. Note that the through-hole grooves MB may not be required.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, the second cover board <b>40</b> has a peripheral convexity <b>41</b> surrounding a middle region. In the package <b>80</b> the middle region and peripheral convexity <b>41</b> face the piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b>. The convexity <b>41</b> is formed by etching away material of the second cover board <b>40</b> corresponding to the middle region, inboard of the convexity. In the middle region is an excitation electrode <b>30</b>. A respective extraction electrode <b>32</b> extends from one corner of the excitation electrode <b>30</b> to a respective corner of the second cover board <b>40</b>, on the convexity. The excitation electrode <b>30</b> and the extraction electrode <b>32</b> each comprise a gold (Au) layer of 400 &#x212b; to 2000 &#x212b; thickness formed on a chromium (Cr) layer of 150 &#x212b; to 700 &#x212b; thickness. In the middle region, just inboard of the convexity <b>41</b>, is a continuous bead of electrically conductive adhesive <b>23</b> that thus surrounds the excitation electrode <b>330</b>. A respective notch Y is located at each of the four corners of the first cover board <b>10</b>, in which conduction wiring is formed. The conduction wiring <b>31</b> is electrically connected to the extraction electrode <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">First and second external electrodes <b>47</b>, <b>48</b>, respectively, are formed on the lower main surface of the second cover board <b>40</b>. Both external electrodes <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> are metallized. The external electrodes <b>47</b>, <b>48</b> are electrically connected to respective conduction wiring <b>31</b> in a respective notch Y.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, the piezoelectric device <b>100</b> is formed by sandwiching the piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b> between the first cover board <b>10</b> as a package top and the second cover board <b>40</b> as a package bottom, and bonding all three boards together. On the first and second cover boards <b>10</b>, <b>40</b>, the respective bead of electrically conductive adhesive <b>23</b> is applied inboard of the respective convexities <b>11</b>, <b>41</b> so as to surround all inboard structure. The top of each bead of adhesive <b>23</b> as applied is higher (in the Z-direction) than the respective convexity <b>11</b>, <b>41</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Thus, the adhesive <b>23</b> flattens and spreads out somewhat with application of pressure during assembly of the package. The adhesive <b>23</b> is cured by heating (thermally hardened) during assembly and bonding together of the frame portion SW, first cover board <b>10</b>, and second cover board <b>40</b> to form the package <b>80</b>. Meanwhile, the excitation electrodes <b>30</b> are hermetically sealed inside the package <b>80</b> by the adhesive <b>23</b>. The resulting hermetic isolation of the excitation electrodes <b>30</b> from the external environment provides a device <b>100</b> that is very stable over time.</p>

The adhesive <b>23</b> is denoted by cross-hatching to distinguish it more clearly from the convexities <b>11</b>, <b>41</b>, the excitation electrode <b>30</b>, and the extraction electrode <b>32</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> the first external electrode <b>47</b> is electrically connected to conductive wiring <b>31</b> in a respective notch Y and also to the excitation electrode <b>30</b> and extraction electrode <b>32</b> on the second cover board <b>40</b>. Similarly, the second external electrode <b>48</b> is electrically connected to conductive wiring <b>31</b> in a respective notch Y and also to the excitation electrode <b>30</b> and extraction electrode <b>32</b> on the first cover board <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> also shows that the excitation electrode <b>30</b> on the first cover board <b>10</b> faces the excitation electrode <b>32</b> on the second cover board <b>40</b>. These excitation electrodes are vertically aligned with each other while the extraction electrodes <b>32</b> are diagonally opposed to each other (in the XY plane).</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In step S<b>102</b> a convexity <b>11</b> is formed in a region (XY plane) of a first cover wafer <b>10</b>W.

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In step S<b>104</b> the excitation electrode <b>30</b> and the extraction electrode <b>32</b> are formed on the first cover wafer <b>10</b>W. Each excitation electrode <b>30</b> and extraction electrode <b>32</b> is, for example, a gold (Au) layer (400 &#x212b; to 2000 &#x212b; thickness) formed on a layer of chromium (Cr) (150 &#x212b; to 700 &#x212b; thickness). Instead of the chromium (Cr) layer, a titanium (Ti) layer can be used, and a silver (Ag) layer can be used instead of the gold (Au) layer.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In step S<b>106</b> the adhesive <b>23</b> is applied as a continuous bead in a region (XY plane) just inboard of the convexity <b>11</b> but higher (in the Z-direction) than the height of the convexity <b>11</b>. The adhesive <b>23</b> desirably is applied by a printing technique. The convexity <b>11</b> surrounds the bead of adhesive <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In step S<b>112</b> a crystal wafer <b>20</b>W is prepared, on which multiple piezoelectric vibrating boards <b>20</b> are to be fabricated.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In step S<b>122</b> a convexity <b>41</b> is formed in a region (XY plane) of a second cover wafer <b>40</b>W. The outside edge of the convexity <b>41</b> corresponds to the outline profile of piezoelectric device <b>100</b>, and this step is performed by wet-etching.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In step S<b>124</b> the excitation electrode <b>30</b> and extraction electrode <b>32</b> are formed on the second cover wafer <b>40</b>W.

Instead of the chromium (Cr) layer, a titanium (Ti) layer can be used, and a silver (Ag) layer can be used instead of the gold (Au) layer.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In step S<b>126</b> the adhesive <b>23</b> is applied as a continuous bead in a region (XY plane) just inboard of the convexity <b>41</b> but higher (in the Z-direction) than the height of the convexity <b>41</b>. The adhesive <b>23</b> desirably is applied by a printing technique. The convexity <b>41</b> surrounds the bead of adhesive <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is a plan view of the second cover wafer <b>40</b>W, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a cross-sectional view along the line C-C&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> virtual lines (two-dot lines) denote the edge profiles of respective second cover boards <b>40</b>, for clarity. The height h<b>2</b> (Z-direction) of the bead of adhesive <b>23</b> is greater than the height h<b>1</b> of the convexity <b>41</b>. The bead of adhesive <b>23</b> has high viscosity, which tends to round out its cross-section by surface tension. During package assembly, when the piezoelectric vibrating wafer <b>20</b>W is sandwiched between the first and second cover boards (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) and compression (in the &#x2212;Z-direction) is applied, the adhesive <b>23</b> is squashed and flattened.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Continuing further with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, in step S<b>152</b> the crystal wafer <b>20</b>W containing the piezoelectric vibrating boards is sandwiched between the first cover wafer <b>10</b>W and the second cover wafer <b>40</b>W.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In step S<b>154</b> the three-layer sandwich is compressed under a vacuum or in an inert-gas atmosphere.

Note that, in the depicted sandwich, the first cover wafer <b>10</b>W, the crystal wafer <b>20</b>W, and the second cover wafer <b>40</b>W are aligned with each other. The wafers are bonded together by the adhesive <b>23</b>. This bonding is performed, with application of heat and compression, under a vacuum or in an inert-gas atmosphere to cure (harden) the adhesive <b>23</b> and form the packages <b>80</b>W. Inside the cavity <b>27</b> is a vacuum or inert-gas atmosphere. The adhesive <b>23</b> is applied having a height (in the Z-direction) greater than the height of either convexity <b>11</b>, <b>41</b>.

Nevertheless, the respective heights of the convexities <b>11</b> and <b>41</b> are maintained so that desired respective gaps are established and maintained between the piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b> and the excitation electrodes <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Returning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, in step S<b>156</b> a respective through-hole <b>35</b> is formed at each of the four corners of the edge-profile (XY plane) of the piezoelectric device <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In step S<b>158</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, a chromium (Cr) layer is formed (e.g., by sputtering) on the entire lower main surface of the second cover wafer <b>40</b>W and inside the through-holes <b>35</b> to form a metal substrate film.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9D</figref>, the fifth embodiment <b>140</b> is assembled by forming a sandwich of the piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b>D between and aligned with the first and second cover boards <b>10</b>D, <b>40</b>D.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">If an excitation electrode is formed on the crystal vibrating piece, stress is generated between the excitation electrode and the crystal vibrating piece. This stress produces strain that worsens the aging characteristics of the piezoelectric device. Further, this stress also generates heat, which causes changes in the vibration frequency of the device. A space electrode reduces or eliminates the stress between the excitation electrode and the crystal vibrating piece, which improves the aging characteristics and suppresses changes in vibration frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">However, a space electrode requires a gap between it and the crystal vibrating piece. This gap is wider than any space required in devices not using space electrodes. The wider gap tends to increase the CI value of the device. In the fifth embodiment of a piezoelectric device <b>140</b>, by utilizing a space electrode opposite only one surface of the vibrating portion, increases in the CI value can be suppressed better, compared to devices utilizing space electrodes opposite both surfaces. Also, aging and frequency changes can be suppressed better, compared to devices utilizing respective excitation electrodes on both main surfaces of the crystal vibrating piece.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">Although not specifically illustrated, in the second embodiment <b>110</b> and third embodiment <b>120</b> of a piezoelectric device (and similar to the fifth embodiment <b>140</b>), the convexity <b>21</b> can be formed on the first main surface of the piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b> and the excitation electrode <b>30</b> and the extraction electrode <b>32</b> can be formed inboard of the convexity <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The invention has been described above in the context of preferred embodiments. It will be obvious to persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art to modify the invention based on this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">For example, the piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b>D of the fifth embodiment <b>140</b> can be flipped over and the second cover board <b>40</b>D be configured as the planar cover board. Also, the excitation electrode <b>30</b> can be formed on the piezoelectric vibrating board <b>20</b>D (configured as a planar board) by forming the convexity <b>11</b> on and applying the adhesive <b>23</b> to the first cover board <b>10</b>D. Also, although the crystal vibrating pieces were described as AT-cut, a BT-cut crystal vibrating piece alternatively can be used to achieve the same result. Also, even though a crystal material is used in these embodiments as the piezoelectric material, it will be understood that crystal material is one example of various materials that can be used. Alternatively, LiTaO<sub>3 </sub>(lithium tantalite) can be used as a piezoelectric material. Moreover, any of the piezoelectric devices disclosed herein can be configured as respective piezoelectric oscillators, which are essentially piezoelectric devices that include an integrated circuit (IC) including an oscillation circuit.</p>
