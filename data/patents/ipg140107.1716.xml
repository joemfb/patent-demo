<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure generally relates to sensors and sensor networks for monitoring and analyzing a person's health.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A sensor network may include distributed autonomous sensors. Uses of sensor networks include but are not limited to military applications, industrial process monitoring and control, machine health monitoring, environment and habitat monitoring, utility usage, healthcare and medical applications, home automation, and traffic control. A sensor in a sensor network is typically equipped with a communications interface, a controller, and an energy source (such as a battery).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A sensor typically measures a physical quantity and converts it into a signal that an observer or an instrument can read. For example, a mercury-in-glass thermometer converts a measured temperature into expansion and contraction of a liquid that can be read on a calibrated glass tube. A thermocouple converts temperature to an output voltage that a voltmeter can read. For accuracy, sensors are generally calibrated against known standards.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Detecting and managing stress is a significant problem in modern-day medicine. If fact, many doctors argue that stress and stress-related symptoms are a major cause of death. Consequently, methods and systems for modeling, measuring, and monitoring stress in a person provide significant health benefits.</p>

<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Sensor Networks</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an example sensor network <b>100</b>. Sensor network <b>100</b> comprises a sensor array <b>110</b>, an analysis system <b>180</b>, and display system <b>190</b>. Sensor network <b>100</b> enables the collecting, processing, analyzing, sharing, visualizing, displaying, archiving, and searching of sensor data. The data collected by sensors <b>112</b> in sensor array <b>110</b> may be processed, analyzed, and stored using the computational and data storage resources of sensor network <b>100</b>. This may be done with both centralized and distributed computational and storage resources. Sensor network <b>100</b> may integrate heterogeneous sensor, data, and computational resources deployed over a wide area. Sensor network <b>100</b> may be used to undertake a variety of tasks, such as physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental monitoring and analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A sensor array <b>110</b> comprises one or more sensors <b>112</b>. A sensor <b>112</b> receives a stimulus and converts it into a data stream. The sensors <b>112</b> in sensor array <b>110</b> may be of the same type (e.g., multiple thermometers) or various types (e.g., a thermometer, a barometer, and an altimeter). A sensor array <b>110</b> may transmit one or more data streams based on the one or more stimuli to one or more analysis systems <b>180</b> over any suitable network. In particular embodiments, a sensor <b>112</b>'s embedded processors may perform certain computational activities (e.g., image and signal processing) that could also be performed by other components of sensor network <b>100</b>, such as, for example, analysis system <b>180</b> or display system <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used herein, a sensor <b>112</b> in a sensor array <b>110</b> is described with respect to a subject. Therefore, a sensor <b>112</b> may be personal or remote with respect to the subject. Personal sensors receive stimuli that are from or related to the subject. Personal sensors may include, for example, sensors that are affixed to or carried by the subject (e.g., a heart-rate monitor, an input by the subject into a smart phone), sensors that are proximate to the subject (e.g., a thermometer in the room where the subject is located), or sensors that are otherwise related to the subject (e.g., GPS position of the subject, a medical report by the subject's doctor, a subject's email inbox). Remote sensors receive stimulus that is external to or not directly related to the subject. Remote sensors may include, for example, environmental sensors (e.g., weather balloons, stock market ticker), network data feeds (e.g., news feeds), or sensors that are otherwise related to external information. A sensor <b>112</b> may be both personal and remote depending on the circumstances. As an example and not by way of limitation, if the subject is a particular person, a thermometer in a subject's home may be considered personal while the subject is at home, but remote when the subject is away from home. As another example and not by way of limitation, if the subject is a particular home, a thermometer in the home may be considered personal to the home regardless of whether a person is in the home or away.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The sensor array <b>110</b> may further comprise one or more data aggregation nodes <b>114</b>. A node <b>114</b> may access one or more data streams from one or more sensors <b>112</b> in the sensor array <b>110</b>. The node <b>114</b> may then monitor, store, and analyze one or more data streams from the sensors <b>112</b>. In particular embodiments, the node <b>114</b> may synchronize a plurality of data streams from a plurality of sensors <b>112</b>. A node <b>114</b> may transmit one or more data streams based on the one or more data streams received from the sensors <b>112</b> to one or more analysis systems <b>180</b> over any suitable network. In particular embodiments, a node <b>114</b>'s embedded processors may perform certain computational activities (e.g., image and signal processing) that could also be performed by other components of sensor network <b>100</b>, such as, for example, analysis system <b>180</b> or display system <b>190</b>. In particular embodiments, a node <b>114</b> may analyze one or more data streams from one or more sensors <b>112</b> and generate one or more derivative data streams that may be synchronized, modified, stored, transmitted, and analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Analysis system <b>180</b> may monitor, store, and analyze one or more data streams from sensor array <b>110</b>. Analysis system <b>180</b> may have subcomponents that are local <b>120</b>, remote <b>150</b>, or both. Display system <b>190</b> may render, visualize, display, message, and publish to one or more users based on the output of analysis system <b>180</b>. Display system <b>190</b> may have subcomponents that are local <b>130</b>, remote <b>140</b>, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As used herein, the analysis and display components of sensor network <b>100</b> are described with respect to a sensor <b>112</b>. Therefore, a component may be local or remote with respect to the sensor <b>112</b>. Local components (i.e., local analysis system <b>120</b>, local display system <b>130</b>) may include components that are built into or proximate to the sensor <b>112</b>. As an example and not by way of limitation, a sensor <b>112</b> could include an integrated computing system and LCD monitor that function as local analysis system <b>120</b> and local display system <b>130</b>. Remote components (i.e., remote analysis system <b>150</b>, remote display system <b>190</b>) may include components that are external to or independent of the sensor <b>112</b>. As another example and not by way of limitation, a sensor <b>112</b> could transmit a data stream over a network to a remote server at a medical facility, wherein dedicated computing systems and monitors function as remote analysis system <b>150</b> and remote display system <b>190</b>. In particular embodiments, each sensor <b>112</b> in sensor array <b>110</b> may utilize either local or remote display and analysis components, or both. In particular embodiments, a user may selectively access, analyze, and display the data streams from one or more sensors <b>112</b> in sensor array <b>110</b>. This may be done, for example, as part of running a specific application or data analysis algorithm. The user could access data from specific types of sensors <b>112</b> (e.g., all thermocouple data), from sensors <b>112</b> that measure specific types of data (e.g., all environmental sensors), or based on other criteria.</p>

As an example and not by way of limitation, a subject may be a person (or group of persons or entity), place (such as, for example, a geographical location), or thing (such as, for example, a building, road, or car). Although this disclosure describes particular types of subjects, this disclosure contemplates any suitable types of subjects.

As such, the terms &#x201c;subject&#x201d; and &#x201c;user&#x201d; may refer to the same person, unless context suggests otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A sensor <b>212</b> responds to a stimulus by generating a data stream corresponding to the stimulus. A data stream may be a digital or analog signal that can be transmitted over any suitable transmission medium and further used in electronic devices. As used herein, the term &#x201c;sensor&#x201d; is used broadly to describe any device that receives a stimulus and converts it into a data stream. The present disclosure assumes that the data stream output from a sensor <b>212</b> is transmitted to an analysis system, unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In particular embodiments, one or more sensors <b>212</b> each include a stimulus receiving element (i.e., sensing element), a communication element, and any associate circuitry. Sensors <b>212</b> generally are small, battery powered, portable, and equipped with a microprocessor, internal memory for data storage, and a transducer or other component for receiving stimulus. However, a sensor <b>212</b> may also be an assay, test, or measurement. A sensor <b>212</b> may interface with a personal computer and utilize software to activate the sensor <b>212</b> and to view and analyze the collected data. A sensor <b>212</b> may also have a local interface device (e.g., keypad, LCD) allowing it to be used as a stand-alone device. In particular embodiments, a sensor <b>212</b> may include one or more communication elements that may receive or transmit information (such as data streams) over a communication channel, for example to one or more other components in a sensor network.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In particular embodiments, one or more sensors <b>212</b> may measure a variety of things, including physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental stimulus. Physiological stimulus may include, for example, physical aspects of a person (e.g., stretch, motion of the person, and position of appendages); metabolic aspects of a person (e.g., glucose level, oxygen level, osmolality), biochemical aspects of a person (e.g., enzymes, hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines), and other aspects of a person related to physical health, disease, and homeostasis. Psychological stimulus may include, for example, emotion, mood, feeling, anxiety, stress, depression, and other psychological or mental states of a person. Behavioral stimulus may include, for example, behavior related a person (e.g., working, socializing, arguing, drinking, resting, driving), behavior related to a group (e.g., marches, protests, mob behavior), and other aspects related to behavior. Environmental stimulus may include, for example, physical aspects of the environment (e.g., light, motion, temperature, magnetic fields, gravity, humidity, vibration, pressure, electrical fields, sound, GPS location), environmental molecules (e.g., toxins, nutrients, pheromones), environmental conditions (e.g., pollen count, weather), other external condition (e.g., traffic conditions, stock market information, news feeds), and other aspects of the environment.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A biosensor is a type of sensor <b>112</b> that receives a biological stimulus and converts it into a data stream. As used herein, the term &#x201c;biosensor&#x201d; is used broadly.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In particular embodiments, a biosensor may be a device for the detection of an analyte. An analyte is a substance or chemical constituent that is determined in an analytical procedure. For instance, in an immunoassay, the analyte may be the ligand or the binder, while in blood glucose testing, the analyte is glucose. In medicine, analyte typically refers to the type of test being run on a patient, as the test is usually determining the existence and/or concentration of a chemical substance in the human body.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A common example of a commercial biosensor is a blood glucose monitor, which uses the enzyme glucose oxidase to break blood glucose down. In doing so, it first oxidizes glucose and uses two electrons to reduce the FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide, a component of the enzyme) to FADH<sub>2 </sub>(1,5-dihydro-FAD). This in turn is oxidized by the electrode (accepting two electrons from the electrode) in a number of steps. The resulting current is a measure of the concentration of glucose. In this case, the electrode is the transducer and the enzyme is the biologically active component.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In particular embodiments, a biosensor combines a biological component with a physicochemical detector component. A typical biosensor comprises: a sensitive biological element (e.g., biological material (tissue, microorganisms, organelles, cell receptors, enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, etc.), biologically derived material, biomimic); a physicochemical transducer/detector element (e.g. optical, piezoelectric, electrochemical) that transforms the signal (i.e. input stimulus) resulting from the interaction of the analyte with the biological element into another signal (i.e. transducers) that may be measured and quantified; and associated electronics or signal processors generating and transmitting a data stream corresponding to the input stimulus. The encapsulation of the biological component in a biosensor may be done by means of a semi-permeable barrier (e.g., a dialysis membrane or hydrogel), a 3D polymer matrix (e.g., by physically or chemically constraining the sensing macromolecule), or by other means.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Sensor Sampling Rates</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In particular embodiments, a sensor <b>112</b> may sample input stimulus at discrete times. The sampling rate, sample rate, or sampling frequency defines the number of samples per second (or per other unit) taken from a continuous or semi-continuous stimulus to make a discrete data signal. For time-domain signals, the unit for sampling rate may be 1/s (Hertz). The inverse of the sampling frequency is the sampling period or sampling interval, which is the time between samples. The sampling rate of a sensor <b>112</b> may be controlled locally, remotely, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In particular embodiments, one or more sensors <b>112</b> in the sensor array <b>110</b> may have a dynamic sampling rate. Dynamic sampling is performed when a decision to change the sampling rate is taken if the current outcome of a process is within or different from some specified value or range of values. As an example and not by way of limitation, if the stimulus is different from the outcome predicted by some model or falls outside some threshold range, the sensor <b>112</b> may increase or decrease its sampling rate in response. Dynamic sampling may be used to optimize the operation of the sensors <b>112</b> or influence the operation of actuators to change the environment.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In particular embodiments, the sampling rate of a sensor <b>112</b> may be based on receipt of a particular stimulus. As an example and not by way of limitation, an accelerometer may have a default sample rate of 1/s, but may increase its sampling rate to 60/s whenever it measures a non-zero value, and then may return to a 1/s sampling rate after getting <b>60</b> consecutive samples equal to zero. As another example and not by way of limitation, if the stimulus measured over a particular range of time does vary significantly, the sensor <b>112</b> may reduce its sampling rate.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In particular embodiments, the sampling rate of a sensor <b>112</b> may be based on input from one or more components of sensor network <b>100</b>. As an example and not by way of limitation, a heart rate monitor may have a default sampling rate of 1/min, but may increase the its sampling rate in response to a signal or instruction from analysis system <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In particular embodiments, one or more sensors <b>112</b> in the sensor array <b>110</b> may increase or decrease the precision at which the sensors <b>112</b> sample input. As an example and not by way of limitation, a glucose monitor may use four bits to record a user's blood glucose level by default. However, if the user's blood glucose level begins varying quickly, the glucose monitor may increase its precision to eight-bit measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">User-Input Sensors</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In particular embodiments, a user-input device may be a sensor <b>112</b> in sensor array <b>110</b>. These &#x201c;user-input sensors&#x201d; are sensors <b>112</b> where the stimulus received by the sensor <b>112</b> may be input from a user. The user may input any suitable information into the sensor <b>112</b>, including physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental information. The user may input information about the user (e.g., a user may record his psychological state) or about one or more 3rd parties (e.g., a doctor may record information about a patient). A user may provide input in a variety of ways. User-input may include, for example, inputting a quantity or value into the sensor <b>112</b>, speaking or providing other audio input to the sensor <b>112</b>, and touching or providing other stimulus to the sensor <b>112</b>. Any client system with a suitable I/O device may serve as a user-input sensor. Suitable I/O devices include alphanumeric keyboards, numeric keypads, touch pads, touch screens, input keys, buttons, switches, microphones, pointing devices, navigation buttons, stylus, scroll dial, another suitable I/O device, or a combination of two or more of these.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In particular embodiments, an electronic calendar functions as a user-input sensor for gathering behavioral data. A user may input the time and day for various activities, including appointments, social interactions, phone calls, meetings, work, tasks, chores, etc. Each inputted activity may be further tagged with details, labels, and categories (e.g., &#x201c;important,&#x201d; &#x201c;personal,&#x201d; &#x201c;birthday&#x201d;). The electronic calendar may be any suitable personal information manager, such as Microsoft Outlook, Lotus Notes, Google Calendar, etc. The electronic calendar may then transmit the activity data as a data stream to analysis system <b>180</b>, which could map the activity data over time and correlate it with data from other sensors in sensor array <b>110</b>. For example, analysis system <b>180</b> may map a heart-rate data stream against the activity data stream from an electronic calendar, showing that the user's heart-rate peaked during a particularly stressful activity (e.g., dinner with the in-laws).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">User Queries and Triggering User Queries Based on Sensor Inputs</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In particular embodiments, a sensor <b>112</b> may query a user to input information (i.e., stimulus) into the sensor <b>112</b>. The sensor <b>112</b> may query the user in any suitable manner, such as, for example, by prompting the user to input information into a suitable I/O device. The sensor <b>112</b> may query the user at any suitable rate or frequency. As an example and not by way of limitation, a sensor <b>112</b> may query a user at a static interval (e.g., every hour). As another example and not by way of limitation, a sensor <b>112</b> may query a user at a dynamic rate. The dynamic rate may be based on a variety of factors, including prior input into the sensor <b>112</b>, data streams from other sensors <b>112</b> or nodes <b>114</b> in sensor array <b>110</b>, output from analysis system <b>180</b>, or other suitable factors. For example, if a heart-rate monitor in sensor array <b>110</b> indicates an increase in the user's heart-rate, a user-input sensor may immediately query the user to input his current activity. Although this disclosure describes particular components performing particular processes to query a user to input information into a sensor <b>112</b>, this disclosure contemplates any suitable components performing any suitable processes to query a user to input information into a sensor <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may access one or more data streams from one or more sensors <b>112</b>. The sensors may be physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental sensors. Similarly, each data stream may comprise physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental data of a person. In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may access one or more physiological sensors, the physiological sensors comprising one or more of a heart-rate monitor, a blood-pressure monitor, a pulse oximeter, an accelerometer, an electrocardiograph, a glucocorticoid meter, an electromyograph, another suitable physiological sensor, or two or more such sensors. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system <b>180</b> may access a data stream from a heart-rate monitor, wherein the data stream comprises heart-rate data of a person. In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may access one or more environmental sensors that are data feeds, the data feeds comprising one or more of a stock-market ticker, a weather report, a news feed, a traffic-condition update, a public-health notice, an electronic calendar, a social network news feed, another suitable data feed, or two or more such data feeds. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system <b>180</b> may access a stock-market ticker from a data feed, wherein the stock-market ticker comprises stock information. Although this disclosure describes particular components accessing particular data streams from particular sensors <b>112</b>, this disclosure contemplates any suitable components accessing any suitable data streams from any suitable sensors <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may analyze a data stream in reference to its corresponding set of control parameters. Each sensor <b>112</b> or data stream may have a corresponding set of control parameters. The set of control parameters consists of data parameters that specify when a sensor <b>112</b> or data stream is at a normal or expected state. The set of control parameters may include one or more of a set point for the sensor <b>112</b>, an operating range for the sensor <b>112</b>, an operating threshold for the sensor <b>112</b>, a sampling rate for the sensor <b>112</b>, a sample size for the sensor <b>112</b>, another suitable parameter, or two or more such parameters. As an example and not by way of limitation, a heart-rate monitor may have a corresponding set of control parameters that specify that a heart-rate of 60-100 beats/minute is a normal state. As another example and not by way of limitation, a mood sensor <b>400</b> may have a corresponding set of control parameters that specify that a self-reported psychological state of &#x201c;stressed&#x201d; with an intensity of 2 or less on a 0-to-4 Likert scale is a normal state. In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may analyze a plurality of data streams in references to a plurality of corresponding sets of control parameters. The set of control parameters may specify when a first sensor <b>112</b> or first data stream is at a normal or expected state based on data from one or more second sensors <b>112</b> or second data streams. As an example and not by way of limitation, a heart-rate monitor and an accelerometer may have a corresponding set of control parameters that specify that once a period of extended activity has ended, a change in heart-rate of 12 beats/minute<sup>2 </sup>or higher is a normal state (an continuously elevated heart rate after exercise may indicate an increased risk of heart attack). As another example and not by way of limitation, a mood sensor <b>400</b> and a weather report data feed may have a corresponding set of control parameters that specify that when the weather is overcast, a self-reported psychological state of &#x201c;depressed&#x201d; with an intensity of 3 or less on a 0-to-4 Likert scale is a normal state (a person is more likely to be depressed when the weather is poor). Although this disclosure describes particular components analyzing particular data streams in reference to particular sets of control parameters, this disclosure contemplates any suitable components analyzing any suitable data streams in reference to any suitable sets of control parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may analyze a data stream in reference to its corresponding set of control parameters to determine if the data stream deviates from its corresponding set of control parameters. Analysis system <b>180</b> may use any suitable process, calculation, or technique to determine if a data stream deviates from its corresponding set of control parameters. A sensor <b>112</b> or data stream deviates from its corresponding set of control parameters when one or more samples in the data stream indicate that the sensor or data stream is not at a normal or expected state. As an example and not by way of limitation, if a heart-rate monitor has a corresponding set of control parameters that specify that a heart-rate of 60-100 beats/minute is a normal state, analysis system <b>180</b> may compare one or more samples from the data stream from the heart-rate monitor with the set of control parameters corresponding to the heart-rate monitor to identify whether any of the samples indicate a heart-rate outside of the 60-100 beats/minute range.

<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may transmit a query to one or more sensors <b>112</b> for physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental information. The query may ask the user to input information about the user (e.g., asking the user to input his psychological state) or about one or more 3rd parties (e.g., asking a doctor to input physiological information about a patient). The query may ask an environment sensor for environment information (e.g., asking a weather sensor for the temperature at the user's location; asking a stock ticker for information on the user's stock portfolio).

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In particular embodiments, mood sensor <b>400</b> may query a user to input psychological or behavioral information. The user may input any suitable psychological or behavioral information into the mood sensor <b>400</b>. The user may input information about the user (e.g., a user may record his psychological state) or about one or more 3rd parties (e.g., a psychiatrist may record psychological information about a patient). The mood sensor <b>400</b> may query the user at any suitable rate or frequency. As an example and not by way of limitation, mood sensor <b>400</b> may query a user at a static interval (e.g., every hour). As another example and not by way of limitation, mood sensor <b>400</b> may query a user at a dynamic rate. The dynamic rate may be based on a variety of factors, including prior input into mood sensor <b>400</b>, data streams from other sensors <b>112</b> or nodes <b>114</b> in sensor array <b>110</b>, output from analysis system <b>180</b>, requests or queries from other systems, or other suitable factors. For example, if the user inputs that he is &#x201c;angry&#x201d; with an intensity of &#x201c;4,&#x201d; mood sensor <b>400</b> may begin querying the user every 15 minutes until the user indicates the intensity of his mood has dropped to &#x201c;2&#x201d; or less. In another example, if a heart-rate monitor in sensor array <b>110</b> indicates an increase in the user's heart-rate, mood sensor <b>400</b> may query the user to input his current psychological and behavioral state. In yet another example, if the user's electronic calendar indicates that he has an appointment tagged as &#x201c;important,&#x201d; mood sensor <b>400</b> may query the user to input his psychological state immediately before and after the appointment.

<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Data Feeds as Sensors</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In particular embodiments, a sensor <b>112</b> may be a data feed. A data feed may be a computing system that receives and aggregates physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental data from one or more sources and transmits one or more data streams based on the aggregated data. Alternatively, a data feed may be the one or more data streams based on the aggregated data. As an example and not by way of limitation, data feeds may be stock-market tickers, weather reports, news feeds, traffic-condition updates, public-health notices, electronic calendars, data from one or more other users (such as, for example, physiological, psychological, or behavioral data from another user), or any other suitable data feeds. A data feed may contain both personal and remote data, as discussed previously. A data feed may be from any suitable computing device (such as, for example, computer system <b>1600</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The example data feeds illustrated and described herein are provided for illustration purposes only and are not meant to be limiting. This disclosure contemplates the use of any suitable data feed.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Data Streams</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In particular embodiments, a data stream comprises one or more data transmitted from one or more sensors <b>112</b> or from one or more nodes <b>114</b> in sensor array <b>110</b>. A data stream may be a digital or analog signal that may be transmitted over any suitable transmission medium and further used in electronic devices. Sensor array <b>110</b> may transmit one or more data streams based on one or more stimuli to one or more analysis systems <b>180</b> over any suitable network.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A data stream may include signals from a variety of types of sensors <b>112</b>, including physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental sensors. A sensor <b>112</b> generates a data stream corresponding to the stimulus it receives. As an example and not by way of limitation, a physiological sensor (e.g., an accelerometer) generates a physiological data stream (e.g., an accelerometer data stream, which includes, for example, data on the acceleration of a subject over time).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Sensor data may include any suitable information. In particular embodiments, sensor data includes measurements taken by one or more sensors <b>112</b>. Sensor data may include samples that may have any suitable format. In particular embodiments, the format of the samples may be a tuple (or ordered set) that has one or more data parameters, and a particular sample may be a tuple of one or more values for the one or more data parameters. As an example and not by way of limitation, a tuple format (t, p) may have data parameters time t and pressure p, and a particular sample (t<b>0</b>, p<b>0</b>) may have values pressure p<b>0</b> measured at time t<b>0</b>. The tuple format may include any suitable data parameters, such as one or more sensor parameters and/or one or more test parameters. A sensor parameter may correspond to one or more sensors <b>112</b>, and a sensor value may record one or more measurements taken by one or more sensors <b>112</b>. As an example and not by way of limitation, a sensor value may record a measurement taken by a sensor <b>112</b>. A test parameter may correspond to a factor that describes a temporal, spatial, and/or environmental feature of a measurement process, and a test value may record the value of the feature when the measurements are taken. As an example and not by way of limitation, the parameter may be time and the parameter value may record a particular time at which measurements are taken.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In particular embodiments, a sensor <b>112</b> may transmit one or more data at discrete times. The transmitting rate, transmission rate, or transmitting frequency defines the number of transmissions per second (or per other unit) sent by a sensor to make a discrete data signal. For time-domain signals, the unit for transmitting rate may be 1/s (Hertz). The inverse of the transmitting frequency is the transmitting period or transmitting interval, which is the time between transmissions. The datum may be transmitted continuously, periodically, randomly, or with any other suitable frequency or period. This may or may not correlate with the sampling rate of the sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Reference to sensor data may encompass a sensor data stream, and vice versa, where appropriate. Sensor data may relate to a sensor subject, wherein the sensor <b>112</b> receives stimulus from or related to the subject. Sensor data or a data stream may relate to a sensor subject in any suitable way. As an example and not by way of limitation, sensor data may relate to a sensor subject because one or more sensors <b>112</b> generated the sensor data from one or more stimuli produced by the sensor subject. As another example and not by way of limitation, sensor data may relate to a sensor subject because the sensor data may provide insight or further understanding of the sensor subject. As yet another example and not by way of limitation, sensor data may relate to a sensor subject because it may help detect or predict the occurrence of one or more problems or events concerning the sensor subject. As yet another example and not by way of limitation, sensor data may relate to a sensor subject because it may facilitate monitoring of the sensor subject.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Data Acquisition</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In particular embodiments, the components of sensor network <b>100</b> may utilize some type of data acquisition system to further process the data stream signal for use by analysis system <b>180</b>. As an example and not by way of limitation, a data acquisition system may convert an analog waveforms signal into a digital value. As another example and not by way of limitation, the data acquisition system may convert decimal values into binary values. The data acquisition system may be local, for example, integrated into a sensor <b>112</b> in sensor array <b>110</b> or into local analysis system <b>120</b>. The data acquisition system may also be remote, for example, integrated into remote analysis system <b>150</b> or an independent system.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">In particular embodiments, the data acquisition system may perform one or more signal conditioning processes (for example, if a signal from a sensor <b>112</b> is not suitable for the type of analysis system <b>180</b> being used). As an example and not by way of limitation, the data acquisition system may amplify, filter, or demodulate the signal. Various other examples of signal conditioning might be bridge completion, providing current or voltage excitation to the sensor, isolation, time-base correction, and linearization. In particular embodiments, single-ended analog signals may be converted to differential signals. In particular embodiments, digital signals may be encoded to reduce and correct transmission errors or downsampled to reduce transmission power requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Data Logging</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In particular embodiments, the components of sensor network <b>100</b> may utilize some type of data logging system to record, categorize, store, and file data from one or more data streams over time. The data logging system may be local, for example, integrated into a sensor <b>112</b> in sensor array <b>110</b> or into local analysis system <b>120</b>. The data logging system may also be remote, for example, integrated into remote analysis system <b>150</b> or an independent system. The data logging system may also use distributed resources to record data. The data logging system may store data on any suitable data store, such as, for example, data store <b>1740</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The data logging system may record data streams as one or more data sets. A data set comprises one or more data from a data stream. Data sets may be categorized and formed based on a variety of criteria. As an example and not by way of limitation, a data stream could be recorded as one or more data sets based on the specific subject, sensor, time period, event, or other criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">In particular embodiments, one or more data sets from a data stream may be used to construct a binary decision diagram (BDD) representing the data sets.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Data Aggregation</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In particular embodiments, the components of sensor network <b>100</b> may utilize a data aggregation system to process one or more data streams for use by analysis system <b>180</b> or display system <b>190</b>. In particular embodiments, one or more nodes <b>114</b> may be data aggregation systems. As an example and not by way of limitation, a data aggregation system may monitor, synchronize, store, or analyze one or more data streams from one or more sensors <b>112</b> in sensor array <b>110</b>. As another example and not by way of limitation, the data aggregation system may analyze one or more data streams from one or more sensors and generate one or more derivative data streams that may be synchronized, stored, and transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In particular embodiments, the data aggregation system may access the data streams from one or more sensors <b>112</b>. A data stream from a sensor <b>112</b> may be transmitted to a data aggregation system over any suitable medium. As an example and not by way of limitation, a data aggregation system may be connected to one or more sensors by one or more connections <b>116</b>. The data aggregation system may include one or more connection interfaces, such as, for example, a USB interface, a Firewire interface, a 802.11 interface, a Bluetooth interface, another suitable connection interface, or two or more such interfaces. Although this disclosure describes particular connection interfaces, this disclosure contemplates any suitable connection interface.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In particular embodiments, a data aggregation system may access data streams from one or more sensors <b>112</b> and synchronize the data streams. The data aggregation system may include one or more system clocks that may run synchronously or asynchronously of one or more other components in sensor network <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the system clock may be integrated into the data aggregation system. In other embodiments, the system clock may reference one or more external time systems, such as a clock in sensor array <b>110</b>, sensor <b>112</b>, analysis system <b>180</b>, display system <b>190</b>, or another suitable system. One or more sensors <b>112</b> may have one or more sample frequencies or transmission frequencies. The sample frequencies and transmission frequencies of a sensor <b>112</b> in sensor array <b>110</b> may differ from the sample frequencies or transmission frequencies of one or more other sensors <b>112</b> in sensor array <b>110</b>. As an example and not by way of limitation, a first data stream from a first sensor <b>112</b> may comprise a tuple (s<b>1</b>, t<b>1</b>) representing a sample s<b>1</b> with a local timestamp t<b>1</b> based on a local clock on the first sensor <b>112</b>. A second data stream from a second sensor <b>112</b> may comprise a tuple (s<b>2</b>, t<b>2</b>) representing a sample s<b>2</b> with a local timestamp t<b>2</b> based on a local clock on the second sensor <b>112</b>. If the first sensor <b>112</b> and the second sensor <b>112</b> are not synchronized with each other, then samples s<b>1</b> and s<b>2</b> may have been taken at the same absolute time even though timestamps t<b>1</b> and t<b>2</b> are not the same value. In particular embodiments, the data aggregation system may synchronize the first and second data streams by associating a system timestamp with each sample based on a system clock integrated into the data aggregation system. As an example and not by way of limitation, the data aggregation system may associate the system timestamp with each sample when the sample arrives at the data aggregation system. The data aggregation system may assign the samples a timestamp t&#x2032; based on the system clock. The data aggregation system may overwrite the local timestamps, resulting in tuples (s<b>1</b>, t&#x2032;) and (s<b>2</b>, t&#x2032;), or the data aggregation system may add the timestamp t&#x2032; to the tuples, resulting in tuples (s<b>1</b>, t<b>1</b>, t&#x2032;) and (s<b>2</b>, t<b>2</b>, t&#x2032;). As another example and not by way of limitation, the data aggregation system may synchronize the local clocks on one or more sensors <b>112</b>. The data aggregation system may periodically broadcast the system clock time to connected sensors <b>112</b>. The connected sensors <b>112</b> may then adjust their internal clocks to match the broadcasted system clock's time. The connected sensors <b>112</b> may still sample and transmit data at frequencies independent of each other and of the data aggregation system, however when a connected sensor <b>112</b> takes a sample, it may associate the sample with a system timestamp based on the connected sensor's <b>112</b> internal clock. In this manner, when the samples taken by the connected sensors <b>112</b> reach the data aggregation system, the tuples will be (s<b>1</b>, t&#x2032;) and (s<b>2</b>, t&#x2032;). In particular embodiments, analysis of the data streams may be more accurate and precise when the data streams are synchronized. As an example and not by way of limitation, sensor array <b>110</b> may include an accelerometer and a pulse oximeter. If the data streams from the two sensors are not synchronized, an analysis system <b>180</b> may not be able to accurately determine correlations between blood-oxygen levels and activity. Synchronizing data streams may allow more accurate analysis of the data streams for, in the case of this example, the causes of sudden blood-oxygen level changes. Although this disclosure describes a data aggregation system synchronizing particular data streams in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates the data aggregation system synchronizing any suitable data streams in any suitable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In particular embodiments, the data aggregation system may store the data streams from one or more sensors <b>112</b>. The data aggregation system may record the data streams and the system timestamps associated with each of the samples. In particular embodiments, the data aggregation system may compress the data streams before storing. As an example and not by way of limitation, the data aggregation system may store the data streams with the system timestamps as one or more binary decision diagrams (BDDs). The data aggregation system may store the data streams with the system timestamps in any suitable, tangible storage medium such as, for example, an SD card, solid state device, hard drive, random access memory, or memory integrated in a web server. Although this disclosure describes a data aggregation system storing data streams in a particular manner, this disclosure contemplates the data aggregation system storing data streams in any suitable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In particular embodiments, the data aggregation system may analyze one or more data streams from one or more sensors <b>112</b> and generate one or more derivative data streams that may be synchronized, stored, and transmitted. The data aggregation system may perform an operation on one or more data streams to generate a derivative data stream.

<p id="p-0129" num="0131">Analysis system <b>180</b> may generate models of various types, including baseline models, statistical models, predictive models, etc. A baseline model is a model that serves as a basis for comparison, and is typically generated using controlled data (i.e., baseline data) over a specified period (i.e., a control period). The control period may be any suitable period. As an example and not by way of limitation, a baseline model of a subject's blood pressure may simply be the subject's average blood pressure calculated from a series of blood-pressure measurements taken over the course of a week by a blood-pressure monitor. A predictive model is a mathematical function (or set of functions) that describe the behavior of a system or object in terms of one or more independent variables. As an example and not by way of limitation, a predictive model that may be used to calculate a physiological state based on one or more actual sensor measurements. A type of predictive model is a statistical model, which is a mathematical function (or set of functions) that describe the behavior of an object of study in terms of random variables and their associated probability distributions. One of the most basic statistical models is the simple linear regression model, which assumes a linear relationship between two measured variables. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system <b>180</b> may compare data from a pulse oximeter and a barometer and identify a linear correlation between a subject's blood-oxygen level and the barometric pressure at the subject's location.

<p id="p-0137" num="0139">Contextualizing and Correlating Data Streams</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0140">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may map one or more data streams over time, allowing the data streams to be compared. Mapping and comparing the data streams allows analysis system <b>180</b> to contextualize and correlate a data set from one data stream with data sets from one or more other data streams.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0141">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may analyze physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental data steams to contextualize one data set with another data set. Contextualizing is the process of interpreting a data set against the background of information provided by one or more data streams. As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may be wearing a heart-rate monitor and an accelerometer, which transmit a heart-rate data stream and an accelerometer data stream, respectively. A data set in the heart-rate data stream may show the user had an elevated heart-rate during a certain time period. Analysis system <b>180</b> may contextualize the heart-rate data by mapping the heart-rate data against data from an accelerometer data stream that shows that the user had an elevated activity during the same time period. A data set may be contextualized using data from a data stream from a sensor <b>112</b> or from fixed data accessed by analysis system <b>180</b>. As another example and not by way of limitation, a data set of a user's heart rate from a heart-rate monitor may be contextualized against a data set of the user's genome.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0142">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may analyze physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental data steams to identify correlations between certain data sets. Correlating is establishing or demonstrating a causal, complementary, parallel, or reciprocal relation between one data set and another data set. As an example and not by way of limitation, there is a positive correlation activity level in a person and the heart rate of the person. Analysis system <b>180</b> may analyze heart-rate data and accelerometer data and establish that when a user increases his activity beyond a certain level, it will cause an increase in his heart-rate and that activity level and heart-rate will increase proportionally until the user's heart-rate reaches a certain rate. The degree of correlation is the degree to which two or more measurements change simultaneously. These correlations may be of varying degrees of dependence (e.g., as determined by a Pearson's product-moment coefficient). In general, analysis system <b>180</b> may make more accurate correlations as more data becomes available from sensor array <b>110</b>. Analysis system <b>180</b> may then use these correlations to generate causality hypotheses of varying degrees of confidence. In general, analysis system <b>180</b> may make more accurate correlations as more data becomes available from sensor array <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0143">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may contextualize and correlate a data set from one or more data streams that exhibits some type of deviation, variability, or change. The deviation, variability, or change in a data stream may be with respect to other data sets in the data stream or with respect to other data streams. By mapping and comparing data streams that exhibits some type of deviation, variability, or change, analysis system <b>180</b> may contextualize and correlate the data streams. This may be useful, for example, to identify the cause of a deviation, variability, or change in a data stream. As an example and not by way of limitation, an elevated heart-rate that coincides with increased activity is typically a normal response. However, a spike in heart-rate that coincides with a marginal elevated physical activity may not be a normal response. Analysis system <b>180</b> could then determine, based on the comparison, whether certain levels of activity produce abnormal heart-rate spikes in the user.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0144">As an example and not by way of limitation, sensor array <b>110</b> may include a heart-rate sensor, a mood sensor <b>400</b> (for collecting subjective stress and behavior information) that is a smart phone, and a GPS system that is built into the smart phone. This system may be used to contextualize and correlate physiological, psychological, behavioral and environmental data streams to diagnose and monitor stress in a user. For example, the heart-rate sensor's data stream may show a spike in the user's heart-rate at certain times of the day or at certain locations. Similarly, mood sensor <b>400</b>'s data stream, when mapped against the heart-rate data, may show these time periods of increased heart-rate correlate to periods when the user indicated that his mood was &#x201c;stressed&#x201d; and his activity was &#x201c;driving.&#x201d; If the user has previously been diagnoses as hypertensive, it may be desirable to avoid these particularly stressful driving situations that cause a spike in the user's heart-rate. These stressful driving situations may be identified by contextualizing the prior data streams against the GPS system's data stream. When the location data from the GPS system is mapped against the prior data streams, it may show the heart-rate spikes, stressed mood, and driving, all occurred at a specific highway interchange. Therefore, by contextualizing the physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental data streams, analysis system <b>180</b> may identify driving on the specific highway interchange as the cause of the user's heart-rate spikes. This could be useful, for example, to allow the user to identify situations to avoid (e.g., the specific highway interchange) and possibly to identify better or healthier alternatives (e.g., taking surface streets).</p>

<p id="p-0144" num="0146">In particular embodiments, one or more sensors <b>112</b> or one or more nodes <b>114</b> in sensor array <b>110</b> may continuously transmit data regarding a subject's health to analysis system <b>180</b>, which may monitor and automatically detect changes in the subject's health state. As used herein, &#x201c;health state&#x201d; refers to a person's physiological and psychological state, including the person's state with respect to pathologies and diseases. By using an integrated sensor array <b>110</b> to monitor physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental data, analysis system <b>180</b> may identify pathologies, disease states, sensitivities, and other health-related states with greater accuracy than is possible with any individual sensor <b>112</b>.</p>

A biomarker is a characteristic that can be measured and evaluated as an indicator of biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses. As an example and not by way of limitation, in a pharmacogenomic context, a biomarker would be a specific genetic variation that correlates with drug response. As another example and not by way of limitation, in a neurochemical context, a biomarker would be a person's subjective stress level that correlates with the person's plasma glucocorticoid level. As yet another example and not by way of limitation, in a neuropsychological context, a biomarker would be a person's serotonin uptake rate that correlates with the person's depression level. As yet another example and not by way of limitation, in a biochemical context, a biomarker would be a person's LDL cholesterol level that correlates with the person's risk of heart disease, such as heart attack.

The accuracy of identification may generally be increased as the number of data streams is increased. Analysis system <b>180</b> may contextualize and correlate data from multiple data streams to eliminate confounders from its data analysis and reduce the likelihood of generating false-positive and false-negative disease-state diagnoses. As an example and not by way of limitation, the hypertension diagnosis system described above may generate a false-positive diagnosis of hypertension if the subject engages in lengthy periods of physical activity, which naturally raise the subject's blood pressure. Therefore, if analysis system <b>180</b> also monitored a heart-rate data stream of the subject, it could eliminate blood pressure data sets that correlate with time periods of high heart-rate, thereby reducing the likelihood of generating an incorrect hypertension diagnosis.</p>

<p id="p-0151" num="0153">Stress Generally</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0154">Stress is a person's total response to environmental demands or pressures. Stress is a state which arises from an actual or perceived demand-capability imbalance in a person. It is a negative emotional experience accompanied by biochemical, physiological, and behavioral changes that are directed either toward altering the stressful event or accommodating it. Stress results from interactions between a person and the environment that are perceived as straining or exceeding the person's adaptive capacities and threatening their well-being. The causes of stress (i.e., stressors) may include any event or occurrence that a person considers a threat to his coping strategies or resources. Stress may cause a variety of physiological, psychological, or behavioral reactions in a person. As an example and not by way of limitation, stress may cause a person's body to release certain hormones and neurotransmitters, such as catecholamines and glucocorticoids.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0155">Catecholamines are neurotransmitters in the sympathetic nervous system. Catecholamines are synthesized from tyrosine. They are also released into the blood during times of psychological or physiological stress. High catecholamine levels in blood are associated with stress. The major catecholamines are dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). Catecholamines are synthesized in the brain and other neural tissue. Catecholamines are also produced by the adrenal glands and secreted into the blood. Norepinephrine and dopamine act as neuromodulators in the central nervous system and as hormones in the blood circulation. Norepinephrine is a neuromodulator of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system but is also present in the blood (mostly through &#x201c;spillover&#x201d; from the synapses of the sympathetic system). Catecholamines may cause general physiological changes that prepare the body for physical activity (&#x201c;fight-or-flight&#x201d; response). Some typical effects include increases in heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system. Some drugs, like tolcapone (a central COMT-inhibitor), raise the levels of all the catecholamines by blocking their degradation post-release.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0156">Epinephrine is an important catecholamine that acts primarily on muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver. Epinephrine increases delivery of O<sub>2 </sub>to muscle tissue by increasing heart rate and blood pressure, and dilating respiratory passages. Epinephrine increases production of glucose by activating glycogen phosphorylase and inactivating glycogen synthase, thus simulating gluconeogenesis in the liver. Epinephrine promotes the anaerobic breakdown of glycogen in skeletal muscle into lactate by fermentation, thus stimulating glycolytic ATP formation. The stimulation of glycolysis is accomplished by raising the concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate, an allosteric activator of the glycolytic enzyme phosphofructokinase-1. Finally, epinephrine stimulates glucagon secretion and inhibits insulin secretion.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0157">Glucocorticoids are a class of steroid hormones that bind to the glucocorticoid receptor. Glucocorticoids have many diverse (pleiotropic) effects, including potentially harmful effects. Glucocorticoids cause their effects by binding to the glucocorticoid receptor. The activated glucocorticoid receptor complex up-regulates the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins in the nucleus (a process known as transactivation) and represses the expression of pro-inflammatory proteins in the cytosol by preventing the translocation of other transcription factors from the cytosol into the nucleus (transrepression).</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0158">Cortisol (or hydrocortisone) is the most important human glucocorticoid. It is essential for life, and it regulates or supports a variety of important cardiovascular, metabolic, immunologic, and homeostatic functions. A variety of stressors (anxiety, fear, pain, hemorrhage, infections, low blood glucose, etc.) stimulate release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. Cortisol acts on muscle, liver, and adipose tissue to supply the person with fuel for impending intense activity. Cortisol is a relatively slow-acting hormone that alters metabolism by changing the kinds and amounts of certain enzymes that are newly synthesized in its target cell, rather than by regulating existing enzyme molecules. In adipose tissue, cortisol stimulates the release of fatty acids from stored triacylglycerols. The fatty acids are exported to the blood to serve as fuel for various tissues, and the glycerol resulting from triacylglycerol breakdown is used for gluconeogenesis in the liver. Cortisol stimulates the breakdown of nonessential muscle proteins and the export of amino acids to the liver where they serve as precursors for gluconeogenesis. In the liver, cortisol promotes gluconeogenesis by stimulating synthesis of the key enzyme PEP carboxykinase; glucagon also has this effect, whereas insulin has the opposite effect. Glucose produced in this way is stored in the liver as glycogen, or exported immediately by tissues that need glucose for fuel. The net effect of these metabolic changes is to elevate blood glucose levels and to store glycogen to support the fight-or-flight response commonly associated with stress. Consequently, the effects of stress hormones, such as cortisol, may counterbalance those of insulin.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0159">Symptoms of stress may be psychological, physiological, or behavioral. Symptoms include poor judgment, depression, anxiety, moodiness, irritability, agitation, loneliness, various muscle complaints, headaches, diarrhea or constipation, nausea, dizziness, chest pain, elevated heart-rate, irregular eating, irregular sleeping, social withdrawal, procrastination or neglect of responsibilities, drug and alcohol abuse, and other abnormal or irregular behaviors.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0160">Measuring Stress</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0161">In particular embodiments, sensor network <b>100</b> may analyze physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental data streams to diagnose and monitor stress in a user. Sensor array <b>110</b> may intermittently or continuously transmit physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental data streams to analysis system <b>180</b>. Analysis system <b>180</b> may analyze one or more of these data streams to determine the stress index of the user. Any combination of two or more sensors may be used to generate a stress index value. These stress index values may be improved and calibrated by monitoring a person over time to determine when a change in physiological state is due to stress or due to a non-stress related event (such as, for example, exercise, dehydration). The stress-induced physiological changes may be used to establish a baseline physiological state for a person and a range of physiological variation associated with stress. A person may also engage in a training or control period during which the person's input or feedback may be used to engage machine-learning algorithms to develop a stress model that allows the person's stress index to be calculated. Similarly, machine learning may be used to correlate physiological stress responses with changes in psychological, behavioral, or environmental state.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0162">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may access physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental data previously generated to compare it to current physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental data. Analysis system <b>180</b> may also access a stress index previously determined to compare it to a current stress index. Based on the comparison, analysis system <b>180</b> may then determine whether the user's stress level has changed over time. Analysis system <b>180</b> may also model the stress level with respect to time and identify any trends in the stress level of the user. Based on these changes and trends in stress level, various alerts or warnings may be provided to the user or to a third-party (e.g., the user's physician).</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0163">Analysis system <b>180</b> may use a variety of scales, both qualitative and quantitative, for assessing the stress level in a person. The stress level of a person may be quantified using a stress index, which may be any suitable scale for measuring or valuing stress. Analysis system <b>180</b> may quantify stress by combining data from multiple sensors <b>112</b>. The simplest approach would be to assign a single numerical value, i.e., a stress index. Further refinements could be developed, such as, for example, a transient stress index, a stress load, a stress-resilience coefficient, or other suitable stress measurements. As an example and not by way of limitation, analysis system <b>180</b> could grade the stress level of a person on a 0-to-4 Liker scale, where the five-level Likert item may be:
<ul id="ul0007" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0007-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0008" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0008-0001" num="0164">0. Very unstressed</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0002" num="0165">1. Moderately unstressed</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0003" num="0166">2. Neither stressed nor unstressed</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0004" num="0167">3. Moderately stressed</li>
        <li id="ul0008-0005" num="0168">4. Very stressed</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0169">Other suitable Likert items may be used. The Likert items may be analyzed as interval-level data or as ordered-categorical data. As another example and not by way of limitation, analysis system <b>180</b> could grade the stress level of a person on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 is the user's baseline stress when relaxed and resting and 100 is the user's maximum stress. A stress index may be scaled on an absolute scale or scaled on an individual scale. As an example and not by way of limitation, two users experiencing the same stress experience would report identical stress levels on an absolute stress index. However, two users experiencing the same stress experience may report different stress levels on individual stress indexes. A first user's baseline stress when relaxed may report a stress index of 0, which is different from a second user's baseline stress when relaxed and may also report a stress index of 0. Similarly, a first user may only have a minor stress response to a particular stress while a second user may have a major stress response to the same stressor. In particular embodiments, a stress index may be a multidimensional index. As an example and not by way of limitation, the stress index may quantify a person's transient stress (i.e., the change in stress caused by a stressor), baseline stress (i.e., the person's stress when in a normal state), and stress resilience (i.e., the rate at which a patient recovers from a stressor). In particular embodiments, a stress factor may be assigned to particular stressor or therapy. A stress factor is the change in a person's stress index associated with a particular stressor or therapy. As an example and not by way of limitation, driving in traffic may increase a person's stress index by 10 points on a 0-to-100 stress scale, while doing deep breathing exercises may decrease the person's stress index by 8 points. Although this disclosure describes particular stress indexes using particular scales for assessing the stress level in a person, this disclosure contemplates any suitable stress indexes using any suitable scales for assessing the stress level in a person.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0170">Stress may be measured using a variety of methods. As an example and not by way of limitation, stress may be measured by analyzing heart-rate variability, stress-related analytes, and self-reported subjective stress.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0171">Stress may be measured by accessing data from a heat-rate monitor and analyzing heart-rate variability. Heart-rate variability is typically measured using a pulse oximeter, which may measure the heart rate and blood oxygenation levels of a person. The basic technique of quantifying stress by using heart-rate variability and associating different frequency bands with activation of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems comes from work in the 1980's (e.g., Pagani et al., 1986). By creating a ratio of the two frequency bands, a quantitative measure (&#x201c;sympathovagal balance&#x201d; (Pagani et al., 1986; Bigger et al., 1992)) comparing the relative activations is created, which the literature represents as the stress level of the person. This idea is refined to be more robust to signal noise and is described more fully in later literature (Albrecht &#x26; Cohen, 1988; Rottman et al., 1990; Bigger et al., 1992). Parati et al. (1995) provides a survey of spectral analysis applied to HRV and blood pressure variability. They include some reasoning for the choice of HF (parasympathetic control) being defined as frequencies above 0.15 Hz. and LF (sympathetic control) being defined as frequencies below 0.15 Hz (but likely above 0.07 Hz). They also note that these measures incompletely account for the actions of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems, so that the ratio measure give a value that we associate with high stress but is actually due to some other phenomenon. A detailed discussion of the difficulty in measuring heart-rate variability can be found in Clifford (2002).</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0172">Stress may also be measured by accessing data from a biosensor and analyzing stress-related analyte levels, such as glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels. Various means may be used to measure glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels, including immunoassays and various chromatography techniques. The biosensors may measure and transmit information regarding the user's analyte levels. Analysis system <b>180</b> may then analyze this analyte data by inputting it into a stress model that correlates stress-related analyte levels with stress to calculate the user's stress index.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0173">Stress may also be measured by accessing self-reported stress information, such as, for example, from one or more user-input sensors that may receive information on a user's subjective experience of stress. A user's psychological stress may be a biomarker for the user's physiological stress response. The user's subjective experience of stress may be used to indirectly measure the user's physiological stress, for example, by correlating the user's subjective experience of stress with the user's glucocorticoid level. The user-input sensor may measure and transmit information regarding the user's psychological stress levels. Analysis system <b>180</b> may then analyze this psychological data by inputting it into a stress model that correlates psychological stress levels with stress to calculate the user's stress index.</p>

<p id="p-0169" num="0176">Measuring and monitoring stress is a major challenge for present devices. The physiological response to stress may vary from person to person in type as well as extent. This causes a problem in creating a generalized method for measuring and monitoring stress in humans. The major changes during stress are observed in the sympathetic nervous system. The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for up- and down-regulating many homeostatic mechanisms in living organisms. Fibers from the sympathetic nervous system innervate tissues in almost every organ system, providing at least some regulatory function to things as diverse as pupil diameter, gut motility, and urinary output. It is perhaps best known for mediating the neuronal and hormonal stress response. Therefore, one method of measuring stress may involve measuring and monitoring the response of sympathetic nerves, such as in the kidney, where such nerves are rich.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0177">The kidneys serve essential regulatory roles in most animals, including vertebrates and some invertebrates. They are essential in the urinary system and also serve homeostatic functions (such as, for example, the regulation of electrolytes, maintenance of acid-base balance, and regulation of blood pressure). The kidneys serve the body as a natural filter of the blood, and remove wastes which are diverted to the urinary bladder. In producing urine, the kidneys excrete wastes such as urea and ammonium; the kidneys also are responsible for the reabsorption of water, glucose, and amino acids. The kidneys also produce hormones including calcitriol, renin, and erythropoietin. Located at the rear of the abdominal cavity in the retroperitoneum, the kidneys receive blood from the paired renal arteries, and drain into the paired renal veins. Each kidney excretes urine into a ureter, itself a paired structure that empties into the urinary bladder.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0178">The kidney participates in whole-body homeostasis by regulating acid-base balance, electrolyte concentrations, extracellular fluid volume, and blood pressure. The kidney accomplishes these homeostatic functions both independently and in concert with other organs (i.e., both extra-renal and intra-renal mechanisms), particularly those of the endocrine system. Various endocrine hormones coordinate these endocrine functions, such as, for example, renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone, and atrial natriuretic peptide.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0179">Many of the kidney's functions are accomplished by relatively simple mechanisms of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion, which take place in the nephron. Filtration, which takes place at the renal corpuscle, is the process by which cells and large proteins are filtered from the blood to make an ultrafiltrate that eventually becomes urine. The typical human kidney generates 180 liters of filtrate a day, while reabsorbing a large percentage, allowing for only the generation of approximately 2 liters of urine. Reabsorption is the transport of molecules from this ultrafiltrate and into the blood. Secretion is the reverse process, in which molecules are transported in the opposite direction, from the blood into the urine.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0180">The sympathetic nervous system is an integral part of the homeostatic control system that maintains normal kidney function, with an extensive network of nerves identified in most renal tissues. The sympathetic nervous system modulates short-term regulation of renal function, and under normal conditions renal sympathetic nerve activity is low. During acute stress, however, elevated renal sympathetic activity depresses renal function. Chronic stress studies have been less conclusive and are difficult to design due to additional pathologies induced by stress, such as hypertension and cardiovascular complications. Major renal effects of mental stress include increased renal vasoconstriction, causing greater renal vascular resistance (RVR), and increased Na<sup>+</sup> transport, causing greater Na<sup>+</sup> retention. Both of these effects may contribute to the development of hypertension, and some investigators propose that this may be the primary mechanism of hypertension. Therefore, most studies on the renal effects of stress have focused on its relationship to hypertension. Though the effects of stress are more pronounced in hypertensive subjects, stress increases renal vasoconstriction and Na<sup>+</sup> retention in normal subjects as well.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0181">The systemic blood pressure determines the renal perfusion pressure (RPP) and is a major determinant of renal vascular resistance. The kidney has a unique ability to efficiently auto-regulate its own blood flow over a wide range of renal perfusion pressures. Renal blood flow (RBF) changes very little over a large range of renal perfusion pressures, thus helping to maintain a stable renal vascular resistance. This is due to the fine control of vascular tone in the primary renal resistance vessels, the pre-glomerular afferent arterioles, and the post-glomerular efferent arterioles. However, many hormonal and neural disturbances can alter auto-regulation, often targeting these arterioles, leading to inappropriate increases in renal vascular resistance. Increased sympathetic activity increases arteriolar resistance and renal vascular resistance. Increased renal vascular resistance exacerbates hypertension via its contribution to overall increased total peripheral resistance (since renal blood flow is 20-25% of cardiac output) and its ability to promote Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption. Stress can induce both neural and hormonal changes that affect renal vascular resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0182">Renal blood flow correlates with stress and therefore changes in renal blood flow may be significant indicators of stress. A user's stress level may be determined from renal blood flow information. Changes in a person's renal resistive index or renal vascular resistance may be used to detect the person's physiological or psychological responses to stress. As an example and not by way of limitation, a higher renal resistive index (renal RI) corresponds to a higher stress level. Similarly, a lower renal RI corresponds to a lower stress level (i.e., a relaxed state). Renal blood flow information may then be used to generate or validate stress models. Doppler sonography (pulse or continuous) may be used to measure the renal arterial blood flow. A renal Doppler sonograph may also include information about the peak blood pulse. The pulse peak can be used along with electrocardiograph information to measure pulse wave transit time, which can be used to measure renal blood pressure. Analysis system <b>180</b> may then use the renal blood flow information to measure and monitor stress in the person.</p>

<p id="p-0211" num="0226">Continuous Monitoring of Stress Using Self-Reported Psychological or Behavioral Data</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0227">One problem in measuring and monitoring stress accurately is determining whether any changes in measured parameters are taking place due to non-stress related activity from the user that confound the analysis (i.e., confounding factors). Various physiological sensors may be used in an attempt to measure stress, such as, for example, heart-rate monitors, blood-pressure monitors, pulse oximeters, or respiration sensors. However, physiological changes that correlate with stress may actually be caused by non-stress events. For example, an increase in heart rate is associated with an increase in stress, but it is also associated with exercise, which may in fact cause a decrease in stress. Similarly, physiological or psychological data indicating stress may be due to confounding factors and may in fact be contradicted by a patient's self-reported non-stressed state. By using a mood sensor or behavioral sensor, such as mood sensor <b>400</b>, a patient may input psychological data (e.g., happy, anxious, sad, stressed) or behavioral data (e.g., running, driving, fighting, working). By contextualizing physiological sensor data with this psychological or behavioral data, analysis system <b>180</b> may be able to eliminate changes in physiological data caused by non-stress related events and thereby more accurately measure and monitor stress in a person.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0228">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may measure and monitor stress by analyzing one or more data streams from one or more mood sensors, such as, for example, mood sensor <b>400</b>. A user may input psychological (i.e., mood) information into mood sensor <b>400</b>. A mood sensor may receive information regarding a user's subjective experience of stress. A user's subjective experience of stress may act as a biomarker for various physiological states, including, for example, the user's glucocorticoid and catecholamine levels. The user may input stress, for example, on mood input widget <b>430</b>. The user could then input an intensity of the stress, for example, on mood intensity widget <b>440</b>. After receiving the user's mood information, the mood sensor may then transmit one or more data streams comprising the user's mood data to analysis system <b>180</b>. As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may report mood information by inputting that he is &#x201c;stressed&#x201d; with an intensity of 2 on a 0-to-4 Likert scale using mood input widget <b>430</b> and mood intensity widget <b>440</b>. A mood sensor may also receive information regarding a user's general psychological state, which may correlate with stress. As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may report mood information by inputting that he is &#x201c;angry&#x201d; with an intensity of 3 on a 0-to-4 Likert scale. Analysis system <b>180</b> may then analyze this mood and mood intensity data by inputting it into a stress model that correlates psychological states with stress to calculate the user's stress index. Analysis system <b>180</b> may continuously monitor a data stream containing psychological data, thereby allowing it to accurately measure and monitor a user's stress and stress-related health states. Although this disclosure describes measuring and monitoring stress using particular types of mood sensors, this disclosure contemplates measuring and monitoring stress using any suitable mood sensors.</p>

A user's behavior information may be correlated with other stress-related data. A user may input behavioral (i.e., activity) information into mood sensor <b>400</b>. The user may input a behavior, for example, on activity input widget <b>450</b>. After receiving the user's behavioral information, the behavioral sensor may then transmit one or more data streams comprising the user's behavioral data to analysis system <b>180</b>. As an example and not by way of limitation, a user may report behavioral data by inputting that he is &#x201c;driving&#x201d; using activity input widget <b>450</b>. Analysis system <b>180</b> may then analyze this behavioral data by inputting it into a stress model that correlates behavioral states with stress to calculate the user's stress index. Alternatively, analysis system <b>180</b> may calculate the user's stress index using other factors and then correlate a user's stress with specific behaviors by the user. Similarly, analysis system <b>180</b> may correlate a user's lack of stress (i.e., relaxation) with specific behavior or activities by the user. Analysis system <b>180</b> may continuously monitor a data stream containing behavioral data, thereby allowing it to accurately measure and monitor a user's stress and stress-related health states.

<p id="p-0225" num="0249">As discussed previously, one problem in measuring and monitoring stress accurately is determining whether any changes in measured parameters are taking place due to non-stress related activity (such as, for example, by the user) that confound the analysis. Various physiological sensors may be used in an attempt to measure stress, such as, for example, heart-rate monitors, blood-pressure monitors, pulse oximeters, or respiration sensors. However, physiological changes that correlate with stress may actually be caused by non-stress events. For example, increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration are associated with increases in stress, but they are also associated with physical movement, which may be caused by a non-stress event (such as, for example, exercise). Physical exertion changes heart rate, blood pressure, heart rate variability, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, sweat and galvanic skin response, as well as blood glucose level. All of these can be used as crucial markers for accurately estimating stress. For example, when using heart-rate variability to measure stress, the results may be confounded if physical movement and exertion is not taken into account during the stress measurement. Furthermore, many sensors provide erroneous data when accelerated, for example, because the physical connection between the sensor and the subject moves, causing the sensor to generate an inaccurate or false reading. By using an accelerometer (or another suitable movement sensor, such as, for example, a kinesthetic sensor), analysis system <b>180</b> may monitor the physical movement and exertion of a person. By contextualizing physiological sensor data with accelerometer data, analysis system <b>180</b> may be able to eliminate changes in physiological data or erroneous sensor measurements caused by physical movement and thereby more accurately measure and monitor stress in a person.</p>

After measuring the person's physical motion, the physical motion sensor may then transmit one or more data streams comprising the user's physical motion data to analysis system <b>180</b>. Analysis system <b>180</b> may then analyze this physical motion by inputting it into a stress model that correlates physical motion with stress to calculate the person's stress index.

<p id="p-0243" num="0268">Continuous Monitoring of Stress Using Environmental Data</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0269">Another problem in measuring and monitoring stress accurately is determining whether any changes in measured parameters are caused by environmental (i.e., exogenous) factors. Various physiological sensors may be used in an attempt to measure stress, such as, for example, heart-rate monitors, blood-pressure monitors, pulse oximeters, or respiration sensors. However, because stress is often caused by environmental factors, determining the causes of stress may be impossible by monitoring physiological sensors alone. Various environmental sensors may be used in an attempt to monitor stress, such as, for example, barometers, location sensors, traffic sensors, or data feeds. For example, increases in heart rate, blood pressure, and respiration in a person are associated with increases in stress in the person. But measuring merely these physiological may tell nothing about the cause of stress in the person. These physiological responses may be caused by environmental stressors, such as, for example, changing weather, changing the person's location, encountering traffic, or receiving news from a data feed. Most current methods for measuring stress only consider physiological data associated with the subject, thus removing the analysis from its context. Consequently, it may be difficult to establish the causes of stress without an understanding of environmental factors that may act as stressors. By contextualizing physiological sensor data with this environmental data, analysis system <b>180</b> may be able to identify changes in physiological data caused by exogenous events and thereby more accurately measure and monitor stress in a person, and more accurately identify the environmental causes of stress (i.e., stressors) for the person.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0270">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may measure and monitor stress by analyzing one or more data streams from one or more environmental sensors. The environmental sensors may include, for example, a barometer, a weather sensor, a pollen counter, a location sensor, a seismometer, an altimeter, a hydrometer, a decibel meter, a light meter, a thermometer, a wind sensor, a traffic sensor, another suitable environmental sensor, or two or more such sensors. As used herein, the term &#x201c;environmental sensor&#x201d; is used broadly. For example, a canary in a cage, as used by miners to warn of gas, could be considered an environmental sensor. One or more of the environmental sensors may be a data feed. The data feeds may include, for example, a stock-market ticker, a weather report, a news feed, a traffic-condition update, a public-health notice, an electronic calendar, a social network news feed, another suitable data feed, or two or more such data feeds. The environmental sensors may then transmit one or more data streams comprising the environmental data to analysis system <b>180</b>. Analysis system <b>180</b> may then analyze this environmental data by inputting it into a stress model that correlates environmental states with stress to calculate the person's stress index. Analysis system <b>180</b> may also analyze this environmental data to identify events that may act as stressors on a person. Analysis system <b>180</b> may continuously monitor a data stream containing environmental data, thereby allowing it to accurately measure and monitor exogenous events that may cause stress in a person. Although this disclosure describes measuring and monitoring stress using particular types of environmental sensors, this disclosure contemplates measuring and monitoring stress using any suitable environmental sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0271">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may access one or more data streams from an environmental sensor and one or more of other sensors <b>112</b> to measure and monitor stress in a person. The data streams may comprise environmental data and one or more of psychological data of the person, behavioral of the person, or physiological data of the person. In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may access data streams from an environmental sensor and one or more of a mood sensor, a heart-rate monitor, a blood-pressure monitor, a pulse oximeter, or an accelerometer. Although this disclosure describes accessing particular sensors <b>112</b> and particular data streams to measure and monitor stress in a person, this disclosure contemplates accessing any suitable sensors <b>112</b> and any suitable data streams to measure and monitor stress in a person.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0272">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may access a plurality of data sets from the data streams to measure and monitor stress in a person. A typical diagnostic test involves generating at least two data sets, wherein the data sets are collected when the environmental states are different between at least two of the data sets. The data sets may include one or more data sets from one or more sensors <b>112</b> in sensor array <b>110</b>. As an example and not by way of limitation, a first data set may be collected when the environmental data indicates a first state, and a second data set may be collected when the environmental data indicates a second state. As another example and not by way of limitation, a first data set may be collected when the person is exposed to a particular stressor, and a second data set may be collected when the person is not exposed to the particular stressor. As yet another example and not by way of limitation, a first data set may be collected when the person is substantially stressed, and a second data set may be collected when the person is substantially unstressed. As yet another example and not by way of limitation, a first data set may be collected when the person is engaged in a first activity, and a second data set may be collected when the person is engaged in a second activity. Analysis system <b>180</b> may then use the environmental data to deconfound the data from other sensors <b>112</b> to determine whether measured changes in the physiological state of a person are caused by stress or non-stress related events. The accuracy of determining stress in a person may generally be increased as the number of data sets is increased. Therefore, multiple data sets may be generated and analyzed to determine stress in a person. Although this disclosure describes accessing particular data sets to measure and monitor stress in a person, this disclosure contemplates accessing any suitable data sets to measure and monitor stress in a person.</p>

<p id="p-0263" num="0289">Calculating and Monitoring a Composite Stress Index</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0290">Measuring and quantifying stress levels is difficult because there are a variety of physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental factors that may contribute to a person's stress response. For example, physiological stress represents a wide range of physical responses that occur as a direct result of a stressor causing an upset in the homeostasis of the body. Upon immediate disruption of either psychological or physiological equilibrium, the body responds by stimulating the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. The reaction of these systems causes a number of physiological changes that have both short-term and long-term effects on the body. However, physiological stress may be caused internally or by psychological, behavioral, or environmental factors. Therefore, a composite stress index capable of quantifying stress caused by a variety of sources is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0291">Particular stressors may be associated with particular changes in the stress index of a person (i.e., stress factors). For example, one could have a &#x201c;meeting stress factor,&#x201d; a &#x201c;traffic stress factor,&#x201d; a &#x201c;social-engagement stress factor,&#x201d; an &#x201c;economic-change stress factor,&#x201d; and so on. Therefore, the stress index may be calibrated with respect to specific stressors. Each person may have personalized responses and recovery patterns for each type of stressor, indicating a variety of stress factors and stress resilience coefficients. Analysis system <b>180</b> may be used to measure and monitor stress factors and stress resilience. This may allow a user to determine the types of stressors that lead to different resilience patterns in a given individual or population, which may be useful for helping with stress management.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0292">In particular embodiments, a stress factor may be assigned to a particular stressor. A stress factor is the change in a person's stress index associated with a particular stressor or therapy. Thus, a person's stress after being exposed to a particular stressor is based on the person's stress before being exposed to the particular stressor and the stress factor associated with the stressor. As an example and not by way of limitation, a person's current stress index may be SI=f(SI<sub>0</sub>, SF<sub>i</sub>), where SI is the current stress index of the person, SI<sub>0</sub>, is the stress index of the person before being exposed to stressor i, and SF<sub>i </sub>is the stress factor associated with stressor i. In particular embodiments, the stress factor may be added to the prior stress index of a person to calculate a current stress index. As an example and not by way of limitation, a minor stressor, such a attempting to solve relatively simple mathematical questions, may increase a person's stress index by 5 points on a 0-to-100 stress scale, while a major stressor, such as have an argument with one's spouse, may increase a person's stress index by 20 points on the same stress scale. Thus, the minor stress would be assigned a stress factor of (+5)/100 and the major stressor would be assigned a stress factor of (+20)/100. In particular embodiments, the stress factor may be used to perform a mathematical operation other than simple linear addition (such as, for example, multiplication, division, exponentiation, negation, trigonometric function, or other suitable mathematical operations) or be used as part of a mathematical function to calculate the current stress index of a person. Although this disclosure describes assigning particular stress factors with particular stressors, this disclosure contemplates assigning any suitable stress factors with any suitable stressors.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0293">In particular embodiments, analysis system <b>180</b> may measure and monitor stressors by analyzing data streams from the following three groups of sensors <b>112</b>: (1) one or more physiological sensors; (2) one or more deconfounding sensors; and (3) one or more stressor sensors. Analysis system <b>180</b> may measure one or more physiological parameters from the sensors <b>112</b> in the first group. Then data from the sensors <b>112</b> in the second group may be used to deconfound the physiological data from the first group to determine whether physiological changes are actually caused by stress and not a non-stress related event. Finally, the data from the sensors <b>112</b> in the third group may measure changes in psychological, behavioral, or environmental states that may act as stressors. After the sensors <b>112</b> in the three groups take appropriate measurements, the sensors <b>112</b> may then transmit one or more data streams comprising the user's physiological data and other data to analysis system <b>180</b>.

<p id="p-0286" num="0313">Calculating and Monitoring the Efficacy of Stress-Related Therapies</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0314">Another problem with measuring and monitoring stress accurately is determining whether particular stress-reduction therapies are effective. Many different techniques for stress reduction exist. Quantifying the effectiveness of stress reduction may be done by contextualizing the therapy with a variety of data, such as, for example, physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental data. An appropriate stress management approach may differ based upon the nature of the stressor or the person. For example, for a particular person, breathing exercises may be more effective than cognitive reframing when the stress is caused by a domestic argument, while the reverse may be true when the stress is cause by work-related stress. Consequently, a system capable of quantifying the effectiveness of stress reduction techniques for a particular person is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0315">Particular therapies may be associated with particular changes in the stress index of a person (i.e., stress factors). For example, one could have a &#x201c;meditation stress factor,&#x201d; a &#x201c;biofeedback stress factor,&#x201d; a &#x201c;cognitive reframing stress factor,&#x201d; an &#x201c;intervention stress factor,&#x201d; and so on. Therefore, the stress index may be calibrated with respect to specific therapies. Each person may have personalized responses and recovery patterns for each type of therapy, indicating a variety of stress factors and stress resilience coefficients. Analysis system <b>180</b> may be used to measure and monitor stress factors and stress resilience. This may allow a user to determine the types of therapies that are most effective in a given individual or population, which may be useful for helping with stress management.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0316">In particular embodiments, a stress factor may be assigned to particular therapy. A stress factor is the change in a person's stress index associated with a particular stressor or therapy. As an example and not by way of limitation, a minor therapy, such a short breathing exercise, may decrease a person's stress index by 8 points on a 0-to-100 stress scale, while a therapy stressor, such as an hour of meditation, may decrease a person's stress index by 30 points on the same stress scale. Thus, the minor therapy would be assigned a stress factor of (&#x2212;8)/100 and the major stressor would be assigned a stress factor of (&#x2212;30)/100. Although this disclosure describes assigning particular stress factors with particular stressors, this disclosure contemplates assigning any suitable stress factors with any suitable stressors.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0317">In particular embodiments, a person may engage in a variety of stress-related therapies. Stress-related therapies may include, for example, interventions, biofeedback, breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation exercises, presentation of personal media (e.g., music, personal pictures, etc.), offering an exit strategy (e.g., calling the user so he has an excuse to leave a stressful situation), references to a range of psychotherapeutic techniques, and graphical representations of trends (e.g., illustrations of health metrics over time), cognitive reframing therapy, other suitable stress-related therapies, or two or more such therapies. A person may receive a stress-related therapy in a variety of ways, such as, for example, from a third-person (e.g., a physician or therapist), from himself (e.g., self-relaxation techniques), from display system <b>190</b> (e.g., displaying a stress-related therapy), or from another suitable source. Analysis system <b>180</b> may receive input describing the therapies, such as the type, duration, and source of the therapy. Analysis system <b>180</b> may then contextualize stress index data with the therapy data to calculate the stress factor for the therapy.

<p id="p-0308" num="0336">In this experiment, changes in either the renal blood flow in the main renal artery or in the intra-renal artery were measured in a patient in relaxed and stressed states. Renal blood flow was measured using a renal-pulse Doppler. Most readings were taken on the renal artery, as it is assumed that the best and most stable change in renal blood flow is reflected in the main artery near the kidney. The hypothesis for these experiments was that renal resistive index (renal RI) will increase with stress and decrease with relaxation.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0337">Measurement Strategy: The first measurement is taken as soon as the experiment starts. This reading acts as a baseline renal blood flow. In this reading, the stress state is not known, and the patient may be in a stressed or relaxed state. After taking the initial reading, the patient is asked to relax (i.e., self-relaxation). In this method, the patient attempts to relax by himself with no external disturbance provided. The person is then asked to signal when he feels relaxed. After the person signals, another measurement is taken. After taking the measurements, the person is subjected to forced relaxation, which can include talking, telling jokes, etc. After the forced relaxation, another measurement is taken. Next, the person is then subjected to forced stress. The stress may be induced by asking the patient mathematical problems and asking him to orally solve the problems. After the forced stress, another measurement is taken. Next, the patient is again subjected to forced relaxation, and then a measurement is again taken. Finally, the patient is again subjected to forced stress by asking the patient personal questions that are intended to induce stress. After the personal question, a measurement is taken. The measurement strategy ensures that the stress in the person is recorded, and the change from one state to another is also recorded. This should also the impact of various stressors to be discretely analyzed.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0338">Measurement Process: In order to take renal-pulse Doppler measurement in the intra-renal artery, the patient is asked to hold his breath. During this time, the technician focuses on the major artery and takes the measurement. After taking the measurement, the patient can breathe normally. As soon as the question is asked, the patient is again asked to hold his breath and another measurement is taken. This measurement process may be repeated up to five times and the average of the measurement is taken as the reading. The renal-pulse Doppler measurement is used to analyze renal vascular resistance. In the present equipment, a technician manually selects the peak and the trough from the pulse waveform. The machine then uses the peak and trough to calculate the resistive index (RI), which gives an indication of the renal vascular resistance (RVR). The resistive index is calculated from the peak systolic velocity and the lowest diastolic velocity. The peaks and troughs can be identified from the Doppler waveform. RI is equal to the peak systolic velocity (S) minus the lowest diastolic velocity (D), divided by the peak systolic velocity (S). Thus,</p>

<p id="p-0314" num="0342">The pulse Doppler can be taken over an area, which is properly focused. In order to focus the pulse Doppler, external movement should be eliminated. In particular, breathing can cause the kidneys to move up to a half-inch. Due to this movement, a pulse Doppler measurement cannot be taken accurately when the patient is breathing normally. Thus, the patient must hold his breath during the measurement. It is also important to focus the pulse Doppler on the major artery in the kidney for each measurement. The same artery must be used for each measurement because the RI can be different in different arteries. Also, the angle between the beam and the direction of blood flow should be minimized in order to increase the accuracy of the measurement. Furthermore, the measurement angle should be kept constant between measurements. Consequently, the location and angle of all measurements should be the same.</p>

<p id="p-0325" num="0353">Summary of the Trial: The patient's pulse Doppler was measured in either the renal artery or intra-renal artery. Intra-renal artery is likely more responsive to stress, however is it also more sensitive to motion, making it more difficult to take an accurate measurement. The patient had to hold his breath for measurements to be taken, which was detrimental to the experiment. Thus for the further experiments, the main renal Doppler at the start of the renal artery was used. In main renal artery Doppler the measurement is taken from the renal artery at a location beneath stomach instead of at the kidney. Respiration causes less movement at this location, thus making it substantially easier to take measurements without making the patient hold his breath. Furthermore, relatively continuous measurements can be taken at this location, such that changes in RI and S/D ration can be measured effectively as soon as they occur.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0354">Summary: Renal Doppler measurements were taken on the renal artery or intra-renal artery. For the intra-renal artery, the person needed to hold his breath for measurement. Peaks and troughs in the waveform were selected manually. Stress was induced by asking the patient mathematical and personal questions. Changes in RI correlated with the patient's self-reported stress level, such that RI increased with stress.</p>

<p id="p-0328" num="0356">In this experiment, the measurement strategy remained the same as used in example 1. The only difference was that patient did not need to hold his breath during measurements. This second experiment aims to confirm the results of RI dependence on stress and observe if some other correlation is seen between the stress and renal blood flow. New Doppler equipment was used in this experiment which was able to automatically identify peaks and troughs in waveforms, allowing for more accurate measurements. The patient in this experiment was the same as from experiment 1. In this experiment, the person was asked questions continuously and only a brief time period was given to relax between each question. This allowed for measurement of the time needed for a person to recover from stress and particular stressors. This stress-recovery time is inversely proportional to the extent of compensatory mechanism of that person.</p>

<p id="p-0336" num="0364">7. Asking the analytical questions: RI=0.72, 0.69, 0.64, 0.66, 0.69, 0.74.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0365">8. Asking the arithmetic questions: RI=0.74, 0.72, 0.73.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0366">9. The person is asked to undergo self induced stress. RI=0.77, 0.81, 0.84.</p>
<p id="p-0339" num="0367">10. Return to baseline measurement (normal state): RI=0.66, 0.69, and 0.72.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0368">During the continuous measurements, it was observed that it took only 10-12 pulses for the patient to return to a normal (i.e. relaxed) state. This demonstrated the extent of the patient's compensatory mechanisms for dealing with stress. This also indicates that delays in making measurements may cause erroneous RI measurement. Consequently, measurements should be taken immediately after stress is induced.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0369">The Doppler waveform varied with the patient's stress level. It was observed that the peaks in the waveform became sharper and the area under the peak decreased as the patient's stress increased.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0370">When the patient was asked analytical questions (state 7), a good correlation was observed between the question asked and the RI increase. RI increased more with more difficult questions. It was also observed that RI increased just prior to or during question dictation. However, if the question was simple, the patient's RI would decrease immediately after the question was completed. This demonstrates that merely asking a question, regardless of the content of a question, may cause stress.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0371">When the patient was asked to self-induce stress (state 9), the patient was instructing to think of a stressful past-experience or any probable stressful future-event. The patient then signaled once he felt stressed.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0372">When the patient returned to a normal state (state 10), it was expected that the patient's RI would return to the level observed during the baseline measurement (state 1). This was not observed, however, likely because the person was asked to hold his breath during this final measurement, which may have cause the patient's stress and RI to increase.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0373">The patient's average RI when relaxed was 0.62 and his average RI when stressed was 0.75. There is a significant difference of 21% in the average readings. There is also a difference of 38% in min value of relaxed and max value in stressed.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0374">Summary: Renal Doppler measurements were taken on the main renal artery. The patient did not need to hold his breath. Peaks and troughs were selected automatically, and RI was also calculated automatically. This allowed for more accurate RI measurements than in experiment 1. Changes in RI correlated with the patient's self-reported stress level, such that RI increased with stress.</p>

<p id="p-0348" num="0376">The trial of example 2 was repeated on a new patient.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0377">Measurement Strategy: The patient is asked to relax for some time. The patient is not told about the procedure or the type of questions that will be asked. The person is then asked some simple mathematical questions (e.g., addition and subtraction). The patient is then asked more complicated mathematical questions (e.g., multiplication and division). The patient is also asked some personal and job-related questions that are intended to induce stress. Renal Doppler measurements are taken continuously as the questions are asked.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0378">Patient History: The patient is 35-years old, with no history of heart disease or kidney disease. The patient has poor mathematical skills.

<p id="p-0362" num="0390">The patient was subjected to most of the same stressors as the patient in experiment 2. Initially the patient reported that he was stressed due to the anxiety of the trial. The patients RI increased only slightly when he was asked mathematical questions. The patient answered many of the questions incorrectly. After the measurements, the patient was asked about how he was feeling during the trial and what were the instances when he felt stressed. The patient reported that the difficult mathematical questions were not stressful, though he stated that he tried his best to answer them.</p>
<p id="p-0363" num="0391">When the patient was asked personal questions (state 7), his RI increased. The patient reported that the personal questions were stressful, especially in the beginning of that phase of questions. This confirmed that the personal questions stressed the patient. Though the patient's RI increased, the increase in RI was slight, in an absolute sense, compared to the initial values. This suggests that the analysis of stress should be based on a comparison of local values (i.e., by comparing the stressed state with the states immediately before and after the stressed state).</p>
<p id="p-0364" num="0392">The patient's baseline stress consistently declined during the course of the experiment (see states 1, 3, 8, and 10), indicating that the patient was become more relaxed as the trial proceeded and as he became more comfortable and familiar with the process.</p>
<p id="p-0365" num="0393">Summary: Renal Doppler measurements were taken on the main renal artery. The patient did not need to hold his breath.

<heading id="h-0013" level="1">CONCLUSIONS FROM EXAMPLES 1-3</heading>
<p id="p-0367" num="0395">The hypothesis for these experiments was that would RI increase with stress and decrease with relaxation. This hypothesis was generally confirmed. In most cases it was observed that increasing RI correlated with increasing self-reported stress. However, in some cases RI decreased when the patient was subjected to forced stress. Similarly, in some cases RI increased when the patient was subjected to forced relaxation. It is likely that in these latter cases, the forced stress/relaxation was merely ineffective as inducing the expected response. For example, in experiment 1 the patient actually became more relaxed when asked arithmetic questions that were intended to induce stress, while asking the same patient to relax was ineffective at reducing his RI. This is likely because when the patient in experiment 1 began the trial in a stressed state, such that his normal (baseline) stated was substantially stressed. Consequently, the forced relaxation method using talking and jokes was not enough to bring the patient out of the initial stressed state.</p>
<p id="p-0368" num="0396">Asking mathematical questions was effective at inducing stress in certain situation. A question that was relatively difficult for the patient to answer induced stress and an increase in RI was observed. However, a question that was relatively easy for the patient actually reduced the patient's stress and a decrease in RI was observed. Asking personal questions was also effective at inducing stress in patients, and the changes in RI caused by personal questions tended to be larger than the changes caused by mathematical question. Consequently, changes in RI correlated with the difficult of the question asked, such that RI increased with the difficulty of the question. Similarly, it was observed that more difficult questions had a larger (more positive) stress factor, such that the change in RI increased with the difficulty of the question.</p>
<p id="p-0369" num="0397">It was also observed that the patients recovered from particular stressors relatively quickly, indicating that the patients had fast-acting compensatory mechanisms for dealing with stress induced by mathematical and personal questions. Similarly, it indicates that mathematical and personal questions are only capable of inducing short-term stress responses. This also indicates that renal Doppler measurements should be taken continuously when asking these types of questions in order to increase the accuracy of the measurements.</p>
<p id="p-0370" num="0398">Factors that may decrease the accuracy of Doppler measurements include: (1) physical motion of the person, especially breathing when taking measurements on intra-renal artery; (2) having the patient hold his breath, which may itself be stressful; (3) variations in the Doppler measurement angle between measurements; (4) manual selection of peaks in troughs in Doppler waveforms, which may be dependent on the accuracy and experience of the operating technician; or (5) delays between the time stress is induced and when a measurement is taken, which may cause a smaller change in RI to be observed because of fast-acting compensatory mechanisms. These factors may have affected the measurements in experiment 1. However, these factors were effectively eliminated in experiments 2 and 3 using the following techniques: (1) minimizing the effect of physical motion, particularly breathing, by taking measurements on the main renal artery; (2) allowing the patient to breath normally while taking measurements; (3) using equipment that can automatically select the peaks and troughs in Doppler waveforms; and (5) taking measurements continuously. Consequently, the results of experiments 2 and 3 are likely more accurate than the results of experiment 1. However, the results of all three experiments support the hypothesis that RI increases with stress and decreases with relaxation.</p>
<p id="p-0371" num="0399">In experiments 2 and 3, it was observed that the RI of a patient increased significantly just before each question was asked. This reflected the patient's anxiety over the pending question. After the question was completed, RI remained elevated for difficult questions while the patient attempted to solve the question. However, for easy questions, RI quickly decreased after the question was completed. The shape of the Doppler waveform clearly changed when questions were asked, making it simple to identify and distinguish stressed and relaxed stated. Interestingly, it was observed that RI increased the most when a patient was asked to self-induce stress. RI decreased the most when a patient was asked to relax by using deep-breathing techniques, thus validating deep-breathing as an effective stress-reduction therapy. However, merely asking a patient to relax may not decrease their RI, and may in fact cause an increase in RI.</p>
<p id="p-0372" num="0400">While asking difficult questions generally increased a patient's stress, it was observed that asking questions that were too hard (i.e., beyond the patient's ability to answer correctly) did not cause stress. This may be because the patient realizes his inability to answer the question and gives up trying to solve the question, thereby avoiding a stress response. In experiment 3, the patient was initially stressed when asked difficult mathematical question, but his RI quickly dropped after the first question as the patient effectively gave up trying to solve the questions correctly. This correlated with the patient's report that he did not feel stressed when asked difficult mathematical questions that he generally could not solve.</p>
<p id="p-0373" num="0401">Renal Doppler sonography provides a fast and reliable way to detect stress. However, the stress causing methodology is not normalized. Different patients reacted differently to the same type of questions. Thus the questionnaire should be prepared based on the particular patient. For example, mathematical questions should be scaled based on the patients education level. A common method of solving some mental questions works differently on different persons. The normal (baseline) state of patient also has a significant impact on their stress response.</p>
<p id="p-0374" num="0402">In conclusion, renal Doppler sonography may be used to accurately measure stress in a person. There is a strong correlation between a patient's RI and a patient's self-reported stress level. The relationship between RI and stress may be used to generate and validate algorithms used for calculating a stress index and stress factors. Furthermore, RI and self-reported stress data can be combined with data from other sensors to generate a stress model of the patient that correlates a variety of physiological, psychological, behavioral, or environmental data of the patient with the stress or RI of the patient.</p>
<heading id="h-0014" level="1">EXAMPLE 4</heading>
<p id="p-0375" num="0403">In this experiment, physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental data is collected from multiple subjects. The subjects conduct their daily activities normally while various sensors continuously monitor them. The patients wear a blood-pressure monitor, an actigraph, a pulse oximeter, the iPod Touch described above, and a data aggregation system. All of these are portable devices that the subjects can carry. Also, periodically the subject's renal blood velocity, blood glucose level, and cortisol level is measured. The subjects can report psychological and behavioral data using an iPod Touch application, similar to mood sensor <b>400</b>. The iPod Touch also has custom software to verify the operation of the sensors and the data aggregation system. During the experimental period, the subject is exposed to stress therapies (e.g., stress management and counseling).</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0404">Data is collected from ten normotensive subjects for at least four hours a day over the course of two weeks (10 working days). Of the four hours of data collection, approximately two hours of data will be collected while the subject is at work and two hours of data will be collected after work. During the first week of data collection, the patient only engages in light relaxation during the two-hour post-work period each day. During the second week of data collection the patient engaged in stress management counseling during the post-work period each day.</p>
<p id="p-0377" num="0405">The data is used to develop a stress model for each patient. The stress model correlates the physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental data collected during the experiment with the stress or RI of the subject. The renal Doppler measurements for a patient are used to determine the stress index of the patient. The stress index is then correlated with the physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental data collected during the experiment. A stress model for calculating the stress index of a person as a function of with the physiological, psychological, behavioral, and environmental data is then determined. Thus, the renal Doppler measurements are effectively used to validate the stress model of the person.</p>
