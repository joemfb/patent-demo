<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A dual frequency damper includes a liquid inertia vibration eliminator (LIVE) portion and a fluid damper portion. LIVE portion and fluid damper portion operate in series and function so that dual frequency damper is optimized in both stiffness and damping at multiple frequencies. LIVE portion acts as a frequency dependent switch to selectively cause low frequency oscillatory forces to be treated primarily by the high spring rate and high damping rate characteristics of the fluid damper portion, and also to select high frequency oscillatory forces to be primarily treated by the low spring rate and low damping rate characteristics of the LIVE unit portion.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The system of the present application relates to a damper for an aircraft. In particular, the system of the present application relates to a lead/lag damper for a rotorcraft. The damper is particularly well suited for use in the field of rotary wing aircraft; however, other types of aircraft can implement the damper as well. It should be appreciated that even though the damper is illustrated herein with regard to an aircraft, one ordinary skill in the art with benefit of this disclosure will recognize that the damper can be implemented in applications other than an aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">1. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Certain conventional rotorcraft can have multi-bladed rotor hub configurations that require lead/lag dampers to compensate for the acceleration and deceleration of each rotor blade about a rotor blade hinge axis. During forward flight of the rotorcraft, unequal drag forces on the advancing and retreating rotor blade positions typically cause oscillating forces that if left untreated, can negatively affect the rotorcraft. For example, untreated lead/lag oscillating forces can severely limit the life of structural components through fatigue. Furthermore, untreated lead/lag oscillating forces have been known to cause catastrophic results in a &#x201c;ground resonance&#x201d; phenomenon in which the oscillation frequency is similar to the resonant frequency of the aircraft on its landing gear.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventionally, lead/lag dampers are used to treat lead/lag oscillatory forces. However, considerably shortcomings in conventional lead/lag dampers remain.</p>

It should be appreciated that the even though rotor hub <b>101</b> is illustrated with four rotor blades <b>103</b>, the system of the present application is equally applicable to rotor hubs having an alternative number of rotor blades <b>103</b>. Further, it should be appreciated that even though dual frequency damper <b>501</b> particularly well suited for a main rotor hub, as illustrated, dual frequency damper <b>501</b> may also be utilized on a tail rotor hub.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, rotor hub <b>101</b> is further illustrated. For clarity, only a single rotor blade <b>103</b> is shown; however, it should be appreciated that the disclosure regarding the rotor blade <b>103</b> is equally applicable to other rotor blades <b>103</b> that are not shown for clarity. During operation of the rotorcraft, rotor hub <b>101</b> is subjected to a variety of aerodynamic forces, as well as mechanical dynamic forces. Rotor hub <b>101</b> rotates around the rotor mast axis at approximately <b>300</b>-<b>350</b> revolutions per minute (RPM). However, it should appreciated that the rate of rotation of rotor hub <b>101</b> is implementation specific; accordingly, the system of the present invention contemplates rotor hubs that rotate at other RPM's as well.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">A centrifugal force <b>119</b> acts upon rotor blade <b>103</b> when rotor blade <b>103</b> is rotating around the rotor mast axis. Further, an aerodynamic drag force <b>117</b> imparts a restraining force upon the rotor blade <b>103</b>. The centrifugal force <b>119</b> and aerodynamic drag force <b>117</b> create moments that act upon rotor blade <b>103</b>. The damper <b>501</b> also creates a moment acting on the rotor blade <b>103</b>. When the moments from the centrifugal force <b>119</b>, the damper <b>501</b> and aerodynamic drag force <b>117</b> are balanced, then the rotor blade <b>103</b> is an equilibrium position, such as equilibrium position <b>115</b>. However, when the centrifugal force <b>119</b>, damper force <b>501</b> and aerodynamic drag force <b>117</b> change during operation of the rotorcraft, then a relatively steady force acts on rotor blade <b>103</b> until the relatively steady force repositions rotor blade <b>103</b> into a new equilibrium position.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, rotor blade <b>103</b> is shown in a forward position <b>115</b>&#x2032; in which the position of rotor blade <b>103</b> has deviated forwardly from equilibrium position <b>115</b>. Referring also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>, rotor blade <b>103</b> is shown in an aft position <b>115</b>&#x2033; in which the position of rotor blade <b>103</b> has deviated aft of equilibrium position <b>115</b>. These deviations of rotor blade <b>103</b> into a forward position <b>115</b>&#x2032; or an aft position <b>115</b>&#x2033;, can be the result of a lead/lag force that imparts an oscillatory force facilitating the temporary positioning of rotor blade <b>103</b> in forward position <b>115</b>&#x2032; or aft position <b>115</b>&#x2033;. When airflow resulting from a translation of the rotorcraft, or a wind gust, aligns with a directional position of rotor blade <b>103</b>, then the temporary decrease in drag and additional damper force act to accelerate the rotor blade <b>103</b> during that rotational phase of the rotor blade <b>103</b>, resulting in the temporary forward position <b>115</b>&#x2032;. In contrast, when the translation airflow direction opposes the directional position of rotor blade <b>103</b>, then the temporary increase in drag and additional damper force act to decelerate the rotor blade <b>103</b> during that rotation phase of the rotor blade <b>103</b>, resulting in the temporary aft position <b>115</b>&#x2033;. These lead/lag forces act to accelerate and decelerate each rotor blade <b>103</b> within a single revolution about the rotor mast <b>105</b>. It is highly desirable to efficiently and effectively treat the lead/lag forces, as well as other oscillatory forces, through damping.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, a dual frequency damper <b>501</b> is illustrated. Dual frequency damper <b>501</b> includes a liquid inertia vibration eliminator (LIVE) portion <b>503</b> and a fluid damper portion <b>505</b>. LIVE portion <b>503</b> and fluid damper portion <b>505</b> operate in series and function selectively so that dual frequency damper <b>501</b> is optimized in both stiffness and damping at multiple frequencies, as discussed further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Dual frequency damper <b>501</b> includes a first connection member <b>507</b> and a second connection member <b>509</b>. One of the first connection member <b>507</b> and the second connection member <b>509</b> is coupled to the rotor yoke <b>109</b>, while the other of the first connection member <b>507</b> and the second connection member <b>509</b> is coupled to the rotor grip <b>107</b> of rotor blade <b>103</b>. It should be appreciated that the dual frequency damper <b>501</b> may be associated with the rotor hub <b>101</b> in a variety of configurations. Furthermore, dual frequency damper <b>501</b> may alternatively be coupled between adjacent rotor blades <b>103</b>, instead of being coupled between the rotor blade <b>103</b> and rotor yoke <b>109</b>. In the preferred embodiment, first and second connection members <b>507</b> and <b>509</b> are rod ends each having an integral spherical bearing; however, it should be appreciated that first and second connection members <b>507</b> and <b>509</b> may be of any configuration capable of providing a structural connection between rotor blade <b>103</b> and rotor yoke <b>109</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">First connection member <b>507</b> is rigidly connected to a primary housing <b>511</b>. Second connection member <b>509</b> is rigidly connected to an adapter housing <b>513</b>. Adapter housing <b>513</b> and primary housing <b>511</b> are illustrated as having a substantially cylindrical shape; however, it should be appreciated that adapter housing <b>513</b> and primary housing <b>511</b> can be configured in a wide variety of shapes. Adapter housing <b>513</b> is rigidly coupled to a piston <b>515</b> of fluid damper portion <b>505</b> with a plurality of pins, such as pin <b>517</b>. Each pin <b>517</b> extends in a radial direction and traverses through primary housing <b>511</b> through an associated void, such as void <b>519</b>. It should be appreciated that it is fully contemplated that alternative mechanisms, other than adapter housing <b>513</b>, can be used to rigidly couple second connection member <b>509</b> to piston <b>515</b>. Fluid damper portion <b>505</b> further includes a first fluid chamber <b>525</b>, a second fluid chamber <b>527</b>, and a fluid passage <b>523</b>. It should be appreciated that even though only one fluid passage <b>523</b> is illustrated in the illustration, a plurality of fluid passages <b>523</b> can be located radially around and parallel to a central damper axis <b>543</b>. For example, one embodiment can have three fluid passages <b>523</b> located at 120&#xb0; intervals around central damper axis <b>543</b>. Fluid damper portion <b>505</b> also includes a fluid <b>541</b> disposed within first fluid chamber <b>525</b>, second fluid chamber <b>527</b>, and fluid passage <b>523</b>. Fluid <b>541</b> is preferably a hydraulic fluid, but fluid <b>541</b> can be any variety of fluid types. Elastomer members <b>521</b><i>a</i>, <b>521</b><i>b</i>, and <b>521</b><i>c</i>, act in part to define and prevent fluid <b>541</b> from leaking out of first fluid chamber <b>525</b> and second fluid chamber <b>527</b>. Further, elastomer members <b>521</b><i>a</i>, <b>521</b><i>b</i>, and <b>521</b><i>c</i>, are adhesively bonded between the interior of piston <b>515</b> and the exterior of a central member <b>545</b> so as to resiliently secure piston <b>515</b> to central member <b>545</b> of LIVE unit <b>503</b>. Elastomer members <b>521</b><i>a</i>, <b>521</b><i>b</i>, and <b>521</b><i>c </i>include elastomeric material that has an implementation specific spring and damping rate. It should be appreciated that elastomer members <b>521</b><i>a</i>, <b>521</b><i>b</i>, and <b>521</b><i>c </i>may have a wide variety of configurations to tailor stiffness and damping properties. Elastomer members <b>521</b><i>a</i>, <b>521</b><i>b</i>, and <b>521</b><i>c </i>may be a solid elastomer member or a laminate of elastomer layers. Further, the laminate of elastomeric layers can include cylindrically shaped shims bonded therebetween. Further, the requisite length and thickness of elastomer members <b>521</b><i>a</i>, <b>521</b><i>b</i>, and <b>521</b><i>c </i>are implementation specific and depend in part on the predicted rotor hub dynamics and loading. The geometry and composition of elastomer members <b>521</b><i>a</i>, <b>521</b><i>b</i>, and <b>521</b><i>c </i>may be configured to provide linear or non-linear strain properties.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> of dual frequency damper <b>501</b> includes a central member <b>545</b> resiliently coupled to primary housing <b>511</b> with a first elastomer member <b>533</b> and a second elastomer member <b>535</b>. First elastomer member <b>533</b> and second elastomer member <b>535</b> function similar to a journal bearing, as discussed further herein. Central member <b>545</b> is also resiliently coupled to piston <b>515</b> of fluid damper portion <b>505</b> with elastomer members <b>521</b><i>a</i>, <b>521</b><i>b</i>, and <b>521</b><i>c</i>. A first fluid chamber <b>529</b> is formed by the interior space between a first end portion of primary housing <b>511</b> and central member <b>545</b> in conjunction with first elastomer member <b>533</b>. Similarly, a second fluid chamber <b>531</b> is formed by the interior space between a second end portion of primary housing <b>511</b> and central member <b>545</b> in conjunction with second elastomer member <b>535</b>. A tuning passage <b>537</b> is located through an interior of central member <b>545</b> along damper axis <b>543</b>. Tuning passage <b>537</b> provides fluid communication between first fluid chamber <b>529</b> and second fluid chamber <b>531</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">A tuning fluid <b>539</b> is disposed in first fluid chamber <b>529</b>, second fluid chamber <b>531</b>, and tuning passage <b>537</b>. Tuning fluid <b>539</b> preferably has low viscosity, relatively high density, and non-corrosive properties. Other embodiments may incorporate hydraulic fluid having suspended dense particulate matter, for example. Furthermore, in one embodiment, tuning fluid <b>539</b> can be the same as fluid <b>541</b> used in fluid damper portion <b>505</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A conventional LIVE unit is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,236,607, titled &#x201c;Vibration Suppression System,&#x201d; issued 2 Dec. 1980, to Halwes, et al. (Halwes '607). Halwes '607 is incorporated herein by reference. Halwes '607 discloses a a conventional vibration isolator, in which a tuning fluid is used as the &#x201c;tuning&#x201d; mass to counterbalance, or cancel, oscillating forces transmitted through the isolator. This isolator employs the principle that the acceleration of an oscillating mass is 180&#xb0; out of phase with its displacement. In Halwes '607, it was recognized that the inertial characteristics of a dense, low-viscosity fluid, combined with a hydraulic advantage resulting from a piston arrangement, could harness the out-of-phase acceleration to generate counter-balancing forces to attenuate or cancel vibration.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A simple force equation for vibration is set forth as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>F=m{umlaut over (x)}+c{dot over (x)}+kx </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A conventional LIVE unit utilizes inertial forces (m{umlaut over (x)}) to cancel elastic forces) (kx). As such, conventional LIVE units have sought to minimize undesired damping since in contrast to a vibration isolator device, a damping device is primarily concerned with utilizing dissipative effects (c{dot over (x)}) to remove energy from a vibrating system.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">However, in contrast to a conventional LIVE unit, LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> of dual frequency damper <b>501</b> is primarily configured as a frequency dependent switch so that dual frequency damper <b>501</b> is optimized in both stiffness and damping at multiple frequencies, as discussed further herein.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring briefly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a graph <b>901</b> illustrates a LIVE unit response plot line <b>907</b> graphed in terms of frequency and amplitude. Plot line <b>907</b> is illustrative of a response of a LIVE unit to an oscillatory force where instance <b>903</b> is the natural frequency while instance <b>905</b> is the isolation frequency. LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> acts as a frequency dependent switch by being configured such that an oscillatory force exhibited upon dual frequency damper <b>501</b> at frequencies near instance <b>903</b> cause a behavioral response from LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> of high stiffness. At these frequencies near instance <b>903</b>, LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> essentially locks-up and becomes rigid, thereby causing fluid damper <b>505</b> to substantially react the forces exhibited upon dual frequency damper <b>501</b>. When fluid damper <b>505</b> reacts the forces exhibited upon dual frequency damper <b>501</b>, then the spring rate and damping characteristics of fluid damper <b>505</b> are manifested as the total spring rate and damping characteristics of dual frequency damper <b>501</b>. Further, when an oscillatory force is exhibited upon dual frequency damper <b>501</b> at frequencies near instance <b>905</b>, LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> behaves with relatively low stiffness. When LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> behaves with low stiffness, fluid damper <b>505</b> comparatively exhibits a high stiffness, thereby causing LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> to substantially react the oscillatory forces while fluid damper <b>505</b> behaves relatively rigid. Moreover, because the spring constant (K) of first elastomer member <b>533</b> and second elastomer member <b>535</b> are relatively low compared to the spring constant (K) of elastomer members <b>521</b><i>a</i>, <b>521</b><i>b</i>, and <b>521</b><i>c</i>, then the dual frequency damper <b>501</b> operates with relatively low stiffness at force oscillations at frequencies near instance <b>905</b> on graph <b>901</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring now also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a graph <b>1001</b> includes an illustrative stiffness curve <b>1003</b> of dual frequency damper <b>501</b>. It should be appreciated that stiffness curve <b>1003</b> is merely exemplary of an embodiment of dual frequency damper <b>501</b> during operation. Other implementation specific embodiments of dual frequency damper <b>501</b> can have stiffness curves that deviate and differ from stiffness curve <b>1003</b>. &#x3c9;<sub>1 </sub>represents a rotor blade rotational frequency of approximately 2.82 Hz (0.47/rev). &#x3c9;<sub>2 </sub>represents a rotor blade rotational frequency of approximately 6 Hz (1/rev). At &#x3c9;<sub>1</sub>, dual frequency damper <b>501</b> is tuned so that LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> acts relatively stiff and rigid, thereby causing the spring rate, damping rate, and displacement characteristics of fluid damper portion <b>505</b> treat the oscillatory forces. In the illustrated embodiment, fluid damper portion <b>505</b> has a spring rate of approximately 20,000 lbs/in at &#x3c9;<sub>1</sub>. At &#x3c9;<sub>1</sub>, LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> behaves similar to instance <b>903</b> in graph <b>901</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. It should be appreciated that is not necessary for &#x3c9;<sub>1 </sub>to correspond exactly with the peak amplitude shown at instance <b>903</b>; rather &#x3c9;<sub>1 </sub>can correspond with either side of the peak at instance <b>903</b> on plot line <b>907</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Still referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, at &#x3c9;<sub>2</sub>, dual frequency damper <b>501</b> is tuned so that LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> acts relatively soft and compliant, thereby causing fluid damper portion <b>505</b> to act relatively stiff and rigid, which in turn causes the spring rate, damping rate, and displacement characteristics of LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> to treat the oscillatory forces. In the illustrated embodiment, LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> has a spring rate of approximately 5,000 lbs/in at &#x3c9;<sub>2</sub>. At &#x3c9;<sub>2</sub>, LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> behaves similar to instance <b>905</b> in graph <b>901</b> if <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. It should be appreciated that is not necessary for &#x3c9;<sub>2 </sub>to correspond exactly with the lowest dip amplitude shown at instance <b>905</b>; rather &#x3c9;<sub>2 </sub>can correspond with either side of the dip at instance <b>905</b> on plot line <b>907</b>. It should be appreciated that operational conditions between &#x3c9;<sub>1 </sub>and &#x3c9;<sub>1 </sub>result in a combination of contributions from LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> and fluid damper portion <b>505</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring again also to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5-8</figref>, when LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> behaves rigid, such as at a frequency of 0.47/rev (&#x3c9;<sub>1</sub>), loading is reacted by fluid damper portion <b>505</b>. During such a situation, a length L<b>1</b> of dual frequency damper <b>501</b> is compressed and stretched during the loading cycle, thereby translating piston <b>515</b> relative to central member <b>545</b> along damper axis <b>543</b>. Translation of piston <b>515</b> forces elastomer members <b>521</b><i>a</i>, <b>521</b><i>b</i>, and <b>521</b><i>c </i>to elastically deform through shear, thereby treating the oscillatory force with a spring rate and damping rate. Further, the relative translation of piston <b>515</b> relative to central member <b>545</b> forces fluid <b>541</b> through fluid passage <b>523</b> between first fluid chamber <b>529</b> and second fluid chamber <b>531</b>. The viscous damping that results from the fluid transfer through fluid passage <b>523</b> also results in damping of the oscillatory force causing the translation of piston <b>515</b> relative to central member <b>545</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In an alternative embodiment of dual frequency damper <b>501</b>, fluid damper portion <b>505</b> can rely solely upon elastomer members, such as elastomer members <b>521</b><i>a</i>, <b>521</b><i>b</i>, and <b>521</b><i>c</i>, for spring and damping characteristics. More specifically, an alternative embodiment of fluid damper portion <b>505</b> can be void of first fluid chamber <b>529</b>, second fluid chamber <b>531</b>, and fluid passage <b>523</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Dual frequency damper <b>501</b> has significant advantages over conventional dampers. For example, by configuring and implementing live unit as a frequency dependent switch, so as to activate the dual frequency damper <b>501</b> to treat oscillatory forces at a first frequency with the fluid damper portion <b>505</b> having a high spring rate, high damping rate, and low displacement factor, while treating oscillatory forces at a second frequency with the LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> with a low spring rate, low damping rate, and high displacement factor. Further, oscillatory forces at frequencies between the first frequency and the second frequency are treated with a combination of LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> and fluid damper portion <b>505</b>. In such a manner, the dual frequency damper <b>501</b> can be selectively optimized at multiple frequencies, thereby allowing for lower loads and/or higher damping for a given design configuration. Further, having two distinct components, namely the LIVE unit portion <b>503</b> and the fluid damper portion <b>505</b>, allows for each component to be selectively tailored for an implementation specific design configuration.</p>
