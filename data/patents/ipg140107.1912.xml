<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Italian Application Serial No. TO2008A000329 filed May 2, 2008 under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119. This application is incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a surgical prosthesis for the repair of soft tissues, in particular for the treatment of hernias and/or laparoceles, or defects of the abdominal wall, using an intraperitoneal route.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A typical surgical prosthesis includes a mesh made of a non-resorbable and biocompatible polymer. The mesh is composed of filaments that have interstices which permit tissue growth. The prosthesis also includes a sheet of polymer material having barrier properties and low adhesion to sensitive organs and tissues. This sheet is superimposed upon and joined to the mesh to form a stratified structure.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The prosthesis is implanted in a patient so that the mesh is in contact with the patients abdominal wall to reinforce it and stimulate the fibroplastic response. The sheet forming the barrier layer is placed in contact with the viscera of the patient to minimize adhesions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A known prosthesis of this type is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,270,530 to Eldridge et al. According to this patent, the mesh is joined to the sheet through a further intermediate mesh which is sewn to the first mesh on one side and is fused to the barrier sheet on the other through heat and pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The intermediate mesh renders the structure of this prosthesis rather thick, rigid and heavy. As a consequence it is difficult to wrap the mesh in order to introduce it into the abdominal cavity using a trocar (or an instrument which, after creating the pneumoperitoneum, makes it possible to pass surgical instruments through holes made in the abdominal wall), restricting the possibilities for location. In addition to this the large quantity of material present in this prosthesis conflicts with the &#x201c;less is more&#x201d; concept expressed by U. Klinge and V. Schumpelick, in &#x201c;<i>Prosthetic Implants For Hernia Repair</i>&#x201d; BJS, Vol. 90(12), December 2003:1457-1458. According to this concept, the quantity and quality of the inflammatory response directly correlates with the quantity of implanted prosthetic material and the surface area in contact with host tissue. In particular, this inflammatory response causes the formation of scar tissue which covers the mesh, rendering it rigid and causing discomfort and pain to the patient. This is a serious drawback of the prior art mesh.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object of this invention is therefore to provide a prosthesis which is improved in comparison with those described in the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A prosthesis according to the invention joins a sheet to the mesh by a plurality of filaments located alongside each other. The filaments are spaced not more than 5 mm apart. Each filament has a plurality of sites of attachment to the mesh. The attachment points not more than 15 mm apart. Further, each length of filament between two successive attachment sites projects from the side of the mesh facing the sheet and is fused to the sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the prosthesis according to the invention the joining filaments act as spacers located between the mesh and the sheet. The joining filaments prevent damage to the mesh and/or the continuity of the barrier film during the process of fusing them with the sheet, and preventing the interstices in the mesh from being obstructed. Additionally the joining filaments have a mass and rigidity which is very much less than that of an intermediate mesh or other joining means, so that the ease of handling and flexibility of the prosthesis according to the invention are improved.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The structure of the joining filaments allows, at the time of implantation a number of benefits. A benefit of the present invention is that it allows the surgical prosthesis to be cut into the necessary shapes and dimensions for implantation without any damage and loss of fibres belonging to the mesh. The prosthesis of the present invention can be wrapped for insertion into the abdominal cavity using a trocar, and this eases extension at the anatomical implantation site.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Once implanted, the prosthesis of the present invention has values for resilience and strength such as to ensure a response which is compatible with normal physiological reactions and the anatomical and biomechanical dynamics of the abdominal wall without the mesh becoming separated from the sheet and/or the sheet being perforated by the mesh.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In one example, the thickness of the prosthesis according to the invention is between 0.4 and 0.6 mm, the weight per unit surface area is between 60 and 100 g/m<sup>2 </sup>and the tensile strength is greater than the maximum intra-abdominal pressure measured using the principle of Pascal hydrostatics and equal to 16 N/cm, as specified by Klinge U., Klosterhalfen B., Conze J., et al in &#x201c;<i>Modified mesh for hernia repair that is adapted to the physiology of the abdominal wall</i>&#x201d;, Eur J Surg 164:951-960, 1998.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As a whole, the prosthesis according to the invention has a lesser thickness which enables it to be implanted using a trocar, a device which also has small dimensions. The prosthesis also has reduced weight that helps in reducing the inflammatory reaction. A reduced inflammatory reaction reduces the rigidity in the abdominal wall, appreciably improving the patient's comfort and quality of life.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a surgical prosthesis for the repair of soft tissues, in particular for the treatment of hernias and/or laparoceles via an intraperitoneal route of the present invention A mesh <b>10</b> is made up of filaments of non-resorbable and biocompatible synthetic polymer material having interstices which permit tissue growth and a sheet <b>12</b> of polymer material having barrier properties and low adhesion to sensitive body organs and tissues. Sheet <b>12</b> is superimposed on mesh <b>10</b> and joined to it through a plurality of joining filaments <b>14</b> to form a stratified structure.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The material used for sheet <b>12</b> can be synthetic or natural, resorbable or not resorbable, for example expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, polyhuretane, collagen, polyglactin (PGLA), poly-l-lactide acid (PLLA), polydioxanone/poly-p-dioxanone (PDO or PDS), polycaprolacton or polyglecaprone. The material used for mesh <b>10</b>, and for joining filaments <b>14</b>, can be, for example, a monofilament polypropylene polyester, polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) or poly-tetrafluoroethene/poly-tetrafluoroethylene (PTFE).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, joining filaments <b>14</b> are arranged side by side, and in an embodiment, substantially equally spaced. A spacing <b>16</b> between the filaments is less than or equal to 5 mm. In alternate embodiments, spacing <b>16</b> is not greater than 3 mm and another embodiment the spacing <b>16</b> is between 1 and 2 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Each filament <b>14</b> has a plurality of attachment sites <b>18</b> to mesh <b>10</b> which are not more than 15 mm apart and, in another embodiment, not more than 10 mm apart the length <b>20</b> of filament <b>14</b> between two successive attachment sites <b>18</b> of the mesh <b>10</b> can vary from filament to filament or remain equal. In one preferred embodiment the lengths <b>20</b> of filament <b>14</b> are all equal and range between 5 mm and 9 mm. With this arrangement similar attachment sites <b>18</b> of various filaments <b>14</b> are arranged in rows <b>22</b> which are parallel to each other and substantially perpendicular to the adjacent lengths <b>20</b> of filaments <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Additionally, the diameter of joining filaments <b>14</b> is between about 160 and 200 &#x3bc;m greater than that of the filament in mesh <b>10</b>, so, in an embodiment, the value of the ratio between these diameters lies between 1.1 and 2. The diameter of the joining filaments <b>14</b> is between 160 and 200 &#x3bc;m, while the diameter of the filament in mesh <b>10</b> is between 100 and 140 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In addition to being attached to mesh <b>10</b>, joining filaments <b>14</b> are fused to sheet <b>12</b> at projecting lengths <b>20</b> which act as bridges between successive attachment sites <b>18</b>. Fusion is carried out using conventional procedures, for example through the combined action of heat and pressure in a hot rolling process. During the latter and subsequently when in use, joining filaments <b>14</b> keep mesh <b>10</b> at a distance from sheet <b>12</b>, preventing the interstices which are essential to permit tissue growth from being obstructed, and preventing the filament in mesh <b>10</b> from perforating the sheet <b>12</b>, interrupting its continuity. This process results in a cohesive prosthesis structure which is resistant to tearing and delamination, and is likewise resilient and flexible.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Further to the process, the sheet <b>12</b> is pulled from one set of rollers while mesh <b>10</b> is pulled from another. The sheet <b>12</b> and mesh <b>10</b> meet between two other rollers and are hot rolled at a temperature between about 350 and 410&#xb0; F. and a pressure between about 5.7 and 8.5 psi. The materials are fed at about a rate of 15-50 inches per minute. As seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, due to the three dimensional nature of the mesh <b>10</b>, particularly joining filament <b>14</b>, permits the mesh <b>10</b> to be bonded to the sheet <b>12</b> without it laying directly on one surface of the mesh <b>10</b>. This forms a gap and prevents the sheet <b>12</b> from covering the openings formed between the filaments <b>14</b>. This permits the mesh <b>10</b> to be integrated into the tissue it is in contact with and have the strength of sheet <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Naturally, the principle of the invention remaining the same, the forms of embodiment and details of construction may be varied widely with respect to those described and illustrated, which have been given purely by way of example, without thereby departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
