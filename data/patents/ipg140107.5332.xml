<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An information delivery system comprises a receiver component that receives information about the movement, velocity, acceleration, and/or locations over time of a user. A computation component using a predictive model generates a probability distribution relating to one or more of when the user will next be stopped, how long the user will be stopped, how long a pattern of motion, such as walking, driving in stop and go traffic, and smooth highway motion will last, based at least in part upon signals about motion over time. The system can further comprise an alerting component that determines when to provide the user with information based at least in part upon the probability distribution over some aspect of motion or cessation of motion, and optionally the content, or tagged or inferred urgency or importance, of a message or communication.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/428,170, filed Jun. 30, 2006, entitled COMPUTING AND HARNESSING INFERENCES ABOUT THE TIMING, DURATION, AND NATURE OF MOTION AND CESSATION OF MOTION WITH APPLICATIONS TO MOBILE COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS, which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Computers and computer-related technology have enabled users to instantaneously communicate with one another. For example, a single user may be associated with a portable phone, multiple email accounts, a pager, a personal digital assistant, an instant messaging device, and the like. Some of these technologies can be combined. For instance, today's cellular telephones can include email applications, wherein emails can be received at the cellular telephone shortly after an email is delivered to the email account. Similarly, text messaging can be employed over most portable telephones. Still further, some of today's automobiles are associated with phone applications. Pursuant to an example, automobiles can be associated with a microphone and speakers, such that when the automobile's phone number is dialed a radio can be disabled and a ring tone can be provided through the speakers. It can thus be discerned that today individuals associated with sufficient computing equipment can be contacted at almost any time in most regions (including while traveling).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Furthermore, technology has enabled multimedia to be delivered to portable devices, such as streaming video (which can be for entertainment purposes or advertisement purposes), streaming audio, etc. For instance, several of today's automobiles are equipped with monitors that enable users therein to watch videos (e.g., DVDs), review maps of an area, receive feeds from one or more broadcasting locations (through use of antennas), etc. Still further, vehicles can be altered to facilitate housing of video game applications, such that passengers within an automobile can be entertained throughout a journey.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There are instances, however, where it may not be desirable to enable a user to be contacted. For example, when traveling on a busy freeway during times of high traffic congestion, the user may not wish to be interrupted, as probabilities of an accident occurring are increased. Similarly, an advertiser would not wish to provide an advertisement to a user when the user is not likely to pay any attention to the advertisement. There is currently no effective manner, however, for determining a time that a user is most likely to wish to receive an alert during travel. For instance, route planning applications are static in that regardless of a context they output a same route, and provide no indication of where along the route a good point would be to receive a message.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The following presents a simplified summary in order to provide a basic understanding of some aspects of the claimed subject matter. This summary is not an extensive overview, and is not intended to identify key/critical elements or to delineate the scope of the claimed subject matter. Its sole purpose is to present some concepts in a simplified form as a prelude to the more detailed description that is presented later.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The claimed subject matter relates generally to prediction of when a user will be available to review information and when they are busy and provision of information should be deferred. More particularly, a user in traffic can be associated with one or more sensors that enables the user's position to be determined within a traffic system, speed and/or velocity of the user, direction of travel, and the like. Based upon the sensed data, a real-time inference can be made regarding how long the user will remain stopped (if sensed data indicates that the user was already stopped), when the user will become stopped for a threshold amount of time, and the like. For instance, probabilistic distributions can be created over an amount of time that the user will remain stopped, over when the user will be stopped for a certain amount of time, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">These real-time inferences can then be leveraged in connection with determining when to provide information to the user. For instance, today people can be contacted through a plurality of devices in several different message formats. It may not be desirable to provide the user with information, however, when the user is traveling in a high-congestion traffic region. Furthermore, it may not be desirable to provide the user with a voice message that requires time to review the message that is longer than time that the user will be stopped. Accordingly, information can be prioritized and provided to the user based at least in part upon real-time inferences relating to probabilities that the user will be available to receive and review the information.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The probability distributions can be generated through analysis of information at some level of detail about a traffic system and flow of vehicles through a traffic system, for example. It is understood, however, that the novel concepts described herein are applicable generally to any system or process that is subject to stoppage, such as machine operation, drive through lanes, lines in amusement parks, and the like. Additionally, a traffic-system representation need not be analyzed, because a probability distribution over length of a current stop, when a stop of a certain length will occur, and durations of different phases of driving, e.g., how long until stop and go driving will continue before smooth highway driving begins, and the like, can be determined without use of a detailed traffic system representation. Instead, data about values and patterns of accelerations, maintained velocities, decelerations, and cessations of motion, in addition to contextual information and demographic data can be employed in building predictive models about the timing and duration of motion cessation, or motion and motion pattern (e.g., continuing to drive in stop and go traffic). Continuing with the traffic example, a plurality of automobiles can be associated with sensors that enable one to determine one or more of an automobile's location, acceleration, velocity, travel direction, time of day, day of week, weather conditions, and/or the like. Thus, the system representation can accurately represent flow of traffic given different contexts, such as time of day and day of week. The system representation can further include data relating to location of stop signs, stop lights, and other static entities within the traffic system. Therefore, once data associated with a user in the system is received, such as their current location in the traffic system, the representation can be analyzed in light of the received data to aid in generating the aforementioned probability distributions. Again, however, use of the system representation, and even location information, is optional&#x2014;however, adding a consideration to a database that relates the timing, duration, and overall patterns of motion and the cessation motion to details drawn from a representation of a traffic system may lead to increases in the accuracy of the output of probability distributions over stops, future stops, and over the timing and duration of other patterns of motion, such as the duration of a driver remaining in stop and go traffic.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To aid in determining when and/or whether to provide information to the user, a cost/benefit analysis can be undertaken with respect to cost of disrupting the user versus cost of withholding the information from the user given determined probability distributions of when and how long the user will be stopped. These costs can be based at least in part upon user preferences. For instance, the user may wish to receive phone calls from her spouse immediately regardless of whether she is moving in traffic or stopped. In another example, the user may wish to receive phone calls while moving if they are wearing their headset, and if not wearing their headset they may wish to have an artificial operator hold the call until a stop is sensed or a threshold amount of time has passed.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">To the accomplishment of the foregoing and related ends, certain illustrative aspects are described herein in connection with the following description and the annexed drawings. These aspects are indicative, however, of but a few of the various ways in which the principles of the claimed subject matter may be employed and the claimed matter is intended to include all such aspects and their equivalents. Other advantages and novel features may become apparent from the following detailed description when considered in conjunction with the drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The claimed subject matter is now described with reference to the drawings, wherein like reference numerals are used to refer to like elements throughout. In the following description, for purposes of explanation, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the claimed subject matter. It may be evident, however, that such subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As used in this application, the terms &#x201c;component&#x201d; and &#x201c;system&#x201d; are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a server and the server can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. The word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. Any aspect or design described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Furthermore, aspects of the claimed subject matter may be implemented as a method, apparatus, or article of manufacture using standard programming and/or engineering techniques to produce software, firmware, hardware, or any combination thereof to control a computer to implement various aspects of the subject invention. The term &#x201c;article of manufacture&#x201d; as used herein is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media. For example, computer readable media can include but are not limited to magnetic storage devices (e.g., hard disk, floppy disk, magnetic strips, . . . ), optical disks (e.g., compact disk (CD), digital versatile disk (DVD), . . . ), smart cards, and flash memory devices (e.g., card, stick, key drive, . . . ). Additionally it should be appreciated that a carrier wave can be employed to carry computer-readable electronic data such as those used in transmitting and receiving electronic mail or in accessing a network such as the Internet or a local area network (LAN). Of course, those skilled in the art will recognize many modifications may be made to this configuration without departing from the scope or spirit of what is described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">For purposes of explanation and not limitation, the systems/methods are generally described herein with respect to users traveling in a traffic system (e.g., in automobiles). It is to be understood and appreciated, however, that concepts underlying the following description of the figures can be applied to other areas where an activity is subject to at least temporary stoppage (e.g., machine breakdown).</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a system <b>100</b> that facilitates predicting when a user will cease an activity and an amount of time that such activity will be ceased is illustrated. The system <b>100</b> includes a receiver component <b>102</b> that receives a system representation <b>104</b> and data from one or more sensors <b>106</b>. For example, the system representation <b>104</b> can be based upon a traffic system, where parameters of the traffic system are learned through analysis of vehicles traveling through the system. The system representation <b>104</b> can additionally include data relating to location of stop lights, stop signs, intersections, on and off ramps for freeways, etc. Users traveling through the traffic system can be associated with sensing devices such as accelerometers, GPS (or other motion detection or location-based identification scheme, such as wireless triangulation), and data from such sensors can be placed within a data repository (not shown) to create a robust case library. The case library can additionally include contextual data associated with location/velocity/acceleration data, including time of day, day of week, whether an event had occurred in a nearby region (such as a sporting event and/or a concert), weather conditions, and any other suitable contextual data. In another example, the system representation <b>104</b> can be on a smaller scale, such as based solely upon a driver's activity. For instance, the system representation <b>104</b> can represent a driver's history of travel, past and recent accelerations, velocities, decelerations, locations, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Instances within the case library where users were not moving can be located, and typical durations of such pauses can be discerned given certain particular contextual data. For example, at a particular stop sign users may typically be stopped for just a few seconds, while at a stop light a typical user may be stopped for over a minute. Machine learning can be undertaken upon the case library to refine the system representation <b>104</b>, such that given data associated with a user (such as current location, current speed, context, etc.) a good sense for when a user will be stopped and for an amount of time of the stop can be ascertained.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The system <b>100</b> additionally includes a computation component <b>108</b> that reviews the system representation <b>104</b> in light of received data from the sensor <b>106</b>. If the sensor <b>106</b> outputs data that indicates that the user is at a stop, the computation component <b>108</b> can calculate a probability distribution over duration of a stop. For instance, the computation component <b>108</b> can analyze the user's location during a stop in connection with the system representation <b>104</b> and generate a probability distribution over the duration of the stop. In another example, if the sensor <b>106</b> indicates that the user is moving, then the computation component <b>108</b> can generate a probability distribution over time until the user is stopped (or time until the users stops for a time longer than a threshold time) and/or a probability distribution regarding when a user will leave stop and go traffic and enter smooth highway driving. For instance, location of stop signs in the system representation <b>104</b> compared to location of the user can be indicative of whether the user is in stop and go traffic or stopping at one or more stop signs. In still another example, the computation component <b>108</b> can receive a user's current velocity and determine a probability distribution regarding when the user will be stopped for over a threshold amount of time.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">With still more detail with respect to the computation component <b>108</b> determining probability distributions over stops, the component <b>108</b> can analyze month of year, season, whether a day is a holiday, weather conditions, road conditions, major events (such as sporting and/or cultural events), sensed traffic patterns (e.g., which may be sensed by a fixed sensing system, sensors from drivers, . . . ), dynamics of traffic flow (e.g., durations of time since particular regions of a traffic system have been reported to be blocked or freed from blockage), reports on any road of blockage or flow, natural language reports of accidents, events, closures, construction, etc., whether a major road has been blocked within a certain radius or road driving distance to a user, distance to a major road that has become blocked, distance to a road that has become blocked within some threshold time, road segments that are part of a bypass, conduit, or alternative routes (to arterial), within some distance or in a radius from a current, recent, or evolving arterial traffic flow problem. Such contextual information can be utilized in connection with determining probability distributions over one or more stops.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Road types can include, for example, whether the road is a highway, a major road, an arterial road, a street, a ramp, a limited access highway, a ferry connection, etc. Other parameters that can be taken into account include posted speed, number of lanes, two way versus one way, public versus private, toll versus free, paved versus unpaved, physical divider between different directions or not, length of segment, incoming valence (number of streets coalescing into this road), outgoing valence (number of streets the segment branches into), intersections per mile, traffic lights and their density, whether a road segment is part of a typical &#x201c;trouble spot&#x201d; (e.g., where traffic jams often occur), flow of traffic at a segment having high variance versus low variance, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Other factors can additionally be contemplated by the computation component <b>108</b> (which may be retained within the system representation <b>104</b>), such as proximal terrain surrounding a particular road segment, services nearby a road segment, whether a road segment is near transportation services, travel stops, automotive services, accommodations, shopping, ATMs, banks, emergency assistance centers, city centers, government facilities, educational facilities, business facilities, restaurants, grocery stores, restaurants, bars/nightclubs, recreational facilities, parks, and/or the like. Still further, the computation component <b>108</b> can contemplate relationships between roads, such as geographic proximity to a road, distance from arterial system, distance to a highway on or off-ramp, whether a road a &#x201c;conduit&#x201d; to or from highway (e.g., a major road that can reach the highway or come from the highway by traversing a distance of less than a threshold), whether a road part of one or more &#x201c;bypass&#x201d; routes around a major road or arterial, whether a road is part of paths in side streets that route around arterial trouble spots (commonly blocked portion of arterial system), whether a road is part of one or more &#x201c;alternate&#x201d; routes (e.g., the road is a part of at least one path that serves as an alternate route to blocked highways), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Still further, the computation component <b>108</b> can reason over recent and long-term history of maintained velocities (received from the sensors <b>106</b>), such as maximum and minimum velocities since a most recent stop, maximum and minim velocities over a threshold period of time, recent and long term history of acceleration and deceleration, recent and long-term history of stops (time since last stop, duration of the stop, number of stops over a certain period of time, last long stop, last short stop, etc.), pattern and velocity of a current stop, an amount of time surpassed at a current stop, etc. Still further, when a stop has occurred, an amount of time that the stop has already lasted can be used as an additional variable by the computation component <b>108</b> to predict remaining duration of the stop. These and other suitable factors can be determined to have an affect on when a user will stop, length of a stop, remaining time of a stop, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Now turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a system <b>200</b> that facilitates generating probability distributions with respect to stopping is illustrated. The system <b>200</b> includes the receiver component <b>102</b> that receives data from the sensor <b>106</b> that is associated with a user. The sensed data can then be provided to the computation component <b>108</b> that accesses the system representation <b>104</b> upon receipt of the sensed data. The computation component <b>108</b> can include a stop time component <b>202</b> that is activated if sensed data provided from the sensor <b>106</b> indicates that the user has ceased moving. Once activated, the stop time component <b>202</b> can predict a probability distribution over duration of the stop. For example, in same or similar locations (where similarity can be explicitly defined or inferred through utilization of machine learning) different users may have been stopped certain amounts of time. The stop time component <b>202</b> can generate the probability distribution based at least in part upon such previous instances of users in that region, which can be represented within the system representation <b>104</b>. However, remaining duration of the stop can also be determined by the stop time component <b>202</b> based upon recent history of stops, accelerations, decelerations, and/or velocities through use of an accelerometer that may be within a mobile computing device (e.g., a mobile phone). Thus, the system representation <b>104</b> can simply be a collection of recent user activity and need not be a robust representation of an entire traffic system, for instance.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The computation component <b>108</b> can also include a transition component <b>204</b> that is activated if the receiver component <b>102</b> receives data from the sensor <b>106</b> that indicates that the user is traveling in the system, beginning an activity, etc. Once such indication is received, the transition component <b>204</b> can predict a probability distribution over a time until a next stop. Additionally or alternatively, the transition component <b>204</b> can predict a probability distribution over a time until a next stop with mean longer than time t will occur. Still further, the transition component <b>204</b> can predict a probability distribution over a time until the user transitions between driving patterns, such as between stop and go driving and smooth highway driving and can further and predict the duration of time that the user will be in a particular traffic pattern (e.g., stop and go traffic and/or smooth highway driving). Such determination can be based upon a case library that is reasoned over, the system representation <b>104</b>, and data from the sensor <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an alerting system <b>300</b> that leverages real-time inferences relating to when and how long a user will be stopped to determine when and how to provide information, alerts, and/or messages to a user is illustrated. The system <b>300</b> includes the receiver component <b>102</b> that receives data from a sensor, wherein such data can indicate a user's location, a user's current velocity, a user's acceleration, and/or the like. Further, time of day, day of week, and other contextual data can be received from the sensor <b>106</b> and/or associated with sensed data (e.g., by way of a time stamp or analyzing current temporal data). The computation component <b>108</b> can then analyze the system representation <b>104</b> in light of the received sensed data and generate probabilistic inferences relating to when a user will most likely be subject to a stop, an amount of time of the expected stop, an expected time that a stop will exceed a certain amount of time, an expected amount of time the user will remain stopped if already stopped, and the like. As described above, these probabilistic inferences can be generated through utilization of the system representation <b>104</b>, which can be built based at least in part upon a case library of sensed data associated with a traffic system. As stated above, however, it is understood that the system representation <b>104</b> can be utilized to infer stop times in connection with any activity or process that is subject to stoppages, such as lines in an amusement park, machinery, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Furthermore, as used herein, the term &#x201c;inference&#x201d; refers generally to the process of reasoning about or inferring states of a system, environment, and/or user from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data. Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic&#x2014;that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data. Such inference results in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources. Thus, as described above, given data relating to a user and/or system, the computation component <b>108</b> can output probabilistic inferences relating to when a user will stop, how long they will be stopped, when they will be stopped for a threshold period of time, when they will no longer be subject to stopping, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The system <b>300</b> can additionally include an alerting component <b>302</b> that leverages off of the probabilistic inferences to provide a user with messages, alerts, and/or other suitable information at times when the user's attention is not needed elsewhere (e.g., driving a motor vehicle in moving traffic). For instance, the alerting component <b>302</b> can determine when to provide the user with information or alters based at least in part upon a probability distribution over some aspect of motion or cessation of motion, and optionally the content (or tagged or inferred urgency or importance) of a message or communication. In other words, the alerting component <b>302</b> can identify opportunities for providing a user with a voice message, text message, advertising data, email messages, and the like. The alerting component <b>302</b> can additionally analyze content of the message, source of the message, device that the message is directed towards (if any), parameters of the message such as priority, sender of the message, time the message was initially sent, etc. in connection with determining whether/when to provide a message or other suitable information to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The alerting component <b>302</b> can access a data repository <b>304</b> that includes one or more rules <b>306</b>, and can utilize such rules in connection with determining when to provide a user with a message, alert, advertisement etc. For instance, one example rule can call for phone calls from the user's spouse to be provided to the user immediately regardless of the user's status in a traffic system (e.g., stopped, moving, . . . ). Another example rule can call for holding a voice message from the user until the computation component <b>108</b> predicts that the user will be stopped for an amount of time that enables the user to review an entirety of the message. The rules <b>306</b> within the data repository <b>304</b> and decisions made by the alerting component <b>302</b> (if a situation arises not dictated by a rule) accord to preferences of users, and consider notions as an amount of time available for a user to consume information as well as cognitive ability given historical data and user state. For example, if the system predicts that a user in a car will be stopped for sixty seconds, the alerting component <b>302</b> can coordinate delivery of a streaming video that lasts less than sixty seconds. Upon sensing movement, the streaming can be stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Furthermore, if the user is associated with a plurality of desirably received messages, such messages can be prioritized and/or provided to the user based at least in part upon probability inferences regarding stopping times of the user. For example, a text message that may take a few seconds to read and a voice message that may take a minute to review can be received at a mobile phone and retained until the user has an ability to review such messages. The voice message may be associated with a higher priority than the text message however, the computation component <b>108</b> can predict that given the user's current state and/or the current state of the system, the user will not likely be stopping for a sufficient amount of time to review an entirety of the message for ten minutes. The alerting component <b>302</b> can analyze the situation and determine whether it is more important to interrupt the user while driving and/or provide the user with a part of the voice message during an upcoming predicted stop or current stop (even though the stop is not predicted to last for the duration of the message).</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a more detailed illustration of the alerting component <b>302</b> in operation is illustrated. The alerting component <b>302</b> can be privy to communications, alerts, and the like from a plurality of data sources <b>402</b>-<b>406</b>. For example, the data source <b>402</b> can be an email application of an associate of the user, the data source <b>404</b> can be a cellular telephone of a friend of the user, the data source <b>406</b> can be an advertisement server that selectively provides advertisements to the user. Thus, the data sources <b>402</b>-<b>406</b> can be any suitable device/system that is utilized in connection with delivering information to a user (such as alerts, messages, advertisements, streaming video, etc.). The alerting component <b>302</b> can act as a centralized operator with respect to the data sources <b>402</b>-<b>406</b>, such that any information that reaches the user is first analyzed by the alerting component <b>302</b>. The alerting component <b>302</b> can be resident within a server (not shown) that services data sinks <b>408</b>-<b>412</b> of the user, wherein the data sinks <b>408</b>-<b>412</b> can include a portable telephone, a laptop computer, a personal digital assistant, a pager, an instant messaging device, a graphical display and associated speakers in an automobile, an onboard computer, an onboard television, etc. Additionally or alternatively, the alerting component <b>302</b> and/or at least a portion of functionality associated therewith can be embedded within one or more of the data sinks <b>408</b>-<b>412</b>. For example, the alerting component <b>302</b> can be resident within a portable telephone, wherein the alerting component <b>302</b> can hold calls, text messages, notifications (such as notifications of stock prices, notifications of existence of voicemail, etc.) with respect to the portable telephone. If the alerting component <b>302</b> is resident within one or more clients or is distributed across clients, the components or portions thereof can communicate between themselves and/or act autonomously.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The alerting component <b>302</b> can include a valuation component <b>414</b> that can determine and/or assign a value associated with a message from an incoming data source as well as a cost with respect to the user not receiving the message as time proceeds. The valuation component <b>414</b> can make such determination based upon several rules and/or make inferences given known user preferences. For example, the user of the portable phone can provide a rule to the alerting component that assigns a high value to a phone call from her spouse. The valuation component <b>414</b> can further assign values and/or costs based at least in part upon user context and/or current system state. For example, if a user is close to home, the valuation component <b>414</b> can downgrade the value of a text message from her spouse, as the user will most likely be able to converse with the spouse in person in a few minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The alerting component <b>302</b> can additionally include a deferral component <b>416</b> that takes into consideration probabilities associated with a user being in a stopped position and duration of the stop. Thus, the deferral component <b>404</b> can weigh the value of the message versus the cost of deferring the message given probabilities output by the computation component <b>108</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>), which are indicative of a user's cognitive abilities (e.g., the user's cognitive abilities will increase when they are not moving). The deferral component <b>416</b> can also utilize pre-defined rules to determine when and how to provide information to a user and/or infer when and how to alert a user given knowledge of available data sinks. For instance, the user can define a rule that states that the user is only to be alerted with information with a particular priority where the user is predicted to be stopped (or mostly stopped) for at least thirty seconds. In another example, the deferral component <b>416</b> can defer messages until a stop that is predicted to be above thirty seconds with a threshold probability occurs or until the message has been deferred for five minutes, whatever occurs earlier.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In summary, the alerting component <b>302</b> receives probability distributions relating to a current or future stop, wherein the probability distributions can relate to a length of time of a current stop, when a next stop of a certain time will occur, and/or when the user will transition into or out of stop and go traffic. The alerting component <b>302</b> can then leverage that real-time inference to identify opportunities for alerting a user. In particular, the alerting component <b>302</b> can discern with a particular probability whether the user will have time to read an email, receive a phone call that is being held by an artificial operator, etc. More formally, the alerting component <b>302</b> can include a function by which timing of notifications are guided based at least in part upon nature of contents of a message, including the source and priority associated therewith, a probability regarding the time a user will be stopped for a particular period of time, and a probability that it will be the particular period of time. Data sources to aid in determining stopping probabilities or attentiveness of the user can be exotic. For instance, whether the user depresses a brake pad gently or firmly can be indicative of their attentiveness and/or their probability of stopping. Further, contents of the user's calendar can indicate which messages are of utmost importance to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a system <b>500</b> that facilitates selective delivery of multimedia to one or more devices associated with a user and/or automobile is illustrated. The system <b>500</b> includes the receiver component <b>102</b> that receives sensed data associated with a user (from the sensor <b>106</b>). In an example, the sensor <b>106</b> can sense stability and/or changing of radio signals (e.g., cell tower signals, WiFi signals, . . . ), which can be indicative of whether the user is moving or not moving. The computation component <b>108</b> can analyze the system representation <b>104</b> and, given the data from the sensor <b>106</b>, can predict probabilities relating to how long a current stop will continue, how long it will be until a stop occurs, how long a future stop will last, etc. The system <b>500</b> can additionally include the alerting component <b>302</b>, which can receive messages <b>502</b>, which may include text, voice, and/or email messages, multimedia such as streaming audio and/or video, advertisements, and the like. The alerting component can output a message <b>504</b> to the user based at least in part upon content of the message and parameters associated therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The alerting component <b>502</b> can include the valuation component <b>414</b> that in turn comprises a content analysis component <b>506</b>, wherein the content analysis component <b>506</b> scans messages desirably provided to the user to aid in determining an importance of such messages. For instance, the content analysis component <b>506</b> can include voice recognition functionality that can analyze spoken words left in a voice message to determine urgency thereof. The content analysis component <b>506</b> can additionally analyze voice inflections and tones in connection with inferring urgency of the message. Still further, the content analysis component <b>506</b> can review language within text messages (including email messages) to determine an amount of urgency associated therewith. The deferral component <b>416</b> can include a time analysis component <b>508</b> that determines an amount of time required to entirely review the received messages <b>502</b>. For instance, a time of a voice mail can be determined. A time to read an email can be estimated based at least in part upon length of the email. If the messages <b>502</b> include an advertisement, length of the advertisement can be discerned.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The alerting component <b>302</b> can then select when and how to output the message <b>504</b> based at least in part upon the probabilities generated by the computation component <b>108</b>, the analysis undertaken by the analysis component <b>506</b>, and the time required to review received messages as determined by the time analysis component <b>508</b>. Pursuant to one example, the computation component <b>108</b> can determine that there is a high probability that the user will be associated with a stop in three minutes and that the stop will last forty seconds. The content analysis component <b>506</b> can analyze an email and determine that it is associated with high priority and that there is text within the email indicating that a timely response is required. The time analysis component <b>508</b> can determine that it will take approximately twenty seconds to read the email. The alerting component <b>302</b> can thus decide that, rather than alerting the user immediately and interrupting the user's driving experience, the message <b>504</b> can be provided in three minutes. If the stop does not occur as expected, the alerting component <b>302</b> can provide the user with the message after, for example, five minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a system <b>600</b> that can be employed in connection with building/defining the system representation <b>104</b> is illustrated. The system <b>600</b> includes a data repository <b>602</b> that retains sensed data with respect to a plurality of users, resulting in creation of a case library <b>604</b>. The sensed data can be received from one or more sensors <b>606</b>-<b>610</b> that are associated with users in a traffic system. For instance, the sensors <b>606</b>-<b>610</b> can include location sensors, such as GPS receivers, accelerometers, speedometers, sensors indicating traffic flow in one or more regions, sensors associated with brakes of an automobile, or any other suitable sensors. These sensors can be associated with a plurality of users over time, enabling the case library <b>604</b> to be a robust representation of traffic flows in a traffic system as context varies (e.g., time of day, day of week, weather conditions, . . . ). As described above, the sensors <b>606</b>-<b>610</b> can be employed in other contexts, such as monitoring machine operation for breakdowns, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The data repository <b>602</b> can additionally include static data <b>612</b> associated with the traffic system, such as location of stop signs, stop lights, road types (e.g., two lane road, four lane road), posted speed limits, terrain associated with road segments, and other suitable data that is associated with traffic systems that is not subject to change. The static data <b>612</b> and data from within the case library <b>604</b> when taken together can provide an accurate representation of traffic flows in a traffic system. The system <b>600</b> can additionally include a machine-learning component <b>614</b> that reasons over contents of the case library <b>604</b> as well as the static data <b>612</b> to create an accurate and robust system representation, wherein probability distributions relating to time and duration of stops can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In more detail, the machine learning component <b>614</b> can analyze contents of the data repository <b>602</b> to build or train models that can reside within the system representation <b>104</b> that are then employed to determine probability distributions over stop times given current user/system data (as well as a deferral time for messages and other interrupts). For instance, the models can learn patterns relating to traffic flows and cause such patterns to be represented within the system representation <b>104</b>. The models can include substantially any type of system such as statistical/mathematical models and processes for modeling traffic flow including the use of Bayesian learning, which can generate Bayesian dependency models, such as Bayesian networks, na&#xef;ve Bayesian classifiers, and/or Support Vector Machines (SVMs), for example. Other type models or systems can include neural networks and Hidden Markov Models, for example. Although elaborate reasoning models can be employed in accordance with the claimed subject matter, it is to be appreciated that other approaches can also utilized. For example, rather than a more thorough probabilistic approach, deterministic assumptions can also be employed. Thus, in addition to enabling the computation component <b>108</b> (not shown) to perform reasoning under uncertainty, logical decisions can also be made regarding user status, location, context, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The machine learning component <b>614</b> can also be employed in connection with filling in &#x201c;gaps&#x201d; within the system representation. For instance, even if several users are associated with sensors and monitored within a traffic system, there may be certain portions of the traffic system that are not associated with sensed data. The machine learning component <b>614</b> can analyze existing data to aid in representing traffic flows at portions of the traffic system not associated with sensed data over varying contexts. This can be done through recognition and analysis of similar roads at similar contexts, analyzing sensed speeds with respect to a road segment at different contexts, etc. Therefore, in summary, the machine learning component <b>614</b> can be employed to create a robust representation of a traffic system, thereby enabling the computation component <b>108</b> to determine probabilities relating to stopping within the traffic system.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-10</figref>, methodologies in accordance with the claimed subject matter will now be described by way of a series of acts. It is to be understood and appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited by the order of acts, as some acts may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other acts from that shown and described herein. For example, those skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that a methodology could alternatively be represented as a series of interrelated states or events, such as in a state diagram. Moreover, not all illustrated acts may be required to implement a methodology in accordance with the claimed subject matter. Additionally, it should be further appreciated that the methodologies disclosed hereinafter and throughout this specification are capable of being stored on an article of manufacture to facilitate transporting and transferring such methodologies to computers. The term article of manufacture, as used herein, is intended to encompass a computer program accessible from any computer-readable device, carrier, or media.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a methodology <b>700</b> for determining probability distributions relating to a stop is determined. The methodology <b>700</b> starts at <b>702</b>, and at <b>704</b> data is received that is indicative of a state of a user and/or system. For instance, the data can be indicative of a user's current location within a traffic system and current time, current velocity of the user, current acceleration, and/or other suitable data relating to the user. Data relating to the system can include weather conditions, traffic flows in other regions, whether a sporting event is being undertaken within the traffic system, etc. Various information sources can be employed in connection with generating the received data, including accelerometers, GPS receivers, Internet sites, radio stations, television stations, speedometers, amongst others.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At <b>706</b>, a system representation is accessed/analyzed given the received data. For instance, a robust system representation can include road segments and intersections within a traffic system, location of stop signs and stop lights, historic traffic data that is averaged over time, sensed traffic data with respect to different contexts, and the like. At <b>708</b>, a probability distribution relating to the user and an upcoming or current stop is determined/predicted. For example, if sensed data indicates that the user is not moving in a certain location, the system representation can be analyzed with respect to such location (and context, including time) to determine a probability distribution relating to an amount of time the user will remain stopped. Thus, for instance, it can be determined that there is an eighty percent probability that the user will be stopped for at least thirty seconds. This real-time inference can then be leveraged (as described above) to provide users with messages and/or other information, wherein the provision of information is based at least in part upon priority information associated with messages (such as expected value of information to the user, loss of value as time passes, cost associated with delaying the message for a particular period of time).</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In another example, probability distributions can be determined with respect to when a next stop of at least a threshold amount of time t will occur. This can be inferred in real-time as sensed data with respect to a user and/or a system is received. The real-time inference can then be leveraged to determine, for instance, whether to provide a user with information immediately or wait until the user is most likely to be stopped. Thereafter, if the user actually does not stop, the information can be presented to the user after a threshold amount of time has passed. The methodology <b>700</b> then completes at <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a methodology <b>800</b> for determining when/how to deliver information to a user in light of probability distributions relating to a user's opportunity to review the information is illustrated. The methodology <b>800</b> starts at <b>802</b>, and at <b>804</b> information intended for the user is received. This information can include text messages, instant messages, voice messages, pages, emails, alerts, reminders, advertisements, entertainment media, and any other suitable information. Further, the information can be received at a server prior to arriving at a client device. Alternatively, a client device can receive the information and hold such information until it is subject to analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">At <b>806</b>, a probability distribution relating to a user stopping and temporal information associated with such stop is determined. Pursuant to an example, a sensor associated with the user can indicate that they are moving a particular direction on a road segment at a certain velocity. Based at least in part upon such information, a probability distribution relating to when the user will be stopped and probable length of such stop can be determined. At <b>808</b>, parameters associated with the received information are analyzed, including whether it is associated with high priority, amount of time required to review the information, type of information (email, voice message, etc.), an amount of user attention required by the message (e.g., an advertisement may require little of the user's attention), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At <b>810</b> parameters relating to delivery of the information are determined given the inferred probability distribution and the analysis of the parameters. The determination can include to which device the information should be delivered, time that the information should be delivered, mode of delivery of the information, and the like. This determination can be based upon, for instance, user preferences that are embodied as rules; for instance, a user may wish to receive messages of high priority from her spouse regardless of driving status, and may further wish to receive such messages on her portable telephone. Another rule may be to hold all messages from a particular individual until it is sensed that the user is stopped and there is an eighty percent probability that the user will remain stopped for thirty seconds or longer. The information can then be delivered according to the determined parameters. The methodology <b>800</b> then completes at <b>812</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a methodology <b>900</b> for determining when/whether to send information to a user based at least in part upon probability distributions relating to a user stopping is illustrated. The methodology <b>900</b> starts at <b>902</b>, and at <b>904</b> information intended for a user is received, where the information can be a text message, voice message, email message, reminder, alert, advertisement, and the like. As described above, the received information can come from one of a plurality of different sources, including mobile phones, email servers, alert services, etc. At <b>906</b>, source of the information is analyzed, including deliverer of the information and geographical origin of the information. For instance, a user may have preferences relating to a deliverer of the information (e.g., always assign high priorities to a particular deliverer of information).</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">At <b>908</b>, the content of the message is analyzed. For instance, text can be analyzed, voice messages can be analyzed with voice recognition techniques, emails can be scanned to look for particular keywords in a subject line, and the like. At <b>910</b>, cost associated with deferring the information is determined. In one example, priority can be determined based upon a cost assigned to the information if the information is not provided to the user. Thus, cost of delaying deliverance of the information can be balanced against cost of interrupting the user given the user's current state in order to determine a deferral policy with respect to the information specifically, and the user generally. For example, a context-sensitive probability distribution over the user's transition from moving to being stopped can be generated. A measure of loss can also be determined with respect to delaying the incoming information.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">At <b>912</b>, based upon the probable cost, a determination is made regarding when to provide the user with the information based at least in part upon the determined cost and the determined probabilities relating to stop times (which are based at least in part upon current sensed data relating to the user/system). For instance, the determination can be made to wait to deliver the information for at least five minutes, as there is a high probability that the user will be stopped in traffic for three minutes in less than five minutes. The methodology <b>900</b> then completes at <b>914</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, a methodology for determining whether to deliver information to a user immediately or wait until the user is stopped is illustrated. The methodology <b>1000</b> starts at <b>1002</b>, and at <b>1004</b> a message is received (such as an email message). At <b>1006</b>, an amount of time required to review the message is determined. For instance, if the message is a voice message, the length in time of the voice message can be determined. If the message is an email, a number of words can be counted within the email and then translated to an amount of time required to read the counted words.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At <b>1008</b>, a time that a stop will occur with a threshold probability of the stop being over the amount of time required to review the message is determined This determination can be made by analyzing a robust traffic system representation that indicates traffic flows given particular contextual data and current sensed data associated with the user or system, including time of day and day of week. At <b>1010</b>, a determination is made regarding whether to deliver the message immediately or to wait a period of time given the probability that the user will become stopped. For instance, a cost of delaying the message can be weighed against a cost of interrupting the user while driving. The methodology <b>1000</b> then completes at <b>1012</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an example mobile telephone <b>1100</b> that can provide information to a user is illustrated. The mobile telephone <b>1100</b> can include, for example, an accelerometer, a GPS sensor, a speedometer, and/or the like. The mobile telephone <b>1100</b> can also be analyzed in connection with performing triangulation, monitoring signal strength (e.g., WiFi), and/or the like. The mobile telephone <b>1100</b> also includes a screen <b>1102</b> that can display textual information to a user. As described above, information can be provided to a user given sensing of a stop, prediction of a stop at a particular instance in time, predicted duration of a stop, predicted time until a stop, etc. Information can be provided to the user based upon a set of predefined rules, inferences relating to importance of the message, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Now referring collectively to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12-15</figref>, an example mobile telephone <b>1200</b> is provided to illustrate user interfaces that can be employed in connection with the functionality described herein. Referring solely to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the mobile telephone <b>1200</b> is illustrated as displaying a user interface <b>1202</b> that indicates that there are no new messages and that messages are to be withheld from a user until a long stop. The user interface <b>1202</b> additionally displays an exit button (to exit an application) and an options button, wherein the user can change how/when information is provided to such user. Now turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the mobile telephone <b>1200</b> is illustrated as displaying a graphical user interface <b>1302</b> where the user can select an amount of time to withhold messages. For example, the interface <b>1302</b> enables the user to set a rule such that the user will not be interrupted for a certain amount of time, while the user is in a certain location, while the user is moving, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the mobile telephone <b>1200</b> is displaying a user interface <b>1402</b> that enables a user to select options relating to when information is provided to such user with respect to when a stop is occurring or predicted to occur. As can be discerned from reviewing the user interface <b>1200</b>, the user can select parameters relating to how long a stop should be when providing messages to such user. The user can also set a deferral time, such that messages are provided if they are deferred beyond a certain amount of time. These parameters can be altered by the user &#x201c;on the fly&#x201d;, can be set to change as context changes (e.g., as time changes, as sensed location alters, . . . ). With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the mobile telephone <b>1200</b> is illustrated as displaying a user interface <b>1502</b> that allows a user to inform the mobile phone that calls should be held while the user is moving and that calls should be delivered only if the user will be stopped for over 20 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, an example predictive model <b>1600</b> that can be utilized in connection with determining length of a stop and when a stop will occur is illustrated. For instance, variables can be sensed, such as velocities of travel at particular instances in time (e.g., 60 seconds in the past, 30 seconds in the past, . . . ), difference in velocity at different times, gender of the driver, marital status of the driver, whether the driver has children, current traffic conditions, proximity to stop lights, etc. Such variables can be utilized by the model to determine a probability that the user will be stopped for at least forty five seconds (or will stop for a certain period of time in forty five seconds).</p>
