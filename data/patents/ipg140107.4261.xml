<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Various embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to a number of drawings. The embodiments show structures and methods of fabricating a memory array that can include programmable metallization cells (PMCs) that can be programmed and erased between one or more resistance and/or capacitive states.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a memory device according to a first embodiment is shown in block schematic diagram and designated by the general reference character <b>100</b>. A memory device <b>100</b> can include PMC sectors <b>102</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>, source node selection circuitry <b>104</b>, bit line selection circuitry <b>106</b>, bit line decoding circuitry <b>108</b>, word line decoding circuitry <b>110</b>, and source decoding circuitry <b>112</b>. A memory device <b>100</b> can be a single integrated circuit or form a portion of a larger integrated circuit device that provides functions in addition to memory (i.e., can be an &#x201c;embedded&#x201d; memory).</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">PMC sectors (<b>102</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>) can each include a number of memory cells arranged into one or more columns and multiple rows. Each memory cell can include one or more PMCs and a selection device. Generally, a PMC may be configured such that when a bias greater than a threshold voltage (Vt<sub>PMC</sub>) is applied across electrodes of the PMC, the electrical properties of the PMC can change. For example, in some arrangements, as a voltage is applied across the electrodes of the PMC, conductive ions within an ion conductor may begin to migrate and form an electrodeposit at or near the more negative of the electrodes. Such an electrodeposit, however, is not required to induce a change in electrical properties. The term &#x201c;electrodeposit&#x201d; as used herein means any area within the ion conductor that has an increased concentration of reduced metal or other conductive material compared to the concentration of such material in the bulk ion conductor material. As the electrodeposit forms, the resistance between the electrodes can decrease, and other electrical properties may also change. If a voltage is applied in reverse, the electrodeposit can dissolve back into the ion conductor and a device can return to a former electrical state (e.g., high resistance state).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In particular arrangements, one electrode of a PMC can be formed of a material including a metal that dissolves in the ion conductor when a sufficient bias is applied across the electrodes (oxidizable electrode) and the other electrode is relatively inert and does not dissolve during operation of the programmable device (an indifferent electrode). For example, one electrode may be an anode during a write process and be comprised of a material including silver that dissolves in an ion conductor while another electrode may be a cathode during the write process and be comprised of an inert material such as tungsten, nickel, molybdenum, platinum, metal silicides, and the like. Having at least one electrode formed of a material including a metal which dissolves in ion conductor can facilitate maintaining a desired dissolved metal concentration within an ion conductor, which in turn, can facilitate rapid and stable electrodeposit formation within ion conductor or other electrical property change during use of a PMC. Furthermore, use of an inert material for the other electrode (cathode during a write operation) can facilitate electrodissolution of any electrodeposit that may have formed and/or return of the programmable device to an erased state after application of a sufficient voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in the particular example shown, PMC sectors (<b>102</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>) can have a &#x201c;bit line anode&#x201d; configuration. That is, for each given memory cell, the anode of the corresponding PMC(s) can be connected to a bit line by a conductive connection that does not include the corresponding access device. Each such bit line may provide a read data path for the corresponding PMC. This is in contrast to other PMC memory device architectures that have bit lines connected to a corresponding PMC via the access device of the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">PMC sectors (<b>102</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>) may also have a &#x201c;strapped source line&#x201d; architecture. Within each PMC sector, groups of access devices within each memory cell can have terminals formed by diffusions in an integrated circuit substrate. Groups of such diffusions can be &#x201c;strapped&#x201d; by a low resistance structure that provides a conductive connection between groups of such diffusion regions. A very particular example of such an arrangement in shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which illustrates source straps <b>114</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>114</b>-<b>7</b> extending in one direction (vertically in the figure). Again, such an arrangement can be in contrast to a PMC architecture in which access devices may be directly connected to a bit line.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows eight PMC sectors (<b>102</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>), other embodiments may include fewer or greater numbers of PMC sectors.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, source node selection circuitry <b>104</b> can selectively connect source straps (<b>114</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>114</b>-<b>7</b>) to various nodes depending upon the mode of operation and a source decoding value. In one particular example, source node selection circuitry <b>104</b> can connect a selected source strap (<b>114</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>114</b>-<b>7</b>) between at least two different voltages, V2 or V1. More particularly, in a program operation or read operation, a selected source strap can be connected to voltage V2. In contrast, in an erase operation, a selected source strap can be connected to voltage V1. Said in another way, voltage V2 can be considered a source program voltage (VS_Prog) and a source read voltage (VS_Read), while a voltage V1 can be considered a source erase voltage (VS_Erase). Preferably, voltages V1 and V2 are conventional power supply voltages, such +5 and 0 volts, or +3.3 and 0 volts, or +1.2 and 0 volts. More particularly, in one embodiment, voltages V1 and/or V2 may be a power supply voltage received at an external pin of an integrated circuit including memory device <b>100</b>. In another embodiment, voltages V1 and/or V2 may be a voltage generated by a voltage regulator of an integrated circuit that includes memory device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In other arrangements, as will be shown in more detail below, source node selection circuitry <b>104</b> can also connect source straps (<b>114</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>114</b>-<b>7</b>) to an inhibit (e.g., de-select) voltage. An inhibit voltage can be applied to PMCs not selected for erase or program operation, and can help ensure that such de-selected PMCs are not adversely affected by such operations (disturbed).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a similar fashion to source line selection circuitry <b>104</b>, bit line selection circuitry <b>106</b> can selectively connect bit lines of one or more PMC sections (<b>102</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>) according to a mode of operation and bit line decoding values. In one particular example, bit line selection circuitry <b>106</b> can advantageously connect a selected bit to either of voltages V2 or V1. That is, in a program operation, a selected bit line can be connected to voltage V1, while in an erase operation, a selected bit line can be connected to voltage V2. Said in another way, voltage V1 can be considered a bit line program voltage (VBL_Prog), while a voltage V2 can be considered a bit line erase voltage (VBL_Erase). In a very particular embodiment, bit line selection circuitry <b>106</b> can include multiple layers of multiplexing.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As in the case of source node selection circuitry <b>104</b>, bit line selection circuitry <b>106</b> can also connect bit lines to an inhibit voltage for PMCs not selected for erase or program.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is noted that an arrangement like that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> can advantageously provide program and erase voltages without having to include charge pumps or the like, to a voltage that is outside of a power supply range, as may exist in other approaches. Instead, supply voltages applied across a selected PMC device can be switched between program and erase operations. In this way, program and erase can be &#x201c;symmetric&#x201d; operations. That is, in a programming operation, a PMC to be programmed can be connected between voltages V1-V2 in an anode-to-cathode direction. In an erase operation, a PMC to be erased can be connected between voltages V2-V1 in an anode-to-cathode direction. This is in contrast to architectures that maintain a constant voltage on anodes of PMCs, and then provide program and erase voltages with respect to such a common anode voltage. In such a cases, a supply voltage must be equal to a program voltage plus an erase voltage (Vprog+Verase). In sharp contrast, in a symmetric operation according to an embodiment, a program voltage may be an erase voltage, which may both be a supply voltage (Vprog=V1-V2, Verase=V2-V1, Supply voltage=V2-V1).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Bit line decoding circuitry <b>108</b> can generate values for selecting given bit lines for read, program and erase operations. In one arrangement, in response to address information (such as column address data), bit line decoding circuitry <b>108</b> can generate bit line select signals for application to bit line select circuitry <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Word line decoding circuitry <b>110</b> can generate values for selecting a given set of memory cells by enabling access devices in one or more selected rows of PMC sections (<b>102</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>102</b>-<b>7</b>). In response to address information (such as row address data), one or more word lines can be driven to a select voltage to thereby enable the corresponding select device in a row of memory cells. In this way, the PMCs of the selected row can be connected to a source node. Word lines can extend in a direction different from source straps (<b>114</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>114</b>-<b>7</b>), preferably essentially perpendicular to source straps.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Source decoding circuitry <b>112</b> can generate values for selecting given source straps (<b>114</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>114</b>-<b>7</b>). In one arrangement, in response to address information (such as column address data), source decoding circuitry <b>112</b> can generate source select signals for application to source node select circuitry <b>108</b>. Source decoding circuitry <b>112</b> can select a source strap corresponding to a same memory cell as a selected bit line, and thereby enable a program, read or erase operation.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In this way, a memory device can include PMCs as data storage elements with anodes commonly connected to bit lines and memory cell access devices connected to strapped and decoded sources. Such select circuitry can provide for symmetrical program and erase operations utilizing bit line decoding and source strap decoding.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a memory device according to another embodiment is shown in a block schematic diagram and designated by the general reference character <b>200</b>. In one example, the memory device <b>200</b> can be one implementation of the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a memory device <b>200</b> that can include features like those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Such like features are referred to with a same reference character but with the first digit being a &#x201c;2&#x201d; instead of a &#x201c;1&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Memory device <b>200</b> includes a PMC sector <b>202</b> that is shown for illustration purposes by four memory cells <b>216</b>-<b>00</b> to <b>216</b>-<b>11</b>, arranged into four columns and two rows. Two memory cells are shown connected to each of two bit lines <b>222</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>222</b>-<b>1</b>. It is understood that the arrangement can be repeated to form a much larger memory cell array structure. Each memory cell (<b>216</b>-<b>00</b> to <b>216</b>-<b>11</b>) can include a PMC <b>218</b> and an access device N<b>20</b>, which in this example is an n-channel insulated gate field effect (hereinafter &#x201c;MOS&#x201d;) transistor. It is noted that while <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an arrangement in which one PMC is provided per memory cell, alternate embodiments may include more than one PMC per memory cell.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">PMCs <b>218</b> may have a structure as described in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or equivalents. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, PMC sector <b>202</b> also includes word line drivers <b>230</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>230</b>-<b>1</b>. Word line drivers (<b>230</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>230</b>-<b>1</b>) can drive corresponding word lines <b>232</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>232</b>-<b>1</b> to thereby select a memory cell (place its corresponding select device into a low impedance state).</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, bit line select circuitry <b>206</b> can include a bit line multiplexer (MUX) <b>224</b> and read/write circuit <b>225</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, bit line MUX <b>224</b> can connect either of bit lines <b>222</b>-<b>0</b>/<b>1</b> to a read/write circuit <b>225</b> or a de-select state (AN_Des). That is, if a bit line <b>222</b>-<b>0</b>/<b>1</b> is selected for a write, program or read operation, such a bit line can be connected to read/write circuit <b>225</b>. However, if the bit line <b>222</b>-<b>0</b>/<b>1</b> is not selected for such operations, it can be placed into the de-selected state. A de-select state AN_Des can be a high impedance state in the case of an &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; bit line architecture, or alternatively, can be a de-select bias voltage Vbias, in the case of a de-select bias architecture. Very particular examples of isolated bit line and de-select bias architectures are shown in other embodiments herein.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Read/write circuit <b>225</b> can vary in operation according to mode values MODE. In a program operation, read/write circuit <b>225</b> can connect a selected bit line to an anode program voltage (VAN_Prog). In an erase operation, read/write circuit <b>225</b> can connect a selected bit line to an anode erase voltage (VAN_Erase). In a read operation, read/write circuit <b>225</b> can connect a selected bit line to a read bias voltage (not shown in the figure).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Source line selection circuitry <b>204</b> can connect one or more of corresponding source straps <b>214</b>-<b>0</b>/<b>1</b> to a source program voltage (VS_Prog), a source erase voltage (VS_Erase), or a source de-select state (S_Des). As in the case of bit line selection circuitry <b>206</b>, a source de-select state S_Des can be a high impedance state in the case of an &#x201c;isolated&#x201d; bit line architecture, or alternatively, can be the de-select bias voltage Vbias, in the case of a de-select bias architecture. Source line selection circuitry <b>204</b> can vary the number of source straps commonly driven to a same state. That is, source line selection circuitry <b>204</b> can select source straps connected to but one column of memory cells, or connected to multiple such columns.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Having described the various sections of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one example of the operation of such a memory device will now be described with reference to an operation that accesses memory cell <b>216</b>-<b>00</b>. Initially, word lines <b>232</b>-<b>0</b>/<b>1</b> can be driven to a de-select voltage (e.g., low) by word line drivers <b>230</b>-<b>0</b>/<b>1</b>. Bit line selection circuitry <b>206</b> can place bit lines <b>222</b>-<b>0</b>/<b>1</b> in the de-selected state. Similarly, source line selection circuitry <b>208</b> can place source straps <b>214</b>-<b>0</b>/<b>1</b> in the de-select state.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a program operation, in response to address and mode data, bit line selection signals BLSEL can be active, resulting in bit line MUX <b>224</b> connecting bit line <b>222</b>-<b>0</b> to read/write circuit <b>225</b>. In contrast, bit line <b>222</b>-<b>1</b> can be de-selected, and thus placed in the de-selected state (AN_Des). Mode selection values MODE can result in read/write circuit <b>225</b> connecting the selected bit line (in this example <b>222</b>-<b>0</b>) to an anode program voltage (VAN_Prog). A program operation can also include source selection signals SSEL connecting source strap <b>214</b>-<b>0</b> to a source program voltage (VS_Prog), while connecting source strap <b>214</b>-<b>1</b> to a source de-select state (S_Des).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">A word line driver (in this case <b>230</b>-<b>0</b>) corresponding to the selected memory cell can be driven to a select voltage, thereby placing the selected PMC (PMC <b>218</b> of memory cell <b>216</b>-<b>00</b>) between program voltages VAN_Prog and VS_Erase.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An erase operation can occur in the same general fashion, but with the anode erase voltage VAN_Erase being applied to the selected bit line and source erase voltage VS_Erase being applied to a selected source strap. As noted in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in particular embodiments, such an operation can be symmetrical, such that VAN_Prog=VS_Erase and VAN_Erase=VS_Prog.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows n-channel MOS transistors as access devices, other embodiments may include different types of access devices. In such alternate embodiments, word line drivers (e.g., <b>230</b>-<b>0</b>/<b>1</b>) would provide appropriate voltage currents to enable such access devices.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In this way, bit line selection, source selection, and word line activation can be utilized to program and/or erase a PMC array having bit lines connected to anodes of PMCs within multiple memory cells.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, a memory device according to yet another embodiment is shown in a block schematic diagram and designated by the general reference character <b>300</b>. In one example, the memory device <b>300</b> can be one implementation of the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> and/or <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a memory device <b>300</b> that can include features like those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Such like features are referred to with a same reference character but with the first digit being a &#x201c;3&#x201d; instead of a &#x201c;2&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> can be similar to memory device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. However, unlike the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when a bit line and the corresponding source strap are de-selected, they can be placed in a high impedance state. It is understood that read circuitry (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>) can be provided to read data values from selected bit lines.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows source line selection circuitry <b>304</b> formed with complementary MOS circuits, including source selection circuits <b>304</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>304</b>-<b>1</b>. Source selection circuit <b>304</b>-<b>0</b> can include a p-channel transistor P<b>30</b> and n-channel transistor N<b>30</b>. Transistor P<b>30</b> can have a source-drain connected between a high voltage V2 and source strap <b>314</b>-<b>0</b>, and receive an enable signal EN<b>1</b>! at its gate. Transistor N<b>30</b> can have a source-drain path connected between source strap <b>314</b>-<b>0</b> and a low voltage V1, and receive a program enable signal PE<b>1</b> at its gate. Source selection circuit <b>304</b>-<b>1</b> can have the same general structure as <b>304</b>-<b>0</b>, but receive signals EN<b>2</b>! and PE<b>3</b> at gates of transistors P<b>32</b> and N<b>32</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a program operation, the program enable signal (PE<b>1</b> or PE<b>3</b>) of a selected source strap can be driven high, while the corresponding enable signal (EN<b>1</b>! or EN<b>2</b>!) is also being driven high. As a result, the selected source strap can be driven to V1 and isolated from V2. In contrast, the program enable signal (PE<b>1</b> or PE<b>3</b>) of a de-selected source strap can be driven low, while the corresponding enable signal (EN<b>1</b>! or EN<b>2</b>!) is driven high. As a result, the de-selected source strap can be isolated from both V2 and V1, thus placing the de-selected source strap into a high impedance state.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In an erase operation, the program enable signal (PE<b>1</b> or PE<b>3</b>) of a selected source strap can be driven low, while the corresponding enable signal (EN<b>1</b>! or EN<b>2</b>!) can be driven low. As a result, the selected source strap can be driven to V2 and isolated from V1. De-selection can occur in the same fashion as the program operation (e.g., force the end of the source strap to be a high impedance).</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> can also differ from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in that bit line selection circuitry <b>306</b> can have but one layer, and is also formed with complementary MOS circuits, including bit line selection circuits <b>306</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>306</b>-<b>1</b>. Bit line selection circuits (<b>306</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>306</b>-<b>1</b>) can have the same structure as source line selection circuits. For example, bit line selection circuit <b>306</b>-<b>0</b> can include a p-channel transistor P<b>34</b> and n-channel transistor N<b>34</b> having source-drain paths in series between V2 and V1, and drains commonly connected to bit line <b>322</b>-<b>0</b>. A program bias signal PEBIAS<b>1</b> can be applied to a gate of P<b>34</b>, while an enable signal EN<b>1</b> can be applied to a gate of N<b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In a program operation, the program bias signal (PEBIAS<b>1</b> or PEBIAS<b>3</b>) of a selected bit line can be driven low, while the corresponding enable signal (EN<b>1</b> or EN<b>2</b>) is also driven low.

In contrast, a de-selected bit line can be placed in a high impedance state in the same fashion as a source strap (i.e., the program bias signal (PEBIAS<b>1</b> or PEBIAS<b>3</b>) of a de-selected source strap can be driven high while the corresponding enable signal (EN<b>1</b> or EN<b>2</b>) is driven low).</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In an erase operation, the program bias signal (PEBIAS<b>1</b> or PEBIAS<b>3</b>) of a selected bit line can be driven high, while the corresponding enable signal (EN<b>1</b> or EN<b>2</b>) is also driven high.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At time t0, a memory device may be undergoing a program operation. In such a programming operation, a selected source strap (SRC STRAP (Sel)) may be driven to a voltage V1, while a selected bit line (BL (Sel)) may be driven to a voltage V2. Consequently, a voltage (from bit line to source strap) of V2-V1 may be applied across a selected memory cell. At the same time, a de-selected source strap (SRC STRAP (Desel)) as well as a de-selected bit line (BL (Desel)) may be placed into a high impedance state (Hi-Z). Consequently, with respect to a corresponding bit line and source strap, a de-selected memory cell will be exposed to a high impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At time t1, a memory device may be undergoing an erase operation. In such an erase operation, a selected source strap (SRC STRAP (Sel)) may be driven to a voltage V2, while a selected bit line (BL (Sel)) may be driven to a voltage V1. Consequently, a voltage (from bit line to source strap) of V1-V2 may be applied across a selected memory cell. At the same time, as in the case of a program operation, with respect to a corresponding bit line and source strap, a de-selected memory cell will be exposed to a high impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In this way, a PMC memory device can include bit lines connected to anodes in a &#x201c;floating&#x201d; de-selection architecture.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a memory device according to yet another embodiment is shown in a block schematic diagram and designated by the general reference character <b>400</b>. In one example, the memory device <b>400</b> can be one implementation of the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref> and/or <b>2</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows a memory device <b>400</b> that can include features like those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Such like features are referred to with a same reference character but with the first digit being a &#x201c;4&#x201d; instead of a &#x201c;2&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> can be similar to memory device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>. However, unlike the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, when a bit line and the corresponding source strap are de-selected, they are not placed in a high impedance state, but instead are driven to predetermined de-select potentials. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows an arrangement in which a source line can be shared along a row direction in addition to a column direction.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows source line selection circuitry <b>404</b> with one source selection circuit <b>404</b>-<b>0</b>. However it is understood that circuit <b>404</b>-<b>0</b> can be repeated for each selectable source strap. Source selection circuit <b>404</b>-<b>0</b> can include a source driver <b>431</b> and a source voltage selection circuit <b>433</b>. A source driver <b>431</b> can have a CMOS inverter configuration, allowing it to drive source strap <b>414</b> to VDD or VSS. A source voltage selection circuit <b>433</b> can generate a source voltage signal SV for input into source driver <b>431</b>. In the particular example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, source voltage selection circuit <b>433</b> can include a de-select device P<b>42</b>, a passgate T<b>40</b>, and an inverter <b>140</b>. De-select device P<b>42</b> can be a PMOS device having a source-drain path connected between a supply voltage VDD and an input to source driver <b>431</b>, and a gate connected to receive source decode signal SDECn. Passgate T<b>40</b> can receive a mode signal MODE via inverter IN<b>40</b>, and can be enabled by source decode signal SDECn and its inverse SDECnB.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In operation, when a source strap is selected, signals SDECn can be high and SDECnB can be low. As a result, passgate T<b>40</b> can be enabled, and signal MODE can be applied as an input SV to source driver <b>431</b>. Thus, in the event signal MODE is high, signal SV will be low, and source strap <b>414</b> can be driven to a high power supply voltage VDD. Conversely, if mode signal MODE is low, signal SV will be high, and source strap <b>414</b> can be driven to a low power supply voltage VSS. When a source strap is de-selected, SDECn can be low and SDECnB can be high. As a result, passgate T<b>40</b> can be disabled, isolating source driver <b>431</b> from signal MODE. However, a low signal SDECn can enable de-select device P<b>42</b>, forcing signal SV high. As a result, source driver <b>410</b> drives source strap <b>414</b> to a de-select voltage, which in this case is VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> also shows bit line selection circuitry <b>406</b> with two bit line selection circuits <b>406</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>406</b>-<b>1</b>. Each such selection circuit (<b>406</b>-<b>0</b> and <b>406</b>-<b>1</b>) can have the same general structure, so only selection circuit <b>406</b>-<b>0</b> will be described in detail. Selection circuit <b>406</b>-<b>0</b> can include p-channel transistors P<b>44</b>, P<b>46</b> and n-channel transistors N<b>44</b>, N<b>46</b>. Transistors P<b>44</b> and N<b>44</b> are arranged in a CMOS inverter configuration, having source-drain paths in series between a select bit line node <b>434</b> and a bit line de-selection voltage VBL_DES. Transistors P<b>46</b> and N<b>46</b> are also arranged in a CMOS inverter configuration, with source drain paths arranged in the opposite direction between a bit line node <b>434</b> and a bit line de-selection voltage VBL_DES. Bit line selection signal BLSEL<b>0</b> can be applied directly to gates of transistors P<b>46</b>/N<b>46</b>, and by way of inverter IN<b>42</b>-<b>0</b> to gates of transistors P<b>44</b>/N<b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In operation, when bit line select signal BSEL<b>0</b> is active (in this case high), bit line <b>422</b>-<b>0</b> can be connected to select bit line node <b>434</b> by both transistors N<b>46</b> and P<b>44</b>, and isolated from bit line de-select voltage VBL_DES. In contrast, when bit line select signal BSEL<b>0</b> is inactive (in this case low), bit line <b>422</b>-<b>0</b> can be connected to bit line de-selection voltage VBL_DES by both transistors N<b>44</b> and P<b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">While programming and erase voltages are shown to be VDD and VSS, alternate embodiments can use voltages other than power supply voltage for such program and/or erase operations. Similarly, while a source de-select voltage of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is VSS, such a voltage, may be some other voltage between supply voltages VDD and VSS. Similarly, a bit line de-select voltage VBL_DES may be VSS in some embodiments, or a voltage between VDD and VSS in other embodiments.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0077">At time t0, a memory device may be undergoing a program operation. In such a programming operation, a selected source strap (SRC STRAP (Sel)) may be driven to a low supply voltage VSS, while a selected bit line (BL (Sel)) may be driven to a high supply voltage VDD. At the same time, a de-selected source strap (SRC STRAP (Desel)) as well as a de-selected bit line (BL (Desel)) may be driven to de-select voltages, which in this particular embodiment, are both VSS.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">At time t1, a memory device may be undergoing an erase operation.

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Unlike the arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, in word line driver circuit <b>1000</b>-B drivers (<b>1002</b>-<b>0</b>&#x2032; to <b>1002</b>-<i>x</i>&#x2032;) are not &#x201c;self-boosting&#x201d;.

<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, the operation of a memory device according to an embodiment is shown in a timing diagram. The timing diagram includes a waveform BL (Sel), which shows a voltage applied to a selected bit line, a word line voltage (WL), a voltage applied to a source strap (SRC STRP), and a voltage received by an element (e.g., PMC) (ELEMENT). In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, it is assumed that a memory device includes n-channel MOS access devices with a threshold voltage Vth(access).</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">At time t0, a memory device may be undergoing a program operation. In such a programming operation, a selected source strap (SRC STRAP (Sel)) may be driven to a voltage V1, while a selected bit line (BL (Sel)) may be driven to a voltage V2. A word line may be driven to a voltage V2. Because an n-channel MOS access device &#x201c;pulls-down&#x201d; to V1 in this arrangement, no threshold drop is introduced and terminals of an element receive voltage V2 and V1. Consequently, a voltage of V2-V1 may be applied across a selected element.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">At time t1, a memory device may be undergoing an erase operation. In such an erase operation, a selected source strap (SRC STRAP (Sel)) may be driven to a voltage V2, while a selected bit line (BL (Sel)) may be driven to a voltage V1. Because an n-channel MOS access device &#x201c;pulls-up&#x201d; to V2, it could introduce a threshold voltage drop. However, a word line may be driven to a voltage Vboost, which is greater than or equal to V2+Vth(access). Such a boosted voltage may ensure no threshold voltage drop is introduced. Consequently, a voltage of V1-V2 may be applied across a selected element. Waveform ELEMENT includes a dashed line to show a voltage that may be applied if a word line was driven only to V2.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A to 10C</figref> have shown an arrangement in which a high boosted voltage may be utilized in conjunction with n-channel MOS transistors, other embodiments may include different boosting for different types of access devices.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In this way, a memory device may include word line boosting circuits to overcome voltage drops inherent in memory cell access devices to provide a same voltage across an element in both program and erase operations.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Other embodiments show circuits and methods for erasing selected PMCs of a PMC memory array. Such embodiments can advantageously erase and verify selected PMC(s) in a single operation, as opposed to erasing a PMC and then subsequently reading from the PMC device to ensure that it has been adequately erased.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a memory device according to an embodiment is shown in block schematic diagram and designated by the general reference character <b>1100</b>. A memory device <b>1100</b> can include a PMC memory array <b>1102</b>, a row decoder <b>1104</b>, a bit line select circuit <b>1106</b>, bit line decoder <b>1108</b>, and erase and verify circuits <b>1110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">A PMC array <b>1102</b> can include a number of memory cells arranged into multiple columns and rows. Generally, a PMC may have a structure like that described above in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, or equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows two possible examples of PMC memory array configurations that can be included in a PMC memory array <b>1102</b>. Such examples of memory array configuration are shown as items <b>1114</b>-A and <b>1114</b>-B. Array configuration <b>1114</b>-A shows a &#x201c;common anode&#x201d; configuration. Each memory cell can include PMCs <b>1115</b> with anodes connected to a common anode node <b>1124</b>. In addition, each PMC <b>1115</b> can be connected to a bit line <b>1120</b> by an access device <b>1118</b>, which in this case can be an n-channel MOS transistor. In response to a voltage on a word line <b>1122</b> a PMC cathode can be connected to a corresponding bit line <b>1120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Array configuration <b>1114</b>-B shows a &#x201c;common cathode&#x201d; configuration, which can generally follow the configuration of <b>1114</b>-A, but includes PMCs with cathodes connected to a common cathode node <b>1124</b>&#x2032;, and access devices formed by p-channel MOS transistors. However, other embodiments can include various different array configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Row decoder <b>1104</b> can activate word lines in response to address data. Similarly, bit line decoder <b>1108</b> can activate bit line select signals in response to address data. Bit line select circuit <b>1106</b> can connect selected bit lines to erase/verify circuit <b>1110</b> in response to bit line select signals.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Erase and verify circuits <b>1110</b> can include a number of erase and verify sections <b>1112</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>1112</b>-<i>n </i>that can each erase and verify a selected PMC (or PMCs) in a single operation. Such approaches can supply a voltage to a selected PMC(s) based on current drawn by such PMC(s).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Such a single erase/verify approach may be in contrast to conventional approaches that can &#x201c;blindly&#x201d; apply voltages across PMCs based on previous characterization of PMCs. In such conventional approaches, erase pulse voltage and duration can be selected in an attempt to guarantee erasure over all anticipated variations in PMC response. Consequently, such pulses may represent a longest erasure time (i.e., a worst case PMC erase case). Further, to verify erase has been achieved, erased cells are typically read to ensure that they are erased. All of these factors can disadvantageously increase overall erase time. Further, conventional PMC erase approaches can result in &#x201c;over erased&#x201d; cells, as an erase characterization for one PMC (or group of PMCs), may result in over-erasure in another PMC (or group of PMCs). Still further, placing PMCs under erase bias conditions longer than those necessary to achieve a target impedance can reduce the endurance of the PMCs.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The erase verify circuits of the present embodiments are also in contrast to &#x201c;algorithmic&#x201d; approaches. Such algorithmic approaches can apply multiple erase and read pulses. After each read, erase conditions can be adjusted to make a next applied erase pulse more efficient. Such approaches can require logic for executing such algorithms, which can disadvantageously consume area on an integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an erase and verify section according to one embodiment is shown in a block schematic diagram, and designated by the reference character <b>1200</b>. Erase and verify section <b>1200</b> is shown connected to a PMC memory array <b>1202</b>. In one example, an erase and verify section <b>1200</b> can be one implementation of those shown as <b>1112</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>1112</b>-<i>n </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, and PMC memory array <b>1202</b> can be any of those implementations shown as <b>1102</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Erase and verify section <b>1200</b> can include a transconductance section <b>1226</b>, an amplifier <b>1228</b>, and a signal generator <b>1230</b>. A transconductance section <b>1226</b> can provide a current &#x201c;I&#x201d; in response to an output voltage VOUT. Current &#x201c;I&#x201d; can be either into or out of PMC memory array <b>1202</b> depending upon the array configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Amplifier <b>1228</b> can have one input that receives an erase reference voltage VERC, another input that receives an array voltage Varray, and an output that provides output voltage VOUT. Signal generator <b>1230</b> can provide an erase verify signal ER_VER in response to output voltage VOUT.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Prior to an erase operation, a selected PMC(s) within PMC memory array <b>1202</b> can have a particular impedance. During an erase operation, erase and verify section <b>1200</b> can be connected to such a PMC(s). This can establish an initial Varray value based on the initial impedance of the selected PMC(s). Due to a difference between voltage Varray and erase reference voltage VERC, transconductance section <b>1226</b> can enable a path between voltage V1 and V2 that results in an erase potential being applied across the PMC(s), and thus can start an erase operation.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In response to being placed between voltages V1 and V2 (i.e., an erase potential), an impedance presented by the PMC(s) can change, resulting in Varray changing (more toward VERC). This, in turn, can cause and output of amplifier <b>1228</b> to change, causing transconductance section <b>1226</b> to provide less current.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">A signal generator <b>1230</b> can detect the change in the output of amplifier <b>1228</b> to activate an erase verification signal ER_VER. A threshold for such a determination can correspond to a voltage generated by accessed PMCs being in a fully erased state. In this way, easer verification signal ER_VER can indicate when a selected PMC(s) is erased.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">An approach like that shown above can eliminate a need for a read cycle following an erase cycle to verify that erasure has occurred. Avoiding a follow-on read operation can lead to lower power consumption, and/or provide for a reduction in device size as algorithms for executing relatively complex multi-cycle erase and verify operations can be omitted. Further, a time between the application or erase potentials to the PMC(s) and the activation of the erase verification signal ER_VER can help characterize an erase time for a device.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">An approach like that above may also provide for more efficient erasure of PMC devices. By basing erasure of a PMC(s) on a final impedance value, a chance of under erasing (not placing a PMC into a high enough impedance state), can be reduced. Further, faster erase times may be achieved, as an erase time for a PMC(s) can be based on the properties of that particular PMC(s), rather than a worst case (i.e., longest erase time) PMC. Along these same lines, because erasure is based on a final resistance value, control over final PMC resistance values can be better than other approaches that base erasure on worst case devices. Such features can also reduce or eliminate the incidence of over erase in a PMC and/or increase the endurance of a PMC, as a PMC (or group of PMCs) is subject to erase bias conditions only as long as is necessary to achieve a targeted impedance.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Still further, in standard read operations, that can occur at lower voltages than an erase operation, it may be difficult to read from such a high impedance device as an erased PMC. In contrast, an approach like the embodiments herein can provide a reading (i.e., verifying) of such a high impedance state with an erase operation, taking advantage of the existing high voltage states. This can eliminate the need for lower voltage high resistance follow on reads to determine a PMC erased state.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In this way, a PMC memory device can include circuits that simultaneously erase and then verify the erasure of one or more selected PMCs.</p>

Similarly, in response to the same values ELVL_SEL, verify reference switch <b>1646</b> can connect a different one of verify current sources (<b>1635</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>1635</b>-<b>2</b>) to load P<b>62</b>. In such an arrangement, an erase verify signal ER_VER can be tripped for different resulting cell resistance values, allowing erase operations to stop when a particular resistance is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In this way, an erase and verify section can erase and verify the erasure of a PMC memory cell at one of a number of different erase states.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">It is understood that erase and verify circuits according to the various embodiments shown herein, and equivalents, can erase multiple PMC memory cells at a time. In such arrangements, reference values generated to determine when a desired impedance is achieved can reflect a resulting impedance of multiple PMC cells, or be scaled to represent an impedance of multiple PMC cells.</p>

<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Row decoder <b>1704</b> can activate word lines in response to address data. Similarly, bit line decoder <b>1708</b> can active bit line select signals in response to address data. Bit line select circuit <b>1706</b> can connect selected bit lines to program and verify circuit <b>1710</b> in response to bit line select signals.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">Program and verify circuits <b>1710</b> can include a number of program and verify sections <b>1712</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>1712</b>-<i>n </i>that can each program and verify a selected PMC (or PMCs) in a single operation. Such circuits can provide a current to a selected PMC(s) to generate a voltage across the PMC. Such a voltage can be monitored, and once it varies from a program reference voltage, a program verify signal can be generated to thereby indicate that the PMC has been programmed.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">Such an approach is in contrast to conventional approaches that apply voltages across PMCs based on PMC characterization. In such approaches, program voltage and pulse duration can be selected to attempt to guarantee the programming of a PMC over all expected variations. Consequently, in order to ensure sufficient margin to program all devices over such variation, program times may be set to a &#x201c;worst&#x201d; (i.e., longest) programming time. As a result, program times can be unnecessarily longer than needed. Further, to verify programming has been achieved, programmed cells are typically read to ensure that they have been programmed. This can increase overall program operation time.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The programming and verify circuits of the present embodiments are also in contrast to &#x201c;algorithmic&#x201d; approaches. Such algorithmic approaches can execute multiple program and read operations. After each read, programming conditions can be adjusted to make a next applied program pulse more efficient. Such approaches can require considerable logic for executing such an algorithm that can consume value integrated circuit area.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a program and verify section according to one embodiment is shown in a block schematic diagram, and designated by the reference character <b>1800</b>. Program and verify section <b>1800</b> is shown connected to a PMC memory array <b>1802</b>. In one example, a program and verify section <b>1800</b> can be one implementation of those shown as <b>1712</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>1712</b>-<i>n </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, and PMC memory array <b>1802</b> can be any of those implementations shown as <b>1702</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a PMC memory array <b>1802</b> has a common cathode configuration. According to selection information SELECT, one or more PMC can be connected (in this case at their anode ends) to program node <b>1826</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Program and verify section <b>1800</b> can be connected between a high power supply node VDD and program node <b>1826</b>. In the example shown, erase and verify section <b>1800</b> can include a program current source circuit <b>1828</b> and a verify signal generator <b>1830</b>. A program current source circuit <b>1828</b> can supply a program current IPROG to program node <b>1826</b> in response to a program control value PROG. A current IPROG can be a constant current, or alternatively, can be a variable current. According to an impedance across a selected PMC(s), a monitored voltage can be generated at program node. More particularly, prior to programming, non-programmed (or erased) PMCs can have a relatively high resistance. When current source circuit <b>1828</b> is initially enabled, a monitored voltage can be relatively high, due to such a high impedance state. However, enabling current source circuit <b>1828</b> can also generate a voltage that programs the selected PMC(s), resulting in a drop in impedance across a selected PMC(s). Consequently, after such elements are programmed, a voltage at program node <b>1826</b> can drop with respect to its initial value, indicating the programmed state. Operation of current source circuit <b>1828</b> in combination with a resulting impedance across selected can PMC(s) can serve to self-limit programming.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">A verify signal generator <b>1830</b> can compare a voltage at program node <b>1826</b> to a program reference voltage VREF_CAT. In response to such a comparison, a program verify signal PR_VER can be activated.

A program reference voltage VREF_CAT can be the voltage necessary to induce programming in a selected PMC(s) (i.e., a PMC threshold voltage, Vt<sub>PMC</sub>), or can be greater than Vt<sub>PMC</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">A program verify signal PR_VER can be used to stop or inhibit a program operation. In particular, all or a portion of current source circuit <b>1828</b> can be disabled (stopped from providing current) when signal PR_VER is activated.</p>

<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> can differ from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> in that a precharge circuit <b>2028</b>-<b>0</b> can be included in addition to a current source circuit <b>2028</b>-<b>1</b>. A precharge circuit <b>2028</b>-<b>0</b> can allow for more voltage across a selected PMC(s), which can allow for a faster programming of such a PMC(s).

<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref> in combination with <b>20</b>B, one example of a program operation will be described.

At this time, current source <b>2028</b>-<b>1</b> can be disabled, or alternatively enabled. When enabled, precharge circuit <b>2028</b>-<b>0</b> can connect program node <b>2026</b> to a precharge potential VPRECH. During such a precharge operation, a selected PMC(s) can be connected to, or isolated from, program node <b>2026</b> depending upon the programming speed (how fast it can take a PMC to reach a desired programmed state).

<p id="p-0182" num="0181">At about time t1, signal PRCH can return to an inactive state, disabling precharge circuit <b>2028</b>-<b>0</b>.

Similarly, an output of comparator <b>2252</b> can be provided as either a signal PROG_INI or PROG_FIN, according to program signal select circuit <b>2250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">In this way, multiple compare operations can be used to initiate an initial program phase that stops at a first detected PMC resistance, followed by a program verify phase that activates a verify signal based on a second, lower PMC resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22C and 22D</figref>, a program and verify section according to yet another embodiment is shown in a schematic diagram and a timing diagram. In the example shown, a program and verify operation can be conceptualized as having three stages. In a first, higher current stage, a selected PMC(s) can be subject to programming conditions until a first trip point, the first trip point being based on a comparison between the PMC(s) impedance and a reference impedance. In a second, lower current stage, the PMC(s) impedance can be checked again. If a target impedance is not detected (e.g., the PMC(s) has not retained the desired programmed state), the PMC(s) can be automatically subject to the programming conditions (return to first stage). If a target impedance is detected (e.g., the PMC(s) has retained the desired programmed state), a third stage can be reached, and a verify signal can be generated.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22D</figref>, a PMC array <b>2202</b>&#x2032; is represented by a selectable PMC <b>2216</b>&#x2032; accessed by a MOS device <b>2218</b>&#x2032; in response to a select (e.g., word line) signal WL. A program and verify section <b>2200</b>&#x2032; can be connected to PMC array <b>2202</b>&#x2032; at a program node <b>2226</b>&#x2032;, and can include a program current source <b>2228</b>&#x2032;, a first comparator <b>2230</b>-<b>0</b>&#x2032;, a second comparator <b>2230</b>-<b>1</b>&#x2032;, a disable circuit <b>2244</b>&#x2032;, a select circuit <b>2256</b>&#x2032;, a precharge circuit <b>2258</b>&#x2032;, and a reference circuit <b>2260</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">A precharge circuit <b>2258</b>&#x2032; can generate a pulse that can precharge both a first reference node <b>2242</b>-<b>0</b>&#x2032; and program node <b>2226</b>&#x2032; to a precharge voltage (in this example, low power supply voltage VSS).</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">In a first program and verify stage, precharge circuit <b>2258</b>&#x2032; is disabled, while disable circuit <b>2244</b>&#x2032; is enabled (placed into a low impedance state). As a result, both first reference node <b>2242</b>-<b>0</b>&#x2032; and program node <b>2226</b>&#x2032; can be connected to program current source circuit <b>2228</b>&#x2032;. At about the same time, or shortly there after, select circuit <b>2256</b>&#x2032; can connect a reference circuit <b>2260</b>&#x2032; (which includes a reference RC) to a first reference node <b>2242</b>-<b>0</b>&#x2032; and PMC(s) <b>2216</b>&#x2032; can be connected to program node <b>2226</b>&#x2032;. As a result, reference circuit <b>2260</b>&#x2032; will source current at a predetermined rate. PMC(s) <b>2216</b>&#x2032; will start to be programmed, and thus eventually drop in resistance as compared to reference circuit <b>2260</b>&#x2032;. This can be a higher power consuming stage as reference circuit <b>2260</b>&#x2032; and PMC <b>2216</b>&#x2032; are both sourcing current as program current source circuit <b>2228</b>&#x2032; sinks some of this current.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">A first trip point is reached when a potential at program node <b>2226</b>&#x2032; exceeds that at first reference node <b>2242</b>-<b>0</b>&#x2032;. In response to this trip point, first comparator <b>2230</b>-<b>0</b>&#x2032; can place disable circuit <b>2244</b>&#x2032; into a high impedance state, isolating program current source circuit <b>2228</b>&#x2032; from first reference node <b>2242</b>-<b>0</b>&#x2032; and program node <b>2226</b>&#x2032;. This can cause the program and verify section <b>2200</b>&#x2032; to enter a second, lower power consuming stage.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">In a second stage, reference circuit <b>2260</b>&#x2032; will start pulling first reference node <b>2242</b>-<b>0</b>&#x2032; high while the selected PMC(s) <b>2216</b>&#x2032; starts to pull program node <b>2226</b>&#x2032; high. If the selected PMC(s) <b>2216</b>&#x2032; pulls program node <b>2226</b>&#x2032; to a reference voltage before the reference node <b>2242</b>-<b>0</b>&#x2032;, disable circuit <b>2244</b>&#x2032; will continue to isolate the PMC(s) from the current source circuit <b>2228</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">In contrast, if reference circuit <b>2260</b>&#x2032; &#x201c;beats&#x201d; the PMC(s) by pulling the program node <b>2226</b>&#x2032; higher than the program node <b>2226</b>&#x2032; before the program node can reach the reference potential, first comparator <b>2230</b>-<b>0</b>&#x2032; will drive its output low, and enable circuit <b>2244</b>&#x2032; will once again connect first reference node <b>2242</b>-<b>0</b>&#x2032; and program node <b>2226</b>&#x2032; to program current source circuit <b>2228</b>&#x2032;. In this way, the first stage is automatically initiated once again, with reference circuit <b>2260</b>&#x2032; and PMC <b>2216</b>&#x2032; both sourcing current to program current source circuit <b>2228</b>&#x2032;. Such a process can be repeated until a program state is verified (or the operation cancelled).</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Assuming PMC(s) pulls program node <b>2226</b>&#x2032; to the reference potential before reference node <b>2242</b>-<b>0</b>&#x2032;, second comparator <b>2230</b>-<b>1</b>&#x2032; can drive its output signal PRV high, indicating that the PMC(s) is considered to be verified as programmed.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22D</figref> shows various waveforms of a program and verify operation for a circuit like that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">In this way, an initial program and verify operation can compare current drawn by a PMC(s) while it is connected to a programming current source. A lower power verify stage can compare the RC characteristics of the PMC(s) versus a reference RC after such a programming current source is disconnected from the PMC(s).</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a program and verify section according to a further embodiment is shown in a block schematic diagram, and designated by the general reference character <b>2300</b>. This example can also be one version of that shown as <b>1712</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>1712</b>-<i>n </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> shows a circuit that can include features like those of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>. Such like features are referred to with a same reference character but with the first digits being &#x201c;23&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;18&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> can differ from that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> in that it can include a timing circuit <b>2354</b>. A timing circuit <b>2354</b> can require that a program verify signal PR_VER be generated within a predetermined time frame. For example, program operations can occur as noted above, in a repeated fashion (e.g., a sequence like that described for <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>), over a given period of time. If a program verify signal PR_VER cannot be generated, a selected PMC can be determined to be defective.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">In the particular example shown, a timing circuit <b>2354</b> can include a counter circuit <b>2354</b>-<b>0</b>, a count comparator <b>2354</b>-<b>1</b>, and fail logic <b>2354</b>-<b>2</b>. Counter circuit <b>2354</b>-<b>0</b> and count comparator <b>2354</b>-<b>1</b> can determine when a predetermined time period has passed. If signal PR_VER is not activated within such a time period, a fail logic <b>2354</b>-<b>2</b> can activate a fail indication PR_FAIL to signify that a selected PMC(s) could not be programmed to a desired resistance state within a set time period.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">In this way, programming can be controlled according to a timing circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, a program and verify section according to yet another embodiment is shown in block schematic diagram. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> shows a program and verify circuit designated by the general reference character <b>2400</b>. This example can also be one version of that shown as <b>1712</b>-<b>0</b> to <b>1712</b>-<i>n </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">The arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> can include an amplifier <b>2472</b>, a program transconductor (transconductance circuit/device) <b>2458</b>, a verify transconductor <b>2460</b>, a verify signal generator <b>2427</b>, a program voltage source <b>2464</b>, a program current source <b>2466</b>, and a verify current source <b>2468</b>. Such components can be arranged as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. A PMC memory array <b>2402</b> can be connected to the program and verify circuit <b>2400</b> at a program node <b>2426</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Program and verify circuit <b>2400</b> can provide for &#x201c;shunt&#x201d; programming. In a shunt programming operation, a PMC can be connected to a program node and a suitable programming potential generated across the PMC. Initially, current at a program node is sourced/sunk by a program transconductor. As the PMC programs to a lower impedance state, more current is shunted through the PMC device.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The particular operation of the circuit in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">Initially, program node <b>2426</b> can be forced to a programming voltage VPROG. This can be accomplished with a precharge circuit <b>2470</b> (shown by dashed lines), which can force program node <b>2426</b> VPROG. Alternatively, program transconductor <b>2460</b>, in combination with amplifier <b>2472</b>, program voltage source <b>2464</b> and program current source <b>2428</b> can force program node <b>2426</b> to VPROG (or about VPROG). During this initial phase, a PMC(s) may, or may not be connected to program node <b>2426</b>. For example, if PMC <b>2416</b> can require a relatively long program time, PMC <b>2416</b> can be connected to program node <b>2426</b> by access device <b>2418</b> (and any other intervening circuitry) during this phase. Conversely, if a PMC has a shorter program time, it can be disconnected from program node <b>2426</b> at this time.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">Once program node <b>2426</b> is at or about VPROG, PMC <b>2416</b> can be connected to program node <b>2426</b>, if not already connected to such a node, and programming can start.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">Initially, because PMC <b>2416</b> is not programmed, it can have relatively high resistance state. Consequently, the potential at program node <b>2426</b> is sufficiently lower than the VPROG causing amplifier <b>2472</b> to output a voltage CON that causes program transconductor <b>2458</b> to source essentially all programming current to program current source <b>2466</b>. At the same time, amplifier output CON can also cause verify transconductor <b>2460</b> to source current to verify node <b>2474</b>. Current sourced by verify transconductor <b>2460</b> can be greater than that sunk by verify current source <b>2468</b>. As a result, inverting verify signal generator <b>2427</b> can drive its output PRO_VER low, indicating that the PMC <b>2416</b> has not yet been verified as programmed.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">As PMC <b>2416</b> is programmed, its resistance can drop, resulting in PMC <b>2416</b> sourcing essentially all the current to program node <b>2426</b>. Consequently, the potential at program node <b>2426</b> can rise, causing amplifier <b>2472</b> to output a voltage CON that causes program transconductor <b>2458</b> to turn off (provide essentially no current to program node <b>2426</b>). At the same time, amplifier output CON can also cause verify transconductor <b>2460</b> to essentially turn off. This can cause verify current source <b>2468</b> to pull verify node <b>2474</b> low, a result, inverting verify signal generator <b>2427</b> can drive its output PRO_VER high, indicating that the PMC <b>2416</b> has been verified as programmed.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">In this way, a program and verify circuit can use &#x201c;shunt&#x201d; programming to program and verify the programming of one or more PMCs.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">Reference in the description to &#x201c;one embodiment&#x201d; or &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; means that a particular feature, structure, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention.
