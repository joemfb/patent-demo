<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/692,536, filed Mar. 28, 2007 entitled &#x201c;Webcam With Moveable Zoom Lens,&#x201d; which application is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to webcams, and in particular to webcams with an inexpensive zoom lens.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many cameras and high-end web cams include a mechanical zoom feature. A lens is moved by a motor to provide the desired zoom. Some webcams come with software for a &#x201c;software zoom,&#x201d; which basically provides a zoom effect by enlarging the picture, but at a loss of resolution. Such a software or &#x201c;digital&#x201d; zoom is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 6,489,986.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Other products include variable lenses. Mobile phones have included cameras, and in US Published Application No. 2005/0101348, a slider is provided with multiple lenses that can be manually slid over the camera lens. This provides a low cost lens change which allows zoom or polarizing lenses to be used. A more complicated zoom device for a mobile phone or other portable device is shown in US Published Application No. 20060132851.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a webcam with an optical lens that can manually be moved into a position in front of the camera lens. The lens may slide or be rotated to a position in front of the camera lens. The optical lens may be a zoom lens, such that, in combination with the lens of the camera, a fixed zoom or magnification function is provided. Alternately, at least a second lens may also be provided, such as to provide two fixed zoom positions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one embodiment, a curved cover slides over a camera lens on a rounded webcam, with a zoom lens being on a first part of the curved cover, and a second part of the curved cover acting as a cover blocking the camera lens.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another embodiment, a magnifying lens and a minimizing (wide angle) lens can alternately be mechanically moved in front of the camera lens.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In another embodiment, the first, original camera lens can also be moved to improve the focus of the second lens. A single mechanical lever may move both a zoom or other lens in front of the original lens, and also move the original lens inward or outward. In an alternate embodiment, the extra lens (zoom, wide angle, etc.) is manually moved in front of the original lens using a first mechanical mechanism (e.g., a slider), and the original lens is moved relative to the image sensor using a second mechanical mechanism (e.g., a focus dial). Alternately, the image sensor may be moved. In an alternate embodiment, one of the lenses is moved manually, and the other is moved with a motor.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The embodiment includes a support <b>26</b> for attaching to a webcam stand. The slider <b>14</b>, in one embodiment, has a solid plastic portion that may slide in front of lens <b>16</b>. Thus, depending on how far the slider is moved, it may (1) allow an open view for lens <b>16</b>, (2) it may act as a lens cover for lens <b>16</b>, or (3) it may provide a zoom lens in front of lens <b>16</b>. In one embodiment, the combination of lens <b>16</b> and zoom lens <b>18</b> provides a magnification of 1.5. Typically, a webcam user does not want a zoom lens with a large magnification. The zoom is usually used to have the user's face fill more of the picture. Thus, in one embodiment, the zoom is by a factor of 2 or less.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an alternate embodiment of a webcam <b>40</b> with a rotating member <b>42</b> that rotates about an axis <b>44</b>, and a similar axis below the webcam. The center of member <b>42</b> is open, to allow an unobstructed view by camera lens <b>46</b>. On the sides of member <b>42</b> are a magnifying (zoom) lens <b>48</b> and a minimizing (wider field of view) lens <b>50</b>. Lens <b>42</b> may have a magnification of 1.5, while lens <b>50</b> has a magnification of 0.75, in one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> are diagrams of an embodiment illustrating two different positions of a second lens being mechanically moved, with the original lens also being moved. In some embodiments, putting a zoom lens in front of an original lens may result in an out of focus condition. This is because the ideal focus position for the lens relative to the sensor is different when the lens is used alone, compared to when two lenses are used. Thus, one embodiment allows both lenses to be moved with a single mechanical motion.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref> shows a webcam housing <b>52</b> with an original lens <b>54</b> mounted in a lens holder <b>56</b> in front of a sensor <b>58</b> on a circuit board <b>68</b>. A second lens <b>60</b>, such as a zoom lens, is mounted on a curved slider structure <b>62</b>. An arm <b>64</b> is attached to slider structure <b>62</b> and rotates about an axis <b>66</b>. Lens holder <b>56</b> slides in guides <b>70</b>, and is held at a desired position close to sensor <b>58</b> by springs <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, when the slider structure <b>62</b> is moved by a users finger to place lens <b>60</b> in front of lens <b>54</b>. The arm <b>64</b> moves through a slot in the PCB and contacts the edge of lens holder <b>56</b>, pushing it outward. As lens holder <b>56</b> is pushed outward, the springs <b>72</b> are stretched, and guides <b>70</b> maintain the lens perpendicular to the sensor <b>58</b>. Thus, the lens <b>54</b> is moved to a new focus position that is ideal for the combination of lens <b>60</b> and lens <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The slot in the PCB board allows the sensor on the PCB board to be positioned in front of arm <b>64</b>. Alternately, the arm could be in front of the PCB board, with the axis <b>66</b> being mounted on the PCB board or extending through it from behind. Where the arm <b>64</b> contacts lens holder <b>56</b>, there can be a V-shaped groove in holder <b>56</b>, to allow smooth urging forward of holder <b>56</b> by arm <b>64</b>. Alternately, a protruding member on arm <b>64</b> could be used to engage holder <b>56</b>. In yet other embodiments, the arm <b>64</b> could attach to a separate gearing arrangement to move lens holder <b>56</b> forward. For example, axis <b>66</b> could be an axle attached to a gear which engages a worm gear attached to the lens holder. Thus, as arm <b>64</b> rotates, the geared axle rotates, advancing the worm gear and moving lens holder <b>56</b> forward. Alternately, lens holder <b>56</b> could be moved backward.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Other mechanical mechanisms than that used in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref> could be used. Alternately, one of the lenses could be moved manually, and the other with a motor. In one embodiment, the motor is engaged by a switch activated when the first lens is mechanically moved. For example, the slider could move over a switch controlling the motor.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An alternate embodiment is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. A slider <b>80</b> is used to move a second lens in front of the first lens, such as by the mechanism illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3B</figref>. However, instead of the same mechanical mechanism also moving the first lens, a separate focus dial <b>82</b> is used to move the first lens between a normal mode and a zoom mode. The focus dial is connected to a set of gears which connect to a support for the first lens, to move it inward or outward. This is an intuitive operation for a user, since first zooming and then focusing is something easy to understand. The separate focus dial allows for more variation, to account for any manufacturing differences in alignment and lenses.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">It will be understood that modifications and variations may be effected without departing from the scope of the novel concepts of the present invention. For example, in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, two zoom lenses could be used, or one of the lenses can be replaced with an opaque lens cover. The slider of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> could be outside the housing, rather than inside. Rather than a zoom lens, a magnifying lens or wide angle lens could be provided. The lens slider could easily snap off, so a zoom lens could be replaced with a wide angle lens. Accordingly, the foregoing description is intended to be illustrative, but not limiting, of the scope of the invention which is set forth in the following claims.</p>
