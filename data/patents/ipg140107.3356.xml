<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Providing electrical power to support electrical loads located in downhole positions of a production well (e.g., water, gas, and/or oil) is known. Such loads, for example, may include gauges, inflow control valves, electric submersible pumps, other completions equipment, and/or other electrical loads. In existing techniques, power is typically generated and/or stored above ground and transported down the production well via electrical wires. Significant time may be spent during completion operations in placing the wire. The monetary costs of the wire and spoolers are also non-trivial. Furthermore, such wires may be leave downhole equipment susceptible to power loss and/or interruption.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a system <b>100</b> configured for generating electrical power at a downhole position of a production well (i.e., a well completion), in accordance with one or more embodiments. The system <b>100</b> may harness mechanical energy from the flow of fluid being transported by the production well in order to generate electrical power. More specifically, the flow may drive electromagnetic induction through oscillating linear translation.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">By generating electrical power at a downhole position, rather that at the Earth's surface, electrical power can be delivered to downhole electrical loads (e.g., gauges, inflow control valves, electric submersible pumps, other completions equipment, and/or other electrical loads) without the use of electrical wires running down the production well from the surface. Significant time may be saved during completion operations without having to place such wires. Cost savings may be realized by avoiding the use of downhole wires and spoolers. Furthermore, local electrical power generation and delivery may alleviate power loss and/or interruption to downhole equipment.</p>
