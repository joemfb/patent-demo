<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to software, computer program architecture, and data network communications. More specifically, techniques for persistent synthetic environment message notification are described.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In conventional computer or online gaming, characters are typically created by users for interaction with a virtual world or game. Establish accounts, users (i.e., players or person playing a game, whether a PC/desktop, online, massively multiplayer online (e.g., MMO), or console game) typically specify preferences, criteria, rules, characteristics, or other parameters associated with a character, its appearance, capabilities, and other aspects of game play. As characters interact within a game, various activities and events typically occur. During game play or within a game environment, users often interact with each other by creating lists of other characters or other users, often communicating using chat or another messaging feature deployed in the game environment. However, conventional solutions are limited, often restricting the type and amount of information, and the manner in which the information is shared with other players.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some conventional solutions, massively multi-player online games (i.e., MMOG, MMO, MMORPG (i.e., massively multiplayer online role playing games)) typically allow users to communicate with each other, often using messaging techniques deployed within a game environment or implemented for use within a game environment using one or more specialized servers to provide communication capabilities. However, conventional solutions face a constant challenge in attempting to entice additional users to enroll and play a particular game, engage in social networks within a game environment, or allow limited types of information to be shared among users. Further, conventional solutions (i.e., games and gaming applications) often prevent users from sharing game, character, or other related data or information outside of a game environment, often requiring users to be logged into the game environment. Typically, when users are logged into a game environment, conventional solutions are not configured to allow observation of another user's activities or events affecting other users (e.g., a battle occurring in another part of a virtual world of a game that may not involve both users). Still further, conventional games and gaming applications allow game data to be used only within a particular title or game, preventing the use of game data with other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some conventional solutions, in-game data such as combat logs, inventory lists, character, and game performance data offer features that allow users to observe another user's actions or view another user's character information, but only when the observing user is logged into the game environment. In other conventional solutions, users must affirmatively and manually &#x201c;push&#x201d; game status, statistics, level, avatar, or character information to other users. Further, conventional solutions allow basic types of information to be sent only after being manually retrieved by a user. Alternatively, conventional &#x201c;pull&#x201d; solutions for retrieving game data and information must be performed by accessing different sources, typically requiring users to log into a game or gaming application, retrieve desired data, configure rules, filters, preferences, or other parameters. Further, conventional solutions such as MMO games and gaming applications are technically limiting and unable to provide real-time (i.e., game-time) data or information and do not support sending game data outside of the game environment.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Despite these limitations, conventional games and gaming applications are becoming increasingly popular and users are sharing information associated with events and activities affecting their characters using conventional social networking applications and websites (&#x201c;sites&#x201d;). However, using conventional social networking applications to share game-related events and activities is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and provides the ability to view static, time-late information. As a conventional example, a user shares her character's experiences during a battle within a game environment by manually capturing or recording a segment of animation and posts (i.e., uploads, stores, and configures for access by others), pasting it into an email, or posting it to a social networking website, all of which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. By sending email, IM, chat, or other types of messages to other users, the user is able to invite other users to view the posted content. However, the content is created, posted, and configured through time, labor, and expertise-intensive user efforts, which reduces the appeal of games and gaming applications and, subsequently, limits commercial success and revenue potential.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, what is needed is a solution for sharing game data or information without the limitations of conventional techniques.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Various embodiments or examples may be implemented in numerous ways, including as a system, a process, an apparatus, a user interface, or a series of program instructions on a computer readable medium such as a computer readable storage medium or a computer network where the program instructions are sent over optical, electronic, or wireless communication links. In general, operations of disclosed processes may be performed in an arbitrary order, unless otherwise provided in the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A detailed description of one or more examples is provided below along with accompanying figures. The detailed description is provided in connection with such examples, but is not limited to any particular example. The scope is limited only by the claims and numerous alternatives, modifications, and equivalents are encompassed. Numerous specific details are set forth in the following description in order to provide a thorough understanding. These details are provided for the purpose of example and the described techniques may be practiced according to the claims without some or all of these specific details. For clarity, technical material that is known in the technical fields related to the examples has not been described in detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the description.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In some examples, the described techniques may be implemented as a computer program or application (&#x201c;application&#x201d;) or as a plug-in, module, or sub-component of another application. The described techniques may be implemented as software, hardware, firmware, circuitry, or a combination thereof. If implemented as software, the described techniques may be implemented using various types of programming, development, scripting, or formatting languages, frameworks, syntax, applications, protocols, objects, or techniques, including C, Objective C, C++, C#, Adobe&#xae; Integrated Runtime&#x2122; (Adobe&#xae;) AIR&#x2122;), ActionScript&#x2122;, Flex&#x2122;, Lingo&#x2122;, Java&#x2122;, Javascript&#x2122;, Ajax, Perl, COBOL, Fortran, ADA, XML, MXML, HTML, DHTML, XHTML, HTTP, XMPP, and others. Design, publishing, and other types of applications such as Dreamweaver&#xae;, Shockwave&#xae;, Flash&#xae;, and Fireworks&#xae; may also be used to implement the described techniques. The described techniques may be varied and are not limited to the examples or descriptions provided.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Techniques for persistent synthetic environment message notification are described, including retrieving dynamic content (e.g., content, data, or information generated from game play or character interaction with a synthetic environment (i.e., virtual world) in real time) and generating messages in various output formats (&#x201c;formats&#x201d;) for receipt by end devices, such as mobile phones, smart phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), desktop computers, servers, notebooks, or other data communication device, without limitation. In some examples, a persistent synthetic environment may be a virtual world, game, or other simulated environment that, when implemented, provides a continuous forum for various purposes (e.g., gaming, combat simulation, social networking, community or world development, and others) in which users may interact with various aspects, features, activities, and events using characters and avatars. The described techniques may be used to generate message notifications or messages (&#x201c;messages&#x201d;) that may be transmitted between shards (i.e., server-based instances of a synthetic environment (i.e., virtual world, which may be persistent or otherwise), which may be used as copies to implement the synthetic environment), game platforms or titles (i.e., regardless of whether supported by a single game platform or implementation (e.g., console, MMO, MMORPG, MMOG, PC, desktop, and others)), or across various types of data communication interfaces (e.g., application programming interface (&#x201c;API&#x201d;), which may be configured for communicating data and information between a synthetic environment and another application, operating system, or operating system). In some examples, data and information associated with a synthetic environment may be retrieved from one or more sources in real-time or substantially real-time and transmitted to other in-game (i.e., other accounts associated with a given synthetic environment, virtual world, or game) end devices, nodes, or recipients (&#x201c;end devices&#x201d;). In other examples, data and information associated with a synthetic environment, character, account, avatar, character, or any other aspect of a synthetic environment may be transmitted to end devices (e.g., mobile phone, smart phone, PDA, mobile computing device, desktop computer, notebook computer, server, computing network, or any other type of client, server, node, terminal, or other networking element) configured to receive data inside or outside of a synthetic environment on the Internet, World Wide Web (&#x201c;web&#x201d;), or other data network. In other words, a user does not need to be logged into an account within a game, virtual, or synthetic environment in order to receive data associated with the synthetic environment. The described techniques may be varied in design, function, implementation, order, configuration, layout, format, or other technical aspects and are not limited to the examples provided.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates an exemplary persistent synthetic environment message notification system. Here, system <b>100</b> includes network <b>102</b>, message notification system <b>104</b> (including protocol adapter/API <b>105</b>), servers <b>106</b>-<b>112</b>, databases <b>114</b>-<b>120</b>, storing data <b>122</b>-<b>128</b>, and end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b>. The quantity, type, function, capabilities, and other aspects of the elements shown in system <b>100</b> may be varied and are not limited to any examples shown or described. In some examples, servers <b>106</b>-<b>112</b> may be implemented in data communication with databases <b>114</b>-<b>120</b> and, using data <b>122</b>-<b>128</b>, shards of a synthetic environment may be implemented using processes provided by each set (e.g., server <b>106</b> being in data communication with database <b>114</b> using data <b>122</b>, server <b>108</b> being in data communication with database <b>116</b> using data <b>124</b>, server <b>110</b> being in data communication with database <b>118</b> using data <b>126</b>, server <b>112</b> being in data communication with server <b>120</b> using data <b>128</b>, and the like). As an example message notification system <b>104</b>, including protocol adapter/API <b>106</b>, may be implemented on one or more of servers <b>106</b>-<b>112</b>. Configuring data <b>122</b>-<b>128</b> retrieved from one or more of servers <b>106</b>-<b>112</b>, message notification system <b>104</b> may be implemented to generate messages (i.e., message notifications) to one or more of end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For example, data <b>126</b> may include data associated with a synthetic environment that indicates the inventory, allocation, status, and capabilities associated with a given character's weapons. Using inputs provided to message notification system <b>104</b> from any of clients <b>130</b>-<b>138</b> or servers <b>106</b>-<b>112</b>, messages may be generated using data <b>126</b> and transmitted (i.e., sent) to any of clients <b>130</b>-<b>138</b>, regardless of whether the end device is logged into the synthetic environment using, for example, a web browser, an application browser, or the like. As another example, data <b>122</b> and data <b>128</b> may include data associated characters interacting with different regions of a synthetic environment (i.e., virtual world) implemented using different shards. Message notification system <b>104</b> may be configured to generate messages to send to end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b> to allow users to view the actions, activities, performance, statistics, characteristics, attributes, events, or the like associated with another user. Further, message notification system <b>130</b>-<b>138</b> may draw upon dynamic content produced in real-time by a synthetic environment implemented by one or more shards (i.e., server <b>106</b> being in data communication with database <b>114</b> using data <b>122</b>, server <b>108</b> being in data communication with database <b>116</b> using data <b>124</b>, server <b>110</b> being in data communication with database <b>118</b> using data <b>126</b>, server <b>112</b> being in data communication with server <b>120</b> using data <b>128</b>, and the like). Using multi-threading and load-balancing techniques, without limitation to any given technique, large volumes of data may be used to produce real-time &#x201c;feeds&#x201d; or messages being generated and sent to end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b>. As described, messages may be generated using a variety of techniques, protocols, and formats.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Here, messages may be generated by message notification system <b>104</b> using protocol adapter/API <b>105</b> to implement messages in various types of protocols and formats (e.g., TCP/IP, UDP, WAP/WML, SMTP, Brew&#xae;, Java, JavaScript&#xae;, RSS, Atom, HTML, XML, DHTML, and others, without limitation). In some examples, protocol adapter/API <b>105</b> may be a single adapter engine that is configured to translate data <b>122</b>-<b>128</b> from one format to another format. For example, data <b>122</b>-<b>128</b> may be stored as XML-formatted data in databases <b>114</b>-<b>120</b> and, when retrieved by one or more of servers <b>106</b>-<b>112</b>, provided to message notification system <b>104</b>. Subsequently, protocol adapter/API <b>105</b> transforms the XML-formatted data retrieved from databases <b>114</b>-<b>120</b> into a message transmitted as an RSS-based character feed (i.e., a data or information feed that is related to a given character, which may be that of another user, set of users (e.g., a group of users, community of users, a guild, party, team, unit, fire team, squad, platoon, company, battalion, regiment, regimental combat team, brigade, brigade combat team, division, army, and the like) to end device <b>130</b> (e.g., a web-enabled mobile phone). Thus, a user of end device <b>130</b> may be able to view data produced from a synthetic environment (e.g., the weapon status of another user) in real-time on a device that may be web-enabled, but which is not used to log in to the synthetic environment. Messages may be generated and sent to end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b>, regardless of whether they are logged in or out of the synthetic environment. In other words, users may view real-time synthetic environmental data (i.e., data associated with any aspect, feature, character, or attribute of a synthetic environment (e.g., MMO, MMOG, MMORPG, online game, console game, and others)), whether received as an RSS-feed, an email, an instant message using any of various types of instant messaging systems, or a web-based alert that appears as, for example, a pop-up window in a microbrowser provided on device <b>130</b>. In other examples, messages may be generated differently and are not limited to the techniques shown and described.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates another exemplary persistent synthetic environment message notification system. Here, system <b>140</b> includes network <b>102</b>, servers <b>106</b>-<b>112</b>, databases <b>114</b>-<b>120</b>, data <b>122</b>-<b>128</b>, end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b>, and message notification system <b>142</b> (including protocol adapter/API <b>144</b>). In some examples, system <b>140</b> and the elements shown may be implemented similarly or substantially similarly to those shown and described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. As an example, message notification system <b>142</b> and protocol adapter/API <b>144</b> may be implemented on a single server, for example, such as server <b>112</b>. Further, protocol adapter/API <b>144</b>, as shown here or in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, may include one or more applications, programs, or scripts configured to transform or convert data <b>128</b>, for example, to one or more output formats (&#x201c;formats&#x201d;) that may be received by applications installed on end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b>. As an example, if a user wishes to implement an RSS-feed associated with events that the user's character is experiencing within a synthetic environment, he can specify one or more inputs (e.g., preferences, filters, rules, parameters, or the like) to message notification system <b>140</b> using end device <b>134</b>. Using network <b>102</b>, which may be any type of data network (e.g., the Internet, a local area network (LAN), a wide area network (WAN), a wireless local area network (WLAN), or any other type or topology of network), input from end device <b>134</b> may be transmitted to message notification system <b>142</b> and used to direct the transformation or conversion of data <b>128</b> into an RSS-feed that may be received by one or more of end devices <b>130</b>-<b>132</b> or <b>136</b>-<b>138</b>. In some examples, a receiving end device (e.g., end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b>) may be configured or have an application, script, or program installed in order to handle received content formatted using RSS, Atom, or other content syndication formats. In other examples, system <b>100</b> and the above-described elements, including notification system <b>142</b> and protocol adapter/API <b>144</b> may be implemented using a different topology or network configuration apart from that shown and described. Further, system <b>100</b> and the above-described elements may be implemented differently and are not limited to the functions, designs, layout, features, attributes, or other aspects as shown and described above.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> illustrates yet another exemplary persistent synthetic environment message notification system. Here, system <b>150</b> includes servers <b>106</b>-<b>112</b>, databases <b>114</b>-<b>120</b> configured to store and access data <b>122</b>-<b>128</b>, message notification system <b>152</b>, and protocol adapters/API <b>154</b>-<b>166</b> configured to transform (i.e., convert, format, and the like) data <b>122</b>-<b>128</b> into one or more of data formats <b>168</b>-<b>180</b>. Data formats <b>168</b>-<b>180</b> are provided as examples and are not intended to be a comprehensive or all-inclusive set of formats, protocols, and other data types that may be used to generate messages using the techniques described herein. As an example, data <b>122</b> may be data and/or information associated with a synthetic environment, a character account used in connection with the synthetic environment, or other related data. When retrieved by server <b>106</b> from database <b>114</b>, data <b>122</b> may be used to generate a message by message notification system <b>152</b> into an RSS-feed (i.e., data format <b>180</b>) using protocol adapter/API <b>154</b>. In some examples, protocol adapters/APIs <b>154</b>-<b>166</b> may be interfaces that are used to transform, convert, generate, render, or otherwise process data from one format (i.e., data <b>122</b>-<b>128</b>) into one or more output formats (e.g., data formats <b>168</b>-<b>180</b>). Data formats <b>178</b>-<b>180</b> may be used to generate messages or a &#x201c;feed&#x201d; of data or information associated with a synthetic environment in a form such as a &#x201c;news ticker,&#x201d; blog post, and others. Data format <b>176</b> may be used to provide a message notification as an email that may be sent and interpreted by various types of email applications, including web-based email applications. Further, data formats <b>172</b>-<b>174</b> may be used to generate messages for receipt and handling by web-based application or other applications that are used to communicate over, say, the Internet or other types of data networks. Further, data network <b>170</b> may be a type of output data format that is used for generating messages or providing real-time dynamic content from a synthetic environment to a mobile web client (e.g., mobile smart phone with an installed web browser, PDA, or the like) using, for example, wireless markup language (WML), wireless application protocol (WAP), binary run-time environment for wireless (Brew&#xae;), and the like. Still further, data format <b>168</b> may be used to generate messages in other types of data formats apart from those shown and described. Using message notification system <b>152</b>, which may be implemented on one or more of servers <b>106</b>-<b>112</b>, real-time, dynamic content (i.e., data <b>122</b>-<b>128</b>) may be retrieved from one, some, or all of databases <b>114</b>-<b>120</b> and provided to end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1C</figref>) using the formats as shown below. Further, message notification system <b>152</b> provides logic that may include rules, filters, preferences, parameters, or other attributes that may be user or system-specified for a given character account (&#x201c;account&#x201d;) to generate messages for transmission to, say, other members of a guild using various types of formats (e.g., email, web, RSS or Atom feeds, mobile web, and others). This provides real-time updating and informing of events and activities occurring within a synthetic environment, regardless of whether the receiving user is logged into the synthetic environment. In other words, users do not need to be logged into the game, synthetic environment, or other types of accounts in order to view dynamic content. In other examples, users may also configure character accounts by inputting rules, filters, preferences, parameters, or other attributes in order to receive data or information associated with her character, regardless of whether she is logged in or out of her account. In still other examples, system <b>150</b> and the above-described elements may be varied in quantity, function, configuration, layout, design, operation, implementation, or other aspects and are not limited to the examples shown and described.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an exemplary application architecture for persistent synthetic environment message notification. Here, application <b>200</b> includes inputs module <b>202</b>, message notification system <b>204</b>, and outputs module <b>206</b>. Each of inputs module <b>202</b>, message notification system <b>204</b>, and outputs module <b>206</b> may be implemented as a computer program, application, software, hardware, circuitry, or a combination thereof. Further, inputs module <b>202</b>, message notification system <b>204</b>, and outputs module <b>206</b> may also be portions of software code that are discretely identified here for purposes of explanation. In some examples, inputs module <b>202</b> may be an application, program, or script that is used to identify, determine, and encode data input to message notification system <b>204</b>. Further, outputs module <b>206</b> may be an application, program, or script that is used to identify, determine, and transmit messages generated by message notification system <b>204</b> using data provided by inputs module <b>202</b>. Application <b>200</b> and the above-described modules may be implemented as software, hardware, circuitry, or a combination thereof and are not limited to the features, functions, configuration, implementation, or structures described above.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates exemplary inputs for persistent synthetic environment message notification. Here, inputs module <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) includes in-game: character-based events module <b>302</b>, in-game: world events module <b>304</b>, community events module <b>306</b>, system notifications module <b>308</b>, and other notifications module <b>310</b>. The quantity, type, configuration, function, structure, or implementation of inputs module <b>202</b> and the described elements may be varied and are not limited to the examples shown. In some examples, in-game: character-based events module <b>302</b> and in-game: world events module <b>304</b> may include processes and data that are used to provide inputs to message notification system <b>204</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). As an example, in game: character-based events module <b>302</b> may be a process implemented using software, hardware, circuitry, or a combination thereof that provides dynamic content associated with characters within a synthetic environment (i.e., character data). Character data may be accessed and retrieved in the form of real-time data to message notification system <b>204</b>, which is used to generate messages that are directed to outputs module <b>206</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In some examples, character data may refer to any type of data or information associated with a character in a synthetic environment. For example, name, physical characteristics (e.g., height, weight, body geometry, hair color, or other dimensions of an avatar associated with a character), wealth, weapon inventory/status, health, and others, without limitation, may be included as character data. Here, when an event occurs within a synthetic environment that affects a character (e.g., character purchases a weapon, character dies, character is injured, character movement occurs, and others), data associated with the event may be provided by in-game: character-based events module <b>302</b> to notification system <b>204</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Likewise, in-game: world events module <b>304</b> may be implemented as part of inputs module and configured to provide data associated with an event occurring in a synthetic environment (i.e., virtual world) to notification system <b>204</b>. Events affecting a synthetic environment (e.g., a battle occurring in a given region of a synthetic environment, sunset, sunrise, or any other type of event that may bear general or specific interest for a user) may be provided by in-game: world events module <b>304</b>. In some examples, community events module <b>306</b> may be implemented and configured to provide data or information associated with a friends or guild list, news list, guild news, or news, data, or information associated with game play or a character or a synthetic environment in general. Further, system notifications module <b>308</b> may be implemented and configured to provide data or information associated with a character account (e.g., impending account expiration, forgotten or incorrect password, maintenance messages, or other messages generally related to a synthetic environment (i.e., game system, virtual world, and the like)). Still further, other notifications module <b>310</b> may be implemented and configured to provide data or information that may be included in messages generated by message notification system <b>204</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) such as messages from third-party applications other than a game system or platform implementing a synthetic environment. As an example, servers <b>106</b>-<b>112</b>, databases <b>114</b>-<b>120</b>, and notification system <b>104</b>/<b>140</b> with protocol adapter/API <b>105</b>/<b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A-1B</figref>) may be a game system or platform that is configured to implement a synthetic environment. As an example of other notifications that may be provided by other notifications module <b>310</b>, third party applications such as online social networking websites may generate messages associated with a character's account and, using the techniques described herein, be included with messages that are generated by message notification system <b>204</b>. Data gathered, filtered, and sent by modules <b>302</b>-<b>310</b> may be generated from a variety of sources in real-time or substantially real-time and, once identified based on preferences, rules, filters, or other parameters specified within an account, sent to message notification system <b>204</b>. In other examples, the above-described inputs module <b>202</b> and modules <b>302</b>-<b>310</b> may be implemented differently and are not limited to the number, type, configuration, implementation, function, design, layout, architecture, or other aspects of the examples shown and described.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary message notification system for persistent synthetic environment message notification. Here, message notification system <b>204</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) includes notification router <b>402</b>, environmental data retrieval system <b>404</b>, user input subscriptions module <b>406</b>, user output preferences module <b>408</b>, privacy controls <b>410</b>, and admin controls <b>412</b>. Message notification system <b>204</b> includes notification router <b>402</b>, environmental data retrieval system <b>404</b>, user input subscriptions module <b>406</b>, user output preferences module <b>408</b>, privacy controls <b>410</b>, and admin controls <b>412</b> and may be implemented as software, hardware, circuitry, or a combination thereof. Further, one or more of message notification system <b>204</b> includes notification router <b>402</b>, environmental data retrieval system <b>404</b>, user input subscriptions module <b>406</b>, user output preferences module <b>408</b>, privacy controls <b>410</b>, and admin controls <b>412</b> may be implemented as a standalone computer program, software, or application (&#x201c;application&#x201d;) or as functionality included within another application. Regardless, the described techniques provide functionality that may be implemented by message notification system <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In some examples, notification router <b>402</b> provides logic configured to control routing of data and the generation of messages (i.e., message notifications) using data or information from inputs module <b>202</b>, directing the routing of the messages to end devices (e.g., end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>) using formatting provided by protocol adapter/APIs in outputs module <b>206</b>. In other words, notification router <b>402</b> provides control signals and instructions that direct the operation of environmental data retrieval system <b>404</b>, user input subscriptions module <b>406</b>, and user output preferences module <b>408</b> to generate messages based on privacy controls <b>410</b> and admin controls <b>412</b>, for output by outputs module <b>206</b>, as described in greater detail below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Further, notification router <b>402</b> may be implemented as logic configured to determine what data or information associated with a synthetic environment, character, character account, or the like is sent and the manner (e.g., how messages are generated for a given output format or media) in which the data or information is sent. In some examples, notification router <b>402</b> may include a set of rules that are configured as a rules-based logic engine for message notification system <b>204</b>. In other examples, notification router <b>402</b> may be implemented as a data switch that is configured to interact with user input subscriptions module <b>406</b> to retrieve or send synthetic environment (e.g., game) data to in and out-of-game destinations. In still other examples, notification router <b>402</b> may be implemented differently.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Here, environmental data retrieval system <b>404</b> may be implemented to provide a software-based mechanism, in some examples, for retrieving data or information from a synthetic environment. For example, data associated with world-based events (e.g., environmental conditions, events, activities, or other occurrences) may be retrieved by environmental data retrieval system <b>404</b> and sent to notification router <b>402</b> for inclusion with a message generated by the latter and forwarded to outputs module <b>206</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Environmental data retrieval system <b>404</b> may also retrieve any type of data or information associated with a synthetic environment such as a virtual world, game environment, game system, or the like, regardless of implementation (e.g., shards, server-based, client-server, client installed, and others). Information such as time, date, place, and other environmental characteristics may be provided by environmental data retrieval system <b>404</b> to notification router <b>402</b> or other elements, as shown.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some examples, users may provide various types of input (e.g., preferences, rules, parameters, filters, privacy options, administrative controls, and others) using user input subscriptions module <b>406</b>, user output preferences module <b>408</b>, privacy controls <b>410</b>, and admin controls <b>410</b>. For example, user input subscriptions module <b>406</b> may be implemented and used to identify what types and sources of information a user wishes to have accessed for generating messages by message notification system <b>204</b>. As an example, a user may want to specify (i.e., using user input subscriptions module <b>406</b>) that data or information associated with her character, a game, world events, and others is accessed and used by notification router <b>402</b> to generate messages. As another example, user output preferences module <b>408</b> may be configured to identify output formats, including delivery media (e.g., email, instant messages, in-game notifications, out-of-game notifications (e.g., email, instant messages, emails including hyperlinks (&#x201c;links&#x201d;)) to web-based media (e.g., animation clips or segments, for example, of a battle in which a character fought)) for delivering or receiving data or information associated with a synthetic environment. Privacy controls <b>410</b> may, in some examples, be implemented to allow the entry of rules or filters that prevent data or information from being sent to undesirable recipients or end devices (e.g., end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>)). Privacy controls <b>410</b> may also be implemented to control how messages are sent, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data such as account information, payment information, user profile information, and the like. Admin controls <b>412</b> may, in some examples, include instructions or other features that enable users to direct the establishment, use, access, authentication, or other aspects of an account associated with a synthetic environment. In other examples, notification router <b>402</b>, environmental data retrieval system <b>404</b>, user input subscriptions module <b>406</b>, user output preferences module <b>408</b>, privacy controls <b>410</b>, and admin controls <b>412</b> may be implemented differently than as shown and described.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As an example of the functionality and features provided by implementing the above-described elements, a user may be interacting with a historical role playing first-person-shooter (&#x201c;FPS&#x201d;) or role-playing game (&#x201c;RPG&#x201d;) implemented using a synthetic environment configured to appear as South Africa in 1879. In this example, a user's character may have an avatar that appears as a British soldier in Company B, the 24<sup>th </sup>Regiment of Foot, which is combating a Zulu warrior at the defense of Rorke's Drift. During her game play (i.e., interaction with the synthetic environment), a user may wish to share her &#x201c;experience&#x201d; with other users who are either currently logged into the game (i.e., &#x201c;in-game&#x201d;) or logged out of the game (i.e., &#x201c;out-of-game&#x201d;), including data or information regarding her character, her character's ammunition inventory, weapons status, an animation segment showing a given scene in the battle, or the like. Environmental data retrieval system <b>404</b> may be used to access and send data associated with the character's game play to notification router <b>402</b>. As an example of in-game data or information that may be shared, the user may be coordinating with other users (i.e., friends, members of the same unit, guild, or other type of group). In-game shared data or information may include, in this example, her weapons and unit status indicating that the user is running low on ammunition and about to be overrun, providing a pop-up window to another user in a different region of the synthetic environment who is part of a relief column. As an example of out-of-game shared data or information, a user may email an animation clip or segment or a link to an animation clip or segment that allows another user who is not logged into the game to view the former's experience, which could result in the other user joining the game to bring his character to the rescue of the beleaguered user. In other examples, different in-game and out-of game messages may be generated and are not limited to the examples described above. User input subscriptions module <b>406</b> may be configured to allow message notification system to provide data or information from a weapons database, character health database, and game play database. Using output preferences provided by user output preferences module <b>408</b>, notification router <b>402</b> generates messages formatted in SMTP for email and WAP/WML for mobile end devices (e.g., smart phones, PDAs, mobile phones, and the like). Further, privacy controls module <b>410</b> and admin controls module <b>412</b> indicate that data or information associated with the given user should only be sent to members of her guild. Thus, messages are generated that indicate the user's plight within the synthetic environment are sent to trusted recipients (i.e., members of the user's guild), regardless of whether logged into the game or out of the game. As another example, a user may be participating in an auction or other type of marketplace within a synthetic environment (e.g., bidding on a given item). By indicating preferences for receiving information related to the auction using user input subscriptions module <b>406</b> and generating email messages to the user's email account using user output preferences module <b>408</b>, the user may receive one or more intermittent or continuous emails regarding the status of the auction and, in some examples, receive opportunities to direct her character's actions within the synthetic environment while not in-game. The above-described examples may be varied further and are not limited to the descriptions provided. Still further, notification system <b>204</b> and the above-described elements may be varied in design, function, limitation, operation, configuration, or implementation and are not limited to those provided.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates exemplary outputs for persistent synthetic environment message notification. Here, outputs module <b>206</b> includes web ticker module <b>502</b>, web character feed module <b>504</b>, friend radar module <b>506</b>, chat module <b>508</b>, email module <b>510</b>, SMS and instant messaging module <b>512</b>, RSS/Atom/content syndication module <b>514</b>, web services module <b>516</b>, and other messaging systems module <b>518</b>. In some examples, outputs module <b>206</b> may receive message data (i.e., data or information retrieved from databases or other sources associated with a synthetic environment and configured for use with messages generated by message notification system <b>204</b>) and configure messages into one or more output formats using any of web ticker module <b>502</b>, web character feed module <b>504</b>, friend radar module <b>506</b>, chat module <b>508</b>, email module <b>510</b>, SMS and instant messaging module <b>512</b>, RSS/Atom/content syndication module <b>514</b>, web services module <b>516</b>, and other messaging systems module <b>518</b>. Web ticker module <b>502</b> may be used to implement a &#x201c;news ticker&#x201d; feed for providing data or information associated with a synthetic environment, game play, or the like. As an example, web-based data may be formatted using markup languages such as XML, HTML, and others, but sent using TCP/IP as a data communication protocol for interpreting and handling data packets including a given message. Likewise, web character feed module <b>504</b> may be implemented to enable a feed that appears similarly or substantially similar to that described above for web ticker module <b>502</b>. In some examples, a character feed may be provided by web character feed module <b>504</b>, which may be implemented as a news ticker appearing on a website associated with a given user. For example, a character feed may be implemented on a personal web page of a social networking site, allowing others outside of the synthetic environment to view or observe real-time activity of a given character. Likewise, a character for one user may be transmitted and rendered on the website of another user, allowing users to view each other's activities. In other examples, a character feed may be implemented within the synthetic environment (i.e., in-game), allowing users to observe other users' activities during game play. As an example, a character-based update or feed (&#x201c;character feed&#x201d;) may be manually, automatically, or semi-automatically &#x201c;pushed&#x201d; (i.e., sent without permission or input from the receiving user) or &#x201c;pulled&#x201d; (i.e., requested by another user) to users listed on a &#x201c;friend's list&#x201d; or guild list. As another output format, friend radar module <b>506</b> may be implemented that provides data or information to a given user's friends (e.g., other members of a guild, team, or other unit or group) associated with the user or her friend's activities, events, occurrences, or other interactions within a synthetic environment, regardless of whether the user or her friends are logged into (i.e., accessing) the synthetic environment. Chat module <b>508</b> may be implemented to enable messages to be generated and sent using various types of chat formats and data protocols (e.g., IRC, synchronous conferencing, XMPP (i.e., extensible messaging and presence protocol), VoIP, or other types of real-time or near real-time text or voice-based communication applications, formats, and protocols). Email module <b>510</b> may be used to generate messages that are sent using various types of email communication protocol formats, including, but not limited, to SMTP, POP, IMAP, and others. SMS (i.e., short messaging service) and instant messaging (&#x201c;IM&#x201d;) module <b>512</b> may be implemented for generating messages that are sent using SMS, a text-based form of data communication, or instant messages to other users, in-game or out-of-game. RSS, Atom, and content syndication module <b>514</b> may be used to &#x201c;feed&#x201d; or send and post data to another application having a reader (i.e., an application or API configured to receive, interpret, or otherwise process data formatted according to various content syndication formats such as RSS or Atom), such as a blog website (&#x201c;blog&#x201d;) or the like. Further, data or information may be sent as part of messages communicated using one or more web services. Thus, web services module <b>516</b> may be used to generate messages that are communicated over a web service. Further, other output formats may be implemented using other messaging systems <b>518</b>. The above-described techniques allow data or information associated with a synthetic environment to be shared or communicated to recipients, in-game or out-of-game. Still further, outputs module <b>206</b> and the above-described elements are not limited to the examples shown and described.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an alternative exemplary application architecture for persistent synthetic environment message notification. Here, application <b>600</b> includes logic engine <b>602</b>, synthetic environment module <b>604</b>, protocol/format determination module <b>606</b>, communications interface module <b>608</b>, shard interface module <b>610</b>, and database <b>612</b>. In some examples, logic engine <b>602</b> may be implemented to generate and provide control signals and instructions to synthetic environment module <b>604</b>, protocol/format determination module <b>606</b>, communications interface module <b>608</b>, shard interface module <b>610</b>, and database <b>612</b> in order to generate messages including data or information associated with a synthetic environment. Retrieval and initial processing (e.g., selecting data from sources (e.g., database <b>612</b>) indicated by user preferences, filtering data or information to be output based on output preferences specified by a user, which may be included as part of logic engine <b>602</b> or synthetic environment module <b>604</b>) of data or information may be performed by synthetic environment module <b>604</b>. Types of data or information retrieved by synthetic environment module <b>604</b> may include time, date, status of specific regions (e.g., disease-stricken, war-torn, impoverished, prosperous, economically depressed, and the like), physical characteristics of a synthetic environment (e.g., plains, mountainous, desert, barren, hilly, wooded, urban, suburban, and others), and others.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Here, protocol/format determination module <b>606</b> may be configured to determine indicated output formats based on user preferences. Cooperatively working with logic engine <b>602</b> using data bus <b>614</b> (i.e., one or more direct or indirect connections that enable data communication between the elements shown in application <b>600</b>), messages may be generated and output using communications interface module <b>608</b> and shard interface module <b>610</b>. In some examples, communications interface module <b>608</b> allows communication of data and information from message notification application <b>600</b> to other application, operating systems, computing environments, or the like. Further, shard interface module <b>610</b> may, in some examples, be implemented to allow data or information to be retrieved from or sent as messages to one or more shards, without limitation. Database <b>612</b> may be a single or multiple databases, data marts, data warehouses, storage area networks (&#x201c;SAN&#x201d;), or other type of data storage retention facility that is configured to store and access data associated with messages, data communication protocols, application programming interfaces, and others. In some examples, database <b>612</b> may be implemented using one or more databases, game databases, data warehouses, or others to provide a primary source of synthetic environmental data (e.g., data provided from a game database), aggregated sources of synthetic environmental data (e.g., data provided using a data warehouse), or to queue and temporarily store messages that are not delivered, transmitted, or explicitly stored by message notification system (e.g., message notification system <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), <b>152</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>), or the like) for subsequent delivery or retrieval. With regard to explicit storage by message notification system <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), <b>152</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>), or the like for subsequent delivery or retrieval, as an example, an event occurring within a synthetic environment may generated synthetic environmental data that is received by message notification system <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), <b>152</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>), or the like, but stored instead of being delivered. Conditions that may result in storage of synthetic environmental data for later retrieval and delivery may include user or system-specified parameters that instruct application <b>600</b> to store rather than deliver synthetic environmental data, a destination or recipient being unavailable, an event is delayed that does not require delivery of the synthetic environmental data immediately (e.g., an event within the synthetic environment that is scheduled to occur at some future date and time), and others. In other words, synthetic environmental data may be retrieved from database <b>612</b> or directly from a synthetic environment. In other examples, application <b>600</b> and the above-described elements may be varied in design, function, layout, configuration, implementation, structure, application architecture, or other aspects, without limitation to the examples shown and described above.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an exemplary process for persistent synthetic environment message notification. Here, synthetic environmental data is retrieved (<b>702</b>). Once retrieved, preferences, filters, rules, or other user or system-specified parameters are evaluated to identify output formats for generated messages including synthetic environment data (<b>704</b>). A message notification (i.e., message) is configured using the retrieved synthetic environmental data (e.g., any data that meets one or more criteria specified by a user, system, or a combination thereof, that, when the criteria are met, is to be sent as a message to one or more end devices (e.g., end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>)) (<b>710</b>). Once generated, a message notification may be sent (<b>712</b>). In other examples, the above-described process may be varied and is not limited to the techniques provided. The above-described process may be varied in order, function, processes, steps, or other aspects and are not limited to the examples shown and described.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates an alternative exemplary process for persistent synthetic environment message notification. Here, a determination is made as to whether an event has been detected (<b>802</b>). If an event is not detected, the system or application (e.g., message notification system <b>204</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>)) waits until an event is detected. If an event is detected, then synthetic environmental data is retrieved based on the detected event (<b>804</b>). Once retrieved, one or more output formats are identified for transmitting the synthetic environmental data as a message to one or more in-game or out-of-game recipients (e.g., end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1B</figref>)) (<b>806</b>). Once identified, the one or more output formats are used to generate one or more messages communicating the synthetic environmental data (<b>808</b>). Once generated, messages are sent to endpoints (e.g., end devices <b>130</b>-<b>138</b>) indicated by preferences specified by a user, system, or a combination thereof. In other examples, the above-described examples may be varied and are not limited to the techniques described. The above-described process may be varied in order, function, processes, steps, or other aspects and are not limited to the examples shown and described.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> illustrates an exemplary process for providing a message using an exemplary message notification system. Here, an event loop is performed in order to make a determination as to whether an event (i.e., an event occurring within or affecting the synthetic environment, such as a user input, a battle, character or avatar interaction, and others) has been detected (<b>902</b>). If an event is not detected, a loop is performed until an event is detected. If an event is detected, synthetic environmental data associated with the detected event is retrieved from, for example, database <b>612</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), a synthetic environment, or another source (<b>904</b>). Once retrieved, a destination queue is identified (<b>906</b>). In some example, a destination queue may be a list, table, or other data structure that is used to hold messages sent from message notification system <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), <b>152</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>), or the like to await further processing (e.g., generating and formatting a message for delivery to an end device (e.g., cell phone, smart phone, PDA, or the like). After identifying a destination queue, a message may be generated, including providing synthetic environmental data with the message and based on one or more formats associated with the identified destination queue(s) (<b>908</b>). Once generated, a message may be delivered to a queue within message notification system (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), <b>152</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>), or the like (<b>910</b>). In other examples, the above-described process may be &#x201c;chained&#x201d; or repeated for multiple layers of queues. In other words, if multiple queues are identified having similar or different formats, the above-described processes may be chained or sequentially performed such that messages are generated for multiple identified queues. In other examples, the above-described process may be varied and is not limited to those shown and described.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> illustrates another exemplary process for providing a message using an exemplary message notification system. Here, a loop may be performed to determine whether a message is present in a queue (i.e., destination queue as described above) (<b>922</b>). If a message is not detected in a destination queue, then the loop repeats. Alternatively, if a message is detected (<b>924</b>), then the message is retrieved from the queue (<b>926</b>). Once retrieved, a destination device associated with the queue is identified (<b>928</b>). After identifying the destination device, a message may be generated including the synthetic environmental data using one or more formats associated with the destination device (<b>930</b>). For example, if a smart phone is identified as a destination device and messages are formatted using WAP/WML (i.e., wireless application protocol/wireless markup language), then a message may be generated based on the identified format prior to transmission to the destination device. Alternatively, a destination device may be identified and associated with another format (e.g., HTML (i.e., hypertext markup language), XML (extensible markup language), and others). Once generated, messages may be delivered (i.e., transmitted, sent, or otherwise provided) to a destination device (e.g., cell phone, smart phone, client, server, or others) (<b>932</b>). In other examples, the above-described process may be chained or performed in connection, directly or indirectly, with the process described above or that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>. In other words, the above-described process may be performed for multiple destination devices such that messages are delivered using, for example, message notification system <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>), <b>142</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), <b>152</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>). As an example, if multiple destination devices are identified, including a cell phone, smart phone, client computer, and PDA, the above-described process may be chained (i.e., the above-described process may be a &#x201c;link&#x201d; in a chain of processes that are performed for multiple destination devices). In still other examples, the above-described process may be varied and are not limited to the examples shown and described above.</p>
