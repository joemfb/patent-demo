<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Practical writing experience is generally regarded as an effective method of developing writing skills. In this regard, literature pertaining to the teaching of writing suggests that conception of subject matter, arrangement and revision in essay writing may be improved through practice of essay writing. Furthermore, evaluation and feedback, specifically pointing out strong and weak areas in a students essay writing, may facilitate improvements in the student's writing abilities, specifically with regard to essay organization.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In traditional writing classes, students may be presented with a &#x201c;revision checklist&#x201d;. The revision checklist is intended to facilitate a process (i.e., the revision process) in which the student is asked to critically review their own work and identify areas needing improvement. Typically, this checklist is a list of questions posed to the student. These questions are intended to help the student reflect on the quality of their writing. For instance, the checklist might pose questions such as the following: a) Is the intention of the thesis statement clear?; b) Does the thesis statement respond directly to the essay question?; c) Are the main points in the essay clearly stated?; and d) Does the conclusion relate to the thesis statement? If these questions are expressed in such general terms, they may be of little help.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Instead, it may be most helpful if &#x201c;discourse elements&#x201d; within a student's essay are identified and presented to the student. Specific examples of discourse elements include: title, background, thesis statement, main points, support, conclusion, and the like. When the identified discourse elements are presented to the student, the student may, more easily, be able to determine if, for instance, the conclusion follows, conceptually, the thesis statement. However, a teacher may not have sufficient time to annotate (e.g., identify and mark-up the discourse elements of an essay) each student essay and point out specific weaknesses or deficiencies. Furthermore, not all teachers have the same level of annotation skills and thus, some students may receive insufficient or improper annotation. Therefore, an automated discourse analysis application may be valuable to those who wish to improve their writing skills with regard to organization of ideas.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of an architecture for an embodiment of the ADAA <b>180</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the ADAA <b>180</b> includes a user interface <b>300</b> configured to accept an essay and/or to output an annotated essay to the user. For example, the user interface <b>300</b> may accept an essay keyed into the keyboard <b>210</b> and display an annotated essay on the display <b>214</b>. The user interface <b>300</b> is further configured to forward the essay to a feature extractor <b>302</b> and receive the annotated essay from a discourse analysis modeler <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The feature extractor <b>302</b> includes a position identifier <b>304</b>, a lexical item identifier <b>306</b>, a punctuation identifier <b>314</b>, and a rhetorical relation identifier <b>316</b>, each of which is configured to inter-communicate. The term &#x201c;feature&#x201d; may be defined as an attribute, characteristic, and/or quality associated with an identified sentence. More specifically, a feature may include a lexical feature (e.g., word, phrase, etc.) and/or punctuation within the identified sentence. In this regard, the position identifier <b>304</b> is configured to identify sentences and paragraphs within the essay and generate a &#x201c;flat&#x201d; file including a sentence entry for each identified sentence. For each identified sentence, an absolute and relative position may be determined and stored to the corresponding sentence entry (entry) in the flat file. In addition a variety of features may be included in the entry and these features may be set, by default, to &#x201c;F&#x201d; for false. In this regard, each entry may include a string of features separated by commas, for example. As will be described in greater detail hereinbelow, as particular features are identified, these default settings may be modified to &#x201c;T&#x201d; for true. An example of a flat file for an essay including 18 identified sentences, 3 identified paragraphs and approximately 40 lexical features is shown in the following Table 1:</p>

<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As shown in table 1, the example of a flat file includes 18 entries, one for each identified sentence. Each entry begins with a first feature, the term &#x201c;TEXT&#x201d; to indicate a text segment (e.g., a sentence, phrase, etc.) is being identified. The next four features are positional features. These positional features, respectively from left to right, are as follows: sentence position; total number of sentences (utilized to determine relative sentence position); paragraph position; and total number of paragraphs (utilized to determine relative paragraph position). The sixth feature is utilized to indicate whether the sentence is a first sentence, a body sentence, or a last sentence, respectively within the essay. The remainder of the features are utilized to indicate the presence (T) or absence (F) of pre-determined lexical and/or punctuation features. In the example of a flat file provided in table 1, approximately 46 features are identified. However, in practice, any reasonable number of features may be identified. For example, in another embodiment of the invention, approximately 100 features are identified for each identified sentence.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The position identifier <b>304</b> is further configured to determine a relative position for each identified sentence within the essay and/or within a paragraph. As the relative position is determined, this value may be stored to the appropriate entry in the flat file. For example, in the flat file for an 18 sentence essay described in table 1, a total number of identified sentences is determined and this value is stored within each entry. In addition, a total number of paragraphs and an associated paragraph number may be stored within each entry. The position identifier <b>304</b> is further configured to forward the flat file to the lexical item identifier <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The lexical item identifier <b>306</b> is configured to identify lexical features and modify the flat file accordingly. Basically, the lexical item identifier is configured to parse each identified sentence for the presence of a pre-defined lexical feature and, if found, modify the corresponding entry in the flat file. These lexical features may also be described as &#x201c;cues&#x201d; (e.g., indicators, guides, etc.) due to their association with discourse elements and/or rhetorical structures. In general, cues may include words, terms, phrases, syntactic structures, and the like. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the lexical item identifier <b>306</b> includes a category-specific cue identifier <b>308</b>, a general vocabulary identifier <b>310</b>, and a key term identifier <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The category-specific cue identifier <b>308</b> is configured to identify cues typically associated with particular discourse elements. In this manner, a cue may be utilized to indicate a particular sentence is a particular discourse element. For example, the phrase, &#x201c;in conclusion&#x201d; is typically associated with the conclusion statement. Other examples include words such as, &#x201c;opinion&#x201d; and &#x201c;feel&#x201d; being generally associated with the thesis statement.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In an embodiment of the invention, the category-specific cue identifier <b>308</b> may parse through each sentence of the essay searching for a plurality of pre-determined cues. The category-specific cue identifier <b>308</b> is further configured to modify the appropriate entry in the flat file in response to identifying a cue. Moreover, the category-specific cue identifier <b>308</b> is configured to forward the flat file to the general vocabulary identifier <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The general vocabulary identifier <b>310</b> is configured to identify features that may be associated with discourse structures. A discourse structure is a term used to describe an elementary discourse unit, such as a thought or statement. In general, a discourse structure may include a word, term or syntactic structure. More particularly, a discourse structure is typically made up of a sentence or phrase.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The features identified by the general vocabulary identifier <b>310</b> have been predetermined to be associated with specific discourse marker words and terms. For example, the words, &#x201c;agree&#x201d; and &#x201c;disagree&#x201d; may be associated with identification of an argument. In another example, words such as, &#x201c;this&#x201d; and &#x201c;these&#x201d; may indicate that the topic being discussed has not changed. The general vocabulary identifier <b>310</b> is further configured to modify the appropriate entry within the flat file in response to identifying a pre-determined feature. Furthermore, the general vocabulary identifier <b>310</b> is configured to forward the flat file to the key term identifier <b>312</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The key term identifier <b>312</b> is configured to parse each sentence for pre-determined cues associated with various discourse relationships. For example, the words, &#x201c;first&#x201d;, &#x201c;second&#x201d;, &#x201c;third&#x201d;, and &#x201c;finally&#x201d; may be associated with parallel discourse relationships. In another example, words such as, &#x201c;however&#x201d; and &#x201c;alternatively&#x201d; may be associated with a contrasting discourse relationship. The key term identifier <b>312</b> is further configured to modify the appropriate entry within the flat file in response to identifying a pre-determined feature. Furthermore, the key term identifier <b>312</b> is configured to forward the flat file to the punctuation identifier <b>314</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The punctuation identifier <b>314</b>, is configured to identify punctuation pre-determined to be associated with particular discourse elements. For example, an exclamation point at the end of a sentence may indicate a relatively low probability that the sentence is a thesis or conclusion statement and a relatively high probability that the sentence is a supporting sentence. In addition, the punctuation identifier <b>314</b> is further configured to modify the appropriate entry within the flat file in response to identifying a pre-determined punctuation. Furthermore, the punctuation identifier <b>312</b> is configured to forward the flat file to the rhetorical relation identifier <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The rhetorical relation identifier <b>316</b> is configured to receive the flat file and generate a rhetorical structure tree (&#x201c;RST&#x201d;) (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) based on the essay and/or the flat file. A rhetorical relation is a term used to describe how two or more rhetorical structures are connected (e.g., related). In this regard, a text segment (e.g., phrase, sentence, etc.) may have a rhetorical relation to other text segments in an essay. In a general example, a statement may contrast another statement, a paragraph may elaborate on a sentence, and the like. In a more specific example, a text segment beginning with the word, &#x201c;but&#x201d; may be said to contrast a preceding text segment. A more detailed description on the topic of rhetorical relation may be found in U.S. Pat. No. 6,366,759 B1 and is hereby incorporated in its entirety. Rhetorical features identified by the rhetorical relation identifier <b>316</b> may be stored to the flat file (e.g., utilized to modify corresponding entries in the flat file, etc.). The rhetorical relation identifier <b>316</b> is further configured to forward the flat file to the discourse analysis modeler <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The discourse analysis modeler <b>318</b> is configured to receive the flat file from the feature extractor <b>302</b> and extract patterns from the flat file, based on previous training (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). In the previous training, a model <b>320</b> is generated (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In general, the model <b>320</b> includes at least one decision tree generated based on essays annotated by experts and/or trained judges. By navigating the decision tree based on the presence or absence of features associated with each entry in the flat file, a probability correlating each identified sentence to a discourse element may be determined. Thus, for each sentence, the model <b>320</b> is utilized to determine the likelihood of the sentence belonging to a discourse classification category. To those skilled in the art, this process is described as &#x201c;mapping&#x201d;. For example, as the flat file is &#x201c;mapped&#x201d; (e.g., overlaid, compared, etc.) to the model <b>320</b>, the probability of each identified sentence being the thesis statement is determined. These probabilities are compared and, the sentence with a relatively higher probability is determined to be the thesis statement. Furthermore, in this manner, the discourse analysis modeler <b>318</b> may utilize the model <b>320</b> to assign (e.g., categorize) each identified sentence as being (or not being) a member of a particular discourse element.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In another embodiment, the discourse analysis modeler <b>318</b> is configured to utilize a voting algorithm to classify sentences in discourse element categories. In general, although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the voting algorithm may utilize decisions from a plurality of substantially independent discourse analysis systems (e.g., discourse models, models, etc.). (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). For example, the model <b>320</b> may include a model generated based positional data, a model generated based on lexical features, and a model generated based on punctuation. Thus, the flat file may be mapped to each of the plurality of models generating a plurality of probabilities. These probabilities may be utilized, based on a level of agreement between the models, to categorize each sentence.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The discourse analysis modeler <b>318</b> is further configured to annotate the essay based on the determined probabilities. This annotated essay may then be forward by the discourse analysis modeler <b>318</b> to the user interface <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in another embodiment, the ADAA <b>180</b> may be configured to intercommunicate with a database such as the database <b>160</b>. In this regard, the ADAA <b>180</b> may be configured to execute autonomously and/or provide the user with the capability to select data from the database <b>160</b> for analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow diagram of a method <b>400</b> for the ADAA <b>180</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. Accordingly, the method <b>400</b> may be implemented on a computer system (e.g., the computer system <b>200</b>) and/or over a computer network (e.g., the computer network <b>100</b>). The method <b>400</b> is initiated in response to receiving an essay.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At step <b>402</b>, sentences of the essay may be identified by the position identifier <b>304</b>. Furthermore, a flat file including a sentence entry for each identified sentence may be generated by the position identifier <b>304</b>. Each sentence entry may include a string of features separated by commas. Positional features may be assigned a numerical value and the lexical features may be set, by default, to &#x201c;F&#x201d; for false. As will be described in greater detail hereinbelow, as particular lexical features are identified, these default settings may be modified to &#x201c;T&#x201d; for true.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At steps <b>404</b>-<b>408</b>, lexical features are identified and corresponding entries for identified sentences within the flat file are modified accordingly by the lexical item identifier <b>306</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">At step <b>404</b>, cues typically associated with particular discourse elements are identified by the category-specific cue identifier <b>308</b>. In addition, entries in the flat file corresponding to sentences having identified cues may be modified. For example, if the second identified sentence is determined to include the pre-defined search term &#x201c;opinion&#x201d;, then lexical feature corresponding to the term &#x201c;opinion&#x201d; may be modified from &#x201c;F&#x201d; to &#x201c;T&#x201d; in the second entry.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">At step <b>406</b>, features associated with discourse structures may be identified by the general vocabulary identifier <b>310</b>. In addition, entries in the flat file corresponding to sentences having identified features may be modified. For example, if the third identified sentence is determined to include the pre-defined search term &#x201c;those&#x201d;, then lexical feature corresponding to the term &#x201c;those&#x201d; may be modified from &#x201c;F&#x201d; to &#x201c;T&#x201d; in the third entry.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">At step <b>408</b>, pre-determined cues associated with various discourse relationships may be identified by the key term identifier <b>312</b>. In addition, entries in the flat file corresponding to sentences having identified cues may be modified. For example, if the fourth identified sentence is determined to include the pre-defined search term &#x201c;never the less&#x201d;, then lexical feature corresponding to the term &#x201c;never the less&#x201d; may be modified from &#x201c;F&#x201d; to &#x201c;T&#x201d; in the fourth entry.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">At step <b>410</b>, pre-determined punctuation marks may be identified by the punctuation identifier <b>314</b>. In addition, entries in the flat file corresponding to sentences having identified punctuation may be modified. For example, if the fifth identified sentence is determined to include the pre-defined punctuation &#x201c;?&#x201d;, then feature corresponding to the punctuation &#x201c;?&#x201d; may be modified from &#x201c;F&#x201d; to &#x201c;T&#x201d; in the fifth entry.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">At step <b>412</b>, an RST is generated based on the flat file by the rhetorical relation identifier <b>316</b>. In addition, based on the RST, rhetorical features are identified and corresponding entries for identified sentences within the flat file are modified accordingly by the rhetorical relation identifier <b>316</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At step <b>414</b>, the flat file may be mapped to the model <b>320</b>. In general, the likelihood of each identified sentence being a particular discourse element is determined. These probabilities are compared and, the sentence with a relatively higher probability for the particular discourse element is determined to be that particular discourse element. Furthermore, in a similar manner, the probable discourse element category for a plurality of identified sentences may be determined by the discourse analysis modeler <b>318</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Additionally or in another embodiment of the invention, a voting algorithm may be utilized to classify sentences into discourse element categories by the discourse analysis modeler <b>318</b>. In this regard, the decisions from a plurality of substantially independent discourse analysis systems may be weighed (e.g., compared, etc.) to determine a discourse element category probability for each identified sentence.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">At step <b>416</b>, the essay may be annotated based on the determined probabilities by the discourse analysis modeler <b>318</b>. This annotated essay may then be forward by the discourse analysis modeler <b>318</b> to the user interface <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">At step <b>418</b>, the annotated essay may be displayed to the user via the display <b>214</b> by the user interface <b>300</b>.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram of a rhetorical structure tree (&#x201c;RST&#x201d;) <b>500</b> according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the RST <b>500</b> includes discourse structures <b>502</b>-<b>514</b> and rhetorical relations <b>516</b>-<b>526</b>. In the RST <b>500</b>, each discourse structure <b>502</b>-<b>514</b> is identified as having a rhetorical relation <b>516</b>-<b>526</b> to another discourse structure <b>502</b>-<b>514</b>. For example, the discourse structure <b>506</b> has the rhetorical relation <b>522</b> to the discourse structure <b>508</b>. In the example described, the rhetorical relation <b>518</b> is a &#x201c;joint&#x201d; relation. This may be determined based on the conjunction &#x201c;and&#x201d; which is used to &#x201c;join&#x201d; the discourse structure <b>508</b> to the discourse structure <b>506</b>. Other examples of rhetorical relations include: elaboration, background, contrast, cause, antithesis, interpretation, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Additionally, each of the rhetorical relations <b>516</b>-<b>526</b> includes an associated node <b>528</b>-<b>538</b> (e.g., connection). Each node <b>528</b>-<b>538</b> may be characterized by a &#x201c;status&#x201d; (nucleus or satellite). The distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empirical observation that, in general, a nucleus is utilized to express more important content relative to a satellite. Furthermore, a nucleus of a rhetorical relation is typically comprehensible independent of the satellite, but not vice versa. Moreover, these discourse structures and rhetorical relations may be utilized as features and thus, may be stored to the flat file.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the above-included example, the RST <b>500</b> was automatically generated based on an essay utilizing a cue-phrase-based discourse parser (not shown) of Dr. Daniel Marcu (&#x201c;The theory and practice of discourse parsing and summarization&#x201d; The MIT press, 2000) and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. However, in response to a different essay, the cue-phrase-based discourse parser, may generate a different RST. Accordingly, the above described RST <b>500</b> is provided by way of an example only. Therefore, the invention is not limited to the cue-phrase-based discourse parser or the RST <b>500</b>, but rather, various embodiments of the invention may include any reasonable method of identifying and categorizing sentences, and thus, are within the scope of the invention.</p>

As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the model builder <b>600</b> includes a user interface <b>602</b>, a feature extractor <b>604</b>, and a machine learning tool <b>618</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The user interface <b>602</b> is configured to accept training data and/or annotations of the training data. The annotations may include marks (e.g., indicators, etc.) identifying the discourse elements of the training data. The annotations may further include marks identifying various other discourse categories, such as &#x201c;irrelevant&#x201d;, &#x201c;incomprehensible&#x201d;, and the like. &#x201c;Irrelevant&#x201d; may be used to identify a text segment that does not contribute in a meaningful way. &#x201c;Incomprehensible&#x201d; may be used to identify a text segment that is not understood by the annotator (e.g., incorrect syntax, incorrect word usage, etc.). While the annotations may be generated in a variety of manners, in an embodiment of the invention, the user interface <b>602</b> is configured to accept manual annotations of the training data from a trained judge (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>). The training data may include essays and the like. Additionally, the user interface <b>602</b> is configured to forward the training data and/or the manual annotations to the feature extractor <b>604</b> and receive the model <b>320</b> from the machine learning tool <b>618</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The feature extractor <b>604</b> of the model builder <b>600</b> is similar to the feature extractor <b>302</b> described hereinabove and thus only those features which are reasonably necessary for a complete understanding of the feature extractor <b>604</b> are described hereinbelow. One difference between the feature extractor <b>604</b> and the feature extractor <b>302</b> is that the feature extractor <b>604</b> is configured to receive, process, and/or forward data associated with the manual annotations. In this regard, following extraction of features, generation of a flat file, and generation of an RST, the feature extractor <b>604</b> is configured to forward data associated with the manual annotations and/or the flat file to the machine learning tool <b>618</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The machine learning tool <b>618</b> is configured to receive the manual annotation data and/or the flat file from the feature extractor <b>604</b> and generate the model <b>320</b> based on this data. In general, the machine learning tool <b>618</b> is configured to determine patterns associated with each annotation. For example, the conclusion statement may be strongly correlated with positional data (e.g., a conclusion statement is typically at, or near, the end of an essay). In an embodiment of the invention, a machine learning tool (e.g., a data mining tool, etc.), C5.0&#x2122; (Available from RULEQUEST RESEARCH PTY.

However, in other embodiments of the invention, various other machine learning tools, and the like, may be utilized to generate the model <b>320</b> and are thus within the scope of the invention. In this regard, in another embodiment of the invention, a plurality of models may be generated and incorporated into the model <b>320</b>. For example, a model based on positional data, a model based on lexical features, a model based on key features, and another model based punctuations may be generated. These substantially independent models may be incorporated into the model <b>320</b>. In this manner, a voting algorithm may receive categorized sentences from each model and determine a consensus for each categorized sentence.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At step <b>806</b>, it is determined if the performance of the judge is acceptable. For example, annotated essays performed by a first judge may be compared to annotated essays of the same data by the experts and/or a second judge. A level of agreement between the annotated essays may be determined by calculating values for one or more of: Kappa, precision, recall and F-measure. In this regard, Kappa is a generally known equation for determining a statistical probability of agreement, excluding the probability of chance. Precision is a measure of agreement between the first judge and the second judge, divided by the number of annotations performed by the first judge. Recall is a measure of agreement between the first judge and the second judge, divided by the number of annotations performed by the second judge. F-measure is equal to two times precision times recall, divided by the sum of precision plus recall.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If the performance of the judge is determined to be unacceptable, the judge may receive more training at step <b>802</b>. If the performance of the judge is determined to be acceptable, the judge may generate annotated essays at step <b>808</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">At step <b>808</b>, annotated essays may be generated by the judge. For example, the judge may receive essays from the database <b>160</b> and annotate the essays. These annotated essays may be forwarded to the ADAA <b>180</b> and/or the annotated essays may be stored to the database <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Additionally, while in an embodiment of the invention it may be practical for the expert to train one or more judges. For example, if a relatively large number of essays are to be annotated and doing so would be unduly burdensome to a relatively small number of experts, it may be advantageous to train a plurality of judges. In another embodiment of the invention, it may be more practical for the expert to act in the capacity of the judge or vise versa. For example, if there are a relatively low number of essays and the expert is capable of annotating them in an expedient manner or a plurality of relatively skilled judges, requiring little or no training, may be located. Therefore, while judges and experts are discussed herein, it is within the scope of the invention utilize one or the other and thus, steps <b>802</b>-<b>806</b> may be optional.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Furthermore, although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the annotated essays may be generated in a variety of manners and thus, any reasonable method of generating annotated essays is within the scope of the invention. In an embodiment of the invention, the annotated essays may be in the form of a plurality of essays discussing one or more topics. The plurality of essays having been annotated by trained judges. In general, the annotations may be utilized to identify discourse-relevant features (e.g., discourse elements, cues, etc.).</p>

For example, they may exist as software program(s) comprised of program instructions in source code, object code, executable code or other formats. Any of the above may be embodied on a computer readable medium, which include storage devices and signals, in compressed or uncompressed form. Examples of computer readable storage devices include conventional computer system RAM (random access memory), ROM (read only memory), EPROM (erasable, programmable ROM), EEPROM (electrically erasable, programmable ROM), flash memory, and magnetic or optical disks or tapes. Examples of computer readable signals, whether modulated using a carrier or not, are signals that a computer system hosting or running the computer program may be configured to access, including signals downloaded through the Internet or other networks. Concrete examples of the foregoing include distribution of the program(s) on a CD ROM or via Internet download. In a sense, the Internet itself, as an abstract entity, is a computer readable medium.
