<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An optical transmitter is provided for transmitting a wavelength multiplexed signal comprising an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal through a transmission line. The optical transmitter includes a bit time difference given signal generator for generating at least two optical signals having a bit time difference therebetween, from the wavelength multiplexed signal. The optical transmitter further includes a wavelength multiplexed signal output unit to which at least two optical signals are input from the bit time difference given signal generator, and which generates and outputs a wavelength multiplexed signal in which the bit time difference was given between the phase modulation optical signal and the phase modulation optical signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1) Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to optical transmitters and optical transmission methods suitable for use in optical WDM (Wavelength-Division Multiplexing) communication systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2) Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">WDM transmission techniques, which employ 2.5-Gbps (Gbit/s) or 10-Gbps intensity modulation (on-off keying) optical signals of tens of wavelengths, have now been put to practical use in land transmission systems and submarine transmission systems, such as access network systems, metro network systems, long-distance network systems, etc. For 40-Gbps WDM systems that will be put to practical use in a short time, element techniques and development of devices have accelerated in recent years, and the 40-Gbps WDM systems are required to have the same transmission distance and frequency utilization factor as the 10-Gbps transmission systems.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As a means of realizing 40-Gbps WDM transmission systems, deep study has been devoted to modulation methods such as optical duobinary, CS-RZ (Carrier Suppressed-Return to Zero), DPSK (Differential Phase-Shift Keying), DQPSK (Differential Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying), and the like. These modulation methods are promising modulation techniques as a means of realizing 40-Gbps WDM transmission systems, because they are better in part or all of frequency utilization factor, OSNR (Optical Signal-to-Noise Ratio), and nonlinearity endurance than NRZ (Non-Return-to-Zero) used in transmission systems of 10 Gbps or less.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Among these modulation methods, DQPSK is a method in which one wavelength channel is modulated into four different phase angles to simultaneously transmit two bits per code. In this method, the pulse repeated frequency, that is, code transmission speed is reduced to half (e.g., 20 GHz) with respect to a data transmission rate (e.g., 40 Gbps). Compared with the conventional on-off keying, the signal spectral width becomes about half, so DQPSK is superior in frequency utilization factor, chromatic dispersion tolerance, and optical device transmission characteristics. Because of this, in the field of optical transmission systems, the use of phase modulation methods, such as DPSK, DQPSK, etc., is being actively investigated.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The WDM transmission systems, which have widely been put to practical use in various systems and employ 2.5-Gbps or 10-Gbps intensity modulation (on-off keying) optical signals, can be strengthened by increasing the number of wavelengths to be multiplexed. For example, some of C-band optical amplifiers have an optical signal band of about 32 nm, so if wavelength spacing is 100 GHz (about 0.8 nm), a maximum number of 40 channels can be transmitted. The WDM transmission systems themselves have the capacity of transmitting 40 channels. But, depending on the operating state of a network, users gradually increase the number of wavelengths that are used.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, as set forth above, if the number of wavelengths multiplexed is increased to strengthen systems, the wavelength spacing becomes narrower, the walk-off quantity between wavelengths becomes smaller, and the influence of cross-phase modulation (which is nonlinear effects between wavelengths) becomes greater. In cross-phase modulation, the refractive index of an optical fiber changes in proportion to variations in the intensity of one optical channel, and this change in the refractive index modulates the phase of other optical channels.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A to 42C</figref> conceptually show the phenomenon of cross-phase modulation between optical pulses. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42A</figref>, &#x3bb;<b>1</b> and &#x3bb;<b>2</b> represent two optical pluses of different wavelengths, and from chromatic dispersion characteristics of an optical fiber, suppose that the speed of a first optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>1</b> is faster than that of a second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b>. When the two optical pulses propagate through an optical fiber, the first optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>1</b> travels faster than the second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42B</figref>, the rising part of the first optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>1</b> begins to overlap with the falling part of the second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">At that stage, the falling part of the second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b> is shifted in phase by red chirp caused by the rising part of the first optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>1</b>. If the two optical pulses of &#x3bb;<b>1</b> and &#x3bb;<b>2</b> further travel, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 42C</figref>, the first optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>1</b> will pass the second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b> and the falling part of the first optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>1</b> will overlap with the rising part of the second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b>. At this stage, the rising part of the second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b> is shifted in phase by blue chirp caused by the falling part of the first optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43A</figref>, <b>43</b>B, <b>43</b>C, and <b>43</b>D are diagrams used to explain how chirp remains behind because of cross-phase modulation that arises during each relay span. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref>, in the case where transmission fibers <b>210</b> with a positive dispersion value are connected in multiple stages through a plurality of lumped-parameter optical amplifiers <b>220</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43B</figref>, an optical signal being transmitted through the transmission fiber <b>210</b> between two lumped-parameter optical amplifiers <b>220</b> has a relatively large optical power immediately after the lumped-parameter optical amplifier <b>220</b>, but the optical power attenuates with propagation (first relay span). Then, if the optical signal is input to the next lumped-parameter optical amplifier <b>220</b>, it is amplified to a relatively large optical power again and transmitted through the downstream transmission fiber <b>210</b>. However, the optical power attenuates again with propagation (second relay span).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Now, suppose that the relay span between two lumped-parameter optical amplifiers <b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43A</figref> is 100 km, the chromatic dispersion near the wavelength of an optical signal is 2.5 ps/km/nm, the signal wavelength spacing is 0.8 nm, and the data transmission rate is 20 Gbit/s. The delay of an optical signal of an adjacent wavelength caused by chromatic dispersion can be expressed by the following Equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Delay(ps)=<i>D</i>(ps/km/nm)&#xd7;<i>L</i>(km)&#xd7;&#x394;&#x3bb;(nm)&#x2003;&#x2003;(1)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where
</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">D=chromatic dispersion,</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">L=transmission distance,</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">&#x394;&#x3bb;=wavelength spacing.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">If a wavelength multiplexed optical signal is transmitted 25 km, the time delay between adjacent wavelengths is 2.5 (ps/km/nm)&#xd7;25 (km)&#xd7;0.8 (nm)=50 (ps) from Equation (1). This means that an adjacent optical pulse delays 1 bit because the bit interval of a 20-Gbit/s signal is 50 ps.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">That is, at the spot (coordinates 0 km) immediately after a lumped-parameter optical amplifier <b>220</b>, in the case where optical pulses of adjacent wavelengths &#x3bb;<b>11</b> and &#x3bb;<b>2</b> are about to, what is called, collide with each other (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 42A to 42C</figref>), red chirp and blue chirp arise once during a transmission of 25 km. Therefore, in the case of a relay span of 100 km, the time delay is 2.5 (ps/km/nm)&#xd7;100(km)&#xd7;0.8(nm)=200 (ps). That is, the time delay between optical pulses of adjacent wavelengths is four bits, so blue chirp arises 4 times and red chirp arises 4 times. For instance, if the second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b> passes through a transmission fiber <b>210</b> with a length of 100 km, it will arrive after a delay of four bits from the first optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Now, assuming the signal bit patterns of two different adjacent wavelength signals &#x3bb;<b>1</b> and &#x3bb;<b>2</b> are all &#x201c;1&#x201d;s, consider the cross-phase modulation between the two wavelengths &#x3bb;<b>1</b> and &#x3bb;<b>2</b>. After a wavelength multiplexed signal has been amplified to a desired level by the lumped-parameter optical amplifier <b>220</b>, it is transmitted through the transmission fiber <b>210</b> of the next stage. During the span of this transmission fiber <b>210</b>, the above-described cross-phase modulation arises between the two different wavelengths &#x3bb;<b>1</b> and &#x3bb;<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">When there is no optical power attenuation over the span of the transmission fiber <b>210</b> through which the two different wavelengths &#x3bb;<b>1</b> and &#x3bb;<b>2</b> are transmitted, the quantities of red chirp and blue chirp that the second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b> undergoes by the first optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>1</b> become equal to each other. Therefore, they cancel each other when the first optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>1</b> passes the second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b>. As a result, there is no possibility that the second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b> will be shifted in phase by cross-phase modulation.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">However, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43B</figref>, the optical power of an optical signal is attenuated as it is propagated through the transmission fiber <b>210</b>. Therefore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 34C</figref>, the quantity of red chirp, which arises as first optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>1</b> overlaps with the second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b>, is slightly larger than that of blue chirp that arises as the first optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>1</b> passes the second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b> from the overlapping state. Because of this, the two chirp quantities will not cancel each other, and the red chirp that has arisen at the location of the higher optical power will remain behind slightly.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Thus, during the span of the transmission fiber <b>210</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 43D</figref>, red chirp always remains behind because of cross-phase modulation, and in total, it remains behind by &#x394;C. In this case, the second optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b> is shifted in phase by the residual red chirp, and the group speed of a wavelength multiplexed signal passing through an optical fiber changes.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In a relay transmitter including the lumped-parameter optical amplifier <b>220</b>, dispersion compensation is normally performed to suppress waveform degradation. In the case where the propagation time delay difference between adjacent wavelengths &#x3bb;<b>1</b> and &#x3bb;<b>2</b> is compensated at each relay stage with the dispersion compensating function, and the bit patterns of adjacent wavelength signals input to the lumped-parameter amplifier <b>220</b> of each stage become practically the same, the residual red chirp in each relay stage accumulates. Because of this, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 43C and 43D</figref>, the residual chirp &#x394;C during each relay span is multiplied by the number of relay stages, resulting in severe waveform degradation.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Therefore, the optical pulse of &#x3bb;<b>2</b> is shifted in phase by the residual red chirp, the group speed passing through an optical fiber changes, and this influence remains behind at the end of each relay span. In the case of intensity modulation optical signals, the residual chirp causes jitter (deviation from the center position of a received pulse) at the signal receiving end, and in the case of phase modulation optical signals, the residual chirp becomes the direct noise component of a symbol code and degrades transmission performance.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Thus, because intensity distortion between adjacent wavelengths causes phase fluctuations and degrades transmission properties, cross-phase modulation has become an important consideration in wavelength multiplexing long-distance transmission systems in which a collision of optical pulses is repeated between adjacent wavelengths.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Note that the related art of the present invention is shown in non-patent document 1 (G. Charlet, et. al., &#x201c;Nonlinear Interactions Between 10 Gb/s NRZ Channels and 40 Gb/s Channels with RZ-DQPSK or PSBT Format, over Low-Dispersion Fiber&#x201d;, Mo3.2.6, ECOC 2006).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Multiplexing and transmitting channels of phase modulation optical signals (modulated in phase modulation methods described above) and channels of intensity modulation optical signals are being examined. That is, multiplexing intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals can increase the frequency utilization factor, and employ the existing equipment for WDM transmission of intensity modulation optical signals to upgrade transmission systems in steps and efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">However, in upgrading transmission systems, when it is necessary to multiplex and transmit intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals, nonlinear effects (cross-phase modulation) due to variations in the intensity of an intensity modulation optical signal greatly affect the reception quality of phase modulation optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">That is, in systems for WDM transmission of intensity modulation optical signals, for example, nonzero dispersion-shifted fibers (NZDSFs) with a relatively small chromatic dispersion value per unit of length are sometime employed as transmission fibers to balance self-phase modulation and cross-phase modulation so that optimum reception signal quality is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">However, in transmission systems with transmission fibers whose chromatic dispersion is small per unit of length, if the function of multiplexing phase modulation optical signals such as DQPSK signals is added, in nonzero dispersion-shifted fibers it cannot prove definitely that the code walk-off (or relative propagation speed difference in a transmission fiber) between wavelength channels is great enough to avoid the influence of cross-phase modulation that phase modulation optical signals undergo.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In other words, when employing nonzero dispersion-shifted fibers (NZDSFs), if phase modulation optical signals are arranged according to the conventional channel arrangement that could be used for wavelength-multiplexing intensity modulation optical signals, and are multiplexed along with phase modulation optical signals of other channels, the degradation of the reception signal quality of phase modulation optical signals due to cross-phase modulation becomes greater compared with the case of WDM transmission of only phase modulation optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The aforementioned non-patent document 1 has attained the following results. That is, in the case where 10-Gbps intensity modulation optical signals and 43-Gbps phase modulation optical signals are multiplexed and transmitted through a nonzero dispersion-shifted fiber, if the 10-Gbps intensity modulation optical signals are arranged at wavelengths adjacent to the 43-Gbps phase modulation optical signal, the reception signal quality is degraded compared with the case where 43-Gbps phase modulation optical signals are arranged at all wavelength channels. The non-patent document 1 has also attained the following results. That is, even when the state of polarization is optimum (orthogonal), a Q value representing reception signal quality degrades compared with WDM transmission of only 40-Gbps phase modulation optical signals, and in a parallel polarization state, the Q value degrades about 3 dB.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">That is, in upgrading transmission systems, in the case of multiplexing and transmitting intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals, it is necessary to take more effective countermeasures to suppress cross-phase modulation, compared with the case of the conventional WDM transmission of only 10-Gbps intensity modulation optical signals or WDM transmission for phase modulation optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The non-patent document 1 does not teach or suggest a means of suppressing the influence of cross-phase modulation that phase modulation optical signals undergo when multiplexing and transmitting intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals.</p>

Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to suppress transmission quality degradation in network systems where intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals are multiplexed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Note that another object of the present invention includes having advantages that are derived from preferred embodiments presented herein and not obtained by prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Therefore, the present invention is characterized by optical transmitters, an optical transmission method, and a wavelength-selective variable delayer described below.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">(1) That is, in accordance with the present invention, there is provided an optical transmitter for transmitting a wavelength multiplexed signal comprising an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal through a transmission line. The optical transmitter includes two major components: a bit time difference given signal generator for generating at least two optical signals having a bit time difference therebetween, from the wavelength multiplexed signal; and a wavelength multiplexed signal output unit to which the at least two optical signals are input from the bit time difference given signal generator, and which generates and outputs a wavelength multiplexed signal in which the bit time difference was given between the phase modulation optical signal and the intensity modulation optical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">(2) In the optical transmitter of the above (1), the bit time difference given signal generator may be constructed such that as the two optical signals, it generates optical signals given a time delay difference by delaying one of two timings at which the two optical signals are input to the wavelength multiplexed signal output unit, with respect to the other of the two timings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Preferred embodiments of the present invention will hereinafter be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Note that the present invention is not to be limited to the following embodiments. The foregoing and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from preferred embodiments presented below.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">[A] First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there is shown a network system to which an optical transmitter according to a first embodiment of the present invention is applied. The network system <b>100</b> shown in the figure is constituted by a data transmission network <b>110</b>, a control network <b>120</b> which controls the data transmission network <b>110</b>, and a management plane <b>130</b> which manages the control network <b>120</b>. The data transmission network <b>110</b> includes a plurality of optical transmitters <b>111</b>, which are interconnected. The control network <b>120</b> includes a plurality of control nodes <b>121</b>, which are connected with one another and disposed so as to correspond to the optical transmitters <b>111</b> forming the data transmission network <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">With the above configuration, the control nodes <b>121</b> forming the control network <b>120</b> extract information from the optical transmitters (relay transmitters) <b>111</b> of the data transmission network <b>110</b> (which are target objects in the data transmission network <b>110</b>), thereby being able to control operation of the optical transmitters <b>111</b> (see each dashed line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The management plane <b>130</b> uses management protocols such as SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) to collect the information extracted by each control node <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram used to explain the configuration of the optical transmitter <b>111</b> along with the configuration example of the data transmission network <b>110</b>. In the data transmission network <b>110</b> shown in the figure, optical transmitters <b>111</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>111</b>-<b>5</b> are connected in ring form through a transmission fiber <b>140</b> with a small dispersion value (e.g., NZDSF (Nonzero Dispersion-Shifted Fiber)), and optical transmitters <b>111</b>-<b>4</b> to <b>111</b>-<b>8</b> also are connected in ring form through a transmission fiber <b>140</b> with a small dispersion value (e.g., NZDSF (Nonzero Dispersion-Shifted Fiber)). In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, when the optical transmitters <b>111</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>111</b>-<b>8</b> are not discriminated from one another, they are referred to collectively as optical transmitter <b>111</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In addition to having the function of selecting a route for each wavelength of a wavelength multiplexed input signal, each of the optical transmitters <b>111</b>-<b>1</b> to <b>111</b>-<b>8</b> constituting the data transmission network <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is constructed such that it is able to perform signal processing which can suppress waveform degradation. That is, when a wavelength multiplexed input signal of intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals is input, each optical transmitter <b>111</b> is able to suppress the waveform degradation at the signal receiving end that is caused by the cross-phase modulation that the phase modulation optical signal undergoes from the intensity modulation optical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">More specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the optical transmitter <b>111</b> includes an optical cross connect (OXC) <b>4</b>, and a delay block <b>1</b> placed before or after the optical cross connect <b>4</b> to give a time delay difference between a phase modulation optical signal (described as a phase modulation signal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and an intensity modulation optical signal (described as an intensity modulation signal in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) which form a wavelength multiplexed input, and further includes an information collector <b>2</b> and a controller <b>3</b>. Moreover, the optical transmitter <b>111</b> may include a dispersion compensating unit, which is placed before the delay block <b>1</b> to compensate for the chromatic dispersion of a transmission fiber, and a lumped-parameter amplifier, which is placed at its output end from which an optical output signal is sent out to a downstream transmission fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The delay block <b>1</b> includes a splitting unit <b>11</b> which splits a wavelength multiplexed input signal into an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal, a delay unit <b>12</b> which gives a time delay difference between the intensity modulation optical signal and the phase modulation optical signal split in the splitting unit <b>11</b>, and a combining unit <b>13</b> which combines the intensity modulation optical signal and phase modulation optical signal given the time delay difference in the delay unit <b>12</b>. The delay unit <b>12</b> is required to give a time delay difference between an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal, so in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a time delay is given to the phase modulation optical signal, but it may be given to the intensity modulation optical signal. Both may also be given different time delays. In the above description and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, while a wavelength multiplexed input signal is split into an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal by the splitting unit <b>11</b>, the installation of the function of selecting the intensity modulation optical signal and phase modulation optical signal is not limited to the splitting unit <b>11</b>. For example, the splitting unit <b>11</b> may simply split an input signal into two outputs without selecting wavelengths, and the combining unit <b>13</b> may have a wavelength-selective switch so that intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals from two ports can be selectively combined. Further, the delay unit <b>12</b> has the function of blocking wavelengths selectively.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> are diagrams used to explain specific configuration examples of the delay block <b>1</b>. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the delay block <b>1</b> is constituted by an optical circulator <b>14</b>, a wavelength-selective switch (WSS) <b>15</b>, a delayer <b>16</b>, and a reflector <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">For a multiplexed signal that was input to the wavelength-selective switch <b>15</b> through the optical circulator <b>14</b>, the light of the wavelength of the intensity modulation optical signal is reflected at the reflector <b>15</b><i>a </i>within the wavelength-selective switch <b>15</b> and output to the port having no delayer <b>16</b>, and is then reflected at the reflector <b>17</b> and returns back to the input port of the wavelength-selective switch <b>15</b>. In contrast, the light of the wavelength of the phase modulation optical signal is output to the port having the delayer <b>16</b>, and is then reflected at the reflector <b>17</b> and returns back to the input port of the wavelength-selective switch <b>15</b>. Therefore, a time delay difference can be given between the intensity modulation optical signal and the phase modulation optical signal. Note that the wavelength-selective switch <b>15</b> functions as the splitting unit <b>11</b> and combining unit <b>13</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, while the delayer <b>16</b> functions as the delay unit <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">In addition, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the delay block <b>1</b> can be constituted by the same optical circulator <b>14</b>, delayer <b>16</b>, and reflector <b>17</b> as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and a wavelength-selective switch <b>15</b>&#x2032; which performs a route selecting operation differing from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">For a multiplexed signal that was input to the wavelength-selective switch <b>15</b>&#x2032; through the optical circulator <b>14</b>, the light of the wavelength of the intensity modulation optical signal is reflected at the reflector <b>15</b><i>a </i>within the wavelength-selective switch <b>15</b>&#x2032;, and then returns back to the input port of the wavelength-selective switch <b>15</b> without being reflected at an external reflector. In contrast, the light of the wavelength of the phase modulation optical signal is output to the port having the delayer <b>16</b>, and is then reflected at the reflector and returns back to the input port of the wavelength-selective switch <b>15</b>&#x2032;. Even the delay unit <b>1</b> thus constructed can give a time delay difference between the intensity modulation optical signal and the phase modulation optical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Thus, the wavelength-selective switch <b>15</b> or <b>15</b>&#x2032;, which forms the above-described splitting unit <b>11</b>, and the delayer <b>16</b>, which functions as the delay unit <b>12</b>, constitute a time difference given signal generator, which generates at least two optical signals given a bit time difference, from a wavelength multiplexed input signal. The splitting unit <b>11</b> functions as a unit that splits a wavelength multiplexed input signal into an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal, while the delay unit <b>12</b> constitutes a bit time difference giving unit that gives a bit time difference between the optical signals split in the splitting unit <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">As described later, by giving a time delay difference between an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal with the delay block <b>1</b> as described above, the waveform degradation at the receiving end due to the influence of cross-phase modulation on the phase modulation optical signal from the intensity modulation optical signal can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the wavelength-selective switches <b>15</b> and <b>15</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, the input port to which an optical signal is input from the optical circulator <b>14</b> is provided with a splitting and combining unit <b>15</b><i>b </i>so that the wavelength multiplexed signal from the optical circulator is split into wavelengths and they fall on the corresponding reflectors <b>15</b><i>a</i>, and so that optical signals from the reflectors <b>15</b><i>a </i>enter the input ports connected to the optical circulator <b>14</b> and are combined together. Each of the reflectors <b>15</b><i>a </i>is constructed such that under control of the controller <b>3</b>, its reflecting surface is free to rotate, and can switch the optical coupling relationships between the input port (which is provided with the splitting and combining unit <b>15</b><i>b</i>) and other ports, as required.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Thus, the wavelength-selective switch <b>15</b> or <b>15</b>&#x2032; forming the combining unit <b>13</b> constitutes a wavelength multiplexed signal output unit to which at least two optical signals are input from the time difference given signal generator, and which generates and outputs a wavelength multiplexed signal in which a bit time difference is given between the phase modulation and intensity modulation optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The information collector <b>2</b> is adapted to collect management information on the network system <b>100</b> through control signals transmitted to and from the control node <b>121</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The controller <b>3</b> is adapted to control operation of the optical transmitter <b>111</b> based on management information collected in the information collector <b>2</b>. More specifically, based on management information collected in the information collector <b>2</b>, the controller <b>3</b> judges whether a phase modulation optical signal is vulnerable to cross-phase modulation in the transmission fiber <b>140</b>. When the phase modulation optical signal is judged to be vulnerable to cross-phase modulation, the controller <b>3</b> controls the wavelength-selective switch (<b>15</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> or <b>15</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to give a delay difference between the phase modulation signal and the intensity modulation optical signal, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Several kinds of management information in the network system <b>100</b> that are collected in the information collector <b>2</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. As shown in the figure, the information collector <b>2</b> is adapted to collect information on the kind of transmission fiber <b>140</b> (kind #<b>1</b>), the dispersion quantity of a dispersion compensating module (kind #<b>2</b>), the span loss in the transmission fiber <b>140</b> (kind #<b>3</b>), the distance of the transmission fiber <b>140</b> (kind #<b>4</b>), the method of modulation of an optical signal in each channel (kind #<b>5</b>), the bit rate or code rate of each signal (kind #<b>6</b>), and the operative state of the wavelength of an optical signal (kind #<b>7</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The kinds #<b>1</b>, #<b>2</b>, and #<b>4</b> to #<b>7</b> of management information can be extracted from the setting control information transmitted to and from the control network <b>120</b>. The kind #<b>3</b> of management information (span loss) can be derived by monitoring the input power (A) of an optical signal to an optical transmitter <b>111</b>, then acquiring the output power (B) of that optical signal contained in an OSC (Optical Supervisory Channel) light when that optical signal is transmitted from the upstream optical transmitter <b>111</b>, and in the case where there is provided a Raman amplifier (not shown), acquiring the Raman gain (C) in the transmission fiber between the two optical transmitters, and further making calculations (span loss=B&#x2212;A&#x2212;C).</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">For instance, in the optical transmitter <b>111</b>-<b>3</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the input power (A) of an optical signal from the upstream optical transmitter <b>111</b>-<b>2</b> is monitored, then the output power (B) of that optical signal at the upstream optical transmitter <b>111</b>-<b>2</b> is acquired through the OSC light, and the Raman gain (C) in the transmission fiber <b>140</b> between the optical transmitters <b>111</b>-<b>2</b> and <b>111</b>-<b>3</b> is acquired. From those three pieces of information, the span loss (=B&#x2212;A&#x2212;C) is derived.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The kinds #<b>5</b> to #<b>7</b> of management information can also be extracted from the information of an optical spectrum monitor that monitors the optical spectrum of the wavelength bandwidth of an optical signal. The information on the kind of fiber which is the kind #<b>1</b> of information can also be estimated from the kinds #<b>2</b> to #<b>4</b> of information that have been obtained. That is, even when the kind of transmission fiber is not known, the transmission fiber used can be estimated from the dispersion quantity of the dispersion compensating module, the span loss in the transmission fiber, and the distance of the transmission fiber.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In the controller <b>3</b>, for example, based on the kind #<b>1</b> of management information, when the transmission fiber <b>140</b> is a fiber with a relatively large dispersion value such as SMF (Single Mode Fiber), the walk-off between intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals is great and therefore the influence of cross-phase modulation on phase modulation optical signals in the transmission fiber <b>140</b> can be judged to be relatively slight (phase modulation optical signals are invulnerable to cross-phase modulation). On the other hand, when the transmission fiber <b>140</b> is a fiber with a relatively small dispersion value such as NZDSF (Nonzero Dispersion-Shifted Fiber), the influence of cross-phase modulation on phase modulation optical signals in the transmission fiber <b>140</b> can be judged to be relatively great (phase modulation optical signals are vulnerable to cross-phase modulation).</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">As described above, when the influence of cross-phase modulation is judged to be relatively great, the controller <b>3</b> controls the delay block <b>1</b> to provide a time delay difference between a phase modulation optical signal and an intensity modulation optical signal. In this case, by controlling optical routes in the wavelength-selective switch <b>15</b> or <b>15</b>&#x2032; that serves as the combining unit <b>13</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>), a phase modulation optical signal is output from the combining unit <b>13</b> without traveling through the delay unit <b>12</b>, while an intensity modulation optical signal is output from the combining unit <b>13</b> via the delay unit <b>12</b>. In other words, the controller <b>3</b> controls the splitting of a multiplexed signal in the wavelength switch <b>15</b> or <b>15</b>&#x2032; which functions as the splitting unit <b>11</b>, based on management information collected in the information collector <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">If the delay unit <b>12</b> is constructed to vary a time delay, the controller <b>3</b> can variably control the quantity of a bit time difference which is given in the delay unit <b>12</b> functioning as the time difference given signal generator, based on management information collected in the information collector <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In the optical transmitter <b>111</b> constructed as described above, if the controller <b>3</b> recognizes, based on management information collected in the information collector <b>2</b>, that the phase modulation optical signal is vulnerable to cross-phase modulation in the transmission fiber <b>140</b> (for example, the chromatic dispersion value of the transmission fiber <b>140</b> is small), the delay block <b>1</b> is controlled to change the routes of the intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals within the relay transmitter <b>111</b> to give a time delay difference between the two optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">By giving such a time delay difference in the optical transmitter <b>111</b> of each relay stage, the bit patterns of two signals do not overlap each other at the output of each optical transmitter <b>111</b>, so that the accumulation of phase modulation due to cross-phase modulation is reduced, and the waveform degradation of phase modulation optical signals can be suppressed. In this embodiment, while the routes of intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals are selected one by one, the routes of a plurality of signals may be selected collectively at a time. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>, while the delay unit <b>12</b> is provided in the route through which a phase modulation optical signal travels, it may be provided in the route through which an intensity modulation optical signal travels. In addition, the delay unit <b>12</b> is effective if it is provided in a relay node, disposed downstream of a transmission span including a fiber in which the influence of cross-phase modulation becomes great, which includes a chromatic dispersion compensating module first. Besides, there are cases where it is desirable that the delay quantities of the delay units <b>12</b> of the optical transmitters <b>111</b> not be uniform. The reason is as follows; that is, the relative bit patterns between the intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals in wavelength multiplexed signals which are sent out within the optical transmitters <b>111</b> of relay stages, become irregular. As a result, even when the residual quantity of dispersion compensation for each relay span is regular, residual red chirp for each relay span can be prevented from being simply added.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b> are diagrams used to explain that providing a propagation time delay difference between an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal can suppress the influence of cross-phase modulation at the signal receiving end. For example, suppose two cases by simplifying the bit pattern models of phase modulation and intensity modulation optical signals coded by RZ (return-to-zero). When the propagation speed of a phase modulation optical signal is faster in one span between two optical transmitters <b>111</b> by the time of four bits of an intensity modulation optical signal, the passing of the phase modulation optical signal at the bit waveform level of the intensity modulation optical signal can be considered as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, and <b>6</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">That is, in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, even during one span, upstream of the transmission fiber <b>140</b>, a phase modulation optical signal passes the rising part and falling part of one pulse of an intensity modulation optical signal (occurrence of red chirp and blue chirp). In the middle of one span, it passes the rising part of the intensity modulation optical signal (occurrence of red chirp). At an input place to the next relay stage, at the time of transmission the bit falling part of the intensity modulation optical signal four bits ahead coincides with the falling part of the phase modulation optical signal (occurrence of blue chirp).</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In contrast, when an intensity modulation optical signal is delayed by the time of four bits with respect to a phase modulation optical signal, the passing at the bit waveform level is performed according to a pattern of four bits that is ahead by the time of four bits, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, and differs from the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. In this case, upstream of the transmission fiber <b>140</b>, the phase modulation optical signal passes the falling part of the intensity modulation optical signal. In the middle of one span, at the time of transmission it passes the rising part and falling part of the intensity modulation optical signal two bits ahead (occurrence of red chirp and blue chirp). At an input place to the next relay stage, at the time of transmission the bit rising part of the intensity modulation optical signal four bits ahead coincides with the bit rising part of the intensity modulation optical signal (occurrence of red chirp).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Now, suppose that there is provided a dispersion compensating function (not shown) before the delay block <b>1</b> in the optical transmitter <b>111</b>, and there is provided a lumped-parameter amplifier <b>30</b> at a position before the sending-out of an output signal to the downstream transmission fiber. In this case, when in the optical transmitter <b>111</b> provided in the transmission fiber <b>140</b> there is no time delay difference between a phase modulation optical signal and an intensity modulation optical signal, and the dispersion of the transmission fiber <b>140</b> is compensated to zero by the above-described dispersion compensating function, the relative bit pattern relationship between an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal at the point where they are input to the amplifier <b>30</b> is always the same (e.g., the relationship shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is obtained). In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the residual chirp in each relay span accumulates, so a wavelength multiplexed optical signal will undergo the influence of cross-phase modulation at the signal receiving end.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In contrast, in the case where in the optical transmitter <b>111</b> provided in the transmission fiber <b>140</b> there is provided a time delay difference between a phase modulation optical signal and an intensity modulation optical signal, even if chromatic dispersion were compensated to zero by the above-described dispersion compensating function at the point where the two signals are input to the delay block <b>1</b>, the relative bit pattern relationship between the intensity modulation optical signal and phase modulation optical signal at the point where they are input to the amplifier <b>30</b> would vary in each relay stage. For instance, the relationship is obtained as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> or <b>6</b>B. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the residual chirp quantities in the relay spans are offset as a whole. Therefore, compared with the case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> can suppress the influence of cross-phase modulation at the signal receiving end, particularly the influence of cross-phase modulation on phase modulation optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Thus, since the influence of cross-phase modulation at the signal receiving end can be suppressed by the delay unit <b>12</b> and combining unit <b>13</b> which form the delay block <b>1</b>, the first embodiment of the present invention has the advantage of being able to suppress transmission quality degradation in network systems where intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals are multiplexed together. In addition, as transmission systems can be easily upgraded by phase modulation optical signals, the enhancement of system performance (a wavelength utilization factor, an OSNR (optical signal-to-noise ratio) characteristic, etc.) can be expected, and the flexibility of network management can be increased.</p>

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">[A4] Operational Effects of the First Embodiment and Three Alterations of the First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">A model used to calculate the operational effects of the first embodiment and the first through the third alterations of the first embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, and the results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a transmission fiber <b>140</b> has a chromatic dispersion of 2.4 ps/nm/km (picoseconds per nanometer per kilometer) and a relay span of 80 km. Within the optical transmitter <b>111</b> as a relay transmitter, the input signal (wavelength multiplexed signal) is wavelength-compensated by a dispersion compensating fiber <b>29</b> and amplified by an optical amplifier <b>30</b>. Then, an optical coupler <b>21</b><i>a </i>splits the input signal into an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal. After the phase modulation optical signal is delayed by a delayer <b>22</b>, a wavelength-selective switch <b>23</b> combines the delayed phase modulation optical signal with the intensity modulation optical signal. Thereafter, the output from the wavelength-selective switch <b>23</b> is amplified by an optical amplifier <b>30</b><i>b </i>and is sent out on the transmission fiber <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Using the model shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, calculation results such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> were obtained. That is, by giving a time delay between channels during each relay span, the worst Q penalty could be reduced by about 3 dB (in the case of a chromatic dispersion compensation factor 100%). The time delay between channels is interrelated with chromatic dispersion, and depending upon the quantity of a time delay given, bit patterns sometimes coincide with each other because of a shift in chromatic dispersion compensation. For that reason, in each optical transmitter <b>111</b>, it is desirable to give a delay difference that is far larger than a delay quantity caused by the residual dispersion quantity which results from the dispersion quantity of the transmission fiber <b>140</b> compensated by the dispersion compensating fiber <b>29</b>. For example, the chromatic dispersion tolerance of a 10-Gbps transmission signal is approximately &#xb1;1000 ps/nm for the entire transmission line between the transmitter <b>112</b> and the receiver <b>113</b>, so if wavelength spacing is assumed to be 0.8 nm, the optical transmitter <b>111</b> as a relay transmitter is safe if a time delay between channels is &#xb1;800 ps or greater in total.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">[B] Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, there is shown an optical transmitter <b>111</b>A according to a second embodiment of the present invention. The optical transmitter <b>111</b>A differs from the optical transmitter <b>111</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the first embodiment in that a delay block <b>1</b>A includes a chromatic dispersion giving unit (bit time difference giving unit) <b>12</b>A instead of the delay unit <b>12</b>. The remaining parts other than this are basically the same as the first embodiment. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, the same reference numerals as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> denote approximately the same parts.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">That is, in an optical coupler <b>11</b> as the splitting unit <b>11</b>, the input signal (multiplexed signal) is split into two signals. One of the two signals, as it is, is output to a wavelength-selective switch <b>13</b> serving as the combining unit <b>13</b>. The other signal is further given chromatic dispersion in the chromatic dispersion giving unit <b>12</b>A. This gives a difference in chromatic dispersion between the one optical signal, which is input to the wavelength-selective switch <b>13</b> without passing through the chromatic dispersion giving unit <b>12</b>A, and the other optical signal, which is given chromatic dispersion in the chromatic dispersion giving unit <b>12</b>A and input to the wavelength-selective switch <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Thus, the optical coupler <b>11</b> and chromatic dispersion loader <b>12</b>A constitute a bit time difference given signal generator that generates at least two optical signals having a bit time difference therebetween (through loading the signals with different chromatic dispersion quantities), from an input signal (wavelength multiplexed optical signal).</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In the wavelength-selective switch <b>13</b>, one of the optical signals split in the optical coupler <b>11</b> and the other optical signal via the chromatic dispersion loader <b>12</b>A are input, and optical signals to be output through the output port can be selected and output in wavelength units.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">At this time, when the controller <b>3</b> decides, based on management information collected in the information collector <b>2</b>, that an optical fiber to which an output signal is sent out is vulnerable to cross-phase modulation, the controller <b>3</b> is able to control the wavelength-selective switch <b>13</b> so that, for example, the phase modulation optical signal is sent out from the output port via the chromatic dispersion loader <b>12</b>A, while the intensity modulation optical signal is sent out from the output port without passing through the chromatic dispersion loader <b>12</b>A. This can give a bit time delay difference between the phase modulation optical signal and intensity modulation optical signal. As a result, the optical transmitter <b>111</b>A of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, as with the first embodiment, is capable of reducing residual red chirp caused by cross-phase modulation.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Thus, the wavelength-selective switch <b>13</b> constitutes a wavelength multiplexed signal output unit to which two optical signals are input from the optical coupler <b>11</b> and chromatic dispersion loader <b>12</b>A, and which generates and outputs a wavelength multiplexed signal in which there is a bit time difference between the optical phase modulation signal and the optical intensity modulation signal.</p>

Of course, like the wavelength-selective switches <b>15</b>, <b>15</b>&#x2032; (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>) in the case of the first embodiment, the present invention may employ one wavelength-selective switch serving both as the splitting unit and the combining unit.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">In the optical transmitter <b>111</b>A of the second embodiment constructed as described above, if the controller <b>3</b> recognizes, based on management information collected in the information collector <b>2</b>, that the transmission fiber <b>140</b> is vulnerable to cross-phase modulation (for example, the chromatic dispersion value of the transmission fiber <b>140</b> is small), the controller <b>3</b> controls the wavelength-selective switch <b>13</b> of the delay block <b>1</b>A so that within the optical transmitter <b>111</b>A, a chromatic dispersion difference is given between a phase modulation optical signal and an intensity modulation optical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Like the dispersion map (graph of transmission distance versus accumulated chromatic dispersion) shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, in the case where the dispersion compensation factor of the dispersion compensating unit in the optical transmitter <b>111</b>A serving as each relay transmitter is 100%, bit patterns overlap each other at each optical transmitter <b>111</b>A and therefore phase modulation caused by cross-phase modulation is accumulated. In contrast, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, within the optical transmitter <b>111</b>A, the phase modulation optical signal is passed through the chromatic dispersion loader <b>12</b>A so that it is loaded with chromatic dispersion, whereby the dispersion map is obtained as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. As a result, the dispersion compensation factor in each optical transmitter <b>111</b>A can be shifted from 100%. In this manner, bit patterns do not overlap each other at each optical transmitter <b>111</b>A, so that the accumulation of phase modulation due to cross-phase modulation is reduced. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, while the chromatic dispersion loader <b>12</b>A is inserted in the route of the phase modulation optical signal, it may be inserted in the route of the intensity modulation optical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">A model used to calculate effects of the second embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, and the calculation results are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.

Thereafter, the wavelength-selective switch <b>23</b> combines the two signals. As shown in the calculation results of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, by shifting the ratio of the dispersion compensation factors between the intensity modulation optical signal and the phase modulation optical signal in each optical transmitter <b>111</b>A from 100%, bit patterns that are subjected to cross-phase modulation do not overlap each other in each relay transmitter, so that the accumulation of phase modulation due to cross-phase modulation can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Thus, the second embodiment of the present invention also is able to possess the same advantages as the first embodiment by the chromatic dispersion loader <b>12</b>A and combining unit <b>13</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, there is shown an optical transmitter according to a third embodiment of the present invention. The optical transmitter shown in the figure is adapted to transmit a wavelength multiplexed signal of an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal through a transmission line. This optical transmitter includes an intensity modulation signal generator <b>41</b> which outputs at least one intensity modulation optical signal over at least one channel (in this embodiment, a plurality of channels), and a phase modulation signal generator <b>42</b> which outputs at least one phase modulation optical signal over at least one channel (in this embodiment, a plurality of channels). The optical transmitter further includes a chromatic dispersion loader <b>43</b>, combiners <b>44</b><i>a </i>to <b>44</b><i>c</i>, an information collector <b>2</b>, and a controller <b>3</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">The first input combiner <b>44</b><i>a </i>is used for combining (wavelength-multiplexing) the intensity modulation optical signals from the intensity modulation signal generator <b>41</b>, particularly different intensity modulation optical signals of different channels.

<p id="p-0176" num="0175">The chromatic dispersion loader <b>43</b> has the function of a chromatic dispersion loading unit that spreads out the rising part and falling part of the intensity modulation optical signal generated in the intensity modulation signal generator <b>41</b>.

Thus, this pre-equalization processing unit <b>45</b> constitutes a chromatic dispersion loading unit that spreads out the waveform of an intensity modulation optical signal that is generated in the intensity modulation signal generator <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">The optical transmitter of the third embodiment of the present invention loads a generated intensity modulation optical signal with dispersion to transmit a multiplexed signal in which the waveform of the intensity modulation optical signal has been spread out.

<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In the case where the optical transmitter <b>150</b> transmits a multiplexed signal without spreading out the waveform of the intensity modulation optical signal, the intensity modulation optical signal and phase modulation optical signal can be considered to have bit patterns such as those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref>. That is, in one transmission span from the optical transmitter <b>150</b> to the next relay transmitter <b>160</b>, when the propagation speed of the phase modulation optical signal is faster by four bits of the intensity modulation optical signal, the passing of the phase modulation optical signal at the bit waveform level of the intensity modulation optical signal can be considered as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28D</figref>, even during one span, upstream of the transmission fiber <b>140</b>, the phase modulation optical signal passes the rising part and falling part of one pulse of the intensity modulation optical signal (occurrence of red chirp and blue chirp). In the middle of one span, it passes the rising part of the intensity modulation optical signal (occurrence of red chirp). At an input place to the next relay stage, at the time of transmission the bit falling part of the intensity modulation optical signal four bits ahead coincides with the falling part of the phase modulation optical signal (occurrence of blue chirp).</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In other words, for the bit pattern of a multiplexed signal which is output from the optical transmitter <b>150</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 28A and 28B</figref>, it is conceivable that the bit patterns of the intensity modulation optical signal and phase modulation optical signal will coincide with each other. In this case, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28E</figref>, the residual chirp during each relay span accumulates, so that the effect of cross-phase modulation becomes greater at the signal receiving end.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In contrast, in the case where an intensity modulation optical signal is loaded with chromatic dispersion so that the waveform is spread out, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 29A and 29B</figref>, even when the bit patterns of the intensity modulation optical signal and phase modulation optical signal coincide with each other, as shown on <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29D</figref>, the red chirp and blue chirp that occur on the transmission fiber <b>140</b> can be reduced compared with the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 28D</figref>. As a result, the amount of residual chirp that accumulates during the relay span also can be reduced as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29E</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">Thus, according to the third embodiment of the present invention, the chromatic dispersion loader <b>43</b> can reduce the occurrence of chirp on a transmission line due to cross-phase modulation, so that the influence of cross-phase modulation at the signal receiving end can be suppressed. Accordingly, the third embodiment is capable of suppressing transmission quality degradation in a network system where intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals are multiplexed. In addition, because transmission systems can be easily upgraded by phase modulation optical signals, the enhancement of system performance (a wavelength utilization factor, an OSNR (optical signal-to-noise ratio) characteristic, etc.) can be expected, and the flexibility of network management can be increased.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">In the third embodiment, while the intensity modulation optical signal which is generated in the optical transmitter is loaded with chromatic dispersion so that the waveform is spread out, according to the present invention, an optical relay transmitter may also have the function of loading an intensity modulation optical signal with chromatic dispersion so that the waveform is spread out.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">The chromatic dispersion in the second embodiment and the chromatic dispersion in the third embodiment can also be combined and carried out. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref> shows an example of a chromatic dispersion map in the case where the chromatic dispersion in the second embodiment is combined the chromatic dispersion in the third embodiment. A comparative chromatic dispersion map is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. In the chromatic dispersion map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>, both an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal have a chromatic dispersion compensation factor of 100%. In contrast, in the chromatic dispersion map of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 31</figref>, an intensity modulation optical signal is loaded with chromatic dispersion in the transmitting unit, and in the chromatic dispersion loader <b>12</b>A in the optical transmitter <b>111</b>A as each relay transmitter, the chromatic dispersion compensation factor for an intensity modulation optical signal is shifted from 100%. In this manner, waveform degradation due to cross-phase modulation can be suppressed, while preserving the transmission property of an intensity modulation optical signal over long distances as much as possible.</p>

Therefore, as with the first embodiment, by wavelength-multiplexing the intensity modulation optical signal transmitted through the roundabout route and the phase modulation optical signal not transmitted through the roundabout route and transmitting the wavelength multiplexed signal, the accumulation of red chirp can be reduced compared with the case where both modulation signals are transmitted without the roundabout route.

Therefore, the wavelength multiplexed signal can be considered vulnerable to cross-phase modulation at the signal receiving end.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">Hence, in the optical transmitter <b>111</b>F of the seventh embodiment, in the case where a multiplexed signal is transmitted through the nonzero dispersion-shifted fiber <b>142</b>, the wavelength pattern of a phase modulation optical signal vulnerable to cross-phase modulation and adjacent intensity modulation optical signals is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> shows the optical transmitter <b>111</b>F having the function of changing a wavelength pattern. As shown in the figure, the optical transmitter <b>111</b>F includes a wavelength pattern converting unit <b>70</b>, which is equipped with a splitter <b>71</b>, a wavelength converter <b>72</b>, and a combiner <b>73</b>, and includes the same information collector <b>2</b> and controller <b>3</b>F as those of the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">Directing attention now to the case where the optical transmitter <b>111</b>F is employed as the optical transmitter <b>111</b>F-<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, either the single-mode fiber <b>141</b> or the nonzero dispersion-shifted fiber <b>142</b> can be selected in wavelength units as a route through which a multiplexed output signal is transmitted. The optical transmitter <b>111</b>F may have the configuration of the optical transmitter <b>111</b>D shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref> and have the wavelength pattern converting unit <b>70</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 39</figref> interposed between the wavelength-selective switch <b>63</b> and nonzero dispersion-shifted fiber <b>142</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 35</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The splitter <b>71</b> is a separating unit that separates optical signals of one wavelength band of a wavelength multiplexed signal from optical signals of another wavelength band. For example, it can be constituted by a wavelength-selective switch that selects an output route for each wavelength according to a control signal from the controller <b>3</b>F. Particularly, for optical signals of one wavelength band, they can pass through different routes in channel units, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">The wavelength converter <b>72</b> constitutes wavelength allocation changing unit that changes the wavelength allocation of intensity modulation optical signals of one wavelength band separated in the splitter <b>71</b>. For example, it is constituted by parallel-arranging pairs of a photoelectric converter and an electro-optic converter that have different conversion wavelengths according to the number of wavelengths of the optical signals of one wavelength band. This makes it possible to convert optical signals of one wavelength band separated in the splitter <b>71</b> to optical signals of different wavelengths converted according to the number of wavelengths of the conversion source.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">Note that the splitter <b>71</b> can separate an optical signal of the wavelength of a phase modulation optical signal. However, in this case, the wavelength converter is constructed to demodulate a separated phase modulation optical signal and then phase-modulate it into an optical signal of a wavelength different from the wavelength of the conversion source.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">As an alteration of the wavelength allocation in the wavelength converter <b>72</b>, as shown by reference character A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, only the channel of a phase modulation optical signal P vulnerable to cross-phase modulation is shifted to an unused channel on the long wavelength side whose dispersion value is relatively large (preferably, an adjacent unused channel), whereby the influence of cross-phase modulation can be suppressed. As another alteration, as shown by reference character B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the channels of intensity modulation optical signals I adjacent to the phase modulation optical signal P vulnerable to cross-phase modulation are shifted to unused channels (e.g., channels on the long wavelength side), whereby the channel of the phase modulation optical signal P can be provided with a practical guard band. As still another alteration, as shown by reference character C in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 38</figref>, the channels of the phase modulation optical signal P vulnerable to cross-phase modulation and intensity modulation optical signals I adjacent to the phase modulation optical signal P are shifted to channels on the long wavelength side whose dispersion value is large, whereby the influence of cross-phase modulation can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">The combiner <b>73</b> is a wavelength multiplexing and relaying unit that wavelength-multiplexes optical signals in which wavelength allocation was changed in the wavelength converter <b>72</b> and optical signals of another wavelength band from the splitter <b>71</b> in which wavelength allocation remains unchanged, and which relays the multiplexed signal. For example, it can be constituted by an optical coupler.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">In the optical transmitter <b>111</b>F constructed as described above, after the controller <b>3</b>F recognizes, based on management information collected in the information collector <b>2</b>, that a wavelength multiplexed signal is vulnerable to cross-phase modulation in a transmission fiber to which the multiplexed signal is sent out (e.g., after the controller <b>3</b>F recognizes that the transmission fiber is a fiber with a small wavelength dispersion value such as the nonzero dispersion-shifted fiber <b>142</b>), in the span during which the signal is vulnerable to cross-phase modulation, a route in the wavelength-selective switch <b>71</b> leading to the wavelength converter <b>72</b> is selected for each wavelength in order to change a wavelength pattern so that the nonlinear effect between the wavelengths of an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal is suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Thus, by increasing wavelength spacing or chromatic dispersion, the walk-off between signals can be increased, so that the accumulation of phase modulation can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">Therefore, the seventh embodiment also has the advantage of reducing the influence of cross-phase modulation at the signal receiving end and suppressing transmission quality degradation. In addition, since transmission systems can be easily upgraded by phase modulation optical signals, the enhancement of system performance (a wavelength utilization factor, an OSNR (optical signal-to-noise ratio) characteristic, etc.) can be expected, and the flexibility of network management can be increased.</p>
<heading id="h-0016" level="1">[H] Eighth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> shows an optical transmitter <b>111</b>G according to an eighth embodiment of the present invention. The optical transmitter <b>111</b>G shown in the figure also is used for relaying a wavelength multiplexed signal of an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal through a transmission line. The optical transmitter <b>111</b>G includes a wavelength pattern converting unit <b>70</b>, an information collector <b>2</b>, and a controller <b>3</b>F, which are nearly the same as those of the seventh embodiment, and further includes a first interleaving unit (wavelength group dividing unit) <b>81</b>, a delayer <b>82</b>, and a second interleaving unit (wavelength group coupling unit) <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">The wavelength pattern converting unit <b>70</b> is constructed to perform conversion of a wavelength pattern on a wavelength multiplexed input signal so that the intensity modulation optical signals and phase modulation optical signals are alternately arranged, and output the wavelength multiplexed optical signal in which the intensity modulation optical signals and phase modulation optical signals are alternately arranged. For this purpose, in the wavelength converter <b>72</b>, the wavelength conversion function for all wavelength channels is provided for each modulation method (intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals).</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The wavelength group dividing unit <b>81</b> divides the wavelength multiplexed signal in which conversion of a wavelength pattern was performed in the wavelength pattern converting unit <b>70</b>, into two wavelength groups with alternate wavelengths as one wavelength group. That is, because wavelengths different in modulation method have been alternately arranged in the wavelength pattern converting unit <b>70</b>, one wavelength group consists of optical signals of the wavelength of an intensity modulation optical signal, while the other wavelength group consists of optical signals of the wavelength of a phase modulation optical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">The delayer <b>82</b> is a bit time difference giving unit that gives a bit time difference between two wavelength groups divided in the wavelength group dividing unit <b>81</b>. The delayer <b>82</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 40</figref> is constructed to give a predetermined time delay to the timing at which either of the two wavelength groups divided in the wavelength group dividing unit <b>81</b> (i.e., either the intensity modulation signal group or the phase modulation signal group) is output to the wavelength group coupling unit <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">The wavelength group coupling unit <b>83</b> is used for coupling one wavelength group delayed in the delayer <b>82</b> and the other wavelength group not delayed in the delayer <b>82</b>, and outputting the multiplexed signal. Thus, the wavelength group coupling unit <b>83</b> functions as a wavelength group coupling unit that couples the two wavelength groups from the wavelength group dividing unit <b>81</b> and delayer <b>82</b> and outputs the coupled signal.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">In the optical transmitter <b>111</b>G of the eighth embodiment described above, the wavelength pattern converting unit <b>70</b> performs wavelength allocation so that intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals are alternately arranged at even channels and odd channels, respectively. Then, the wavelength group coupling unit <b>81</b> divides the phase modulation and intensity modulation optical signals into two wavelength groups. Then, for example, the phase modulation optical signal is given a time delay by being passed through the delayer <b>82</b>. Therefore, in the case where optical transmitters <b>111</b>G are interconnected through an optical fiber with a relatively small dispersion value, each optical transmitter <b>111</b>G can give a time delay difference between the intensity modulation optical signal and the phase modulation optical signal. As a result, since the bit patterns of the intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals do not overlap at the output side of each optical transmitter, the accumulation of phase modulation due to cross-phase modulation is reduced and the waveform degradation of phase modulation optical signals can be suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">Thus, the eighth embodiment also is able to possess the same advantages as the first embodiment.</p>
<heading id="h-0017" level="1">[I] Ninth Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 41</figref> shows an optical transmitter <b>111</b>H according to a ninth embodiment of the present invention. The optical transmitter <b>111</b>H shown in the figure also is used for relaying a wavelength multiplexed signal of intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals through a transmission line. The optical transmitter <b>111</b>H includes an information collector <b>2</b>, which is approximately the same as that of the first embodiment, and further includes an input amplifier <b>91</b> for amplifying a wavelength multiplexed input signal, a splitter <b>92</b>, variable optical attenuators (VOAs) <b>93</b>, a combiner <b>94</b>, an output amplifier <b>95</b> for amplifying a wavelength multiplexed output signal, and a controller <b>3</b>H.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">The splitter <b>92</b> is used for splitting a wavelength multiplexed signal input through the input amplifier <b>91</b> into a plurality of wavelengths (channels), and is a separating unit that separates a wavelength multiplexed signal into intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals. The variable optical attenuators <b>93</b> are disposed to correspond to the channels separated in the splitter <b>92</b> and functions to give variable attenuation quantities to optical signals of different channels. That is, the variable optical attenuator <b>93</b> is an intensity difference giving unit that gives an intensity difference between the phase modulation optical signal and the intensity modulation optical signal separated in the splitter <b>92</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">The combiner <b>94</b> is used for combining (wavelength-multiplexing) optical signals of different channels variably attenuated in the variable optical attenuators <b>93</b>, and is a wavelength multiplexing and relaying unit that wavelength-multiplexes the intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals given intensity differences in the variable optical attenuators <b>93</b> and outputs the wavelength multiplexed signal. Note that the wavelength multiplexed signal combined in the combiner <b>94</b> is sent out to a transmission fiber through the output amplifier <b>95</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">After recognizing, based on management information collected in the information collector <b>2</b>, that a wavelength multiplexed signal is vulnerable to cross-phase modulation in a transmission fiber (e.g., after recognizing a transmission fiber with a small chromatic dispersion value), the controller <b>3</b>H reduces the output power of the optical transmitter <b>111</b>H (i.e., the optical power of the intensity modulation and phase modulation optical signals) to suppress the influence of nonlinear effects.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">More specifically, the controller <b>3</b>H controls the variable optical attenuators <b>93</b> so that an attenuation quantity at the variable optical attenuator <b>93</b> corresponding to the channel of an intensity modulation optical signal differs from that at the variable optical attenuator <b>93</b> corresponding to the channel of a phase modulation optical signal (e.g., the attenuation quantity of an intensity modulation optical signal becomes larger than that of a phase modulation optical signal). This can suppress cross-phase modulation (nonlinear effect) that occurs in a transmission fiber, in practically the same manner as the first embodiment. As a result, the optical transmitter <b>111</b>H of the ninth embodiment is able to suppress the cross-phase modulation between an intensity modulation optical signal and a phase modulation optical signal, and reduce the waveform degradation of phase modulation optical signals due to cross-phase modulation.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">Besides, by adjusting the excitation light power of a relay transmitter to give a power difference between phase modulation and intensity modulation optical signals, the waveform degradation of phase modulation optical signals due to cross-phase modulation can be reduced.</p>
