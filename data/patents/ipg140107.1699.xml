<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of making a customizable gift box includes the step of providing a box blank including a box bottom and a plurality of sidewalls having adjacent lateral edges. Appendages are positioned to overlap and join the adjacent lateral edges of the adjacent sidewalls. Each appendage includes a first relatively narrow edge, a second relatively wider opposing edge, and S-shaped side edges joining the first and second edges. The configuration of the appendages facilitates their removal from a label assembly that includes a face sheet and a back sheet, the face sheet including a removable carrier portion, a removable label, and the removable appendages in the carrier sheet. Once the sidewalls of the box blank are properly anchored using the appendages, the label assembly can be aligned and the label can be adhered to the box blank.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/585,653, filed on 24 Oct. 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 8,033,040 the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention is directed to a customizable gift box that includes a box blank and a label assembly with a label having a printable surface.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Gift boxing and wrapping are necessary components of gift giving. Often, gift givers need dedicated space for wrapping paper of all varieties and boxes of various sizes and shapes to accommodate such gifts. Gift bags are one accommodation to the space requirements of traditional gift boxes and wrapping. However, like wrapping paper, gift bags are generally thematic and not all gift bags are appropriate for all gift giving situations.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As such, a need arises for a customizable gift box that a gift giver may design that is appropriate for the particular gift, event, occasion, season and/or recipient. Such customizable gift boxes eliminate the need for a gift giver to stock and/or independently purchase a tailor-made gift wrap or gift box for each particular gift, event, occasion, season and/or recipient.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is an object of the present invention to provide a customizable gift box.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The above and other objects of this invention can be attained with a box blank and label assembly including a back sheet and a face sheet removably adhered to the back sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The face sheet has a carrier portion and at least one label. An opposite back sheet is affixed to the face sheet. The face sheet preferably includes an adhesive material coating on one side facing the back sheet and a printable surface on an opposite side. The label assembly is preferably manufactured of a size and material to permit feeding into any number of standard printers, such as a consumer laser printer.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In operation, the label assembly preferably includes the face sheet having a printable surface including a label sized to cover at least a box bottom of the box blank. The label assembly is preferably customized by printing the label with a standard printer to include desired designs, writing, etc. appropriate to the situation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The back sheet preferably includes a first removable portion at least partially overlaying the label. The first removable portion is preferably separable from the label assembly and removable to expose an adhesive surface of the label within the face sheet. The back sheet preferably further includes at least one index line for aligning the box blank relative to the label assembly, specifically relative to the label.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Thus, following removal of the first removable portion thereby exposing a partial surface of the label, at least one edge of the box blank can be aligned with one or more index lines without adhering the label to the box blank. Once aligned, the box blank can be adhered to the exposed section of the label and the remainder of the label can be applied to the box blank.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">As a result of the label assembly as described, removal of one or more removable portions from the back sheet results in the label remaining in a carrier portion of the face sheet, preferably with the adhesive side facing upward. This configuration facilitates alignment and placement of the box blank without curling or unwanted adhesion that may result from peeling the label away from the back sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Other objects and advantages of this invention are apparent to those skilled in the art, in view of the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the appended claims and drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show each side of a label assembly <b>20</b> (not necessarily shown to scale) according to one embodiment of this invention. Label sheet <b>20</b> is desirably formed of a face sheet <b>30</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and an opposite back sheet <b>60</b>, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Back sheet <b>60</b> is desirably approximately the same size as face sheet <b>30</b>, but may be slightly larger or smaller than face sheet <b>30</b>. A surface of face sheet <b>30</b> that is disposed toward back sheet <b>60</b> preferably includes an adhesive material coating. The adhesive coating can include any adhesive material known and available to those skilled in the art for forming pressure sensitive, or self-adhesive labels.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Label assembly <b>20</b> is preferably of any suitable shape, and generally any suitable size that can be accepted by and fed through a printer, such as a laser printer or an ink jet printer. Common sizes of paper generally fed through printers are 8.5 inches by 5.5 inches, 8.5 inches by 11 inches, 8.263 inches by 11.688 inches (A4 size), and 8.5 inches by 14 inches. Face sheet <b>30</b> is preferably, but not necessarily, constructed of any suitable paper, paper composite, non-metal and/or metal material that can be used as a label. Other suitable materials for constructing face sheet <b>30</b> include fabric, plastic, and metal foils. The adhesive coating covered by back sheet <b>60</b> is preferably applied to face sheet <b>30</b> in any suitable manner known to those skilled in the art. Face sheet <b>30</b> desirably has a printable surface <b>52</b> on a side opposite the adhesive coating.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Face sheet <b>30</b> and printable surface <b>52</b> can be any of a variety of face materials used to make pressure sensitive, or self-adhesive labels. Such face materials may include, but are not limited to: smudge proof stock, litho stock, cast coated stock, tag stock, fluorescent stock, foils, computer printable polyester, vinyl, satin cloth, Tyvek&#x2122; material, flexible plastic, book papers, photo quality papers and/or photo quality film. Furthermore, various portions of the face materials can be different colors, thereby resulting in different colored parts.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The phrase &#x201c;printable surface&#x201d; relates to a surface of any type of matter upon which a person or machine can draw, print, color, paint, photocopy, write, emboss, or make any other type of mark or graphic. Laser printers, ink jet printers, impact printers, thermal transfer printers, direct thermal printers, typewriters, or any other suitable graphic printing devices are preferred but not necessary for use with printable surfaces according to this invention. Customization on label <b>50</b> may include one or more images, patterns, print, pictures, drawings, letters, numbers, words and/or symbols, for example, to relate the gift giver, receiver and/or contents of the gift box <b>10</b> to the customization.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As briefly described above, a layer of an adhesive is preferably positioned between back sheet <b>60</b> and face sheet <b>30</b> so that the adhesive adheres to face sheet <b>30</b> exclusively or at least adheres to face sheet <b>30</b> more than to back sheet <b>60</b> when back sheet <b>60</b> is removed from face sheet <b>30</b>, as described hereafter. As a result of this configuration, label assembly <b>20</b> preferably includes face sheet <b>30</b> having a printable side and an opposite, adhesive side and back sheet <b>60</b> including a separable side and an opposite side.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Face sheet <b>30</b> may include a plurality of shapes of labels <b>50</b>, defined in face sheet <b>30</b> as one or more individual labels <b>50</b> according to this invention. The phrase label <b>50</b>, &#x201c;shape,&#x201d; or the phrase &#x201c;removable or tearable shape,&#x201d; are intended to relate to a shape, such as the shapes identified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by element reference numeral <b>50</b>, that can be removed or torn away from a remaining carrier portion <b>40</b> of face sheet <b>30</b>, such as by using tearable lines of separation <b>43</b>. Specifically, as described below in more detail, label <b>50</b> is preferably dimensioned to cooperate with a particular box blank <b>15</b> depending on the size and shape of the gift box <b>10</b> desired.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Tearable lines of separation <b>43</b> can be formed as a line of weakness and/or cut in face sheet <b>30</b> known to those skilled in the art, such as die-cut lines, perforated lines, micro-perforated lines, or any combination of these types of separation, or any other suitable structure that enables separation. A preferred type of tearable line <b>43</b> is a line that is die-cut. Label <b>50</b> can be die-cut along at least a portion of a periphery, such that label <b>50</b> can be easily removed or separated from carrier portion <b>40</b> of face sheet <b>30</b>, for example after label assembly <b>20</b> is run through a printer and removable portions <b>65</b>, <b>80</b> and/or <b>90</b> of back sheet <b>60</b> are removed as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In operation, label assembly <b>20</b> preferably includes face sheet <b>30</b> having printable surface <b>52</b> on label <b>50</b> that is sized to cover at least box bottom <b>17</b> of box blank <b>15</b>. As described above, label assembly <b>20</b> is preferably customized by printing label <b>50</b> with a standard printer to include desired designs, writing, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, two tearable lines of separation <b>45</b> extend the length of back sheet <b>60</b> and divide back sheet <b>60</b> into a first central removable portion <b>65</b>, a second outer removable portion <b>80</b>, and a third outer removable portion <b>90</b>. The back sheet <b>60</b> preferably includes first removable portion <b>65</b> at least partially overlaying label <b>50</b> (shown in hidden lines) and carrier <b>40</b>. Part or all of carrier <b>40</b> can be peeled away from back sheet <b>60</b>, leaving label <b>50</b> (with or without portions of carrier <b>40</b>) on the facing sheet <b>30</b>. Preferably, carrier <b>40</b> is not removed until a later stage described below. First removable portion <b>65</b> is preferably separable from label assembly <b>20</b> and removable to expose an adhesive surface of label <b>50</b> within face sheet <b>30</b>. First removable portion <b>65</b> is preferably exclusive to back sheet <b>60</b> and is removable along at least the two tearable lines of separation <b>45</b> extending through the back sheet <b>60</b>, but not into face sheet <b>30</b>. Tearable lines of separation <b>45</b> on the back sheet <b>60</b> can be formed as any line of weakness and/or cut as described above for tearable lines of separation <b>43</b> on face sheet <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, back sheet <b>60</b> preferably further includes at least one index line <b>70</b> for aligning box blank <b>15</b> relative to label assembly <b>20</b>, specifically relative to label <b>50</b>. Accordingly, following removal of first removable portion <b>65</b> thereby exposing a partial surface of label <b>50</b> (and possibly a portion of carrier <b>40</b>, if not yet removed), at least one edge of box blank <b>15</b> can be aligned with one or more index lines <b>70</b> without adhering label <b>50</b> to box blank <b>15</b>. Once aligned, box blank <b>15</b> can be adhered to the exposed section of label <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to a preferred embodiment of this invention, not all of label <b>50</b> will be exposed following removal of first removable portion <b>65</b>. As a result, second and/or third removable portions <b>80</b>, <b>90</b> may also be removable from back sheet <b>60</b> to more fully expose label <b>50</b>. The second and/or third removable portions <b>80</b>, <b>90</b> preferably at least partially overlay label <b>50</b> and are removable to expose additional adhesive surface of label <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, and to facilitate proper and accurate alignment of box blank <b>15</b> relative to label <b>50</b>, first removable portion <b>65</b> preferably includes a width smaller than a width of box bottom <b>17</b>. As a result of the small width of first removable portion <b>65</b>, box blank <b>15</b> can be aligned with label <b>50</b> along index lines <b>70</b> without unintentionally adhering portions of box bottom <b>17</b> to label <b>50</b>. However, as described in more detail below, label <b>50</b> preferably includes a width wider than a width of box bottom <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Following removal of first, second and/or third removable portions <b>65</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>90</b> of label assembly <b>20</b>, label assembly <b>20</b> is preferably positioned underneath box blank <b>15</b> with a portion of label <b>50</b> adhesively fixed to box blank <b>15</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 5</figref>, additional portions of label <b>50</b> preferably extend beyond box bottom <b>17</b> of box blank <b>15</b> in the form of tabs <b>55</b> thereby permitting sidewalls <b>19</b> of box blank to be entirely covered by label <b>50</b>. In addition, one or more extended portions <b>57</b> of tabs <b>55</b> preferably extend outwardly from tabs <b>55</b> to permit adjoining of adjacent sidewalls <b>19</b> of box blank <b>15</b> to form gift box <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>, first removable portion <b>65</b> is preferably positioned along a center of label <b>50</b>. As such, upon removal of first removable portion <b>65</b> from label assembly <b>20</b>, box blank <b>15</b> is preferably indexable relative to each side of label <b>50</b> along remaining portions of back sheet <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In this manner, index lines <b>70</b> are preferably positioned outside of first removable portion <b>65</b> so that a visual index can be drawn between box blank <b>15</b> and label assembly <b>20</b>. More specifically, two laterally extending index lines <b>70</b> and two longitudinally extending index lines <b>70</b> are preferably positioned one on either side of first removable portion <b>65</b>. Index lines <b>70</b> are preferably inked or otherwise marked into back sheet <b>60</b> so as to be readily legible and apparent to a user. In addition, index lines <b>70</b> are preferably positioned along second removable portion <b>80</b> and/or third removable portion <b>90</b> of back sheet <b>60</b> and not in an exposed adhesive section of label <b>50</b>. In this manner, box blank <b>15</b> may be aligned and adjusted without adhering label <b>50</b> to box bottom <b>17</b> or sidewalls <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Index lines <b>70</b> constitute one type of indexing device. As an alternative to index lines <b>70</b>, one or more other indexing devices can be used. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an embodiment of the invention in which index lines <b>70</b> are replaced by foldable index tabs <b>75</b>, suitably four of the foldable index tabs <b>75</b>, in the back sheet <b>60</b>. A first pair of foldable index tabs <b>75</b> forms part of the second outer removable portion <b>80</b>. A second pair of foldable index tabs <b>75</b> forms part of the third outer removable portion <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, each foldable index tab <b>75</b> has a foldable edge <b>77</b> (represented by the dotted line) and three removable edges <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> and <b>79</b> represented by corresponding tearable lines of separation. The tearable lines of separation are formed in the corresponding outer removable portion (<b>80</b> or <b>90</b>) in the back sheet <b>60</b>, and may be any of the lines of weakness and/or cut lines described above with respect to tearable lines <b>43</b> and <b>45</b>. The three removable edges include an inner removable edge <b>76</b> which coincides with tearable line <b>45</b> between the second or third outer removable portion <b>80</b> or <b>90</b> and the first central removable portion <b>65</b>, an opposing outer removable edge <b>78</b> within the outer removable portion <b>80</b> or <b>90</b>, and a transverse removable edge <b>79</b> that is opposite the foldable edge <b>77</b> and between the inner and outer removable edges. The transverse removable edge <b>79</b> intersects the inner removable edge at a corner <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In order to lift the index tab <b>75</b> and use it to align the box blank <b>15</b> relative to label assembly <b>20</b>, the user can lift up the corner <b>74</b> and cause the tab <b>75</b> to separate from the remainder of the outer removable portion <b>80</b> or <b>90</b> along removable edges <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> and <b>79</b>. This will also cause the tab <b>75</b> to fold along foldable line <b>77</b> so that it protrudes outward from the remainder of second or third outer removable portion <b>80</b> or <b>90</b>. This procedure can be repeated four times, for all four tabs <b>75</b>, in order to completely align the box blanks.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, it is advantageous to position the transverse removable edge <b>79</b> on the back sheet <b>60</b> at an angle so that it falls in between the tearable lines <b>43</b> used to separate the label <b>50</b> from the carrier portion <b>40</b> on the facing sheet <b>30</b>. In other words, the index tabs <b>75</b> should be designed and positioned so that none of the removable edges <b>76</b>, <b>78</b> or <b>79</b> in back sheet <b>60</b> coincides with a tearable line of separation on the facing sheet <b>30</b>. This helps prevent spontaneous separation as the label assembly <b>20</b> passes through a printer, which can cause jamming of the printer. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, transverse removable edge <b>79</b> on back sheet <b>60</b> is positioned in between the nearest edges of tabs <b>55</b> and extended portions <b>57</b>. The upper removable edge <b>78</b> is longer than the lower removable edge <b>76</b> so that the transverse edge <b>79</b> may connect each of them at an angle that is not a right angle, and is suitably about 30 to about 80 degrees, or about 40 to about 70 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In addition, second removable portion <b>80</b> and third removable portion <b>90</b> are preferably positioned along outer edges of label <b>50</b> so that, following indexing and adherence of center portion of label <b>50</b> to box bottom <b>17</b>, the remaining portions of label <b>50</b> may be properly adhered to box blank <b>15</b> as described.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">As a result of label assembly <b>20</b> as described, removal of first, second, third and/or additional removable portions <b>65</b>, <b>80</b>, <b>90</b> from back sheet <b>60</b>, label <b>50</b> can remain in all or part of carrier portion <b>40</b> of face sheet <b>30</b>, preferably with the adhesive side facing upward. This configuration facilitates alignment and placement of box blank <b>15</b> without curling or unwanted adhesion that may result from peeling label <b>50</b> away from back sheet <b>60</b>. Following proper, aligned adhesion of label <b>50</b> to box blank <b>15</b>, label <b>50</b> is removed from remainder of carrier portion <b>40</b> on face sheet <b>30</b> along tearable lines of separation <b>45</b>, as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">One or more score lines <b>95</b> may be positioned in back sheet <b>60</b> and/or face sheet <b>30</b> and preferably extend from at least one edge of first removable portion <b>65</b>. Such score lines <b>95</b>, unlike tearable lines of separation <b>45</b>, preferably extend entirely through label assembly <b>20</b> and facilitate removal of first removable section <b>65</b> as well as separation of carrier portion <b>40</b> from label <b>50</b> during or following application of label <b>50</b> to box blank <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In a further embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the carrier portion <b>40</b> of back sheet <b>60</b> is provided with removable appendages <b>85</b>. Appendages <b>85</b> are useful for reinforcing the box blank <b>15</b> in a folded position by holding the adjacent sidewalls <b>19</b> together, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Each removable appendage <b>85</b> can be manually removed from the carrier portion <b>40</b> along tearable lines of separation <b>86</b>. Each tearable line of separation <b>86</b> can be formed as a line of weakness and/or cut in the face sheet <b>30</b>. Examples of tearable lines of separation <b>86</b> include without limitation die-cut lines, perforated lines, micro-perforated lines, and combinations of the foregoing, as well as any other suitable structure that enables separation.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, each removable appendage <b>85</b> may include a first relatively narrower, relatively flat upper edge <b>90</b> and a second relatively wider, relatively flat opposing lower edge <b>92</b>. The first and second edges are joined by S-shaped side edges <b>86</b>. Each S-shaped side edge <b>86</b> includes a first upper concave portion <b>87</b> having a positive radius of curvature and a second lower convex portion <b>89</b> having a negative radius of curvature. The lower convex portion <b>89</b> of each side edge <b>86</b> converges with lower edge <b>92</b> at a point <b>91</b>. As each side edge <b>86</b> approaches point <b>91</b>, the angle &#x3b8; between the side edge <b>86</b> and lower edge <b>92</b> is less than about 90 degrees, suitably about 15 to about 85 degrees, or about 40 to about 80 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The S-shaped side edges <b>86</b>, having the lower convex portions <b>89</b> converging with lower edge <b>92</b> at points <b>91</b>, facilitate easy removal and peeling of the appendages <b>85</b> from the back sheet <b>60</b> and carrier portion <b>40</b> without causing tearing or excessive bending of the appendages <b>85</b>, back sheet <b>60</b> or remainder of carrier portion <b>40</b>. In order to use the appendages <b>85</b>, the following steps may be followed. First, in order to remove an appendage <b>85</b> from the back sheet <b>60</b> and carrier portion <b>40</b>, the user may slightly bend the label assembly <b>20</b> at one of the points <b>91</b>. The user may then manually grasp the appendage <b>85</b> at the point <b>91</b> and lift the appendage <b>85</b> off the back sheet <b>60</b> and away from carrier portion <b>40</b>. The removed appendage <b>85</b> has a top surface and an adhesive-coated bottom surface.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The user may also fold the box blank <b>15</b> in the manner shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Specifically, the four sidewalls <b>19</b> of the box blank <b>15</b> are folded at about a 90-degree angle to the box bottom <b>17</b> so each lateral edge <b>21</b> of each sidewall <b>19</b> is positioned adjacent to a lateral edge <b>21</b> of an adjacent sidewall <b>19</b>. Then, the appendage <b>85</b> is positioned to overlap two of the adjacent sidewalls <b>19</b> and gently pressed against the adjacent sidewalls <b>19</b> so that the adhesive-coated bottom surface bonds the appendage <b>85</b> to both of the adjacent sidewalls <b>19</b>, thereby forming a joint between the adjacent lateral edges <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">This procedure is repeated four times, forming a joint at each line of intersection between adjacent sidewalls <b>19</b> of the box blank <b>15</b>. Then, as described above, at least the first removable portion <b>65</b> is removed from back sheet <b>60</b> along tear lines <b>65</b>, exposing a portion of the adhesive-coated surface of label <b>50</b>. At least one edge of box bottom <b>17</b> of box blank <b>15</b> can be aligned with one or more index lines <b>70</b>, or other index devices such as the index tabs <b>75</b> described above. Suitably, all four edges of box bottom <b>17</b> are aligned in this fashion. Once aligned, box bottom <b>17</b> of box blank <b>15</b> can be adhered to the exposed section of label <b>50</b>. Any remainder of carrier portion <b>40</b> is then removed from facing sheet <b>30</b> along tearable lines of separation <b>43</b>, as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Subsequently, second and/or third removable portions <b>80</b> and <b>90</b> can be removed from back sheet <b>60</b> to more fully expose label <b>50</b>. The second and/or third removable portions <b>80</b> and <b>90</b> suitably at least partially overlay label <b>50</b> and are removable to expose additional adhesive-coated surface of label <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Following removal of first, second and third removable portions <b>65</b>, <b>80</b> and <b>90</b> of back sheet <b>60</b>, the remainder of label assembly <b>20</b> is positioned underneath box blank <b>15</b> with a portion of the label <b>50</b> adhesively fixed to the box bottom <b>17</b> of box blank <b>15</b>. The remainder of label <b>50</b>, specifically the tabs <b>55</b> and extended portions <b>57</b>, are folded over and adhered to the sidewalls <b>19</b> of box blank <b>15</b>, so as to cover exposed surfaces of the sidewalls <b>19</b> and conceal the appendages <b>85</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, one or more additional removable appendages can also be included in carrier portion <b>40</b> of face sheet <b>30</b> for various purposes. The illustrated removable appendage <b>87</b> can be used as a shopping label which identifies the specific label assembly <b>20</b> according to a code, to facilitate reordering.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In decorating label <b>50</b> according to one preferred embodiment of this invention, label assembly <b>20</b> is routed through a suitable printer. Information downloaded from an internet website or saved on a computer database for example, is printed on at least one printable surface <b>52</b> of face sheet <b>30</b>. For example, in one preferred embodiment of this invention, a first set of information, such as an image of the gift recipient, is printed on printable surface <b>52</b> of label <b>50</b>. In one preferred embodiment of this invention, a database containing or having a plurality of downloadable images is accessible from a personal computer or work station. At least one of the downloadable images can be selected to download. After the image is downloaded, the image is printed on label <b>50</b>. As used in the specification and in the claims, the term &#x201c;information&#x201d; refers to any suitable or desirable electronic image or design, such as a digital photograph, picture, drawing, pattern, text and/or symbol.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While in the foregoing specification this invention has been described in relation to certain preferred embodiments thereof, and many details have been set forth for purpose of illustration, it will become apparent to those skilled in the art that the invention is susceptible to additional embodiments and that certain of the details described herein can be varied considerably without departing from the basic principles of the invention.
