<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A system for sterilizing bottles with a gaseous sterilant. The system includes moving means for continuously moving bottles one after another along a path. An assembly is provided for distributing a predetermined amount of the gaseous sterilant from a source of gaseous sterilant to each of the bottles. The assembly includes a plurality of injectors that are movable with the bottles. One of the plurality of injectors is associated with each of the bottles. The injector is fluidly connected to the source of gaseous sterilant when the bottle associated with the injector is disposed along a first portion of the path. The injector is disposed above the bottle when the injector is in a first position. The injector is disposed within an interior of the bottle when the injector is in a second position such that the predetermined amount of the gaseous sterilant is conveyed into the interior of the bottle.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/246,752, filed Sep. 29, 2009, which is fully incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to sterilization processes using a vaporized sterilant, and more particularly, to a system for decontaminating bottles and the like using vaporized hydrogen peroxide and a method of operating the same.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles are commonly used in the United States as containers for beverages. Prior to filling a bottle with a liquid beverage for human consumption, the bottles undergo a sterilization process.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One method of sterilizing bottles as part of a continuous bottling system is to use liquid sterilant, wherein the bottles are filled with liquid sterilant to sterilize the interior of the bottle, and then rinsed to remove any excess or residual sterilant. Filling and removing a sterilant and rinse solution from a bottle requires that the bottles be repeatedly inverted and returned to an upright position. Rotating bottles from an upright position to an upside down position and vice versa increases the complexity and cost of a continuous bottling system.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Moreover, bottles are typically rinsed with sterilized water, which requires a system for generating the sterile water. Sterile water is expensive to produce, and the sterility level of the water is always suspect.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Another method of sterilizing bottles uses condensed hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). In these systems, the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>is first vaporized and then condensed onto the cooler surface of the bottles. The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>sterilant is typically a mixture of water and hydrogen peroxide. A problem with using condensed vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) systems is that it is difficult to obtain uniform condensation coverage on complex bottle surfaces that may have temperature gradients there along. It is also difficult to determine the concentration of concentrated vaporized hydrogen peroxide that is necessary to reach the condensation point due to variations in both bottle temperature and humidity levels.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention overcomes these and other problems and provides a system for decontaminating bottles and the like as part of a continuous bottle-filling system, wherein a centralized vaporized hydrogen peroxide system provides and controls the concentration of VHP to a bottling system.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a system for decontaminating bottles and the like as part of a continuous bottle-filling system.

<p id="p-0097" num="0096">As provided in the present invention, by controlling the air temperature, air flow rate, sterilant temperature and sterilant injection rate in a decontamination system, a desired concentration of vaporized hydrogen peroxide can be maintained within a decontamination chamber. When using vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) in a decontamination system, it is necessary to prevent the vaporized hydrogen peroxide from condensing on the products or articles to be decontaminated. In a steady state, steady flow vaporized hydrogen peroxide process, the sterilant injection rate, the air flow rate and the air temperature must be controlled to prevent condensation. According to the present invention, the hydrogen peroxide vaporizer system is controlled to a desired vaporized hydrogen peroxide concentration and temperature, to prevent condensation. According to one aspect of the present invention, the operation of system <b>10</b> is controlled to maintain the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in an air stream at a dew point temperature that is below the temperature of articles to be decontaminated. System <b>10</b> is controlled based upon a mathematical model that shall now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">It is known that the dew point concentration of a water and hydrogen peroxide sterilant is dependent on the temperature of the air&#x2014;into which the sterilant is injected&#x2014;and the concentration of the water and peroxide in the air. In the case of a steady state, steady flow process, as is used with vaporized hydrogen peroxide decontamination equipment, the dew point concentration is dependent on the injection rate of the sterilant and the temperature and the volumetric flow of air past the injector.</p>

<p id="p-0148" num="0206">Referring now to the operation of system <b>10</b>, a controller (not shown) is programmed to allow system <b>10</b> to operate in three different modes of operation, namely: (1) operating to maintain a desired dew point temperature within decontamination chamber <b>100</b>, (2) operating at a fixed rate of sterilant injection, and (3) operating so as to hold a desired peroxide concentration. The controller receives input signals from the various sensors throughout system <b>10</b>. In addition, the controller is programmed, based upon the foregoing equations, to control the heating elements <b>498</b>, <b>552</b>, <b>852</b>, blower motors <b>494</b>, <b>522</b>, <b>732</b>, <b>812</b>, and pump motors <b>324</b>, <b>524</b>, <b>628</b> in accordance with a selected mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0207">Referring first to the first mode of operation that maintains a specific dew point in the decontamination chambers, certain user inputs are required for this mode of operation. Specifically, the user inputs the following: (a) a desired dew point temperature (T<sub>dp</sub>), (b) a desired vaporizer outlet temperature, and (c) the percent of hydrogen peroxide in the liquid sterilant.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0208">When vaporized hydrogen peroxide sensor <b>674</b> is used, the dew point can be calculated. When no sensor is available, it may be estimated using equations (1) and (2) to calculate the water and peroxide concentrations (assuming efficiency is known).</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0209">As is known by those skilled in the art, a dew point temperature is the temperature at which water vapor or hydrogen peroxide vapor in the air becomes saturated and condensation begins. In the context of the present invention, the objective of system <b>10</b> when operated in the first mode of operation is to control the air temperature, air flow, and concentration of water and vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) in the air stream so as to prevent condensation on bottles <b>14</b> to be sterilized. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the temperature of bottles <b>14</b> to be sterilized is a factor in determining an actual dew point temperature. In the embodiment shown, bottles <b>14</b> are to be conveyed through decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. The initial temperature of bottles <b>14</b> entering decontamination chamber <b>100</b> is important in determining the desired dew point temperature (T<sub>dp</sub>). The desired dew point temperature is determined based upon the initial temperature of bottles <b>14</b> entering decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. To ensure that condensation does not form on bottles <b>14</b>, &#x201c;the desired dew point temperature,&#x201d; also referred to as a &#x201c;pre-selected temperature,&#x201d; inputted into the system is preferably a specific number of degrees lower than the initial temperatures of bottles <b>14</b> when entering decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the desired dew point temperature is selected to be approximately 30&#xb0; C. lower than the initial temperature of bottles <b>14</b> when entering decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. It will, of course, be appreciated that the added temperature factor could be increased or decreased, so long as it remains lower than the initial temperature of bottles <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0210">As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the lower the temperature of bottles <b>14</b> to be sterilized when entering the decontamination chamber, the lower the dew point temperature at which the water or hydrogen peroxide vapor will condense on bottles <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0211">The second piece of data inputted by the user is a desired vaporizer outlet temperature. To a certain extent, these data are also dependent on the physical properties of bottles <b>14</b> to be decontaminated. In this respect, it may be necessary to operate system <b>10</b> below a certain temperature to avoid damaging bottles <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0212">The third piece of data inputted by the user is the percent of hydrogen peroxide in the liquid sterilant. This information is provided by the supplier of the liquid sterilant.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0213">Based upon the foregoing inputted information, the system operates in the first mode of operation as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0214">Initially, both reservoir tanks <b>332</b>A, <b>332</b>B in sterilant supply unit <b>300</b> are preferably filled with liquid sterilant. Liquid sterilant is provided to the respective tanks by pump <b>322</b>. Tanks <b>332</b>A, <b>332</b>B are preferably filled to a desired fill level, indicated by level sensor <b>354</b> in each tank <b>332</b>A, <b>332</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0215">Preferably, one tank <b>332</b>A or <b>332</b>B is used to provide liquid sterilant to vaporizer unit <b>500</b> at any one time. Once a given tank <b>332</b>A or <b>332</b>B is depleted of liquid sterilant, liquid sterilant from the other tank <b>332</b>A or <b>332</b>B is then used to supply vaporizer unit <b>500</b>. An empty tank <b>332</b>A or <b>332</b>B can be refilled by opening the appropriate valves <b>344</b>, <b>346</b> to empty tank <b>332</b>A or <b>332</b>B and by pumping liquid sterilant from external supply <b>314</b> into the empty tank. While an empty tank <b>332</b>A or <b>332</b>B is being filled, the other tank <b>332</b>A or <b>332</b>B is used to supply vaporizer unit <b>500</b>. Tanks <b>332</b>A, <b>332</b>B are dimensioned to allow continued operation of decontaminating system <b>10</b> while a tank <b>332</b>A or <b>332</b>B is being refilled. As a result, a generally continuous flow of sterilant can be provided simultaneously to vaporizer unit <b>500</b> to allow continuous processing of bottles <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0216">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, liquid sterilant from tanks <b>332</b>A, <b>332</b>B are directed to holding tank <b>370</b>. Holding tank <b>370</b> is dimensioned to allow any gases that may have been released from the liquid sterilant to be vented from supply unit <b>300</b> prior to entering vaporizer unit <b>500</b>. In this respect, it has been found that the outer dimensions of holding tank <b>370</b>, being significantly larger than the feed lines and conduit in system <b>10</b>, allows gas in the liquid sterilant to be released and vented, and prevents such gas bubbles or pockets from flowing to vaporizer unit <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0217">As previously indicated, sterilant supply unit <b>300</b> is a gravity-feed system. To avoid trapping gas bubbles in vaporizer feed line <b>392</b>, all conduit and piping forming vaporizer feed line <b>392</b> extending from holding tank <b>370</b> to vaporizer unit <b>500</b> have a downward slope such that any gas released by the liquid sterilant within vaporizer feed line <b>392</b> migrates to holding tank <b>370</b> where it can be released through vent line <b>374</b>. Valve <b>376</b> in vent line <b>374</b> is controlled by float switch <b>377</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0218">Referring now to the operation of vaporizer unit <b>500</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the controller of system <b>10</b> causes motor <b>524</b> to drive blower <b>522</b>, thereby drawing air through the air-conditioning unit <b>400</b> and blowing the air into vaporizer <b>560</b> through vertical conduit <b>528</b>. The air flow created by blower <b>522</b> is measured by flow element <b>532</b>. As indicated above, motor <b>524</b> is preferably an electrically-controlled variable-speed motor wherein the air flow created through vaporizer <b>560</b> can be adjusted automatically by the controller. Heating element <b>552</b> is energized to heat the air entering vaporizer plenum <b>564</b>. The output of heating element <b>552</b> may be adjusted by varying the duty cycle to heating element <b>552</b>. In other words, the temperature of the air flowing into vaporizer plenum <b>564</b> can be adjusted by adjusting the output of heater element <b>552</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0219">When system <b>10</b> is initially started up, air from blower <b>522</b> is forced through plenum <b>564</b> and through decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. Heated air is blown through system <b>10</b> to allow components thereof to heat up until the temperature of system <b>10</b> stabilizes. Temperature sensors <b>474</b>, <b>486</b>, <b>536</b>, <b>652</b>, <b>654</b>, <b>672</b>, <b>726</b>, <b>762</b> and <b>764</b> throughout system <b>10</b> monitor the temperature of the air within system <b>10</b> and determine when the system has reached an equilibrium temperature based upon the input temperature of heating element <b>552</b> as measured by temperature sensor <b>536</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0220">Once the temperature of system <b>10</b> has stabilized, liquid sterilant is injected into the heated air stream by injector system <b>610</b>. The amount of sterilant injected into the system is established by the controller based upon calculations using the equations set forth above. The initial injection of liquid sterilant into the heated stream creates a pressure increase within vaporizer plenum <b>564</b> as a result of the liquid sterilant vaporizing in the heated air stream. This increase in pressure within vaporizer plenum <b>564</b> will result in reduced air flow into vaporizer <b>560</b>. This drop in air flow will be sensed by flow element <b>532</b>. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, the operation of blower <b>522</b> is controlled by the sensed air flow through flow element <b>532</b>. Based upon output signals from flow element <b>532</b> and sensor <b>534</b>, the controller increases the speed of blower <b>522</b> to maintain the desired air flow through vaporizer plenum <b>564</b> and the downstream units. In this respect, system <b>10</b> is self-adjusting to maintain a desired air flow rate through system <b>10</b> while vaporized hydrogen peroxide is being generated. The vaporized hydrogen peroxide from vaporizer unit <b>560</b> is conveyed into decontamination chamber <b>100</b> through vaporized hydrogen peroxide feed line <b>176</b>. In accordance with another embodiment of the present invention, for safety reasons vaporizer unit <b>560</b> is located above decontamination chamber <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this respect, any hydrogen peroxide not vaporized in vaporizer unit <b>560</b> will remain in a liquid state and drip or flow downward into decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. The dripping or flowing of liquid hydrogen peroxide into decontamination chamber <b>100</b> may be ascertained from a visual inspection of decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. If liquid hydrogen peroxide is noticed in decontamination chamber <b>100</b>, the system is shut down to avoid a hazardous condition.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0221">Referring now to the operation of system <b>10</b>, bottles <b>14</b> are conveyed along entrance passageway <b>24</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a bottle <b>14</b> is received within a recess <b>36</b> in first inlet rotary transfer device <b>32</b>A. First inlet rotary transfer device <b>32</b>A transfers bottle <b>14</b> into decontamination chamber <b>100</b> and into a recess <b>118</b> that is formed in the periphery of plate <b>116</b>. As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, bottle <b>14</b> rests upon turntable <b>112</b> and within recess <b>118</b> of plate <b>116</b>. Rotation of turntable <b>112</b> about axis &#x201c;A&#x201d; causes the bottles to move along a circular path through decontamination chamber <b>100</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates the position of injector <b>162</b>, as bottle <b>14</b> enters decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. The vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) enters decontamination chamber <b>100</b> through feed line <b>176</b>. The VHP flows through rotary union <b>182</b> into distribution block <b>174</b>. From distribution block <b>174</b>, the VHP is fed through the plurality of connector hoses <b>172</b> that connect distribution block <b>174</b> to each of the injectors <b>162</b>. In this respect, VHP flows through connector hoses <b>172</b> through opening <b>168</b> in slide <b>142</b> to passageway <b>164</b> in injector <b>162</b>. The VHP is dispensed from the orifice <b>166</b> of injector <b>162</b>, as illustrated by the arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In this respect, as a bottle <b>14</b> enters decontamination chamber <b>100</b>, VHP is being dispensed from injector <b>162</b> above the throat of bottle <b>14</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The VHP from each of the injectors <b>162</b> basically fills decontamination chamber <b>100</b> with vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP). As turntable <b>112</b> rotates about axis &#x201c;A,&#x201d; roller <b>148</b> on slide <b>142</b> follows guide slot <b>154</b> in guide plate <b>152</b>. Guide slot <b>154</b> is formed to form a continuous path from the upper edge of guide plate <b>152</b> to the lower edge of guide plate <b>152</b> such that slide <b>142</b> is caused to move downwardly along guide rod <b>136</b> as roller <b>148</b> follows guide slot <b>154</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows the position of injector <b>162</b> when slide <b>142</b> is at its lowermost position relative to guide rod <b>136</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) that exits injector <b>162</b> is forced into the interior of bottle <b>14</b> and up out through the throat of the bottle around injector <b>162</b>. In this respect, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) is injected directly into the interior of the bottle to ensure that all surfaces therein are exposed to the vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP). As the bottle moves around the circular path within decontamination chamber <b>100</b>, guide slot <b>154</b> is designed to cause slide <b>142</b> to move upwardly along guide rod <b>136</b> to withdraw injector <b>162</b> from bottle <b>14</b> as bottle <b>14</b> approaches the exit of decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. First outlet rotary transfer device <b>32</b>B conveys each bottle <b>14</b> from turntable <b>112</b> to connecting passageway <b>42</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). VHP injected into decontamination chamber <b>100</b> is removed from decontamination chamber <b>100</b> by one or more VHP outlet lines <b>184</b> connected to decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. A VHP outlet line <b>184</b> is also connected to connecting passageway <b>42</b> to withdraw vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) therefrom. VHP withdrawn from decontamination chamber <b>100</b> and connecting passageway <b>42</b> is connected to destroyer unit <b>700</b>. Bottles <b>14</b> in connecting passageway <b>42</b> are conveyed into aeration chamber <b>200</b> by second inlet rotary transfer device <b>62</b>A. Each bottle is transferred to a turntable that in the embodiment shown is the same as the turntable described above with respect to decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. Aeration chamber <b>200</b> includes an assembly for aerating bottles <b>14</b> that in the embodiment shown is the same as assembly <b>110</b> for decontaminating bottles in decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. In this respect, bottles are conveyed along a circular path within aeration chamber <b>200</b> and an injector injects clean, filtered air from aeration unit <b>800</b> into bottles <b>14</b>, as schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In this respect, each bottle includes an associated injector that is mounted to a slide that in turn is movable along a guide rod in the same fashion as previously described with respect to decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. Rather than injecting VHP, in aeration chamber <b>200</b>, clean, filtered air is conveyed to each injector from connector hoses <b>172</b>. In the same fashion as previously described, the clean, filtered air blown through the injectors within aeration chamber <b>200</b>, blow clean, filtered air around the body and into aeration chamber <b>200</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, clean, filtered air is blown into aeration chamber <b>200</b> (which is marked as decontamination chamber <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) above bottle <b>14</b> as a bottle is conveyed along a circular path by turntable <b>112</b>, the injector is inserted into bottle <b>14</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Air is blown into bottle <b>14</b> to force any residual VHP gas that may remain therein out through the neck of the bottle around injector <b>162</b>. The injector forces clean dry air into the bottle to force any residual VHP therefrom. Bottles <b>14</b> then exit aeration chamber <b>200</b> by means of second outlet rotary transfer device <b>62</b>B that transfers the bottles from turntable <b>112</b> to exit passageway <b>52</b>, wherein the bottles are conveyed along a processing line for filling (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0222">The present invention thus provides a continuous processing line for decontaminating bottles prior to a filling process. Like turntables and injector assemblies are used in both decontamination chamber <b>100</b> and aeration chamber <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0223">According to one aspect of the present invention, the concentration of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) within the decontamination chamber is monitored by sensors within the decontamination chamber and by controlling the flow through the decontamination chamber. In this respect, the flow of vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) into and out of the decontamination chamber is controlled by the flow of VHP entering the chamber through injectors <b>162</b> and by the flow of VHP out of the chamber through one or more VHP outlet lines <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0224">Similarly, air flow through aeration chamber <b>200</b> is controlled by controlling the air flow to injectors <b>162</b> in aeration chamber <b>200</b> and by controlling the air flow out of aeration chamber <b>200</b> through one or more air outlet lines <b>186</b> connected to the interior of aeration chamber <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0225">As schematically illustrated in the drawings, the vaporized hydrogen peroxide is directed over bottles <b>14</b> from above. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, blower <b>732</b> in destroyer unit <b>700</b> is energized to draw the vaporized hydrogen peroxide out of decontamination chamber <b>100</b> through VHP outlet line <b>184</b>. Flow element <b>722</b> provides signals indicative of the flow to blower <b>732</b>. The controller controls the operation of blower <b>732</b> so as to balance the air flow out of decontamination chamber <b>100</b> with the flow of air through vaporizer plenum <b>564</b>. The air stream drawn from decontamination chamber <b>100</b> is forced through destroyer <b>742</b> where the vaporized hydrogen is broken down into oxygen and water that is exhausted from system <b>10</b>, as schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0226">As indicated above, during this mode of operation, i.e., wherein the system is controlled to maintain the concentration of water vapor and vaporized hydrogen peroxide in decontamination chamber <b>100</b> at a desired level for a desired operating temperature, the controller of system <b>10</b> constantly monitors the various sensors throughout system <b>10</b> to ensure that the proper amount of liquid hydrogen peroxide sterilant is being injected into injection system <b>610</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0227">In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, system <b>10</b> monitors and verifies the amount of vaporized hydrogen peroxide produced within system <b>10</b> in several ways. According to a first method of measuring the vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), system <b>10</b> monitors the temperature drop across destroyer <b>742</b> using temperature sensors <b>762</b> and <b>764</b>. In this respect, the destruction of vaporized hydrogen peroxide produces heat. By monitoring the change in temperature across destroyer <b>742</b>, a first indication of the amount of vaporized hydrogen peroxide flowing through the system can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0228">A second method of measuring and monitoring the concentration of vaporized hydrogen peroxide within system <b>10</b> is through measurements from vaporized hydrogen peroxide sensor <b>662</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) or <b>674</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0229">A third method of measuring and monitoring the amount of vaporized hydrogen peroxide in system <b>10</b> is by monitoring the injection rate of liquid sterilant into injection system <b>610</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). In this respect, the output of mass meter <b>627</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) can be monitored to provide an indication of the metered amounts of liquid sterilant sent to injection system <b>610</b>. The peroxide and water concentrations are calculated using equations 1 and 2.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0230">A fourth method of measuring and monitoring the amount of vaporized hydrogen peroxide in system <b>10</b> is to monitor the temperature change within vaporizer plenum <b>564</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>). Specifically, temperature sensors <b>652</b> and <b>654</b> within vaporizer plenum <b>564</b> are monitored. Just as the destruction of vaporized hydrogen peroxide produces a specific amount of heat per unit mass, so, too, does the vaporization of liquid hydrogen peroxide require a specific amount of heat which produces a decrease in temperature. By monitoring the change in temperature in the air stream within vaporizer plenum <b>564</b>, the amount of vaporized hydrogen peroxide in system <b>10</b> can be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0231">In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, system <b>10</b> monitors all four of the foregoing conditions and compares the output calculations to each other. If any one of the four monitored parameters is outside an acceptable range of error, system <b>10</b> alerts the system operator of potential problems.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0232">By continuously monitoring the sensors throughout system <b>10</b>, the concentration of water vapor and hydrogen peroxide vapor within the air stream can be maintained at a desired level for a desired operating temperature. Since, as indicated above, the desired operating dew point temperature is preferably approximately 30&#xb0; C. below the temperatures of bottles <b>14</b> entering the decontamination chamber, condensation on such bottles <b>14</b> can be avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0233">The present invention thus provides a system <b>10</b> that can operate to maintain a specific dew point temperature, to prevent water vapor or vaporized hydrogen peroxide from condensating on bottles <b>14</b> and, at the same time, maintain a desired operating temperature so as not to damage bottles <b>14</b> to be decontaminated.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0234">Referring now to the second mode of operation, i.e., wherein system <b>10</b> is held to a predetermined injection rate, the user is required to once again input into the controller of a system <b>10</b> a desired temperature that system <b>10</b> should maintain within decontamination chamber <b>100</b>, and the percent of hydrogen peroxide in the liquid sterilant. In this mode of operation, once a steady-state flow has been established, the injection rate of injection system <b>610</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) is maintained at a set amount. Air flow through the system may increase to maintain a desired operating temperature, however, the injection rate remains constant throughout the operation in this mode. The dew point is supplied to the user so a determination can be made if condensation will occur.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0235">In the third mode of operation, i.e., wherein the vaporized hydrogen peroxide concentration is held steady, the user inputs into the controller of system <b>10</b> a desired operating temperature that system <b>10</b> should maintain within decontamination chamber <b>100</b>. Once steady-state air flow has been established through the system, liquid hydrogen peroxide is injected into the air stream. As indicated above, system <b>10</b> monitors the amount of vaporized hydrogen peroxide in system <b>10</b> and maintains the desired vaporized hydrogen peroxide concentration by increasing or decreasing the injection rate of pump <b>626</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of injection system <b>610</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0181" num="0286">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13B</figref>, a bottling system <b>900</b> illustrating an alternate embodiment of the present invention is shown. Unlike the prior embodiment wherein a decontamination chamber <b>100</b> and a separate aeration chamber <b>200</b> are shown as part of bottling system <b>10</b>, in system <b>900</b> a bottle <b>14</b> is sterilized, aerated, filled and capped on a single turntable mechanism. System <b>900</b> includes an outer housing <b>912</b> that defines an entrance passageway <b>914</b>, a generally cylindrical interior chamber <b>916</b> and an exit passageway <b>918</b>. Interior chamber <b>916</b> is dimensioned to contain a turntable <b>922</b> that is essentially the same as that disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-10</figref>, but larger to accommodate more bottles <b>14</b>. As in the prior embodiment, turntable <b>922</b> is designed to convey bottles <b>14</b> along a circular path from the entrance passageway <b>914</b> to exit passageway <b>918</b>. In accordance with the embodiment shown, bottles <b>14</b> are sterilized, aerated, filled with a fluid and capped between entrance passageway <b>914</b> and exit passageway <b>918</b>. As in the prior embodiment, system <b>900</b> includes injector assemblies that are essentially the same as that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, wherein injector <b>162</b> (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13B</figref>) may be guided into and out of bottle <b>14</b> by means of a slide <b>142</b> moving along guide rod <b>136</b>. In system <b>900</b>, bottle <b>14</b> passes through a decontamination zone &#x201c;DZ,&#x201d; an aeration zone &#x201c;AZ,&#x201d; a filling zone &#x201c;FZ&#x201d; and a capping zone &#x201c;CZ.&#x201d; The foregoing zones are defined by baffles <b>924</b><i>a</i>, <b>924</b><i>b</i>, <b>924</b><i>c</i>, <b>924</b><i>d </i>(shown in phantom lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) that are formed along the path of bottles <b>14</b>. Baffles <b>924</b><i>a</i>, <b>924</b><i>b</i>, <b>924</b><i>c </i>and <b>924</b><i>d </i>each have an opening (not shown) therethrough that allow bottles <b>14</b> and injectors <b>162</b> to pass therethrough with minimum clearance as is conventionally known.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0287">In the embodiment shown, each injector <b>162</b> is connected by a slide <b>142</b> to a connector hose <b>172</b> that connects injector <b>162</b> to a distribution block <b>932</b>, best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Distribution block <b>932</b>, best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, is comprised of an upper stationary section <b>932</b>A and a lower rotating section <b>932</b>B. Upper section <b>932</b>A and lower section <b>932</b>B have planar surfaces that mate with each other and allow upper section <b>932</b>A and lower section <b>932</b>B to move relative to each other. In the embodiment shown, a cylindrical pin <b>934</b> extending from the planar surface of upper section <b>932</b>A is received in a cylindrical bore <b>936</b> in lower section <b>932</b>B to facilitate rotational movement between upper section <b>932</b>A and lower section <b>932</b>B about an axis, designated &#x201c;X&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>. Three (3) isolated cavities <b>942</b>, <b>944</b>, <b>946</b>, best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, are formed in upper section <b>932</b>A to define three (3) chambers when upper section <b>932</b>A is mated with lower section <b>932</b>B. A vaporized hydrogen peroxide feed line <b>176</b> from vaporizer unit <b>500</b> communicates with a first cavity <b>942</b> to define a VHP chamber. An aeration conduit <b>822</b> from aeration unit <b>800</b> communicates with second chamber <b>944</b> to define an air cavity. A fluid, i.e., product, inlet line <b>956</b> communicates with third cavity <b>946</b>. Lower section <b>932</b>B of distribution block <b>932</b> includes a plurality of equally spaced apertures <b>958</b> that are arranged symmetrically about central axis &#x201c;X.&#x201d; Each aperture <b>958</b> is connected to a connector hose <b>172</b>, as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0288">As best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, first cavity <b>942</b> in upper section <b>932</b>A of distribution block <b>932</b> defines the decontamination zone &#x201c;DZ&#x201d; within interior chamber <b>916</b> of housing <b>912</b>. Second cavity <b>944</b> in distribution block <b>932</b> defines aeration zone &#x201c;AZ&#x201d; of interior chamber <b>916</b>. Third cavity <b>946</b> defines filling zone &#x201c;FZ.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0289">A capping station <b>960</b> is provided at the end of filling zone &#x201c;FZ,&#x201d; as schematically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. In the embodiment shown, a supply of caps <b>962</b> provide caps <b>964</b> aligned along a path that intersects a path of bottles <b>14</b> moving along turntable <b>922</b>. Caps <b>964</b> pass through a decontamination chamber <b>966</b> wherein VHP from vaporizer unit <b>500</b>, as heretofore described, is conveyed over caps <b>964</b> to decontaminate the same. Caps <b>964</b> pass into an aeration chamber <b>968</b> where air from the aforementioned aeration unit <b>800</b> removes residual VHP from caps <b>964</b>. Sterilized caps <b>964</b> are then conveyed to a bottle capping mechanism (not shown) that caps bottles <b>14</b> moving along turntable <b>922</b>. As indicated above, bottling system <b>900</b> is designed for use in conjunction with a high-capacity VHP generating system as described above wherein a single, high-capacity VHP vaporizer unit <b>500</b> generates sufficient VHP to sterilize bottles <b>14</b> continuously moving along bottling system <b>900</b>. In this respect, bottling system <b>900</b> includes a sterilant supply unit <b>300</b>, an air conditioning unit <b>400</b>, a vaporizer unit <b>500</b>, a destroyer unit <b>700</b> and an aeration unit <b>800</b>, as heretofore described.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0290">Referring now to the operation of system <b>900</b>, bottles <b>14</b> are conveyed and aligned along entrance passageway <b>914</b> and are conveyed by intermediate conveyor <b>915</b> to turntable <b>922</b>. The bottles <b>14</b> are captured within the recesses of the turntable and are conveyed along the circular path through the interior chamber <b>916</b> of housing <b>912</b>. As each bottle <b>14</b> passes past baffle <b>924</b><i>a </i>that defines the entrance to decontamination zone DZ, the connector hose <b>172</b> associated with an injector <b>162</b> above a bottle <b>14</b> becomes aligned with first chamber (cavity) <b>942</b> in distribution block <b>932</b>. VHP fed from vaporizer unit <b>500</b> through vaporized hydrogen peroxide feed line <b>176</b> is forced into first chamber <b>942</b> and through connector hoses <b>172</b> that communicate with first chamber <b>942</b>. In other words, as bottle <b>14</b> passes through the decontamination zone DZ, VHP is conveyed from vaporizer unit <b>500</b> through first chamber <b>942</b> and through the associated connector hose <b>172</b> into and around bottles <b>14</b> in decontamination zone DZ, thereby filling bottles <b>14</b> with vaporized hydrogen peroxide. As with the previous embodiment, VHP exiting bottle <b>14</b> likewise flows around the exterior of bottle <b>14</b> thereby decontaminating the entire bottle surface. An auxiliary VHP line <b>176</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is provided to provide additional VHP to the decontamination zone DZ to ensure sterilization of the exterior of bottles <b>14</b>. Outlet lines <b>184</b> communicate with decontamination zone DZ to exhaust VHP from the decontamination zone DZ and convey it to destroyer unit <b>700</b>. As described above, system <b>900</b> monitors and controls the flow of VHP through decontamination zone DZ to ensure a specific amount of VHP within decontamination zone DZ as bottles <b>14</b> move therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0291">Eventually, bottles <b>14</b> pass through baffle <b>924</b><i>b </i>that separates decontamination zone DZ from aeration zone AZ. At the same time, apertures <b>958</b> in lower section <b>932</b>B of distribution block <b>932</b> that are associated with connector hoses <b>172</b> that are in turn associated with injectors <b>162</b> within bottles <b>14</b>, move into communication with second chamber <b>944</b> of distribution block <b>932</b> wherein dry, clean, filtered air from aeration unit <b>800</b> is forced through connector hose <b>172</b> and through injector <b>162</b> into bottles <b>14</b>. As a bottle moves through aeration zone AZ, clean, dry, filtered air is continually forced into bottle <b>14</b> to force residual VHP therefrom. At the same time, an auxiliary air inlet line <b>822</b>A is connected to aeration zone AZ to force additional clean, dry, filtered air into aeration zone AZ to remove VHP around bottles <b>14</b>. Outlet lines <b>184</b> communicating with aeration zone AZ exhaust air and residual VHP from aeration zone AZ to destroyer unit <b>700</b>. The combination of air being forced into and around bottles <b>14</b> through injectors <b>162</b> and air inlet lines <b>822</b>, <b>822</b>A and the air being drawn out through outlet lines <b>184</b> creates an air flow through aeration zone AZ to remove residual VHP from and around bottles <b>14</b> from the time a bottle <b>14</b> reaches baffle <b>924</b><i>c </i>between aeration zone AZ and filling zone FZ. As a bottle <b>14</b> passes baffle <b>924</b><i>c</i>, apertures <b>958</b> in lower section <b>932</b>B of distribution block <b>932</b> pass from second chamber <b>944</b> to third chamber <b>946</b> which is filled with a fluid, i.e., the product. In this respect, bottles <b>14</b> are then filled with a fluid as they pass through filling zone FZ of bottling system <b>900</b>. In this respect, the flow of fluid into third chamber <b>946</b> and into bottles <b>14</b> is preferably controlled such that bottles <b>14</b> are filled to an appropriate level when they reach the end of filling zone FZ. It would of course be appreciated that other means of controlling flow into bottles <b>14</b> could be provided when filling the bottles.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0292">Once a bottle <b>14</b> is filled and passes through baffle <b>924</b><i>d </i>defining the end of filling zone FZ, it intersects the cap pathway, wherein a sterilized cap <b>964</b> is applied to a bottle <b>14</b> and secured thereto by conventional capping means (not shown). The filled and capped bottle <b>14</b> is then conveyed by an intermediate conveyor <b>965</b> from turntable <b>922</b> to exit passageway <b>918</b> where the filled and capped bottle <b>14</b> then proceeds to stacking and storage.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0293">The embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11-13</figref> illustrates an alternate embodiment wherein a single VHP generating system is used in conjunction with a single bottling system to perform both sterilization and aeration on the same turntable, where filling and capping may also occur using the same turntable.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0294">The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purposes of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.</p>
