<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/724,806 filed Mar. 15, 2007, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,954,311, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Ammonia or urea may be stored on-board a vehicle for use as a reductant in exhaust emission control systems.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Under some conditions, such as during ammonia or urea recharge, ammonia vapor that was generated in the reductant system may be used, such as described in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006/0117741. For example, ammonia vapors may be routed to a storage unit and a reactor that uses catalytically generated heat from the exhaust or electrically generated heat. Further, the vapors may also be directed to the exhaust gas to react with exhaust gas NOx in a catalyst in the exhaust flow.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">However, the inventors herein have recognized several issues with such a system. For example, ammonia vapors may be used inefficiently in the exhaust, such as during various SCR (selective catalyst reduction) catalyst temperature conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, in one approach, a method of managing vapors generated from an ammonia-containing reductant delivery system for an engine of a vehicle may be used. The method comprises storing ammonia containing vapors generated in the reductant delivery system and purging said stored ammonia into selected regions of the engine based on an operating temperature, such as temperatures of the regions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, the reductant may be directed to various regions of the engine based on operating conditions. For example, at relatively high operation temperatures, ammonia may reduce a first amount of NOx in the combustion chamber and then reduce residual NOx in a downstream SCR catalyst. In another example, at low operation temperatures, ammonia may be used to recharge a urea or ammonia storage device to be later released into the system. In this way, it may be possible to reduce vapor pressures and reduce un-metered ammonia exiting the system. Further, by later use of the stored ammonia in the exhaust, more effective usage rates of ammonia (or urea) may be achieved, possibly reducing the amount or frequency of ammonia (or urea) that is added by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, in an example approach where stored ammonia or urea is purged into the engine combustion chamber, it is possible to reduce some amount of NOx prior to a downstream SCR catalyst. In this way, the combination of the combustion chamber and the SCR catalyst may increase the total amount of NOx reduced in the system. As such, the engine may run on leaner conditions to improve fuel efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Finally, in still another example approach where ammonia or urea is stored during a reductant filling and later purged (into engine, exhaust, or back to tank), it is possible to reduce evaporative emissions that may be released into the atmosphere during reductant refilling. As such, the operator may be subject to a reduced amount of bothersome ammonia vapors.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DEPICTED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The accompanying figures and this description depict and describe various exemplary embodiments of a system for managing the storage and purging of evaporative emissions, such as with regard to an on-board ammonia or urea storage and metering system. Some of the embodiments described herein include a first storage device for storing the reductant, as well as a metering system to deliver the stored reductant to the exhaust system upstream of a catalyst for the reduction of various engine emissions. Further, a second storage device may be included for capturing evaporative emissions from the first storage device to reduce release of evaporative emissions to the atmosphere. Under selected conditions, the second storage device may require purging. The evaporative emissions stored in second storage device may be purged to the first storage device to be dissolved into first reductant or may be purged into the system. For example, the evaporative emissions may be introduced to an SCR catalyst or may be introduced to the combustion chamber to reduce NOx based on thermal considerations or engine operating conditions. In this way, the system may take advantage of the engine operating conditions to effectively reduce NOx with the purged evaporative emissions and reduce release of the evaporative emissions from the first storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, direct injection internal combustion engine <b>10</b>, comprising a plurality of combustion chambers and controlled by electronic engine controller <b>12</b>, is shown. Combustion chamber <b>30</b> of engine <b>10</b> includes combustion chamber walls <b>32</b> with piston <b>36</b> positioned therein and connected to crankshaft <b>40</b>. In one example, piston <b>36</b> includes a recess or bowl (not shown) to form selected levels of stratification or homogenization of charges of air and fuel. Alternatively, a flat piston may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Combustion chamber <b>30</b> is shown communicating with intake manifold <b>44</b> and exhaust manifold <b>48</b> via intake valve <b>52</b><i>a</i>, and exhaust valve <b>54</b><i>a</i>. Fuel injector <b>66</b> is shown directly coupled to combustion chamber <b>30</b> for delivering liquid fuel directly therein in proportion to the pulse width of signal fpw received from controller <b>12</b> via conventional electronic driver <b>68</b>. Fuel is delivered to fuel system (not shown) including a fuel tank, fuel pumps, and a fuel rail. In some embodiments, engine <b>10</b> may include a plurality of combustion chambers each having a plurality of intake and/or exhaust valves.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Intake manifold <b>44</b> is shown communicating with throttle body <b>58</b> via throttle plate <b>62</b>. In this particular example, throttle plate <b>62</b> is coupled to electric motor <b>94</b> so that the position of throttle plate <b>62</b> is controlled by controller <b>12</b> via electric motor <b>94</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Controller <b>12</b> activates fuel injector <b>66</b> so that a desired air-fuel ratio mixture is formed. Controller <b>12</b> controls the amount of fuel delivered by fuel injector <b>66</b> so that the air-fuel ratio mixture in chamber <b>30</b> can be selected to be substantially at (or near) stoichiometry, a value rich of stoichiometry, or a value lean of stoichiometry. Further, controller <b>12</b> is configured to activate fuel injector <b>66</b> so that multiple fuel injections may be performed during a cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A catalytic converter <b>70</b> is shown in communication with exhaust manifold <b>48</b>, and a catalyst <b>72</b> is shown positioned downstream of catalytic converter <b>70</b>. A reductant source <b>73</b> is provided for introducing one or more reductants into exhaust system <b>71</b> upstream of SCR catalyst <b>72</b> or into intake manifold <b>44</b> upstream of combustion chamber <b>30</b> or some combination thereof as prompted by controller <b>12</b>. In particular, reductants may enter exhaust system <b>71</b> at various locations (e.g. first reductant input <b>75</b>, second reductant input <b>77</b>, etc.). Alternatively, reductants may enter intake manifold <b>44</b> via intake manifold input <b>76</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Controller <b>12</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> as a conventional microcomputer including: microprocessor unit <b>102</b>, input/output ports <b>104</b>, an electronic storage medium of executing programs and calibration values, shown as read-only memory chip <b>106</b> in this particular example, random access memory <b>108</b>, keep alive memory <b>110</b>, and a conventional data bus.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Controller <b>12</b> is shown receiving various signals from sensors coupled to engine <b>10</b>, in addition to those signals previously discussed, including: measurement of inducted mass air flow (MAF) from mass air flow sensor <b>100</b> coupled to throttle body <b>58</b>; engine coolant temperature (ECT) from temperature sensor <b>112</b> coupled to cooling sleeve <b>114</b>; a profile ignition pickup signal (PIP) from Hall effect sensor <b>118</b> coupled to crankshaft <b>40</b> giving an indication of engine speed (RPM); and throttle position TP from throttle position sensor <b>120</b>. Controller <b>12</b> may also receive a signal related to an exhaust NOx concentration from a NOx sensor <b>122</b> positioned upstream of SCR catalyst <b>72</b>, and/or a signal from an ammonia sensor <b>124</b> related to an ammonia concentration in a reductant added from reductant source <b>73</b>. Engine speed signal RPM is generated by controller <b>12</b> from signal PIP in a conventional manner and manifold pressure signal MAP provides an indication of engine load.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Combustion in engine <b>10</b> can be of various types, depending on operating conditions. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a compression ignition engine, it will be appreciated that the embodiments described below may be used in any suitable engine, including but not limited to, diesel and gasoline compression ignition engines, spark ignition engines, direct or port injection engines, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a block diagram of an example of emissions control system <b>200</b> of engine <b>10</b> in more detail. In particular, combustion chamber <b>30</b> is shown communicating with intake manifold <b>44</b> and exhaust manifold <b>48</b> where the exhaust manifold is shown further communicating with catalytic converter <b>70</b>. A catalyst <b>72</b>, such as an SCR catalyst, may be coupled to the catalytic converter by exhaust system <b>71</b>. Further, emissions control system <b>200</b> may include a reductant source <b>73</b> (e.g., a reductant storage, delivery, and purge management system) that may manage the storage and utilization of a plurality of reductants. While <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows one specific reductant management system, various alternatives may be used, such as alternatives shown by the examples described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Reductant management system <b>73</b> is shown coupled to intake manifold <b>44</b> upstream of combustion chamber <b>30</b> and exhaust system <b>71</b> upstream of catalyst <b>72</b>, such as an SCR catalyst. As such, reductant management system <b>73</b> may selectively introduce reductants (e.g., mixtures comprising ammonia and/or urea) to or upstream of combustion chamber <b>30</b> (e.g., via intake manifold <b>44</b>) and/or downstream of combustion chamber <b>30</b> to exhaust system <b>71</b> (e.g., before SCR catalyst <b>72</b>). In particular, one or more reductants may be introduced to intake manifold <b>44</b> via first intake input <b>76</b> or second intake input <b>77</b>. Likewise, one or more reductants may be introduced to exhaust system <b>71</b> via first exhaust input <b>75</b>, second exhaust input <b>77</b>, third exhaust input <b>74</b>, or some combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Reductant management system <b>73</b> may include a first storage device <b>220</b> for storing a quantity of a first reductant <b>222</b>. Depending upon the chemical and physical properties of first reductant <b>222</b>, under certain conditions, first reductant <b>222</b> may react (for example, with atmospheric components) or decompose to form a second reductant <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Over time (e.g., during vehicle operation, during engine/vehicle shut-down, during reductant re-filling), the production of second reductant <b>224</b> may cause an increase in vapor pressure within first storage device <b>220</b>. Therefore, to assist in controlling pressure within first storage device <b>220</b> or within system <b>73</b>, at some vapor pressure a pressure relief valve <b>225</b> may be configured to release a quantity of second reductant <b>224</b> into a second storage device <b>230</b> via storage line <b>79</b>, although second reductant <b>224</b> may be released directly into the exhaust stream through third exhaust input <b>74</b>. Second storage device <b>230</b> likewise may be configured to release controlled quantities of second reductant <b>224</b> into exhaust system <b>71</b> through second exhaust input <b>77</b>. Under some conditions, second storage device <b>230</b> may be configured to release controlled quantities of second reductant <b>224</b> into intake manifold <b>44</b> upstream of combustion chamber <b>30</b>. Under other conditions, second reductant <b>224</b> may be released into the first storage device <b>220</b> via recycle line <b>78</b> wherein second reductant <b>224</b> may be dissolved in first reductant <b>222</b>, for example. In this manner, reductant management system <b>73</b> may allow controlled quantities of both the first and second reductants to be released into exhaust system <b>71</b> wherein at least one of the reductants may react at a downstream site, such as an SCR catalyst, for example. Further the release may be concurrent, separate, or some combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, first reductant <b>222</b> stored in first storage device <b>220</b> may be aqueous urea. First storage device <b>220</b> may include a storage tank for the example embodiment described herein, although other storage devices may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As noted above, the aqueous urea solution may react with various atmospheric components (e.g. water vapor, oxygen, etc.) under various conditions (e.g. applied heat, external heat, reduced atmospheric pressure, etc.), thereby decomposing and evolving ammonia vapor. Pressure relief valve <b>225</b> may be configured to open at a selected pressure, engine cycle or time interval, etc. to release at least some of the ammonia vapor from first storage device <b>220</b> into second storage device <b>230</b>. For example, pressure relief valve <b>225</b> may be configured to open during engine/vehicle shut-down prior to filling the storage tank. Likewise, recycle valve <b>227</b> may be configured to open at a selected reductant concentration in storage device <b>230</b>, for example. Second storage device <b>230</b> may capture and store the ammonia vapor so as to reduce ammonia release into the atmosphere during refilling of the tank, for example. Second storage device <b>230</b> may store the ammonia chemically, physically, or some combination thereof. The ammonia may be stored until controller <b>12</b> prompts the release of ammonia vapor from second storage device <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Second storage device <b>230</b> may contain any suitable sorbent material for the storage of ammonia. For example, second storage device <b>230</b> may include a low temperature storage zeolite washcoat on a ceramic substrate. In another example, second storage device <b>230</b> may be a charcoal canister. Other examples of suitable sorbent materials may include but are not limited to molecular sieves (e.g. zeolites, alumina, silica, activated carbon, etc); oxides, carbonates, and hydroxides of alkali earth metals; and metal phosphates including but not limited to phosphates of titanium and zirconium. In one example, the ammonia may be adsorbed to a surface via chemical adsorption, or may be chemically and physically absorbed into material in the storage unit.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In some embodiments, the concentration of ammonia in the gas passing through second storage unit <b>230</b> may drive the storage/release of ammonia. For example, when a higher concentration of ammonia at selected temperatures is passed through second storage device <b>230</b> from first storage device <b>220</b>, ammonia may be stored. However, when fresh air is passed through second storage device <b>230</b>, ammonia may be released. In this way, temporary storage may be used to enable venting of gasses and thereby reduce pressure in the system, where the temporarily stored ammonia may then be recovered and used in the system.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The system may use ammonia vapor recovered from second storage device <b>230</b> in a variety of ways. Under some conditions, ammonia vapor from second storage device <b>230</b> may be introduced to exhaust system <b>71</b>. As such, ammonia may be absorbed in SCR catalyst <b>72</b> to reduce NOx in the exhaust. Alternatively, ammonia vapor from second storage device <b>230</b> may be introduced to intake manifold <b>44</b> upstream of or to combustion chamber <b>30</b>. Under some conditions, ammonia introduced to intake manifold <b>44</b> may at least partially reduce NOx in combustion chamber <b>30</b> and/or exhaust manifold <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As such, ammonia may at least partially convert NOx in a portion of the system that may not include a catalyst, such as combustion chamber <b>30</b>, and/or may reduce NOx selectively and catalytically in SCR catalyst <b>72</b> or some combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically illustrates the conversion of nitrogen oxides by ammonia and/or urea in an example of a reduction process <b>300</b>. Arrows pointing to box <b>310</b> represent chemical reagents <b>320</b> while arrows pointing from box <b>310</b> represent products <b>330</b>. Nitrogen oxides in the reacting with ammonia and/or urea may form more environmentally benign products such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and water for emission into the atmosphere. In some embodiments, ammonia and/or urea may selectively and catalytically react in SCR catalyst <b>72</b>. In other embodiments, ammonia and/or urea may react in a mechanism that may not include a catalyst, such as in thermal decomposition, for example. Some exemplary reactions are as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">First, urea may decompose into ammonia as follows:

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It may be desirable to introduce an amount of one or more reductants, such as urea and/or ammonia, generally derived from the above NOx reduction reaction stoichiometries or a look-up table stored in controller <b>12</b>. In particular, the amount of urea and/or ammonia introduced may be based on information from a sensor. For example, the output signal from a sensor, such as a NOx sensor, may indicate an amount of NOx in some region of the system. In another example, the output signal from a sensor in the reductant management system, such as an ammonia sensor, may indicate an amount of ammonia that may be purged from second storage device <b>230</b>. As such, controller <b>12</b> may prompt reductant management system <b>73</b> to introduce an amount of urea and/or ammonia to exhaust system <b>71</b> accordingly. In doing this, urea and/or ammonia may be substantially consumed by the reduction of NOx in the exhaust at the SCR catalyst.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">However, under some conditions it may be advantageous to mitigate ammonia release into the environment. In particular, ammonia release may occur during refill of the storage tank. Reductant management system <b>73</b> may regulate the reductants such that ammonia may be substantially contained in second storage device <b>230</b> rather than escape through the neck of the storage tank. By doing this, release of ammonia may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a sequence of operations that may be used to reduce the release of evaporative emissions from a urea storage tank. In particular, the storage and transport of a reductant, such as urea and/or ammonia, may be regulated by a method of operating reductant management system <b>73</b> that may be at least partially contingent on various engine conditions, and in particular based on engine shut-down and/or reductant refilling conditions. While ammonia may be generated during normal engine operation, the amount of NOx generated by the engine may be sufficient to substantially consume ammonia generated. However, during engine shut-down conditions, a reduced amount of NOx may be generated by the engine such that ammonia may be released into the atmosphere. As such, the method described herein may be used to reduce evaporative emissions released during an engine shut-down prompted by an output signal requesting a urea tank refill. For example, during engine-off conditions (which may include vehicle-off conditions, or vehicle operational conditions in the example of a hybrid-electric vehicle), ammonia may be released into the environment from the storage tank prior to, during, and/or after refilling the reductant tank. Although <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a sequence of operations for engine-off conditions, it may be understood that the method described herein may be used during various other engine conditions, such as during normal engine operation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The example routine <b>400</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a schematic representation of an example embodiment of emission control system operation that may manage ammonia in emission control system <b>200</b> to address ammonia generation during engine-off conditions, such as during a tank refill. For example, ammonia may be generated due to external heat transferred to the ammonia/urea storage system. In one example, residual engine/exhaust heat in combination with ambient heat may cause production of ammonia vapor that raises vapor pressure. Such conditions may be addressed by storing vapor during the engine-off conditions to be later introduced in the intake manifold and/or the exhaust for emission reduction.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">First, at <b>410</b> a reductant refill in the storage tank may be requested. In particular, an output signal from a sensor in the storage tank may indicate that a reductant refill may be desired to sustain suitable emission control. As such, an indicator light, for example, in the control panel of the vehicle may prompt the vehicle operator to turn the engine off so as to refill the storage tank at <b>420</b>. As such, at <b>430</b> the engine performs a shut-down wherein the shut-down may initiate a condition that may be referred to herein as engine-off condition. In one embodiment, the engine may be a combustion engine in a vehicle wherein the vehicle may be shut-down during the engine-off conditions. In another embodiment, the vehicle may use an electric motor or various other drive members (e.g. a fuel cell, etc.) during the engine-off condition of the combustion engine.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">During the engine-off condition of the combustion engine, ammonia may be generated at <b>440</b> in the reductant management system in various ways. In particular, the urea may react with water and/or oxygen in the storage tank to produce ammonia at ambient temperature. Further, heat may facilitate the decomposition of urea to ammonia. As such, residual heat from previous operation of the engine may at least partially accelerate ammonia generation in the storage tank.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the reaction of stored urea may lead to elevated pressures of ammonia gas in first storage device <b>220</b> wherein first storage device <b>220</b> may be a urea storage tank. Pressure in the storage tank may be reduced by releasing the ammonia through reductant input <b>74</b> to exhaust system <b>71</b> or to intake manifold <b>44</b> or through pressure relief valve <b>225</b> to second storage device <b>230</b> or some combination thereof. In particular, pressure relief valve <b>225</b> may be configured to open to relieve the vapor pressure in the storage tank under some conditions. For example, pressure relief valve <b>225</b> may open during engine/vehicle off conditions prior to, during, and/or after refilling the storage tank. In another example, pressure relief valve <b>225</b> may open at a selected pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, ammonia may be sorbed at <b>450</b> in second storage device <b>230</b>. For example, pressure relief valve <b>225</b> may be configured to open until the controller prompts the valve to close. As such, the concentration of ammonia from the storage tank may increase in second storage device <b>230</b> for at least a portion of the duration of the engine-off condition. In doing this, the vapor pressure of ammonia in the storage tank may be reduced. Lower ammonia vapor pressure in the tank may reduce ammonia release into the atmosphere. As such, ammonia sorption in second storage device <b>230</b> may reduce the amount of ammonia released into the environment at the refill valve or device when introducing the reductant to the storage tank at <b>460</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Then, at <b>470</b>, the combustion engine is started. At <b>470</b>, ammonia may be desorbed from second storage device <b>230</b> and purged into exhaust system <b>71</b> during selected engine/exhaust conditions. For example, after an engine speed run-up, and after the SCR catalyst reaches a selected operating temperature, stored ammonia may be purged into the exhaust and used to reduce NOx produced in the exhaust. In one example, at least one of the amount of purging or frequency of purging may be adjusted based on operation conditions, such as exhaust temperature, catalyst temperature, engine speed, engine load, or combinations thereof. Further, controller <b>12</b> may adjust or enable the purging of ammonia from second storage device <b>230</b> in response to various conditions. As one particular example, controller <b>12</b> may enable purging ammonia in response to a feedback signal from a temperature sensor wherein the temperature sensor may be disposed in the exhaust, the SCR catalyst downstream reductant management system <b>73</b>, or the second storage device. Alternately, the temperature sensor may indicate ambient temperature. In another example, controller <b>12</b> may enable purging ammonia in response to a feedback signal from an ammonia and/or pressure sensor that may detect the concentration of ammonia stored in second storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this way, it may be possible to address vapor generation during engine-off conditions, at least under selected conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A-F</figref>, block diagrams schematically demonstrate various reductant management modes that may be used, including storing, purging, etc. For example, a mode may include selectively transporting ammonia from at least one of first storage device <b>220</b> or second storage device <b>230</b> wherein ammonia transport may be facilitated by one or more vents/connections to atmosphere. Further, the atmospheric vent may be a relief valve that may relieve pressure or vacuum build-up (or may alternative between pressure and vacuum relief based on the desired effect) or may vary in response to the desired direction of transport of ammonia and/or urea. Under some conditions, such as elevated pressure, one or more vents/connections to atmosphere may vent pressure from the system to the environment. As such, an additional device (not shown) may be disposed fluidically between the vent and the atmosphere. Specifically, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, reductant management system <b>73</b> may include a first atmospheric valve <b>510</b> that may be coupled to first storage device <b>220</b> (i.e. the urea storage tank) and/or a second atmospheric valve <b>520</b> that may be coupled to second storage device wherein either valve may be configured to relieve pressure or vacuum build-up or vary as described herein. The atmospheric valves may be configured to adjust the flow of atmospheric air into reductant management system <b>73</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or to adjust the flow of vapor out of the system. It may be appreciated that reductants leaving reductant management system <b>73</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may generally be routed intake manifold <b>44</b> or exhaust system <b>71</b> or some combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, diagram <b>530</b> describes a path of reductant flow in reductant management system <b>73</b> wherein the flow may generally include the flow of ammonia vapor generated in the storage tank to second storage device <b>230</b>. The path of flow described by diagram <b>530</b> may be referred to as a storage mode.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one embodiment of storage mode described herein, NOx in the exhaust may be reduced in the SCR catalyst by liquid urea introduced to exhaust system via a first exhaust input <b>75</b> from the storage tank. The stored urea may produce ammonia vapor that may be routed to second storage device <b>230</b> wherein the ammonia vapor may be stored in second storage device <b>230</b> until controller <b>12</b> may prompt a purging condition.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In another embodiment, controller <b>12</b> may not prompt the release of a reductant from reductant management system <b>73</b>. For example, during engine-off conditions, urea and/or ammonia introduced to exhaust system <b>71</b> may result in ammonia slip. As such, urea may not be introduced to exhaust system <b>71</b>. However, ammonia vapor generated in the storage tank as a result of residual engine heat, for example, may be routed to second storage device. In doing so, elevated vapor pressures may be reduced, although controller <b>12</b> may not prompt the release of reductants to exhaust system <b>71</b>. Further, during engine-off conditions, a reductant may be supplied to the storage tank via reductant supply channel <b>80</b>. For example, a vehicle operator may refill the storage tank with urea in response to an indication that the storage tank may contain less urea than a selected amount. As such, ammonia vapor generated in the storage tank may be routed to second storage device so as to reduce ammonia vapor release into the atmosphere while the operator is refilling the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It may be advantageous to facilitate the transport of ammonia from the storage tank to second storage device <b>230</b> during a storage mode. For example, atmospheric valve <b>520</b> may be configured to open. In doing this, pressure build-up in second storage device <b>230</b> may be relieved such that the air leaving reductant management system <b>73</b> may be substantially free of ammonia and more ammonia vapor may enter second storage device <b>230</b> and be stored therein. In another example, atmospheric valve <b>510</b> may be configured to open at some pressure such that atmospheric air may be drawn into the storage tank. By doing this, vacuum within the storage tank may be relieved under some conditions, such as low ammonia generation during urea supply to the exhaust system.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5B-D</figref> illustrate various modes for purging second storage device <b>230</b>. In particular, ammonia purged from second storage device <b>230</b> may be introduced to the storage tank, drawn into the combustion chamber through the intake manifold, and/or released into exhaust system <b>71</b> as described herein. Further, atmospheric valve <b>520</b> may be configured to open such that atmospheric air may be introduced into second storage device <b>230</b> wherein the atmospheric air may be introduced into second storage device <b>230</b> via a pressure differential, such as a venturi device or a pump. As a result atmospheric air exiting second storage device may be at least partially saturated with ammonia vapor that may be dissolved in the urea solution or may reduce NOx produced by the combustion reaction of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In some embodiments, the release of ammonia from second storage device <b>230</b> may be facilitated by heating the atmospheric air prior to introducing the air. For example, emission control system <b>200</b> may include a heating device (not shown) that may be disposed between atmospheric valve <b>520</b> and second storage device <b>230</b>. In another example, emission control system <b>200</b> may route a portion of the hot exhaust such that the atmospheric air may be preheated.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, diagram <b>560</b> describes a mode of purging second storage device that may generally include the flow of ammonia vapor stored in second storage device <b>230</b> to the storage tank such that ammonia may be dissolved in the urea solution. In one embodiment, the flow of ammonia vapor may be facilitated by drawing atmospheric air through atmospheric valve <b>520</b> via a pump. For example, a pump that may be disposed along channel <b>78</b> may route atmospheric air drawn into the reductant management system through valve <b>520</b> to the storage tank where the ammonia may be dissolved into the urea solution. However, the urea solution in the storage tank may become saturated with dissolved ammonia causing elevated ammonia vapor pressures within the tank. As such, the operation mode described by diagram <b>560</b> may be ended so that vapors may again be stored in <b>230</b> based on pressure in <b>200</b>. Also, the storage tank may preferentially be relieved by at least temporarily routing the vapor to second storage device <b>230</b> according to diagram <b>530</b> and/or releasing ammonia from the storage tank according to the modes described by diagram <b>590</b> and diagram <b>595</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, diagram <b>570</b> describes storage device purging operation with a flow path of reductants in reductant management system <b>73</b>, where the flow may generally include the flow of ammonia vapor stored in second storage device <b>230</b> to intake manifold <b>44</b> upstream combustion chamber <b>30</b>. Valve <b>505</b> may be configured to open such that ammonia vapor may be selectively drawn into combustion chamber <b>30</b> to reduce NOx upstream of the catalytic converters or reduce NOx in catalytic converter <b>70</b> or in SCR catalyst <b>72</b> or some combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">During ammonia purge from the reductant management system, urea in the storage tank may generate ammonia causing elevated ammonia vapor pressures within the tank. As such, purging operation may be ended so that vapors may again be stored in <b>230</b> based on pressure in <b>200</b>. Also, the storage tank may preferentially be relieved by at least temporarily routing the vapor to second storage device <b>230</b> according to diagram <b>530</b> and/or releasing ammonia from the reductant management system as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, diagram <b>580</b> describes storage device purging operation with a flow path of reductants in reductant management system <b>73</b>, where the flow may generally include the flow of ammonia vapor stored in second storage device <b>230</b> to exhaust system <b>71</b>. Again, atmospheric valve <b>520</b> may be configured to open such that atmospheric air may be introduced into second storage device <b>230</b> wherein the atmospheric air may be introduced into second storage device <b>230</b> via a pressure differential, such as a venturi device at the entry point of ammonia vapor into exhaust system <b>71</b> or a pump.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>, diagram <b>590</b> describes a storage tank purge with a reductant flow path in reductant management system <b>73</b> where the flow may generally include the flow of ammonia vapor stored in the storage tank to exhaust system <b>71</b>. Specifically, atmospheric valve <b>510</b> may be configured to open such that atmospheric air may be introduced into the storage tank to relieve vacuum caused by the release of ammonia from the storage tank to exhaust system <b>71</b> for the selective and catalytic reduction of NOx or due to temperature changes.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring specifically to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5F</figref>, diagram <b>595</b> describes a storage tank purge with a reductant flow path in reductant management system <b>73</b> where the flow may generally include the flow of ammonia vapor stored in the storage tank to intake manifold <b>44</b> upstream combustion chamber <b>30</b>. Valve <b>507</b> may be configured to open such that ammonia vapor may be selectively drawn into combustion chamber <b>30</b> to non-catalytically reduce NOx upstream the catalytic converters or reduce NOx in catalytic converter <b>70</b> or in SCR catalyst <b>72</b> or some combination thereof. The addition of urea and ammonia (or any other suitable reductant) to an engine and/or exhaust system as disclosed herein may be performed in a variety of manners. For example, controller <b>12</b> may include executable code to control the addition of suitable amounts of reductants to an engine and/or exhaust system via any suitable system components, including but not limited to valves, pumps, injectors, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some embodiments the system may be configured to control the amounts added in response to feedback control. For example, in some embodiments, controller <b>12</b> may adjust amounts of the first reductant and the second reductant added to the exhaust system based upon feedback received from sensor <b>124</b>. In some embodiments, sensor <b>124</b> may be an ammonia sensor. In other embodiments, controller <b>12</b> may adjust amounts of the reductants based upon feedback from sensor <b>122</b> where sensor <b>122</b> may be a NOx sensor <b>640</b>, for example. Further, in yet other embodiments, both an ammonia sensor and a NOx sensor may be employed, along with any other suitable sensor or sensors. In yet other embodiments, controller <b>12</b> may be configured to determine concentrations of NOx based upon engine operating conditions, and/or may be configured to estimate a concentration of ammonia added to the exhaust system from second storage device <b>230</b> based upon variables such as a flow rate of air through the second storage device, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, one exemplary embodiment of a method <b>600</b> for managing the addition of a plurality of reductants to an exhaust system is shown. Method <b>600</b> may be implemented in a variety of ways, for example, in some embodiments method <b>600</b> may be implemented by the execution of code stored on controller <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Method <b>600</b> first includes determining, at <b>610</b>, a concentration of NOx in the exhaust gases in exhaust system <b>71</b>. Examples for determining the NOx concentration include, but are not limited to, receiving a signal from a NOx sensor, and/or determining an estimated NOx concentration from engine operating conditions such as speed and load. Further, the amount of NOx may be estimated in various forms, such as a level of NOx, a NOx concentration, and/or a NOx rate mass per volume of flow.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, method <b>600</b> includes determining, at <b>620</b>, whether an ammonia purge from second storage device <b>230</b> is requested. Various conditions or events may be used to determine when to request an ammonia purge. Examples include, but are not limited to, requesting a purge when a pressure of ammonia in second storage device <b>230</b> exceeds a threshold pressure, requesting a purge after a predetermined engine operating interval (for example, a time interval or a number of engine cycles), requesting a purge when engine operating conditions provide an opportunity to purge, and/or requesting a purge when an amount of reductant stored in <b>230</b> reaches a predetermined level, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">If no ammonia purge is requested, then method <b>600</b> proceeds to <b>630</b> where an amount of urea to add to the exhaust is determined, and then to <b>640</b> where the determined amount of urea is added to the exhaust via <b>75</b>, for example. An amount of urea to add to the exhaust may be determined in a variety of ways. In some embodiments, controller <b>12</b> may receive an input from a NOx sensor indicating a concentration of NOx in the exhaust gases, and controller <b>12</b> may then determine and/or adjust from this input an amount of urea to add to the exhaust. In other embodiments, a concentration of NOx in the exhaust may be estimated from engine operating conditions, and a correlating amount of urea may be added to the exhaust system. In yet other embodiments, urea may be added to the exhaust system at a constant rate. The amount of ammonia to be added for a selected sensor input or engine operating condition may be calculated, or may be predetermined and stored in a look-up table on controller <b>12</b> and adjusted based on input operating conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">On the other hand, if an ammonia purge is requested, then method <b>600</b> proceeds to <b>650</b>, at which ammonia is added to the exhaust system and a purge is performed. In some embodiments, controller <b>12</b> may control or adjust the rate of ammonia addition to the exhaust system, for example, by controlling a flow of ammonia into the exhaust system based on sensor <b>124</b>. Alternatively, ammonia may be added at a preselected rate.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">As described above, in some embodiments, ammonia may be added to the exhaust system exclusive of any urea. In other embodiments, ammonia from the second storage device may be added to the exhaust system simultaneously with urea. Where ammonia from the second storage device is added to the exhaust system simultaneously with urea, method <b>600</b> may include determining and/or providing, at <b>660</b>, a reduced amount of urea added to the exhaust system to accommodate the added ammonia while avoiding ammonia slip, and then adding the determined amount of urea to the exhaust system at <b>670</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The reduced amount of urea to be added to the exhaust system may be determined in a variety of ways. For example, controller <b>12</b> may determine the reduced amount of urea to be added to the exhaust by determining an amount or concentration of ammonia added to the exhaust system and also determining an amount or concentration of NOx in the exhaust gases from engine <b>10</b>, and then determining how much urea to add to completely reduce all NOx in the exhaust gases. The amount of urea to add may be calculated from a function or functions derived from the NOx reduction reaction stoichiometries, or may be determined via a look-up table stored on controller <b>12</b>. In this way, the amount of urea to be added to the exhaust may be adjusted in response to variation in an amount or concentration of ammonia added to the exhaust system, and/or variation in an amount or concentration of NOx in the exhaust gases from engine <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Reductant management system <b>73</b> may selectively introduce reductants upstream, at, and/or downstream of combustion chamber <b>30</b> before entering SCR catalyst <b>72</b>. In particular, controller <b>12</b> may prompt an ammonia purge based on various conditions. For example, controller <b>12</b> may prompt storage device to purge in response to the ammonia concentration in second storage device <b>230</b>. As such, ammonia may be introduced to intake manifold <b>44</b> and/or exhaust system <b>71</b> to reduce NOx. Alternately, ammonia may be routed to the storage tank to be dissolved in the urea solution. Ammonia may be introduced to various regions of the system, such as to the storage tank, intake manifold, and/or the exhaust system based on a variety of conditions, including exhaust temperature, engine combustion temperature, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is another flowchart <b>700</b> of an embodiment that illustrates controlling the region where ammonia may be introduced based on various conditions, such as temperature. As such, controller <b>12</b> may determine if an ammonia purge may be enabled at <b>710</b>, otherwise the routine ends. An ammonia purge may be enabled in response to various feedback signals from controller <b>12</b> as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Next, method <b>700</b> includes determining, at <b>720</b>, various conditions in order to select a mode of ammonia purge at <b>730</b>. In some embodiments, exhaust temperature may be used. In particular, an output signal from one or more temperature sensors, or temperature estimates, may identify the temperature at various regions of the system. For example, the operating temperature of the combustion chamber may be identified. In another example, the exhaust temperature may be identified. In yet another example, the temperature of the urea storage tank may be identified. In other embodiments, operating conditions of engine <b>10</b> may be identified, such as engine speed and/or load. Under some conditions, such as at various engine speeds or loads, ammonia may not be injected to combustion chamber <b>30</b></p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Accordingly, at <b>730</b>, a mode of ammonia purge may be selected based on various conditions as described herein. In one embodiment, the temperature of combustion chamber <b>30</b> may be in a range of temperatures such that ammonia may reduce NOx in the combustion chamber. For example, controller <b>12</b> may prompt an ammonia purge from second storage device <b>230</b> to intake manifold <b>44</b> in response to an output signal from a temperature sensor in combustion chamber <b>30</b> where the temperature may indicate conditions suitable for non-catalytic reduction of NOx by ammonia. In another embodiment, the temperature in SCR catalyst <b>72</b> may be suitable for high NOx conversion therein. For example, controller <b>12</b> may prompt an ammonia purge to exhaust system <b>71</b> in response to an output signal from a temperature sensor in SCR catalyst <b>72</b>. In yet another embodiment, various conditions in the urea storage tank may be suitable to dissolve ammonia into the aqueous urea solution. For example, the storage tank may reach relatively cool temperatures at some time after an engine shutdown such that ammonia purged from second storage tank <b>230</b> may be substantially dissolved in the urea solution. In another example, controller <b>12</b> may prompt an ammonia purge to the storage take in response to an output signal from a concentration sensor indicating a concentration of the urea solution suitable for high solubility of ammonia.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this way, it may be possible to control reductant addition to the exhaust during a variety of conditions, and manage purging of ammonia vapors along with separate reductant delivery to achieved improved NOx reduction and reduce ammonia slip.</p>
