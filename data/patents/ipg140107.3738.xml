<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2007-0061258 filed on Jun. 21, 2007, in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects of the invention relate to a method of driving an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display device, and more particularly to a method of driving a time-division grayscale OLED display device that can prevent false contours and flickers from occurring at an interface between neighboring grayscales when displaying a moving image.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A flat panel display device (FPD) is a display device that has largely superseded a cathode-ray tube (CRT) display device because the FPD is fabricated to be lightweight and thin. Typical examples of the FPD are a liquid crystal display device (LCD) and an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display device. Compared to the LCD, the OLED display device has a higher luminance and a wider viewing angle, and can be made thinner because the OLED display device does not require a backlight.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the OLED display device, electrons and holes are injected into an organic thin layer through a cathode and an anode and recombine in the organic thin layer to generate excitons, thereby emitting light of a certain wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">OLED display devices may be classified into a passive matrix type and an active matrix type depending on how N&#xd7;M pixels arranged in a matrix are driven. An active matrix type OLED display device includes a circuit using a thin film transistor (TFT) to drive the pixels. A passive matrix type OLED display device can be fabricated using a simple process since anodes and cathodes are merely formed to cross each other to form a matrix of pixels in a display region. However, the passive matrix type OLED display device is applied only to low-resolution, small-sized display devices because it has a limited resolution, requires a high driving voltage, and its materials have short lifetimes. In contrast, in the active matrix type OLED display device, a TFT is provided in each pixel in a display region. Thus, a constant amount of current can be supplied to each pixel so that the active matrix type OLED display device can emit light with a stable luminance. Also, since the active matrix type OLED display device has a low power consumption, the active matrix type OLED display device can be applied to high-resolution, large-sized display devices.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Conventionally, an OLED display device displays a plurality of grayscales using a time-division method that divides a single frame into a plurality of sub-frames corresponding to bits of driving data and having different brightness ratios, and turns pixels on or off during the sub-frames according to the grayscale to be displayed. However, when sequential images, such as moving images, are displayed at a high speed, the emission times of neighboring grayscales become out of sequence due to the properties of human vision. Thus, false contours, which are generated by perceiving the images at a higher or lower grayscale level than the displayed grayscale, and flickering images (or flickers) occur.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Aspects of the invention relate to a method of driving an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display device using a time-division driving method that can prevent the occurrence of false contours and flickers when displaying sequential images, such as moving images, at a high speed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Reference will now be made in detail to embodiments of the invention, examples of which are shown in the accompanying drawings, wherein like reference numerals refer to like elements throughout. The embodiments are described below in order to explain the invention by referring to the figures.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram of the configuration of an organic light emitting diode (OLED) display device according to an aspect of the invention, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram of a pixel of the OLED display device of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to an aspect of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the OLED display device includes a display panel <b>100</b> having a plurality of pixels <b>130</b>, a data driver <b>110</b> for applying a driving data signal to the display panel <b>100</b> through data lines D<b>1</b> to Dm, and a scan driver <b>120</b> for applying a scan signal to the display panel <b>100</b> through scan lines S<b>1</b> to Sn.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Each of the pixels <b>130</b> includes an organic light emitting diode EL interposed between a first power supply voltage line VDD and a second power supply voltage line VSS, a driving transistor Td interposed between the organic light emitting diode EL and the first power supply voltage line VDD, a switching transistor Ts interposed between a gate terminal of the driving transistor Td and the data line Dm, and a capacitor C interposed between the gate terminal of the driving transistor Td and the first power supply voltage line VDD.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The switching transistor Ts is turned on or off in response to a scan signal applied through the scan line Sn, and when it is turned on, it transmits the driving data signal through the data line Dm to the gate terminal of the driving transistor Td. The driving transistor Td is turned on or off in response to the driving data signal transmitted by the switching transistor Ts, and when it is turned on, it supplies a driving current to the organic light emitting diode EL. The driving data signal is composed of a plurality of bits, and a grayscale displayed by the organic light emitting diode EL is determined by brightness ratios of a plurality of sub-frames corresponding to the bits of the driving data. For example, the driving data signal may be composed of 8 bits, and there may be 8 sub-frames corresponding to the 8 bits having brightness ratios of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128, enabling 256 grayscales of 0 to 255 to be displayed. In such an example, a driving data signal of 10010011, where the left-most bit is the most significant bit, would represent a grayscale of 128+16+2+1=147. The different brightness ratios may be provided by providing sub-frames having different time lengths. For example, a sub-frame having a brightness ratio of 128 may have a time length that is 128 times long as a time length of a sub-frame having a brightness ratio of 1. However, it is understood that other numbers of bits, other numbers of sub-frames, other brightness ratios, other orders of brightness ratios, and other methods of providing the different brightness ratios may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a timing diagram of a method of driving an OLED display device according to an aspect of the invention when 8-bit driving data is used to display <b>256</b> grayscales.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a single frame is divided into an odd-numbered field in which a plurality of pixels connected to odd-numbered scan lines S<b>1</b> to Sn&#x2212;1 are driven, and an even-numbered field in which a plurality of pixels connected to even-numbered scan lines S<b>2</b> to Sn are driven, and the odd-numbered field and the even-numbered field are sequentially driven.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each of the odd-numbered field and the even-numbered field is divided into a first sub-frame group and a second sub-frame group, and some of a plurality of sub-frames corresponding to bits of driving data are divided into two divided sub-frame portions that are disposed in the first sub-frame group and the second sub-frame group. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there are 8 sub-frames SF<b>1</b> to SF<b>8</b> respectively corresponding to the 8 bits of the driving data, with SF<b>1</b> corresponding to a least significant bit, and SF<b>8</b> corresponding to a most significant bit.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Similarly, in the even-numbered field, the sub-frames SF<b>5</b>, SF<b>6</b>, SF<b>7</b>, and SF<b>8</b> are divided into two divided sub-frame portions SF<b>5</b><i>c </i>and SF<b>5</b><i>d</i>; SF<b>6</b><i>c </i>and SF<b>6</b><i>d</i>; SF<b>7</b><i>c </i>and SF<b>7</b><i>d</i>; and SF<b>8</b><i>c </i>and SF<b>8</b><i>d</i>.
