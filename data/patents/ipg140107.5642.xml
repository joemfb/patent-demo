No. 12/169,306, filed Jul. 8, 2008, incorporated by reference herein, which is a continuation of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/155,697, filed May 24, 2002, also incorporated by reference herein.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to searching for information over a computer network, and, more specifically, the invention relates to techniques for personalized and adaptive search services.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Computer networks used for knowledge searching and retrieval are well known. For example, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,873,080 to Coden et al., issued on Feb. 16, 1999; U.S. Pat. No. 5,875,446 to Brown et al., issued on Feb. 23, 1999; U.S. Pat. No. 5,913,208 to Brown et al., issued Jun. 15, 1999; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,819,265 to Ravin et al., issued on Oct. 6, 1998, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. In all of these patents, a primary purpose is to provide better methods to retrieve relevant documents in response to user queries.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In order to improve relevancy, information is categorized into groups of subjects. The categorization of the text documents is one of the most effective methods to help users organize information. In general, the content of the text document is analyzed to determine the words and phrases that contribute to the context of the document. The document is then associated, based on the context and content, to one or more categories of a given taxonomy. Once the document is associated with a category of a taxonomy, the users can easily navigate within the taxonomy of their interest to find relevant information. The &#x201c;Yahoo!&#x201d; search Web site is designed based on this concept of categorization. Each document is listed under one category or subcategory.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Once the information is categorized based on a taxonomy, the users can narrow their search scope within a category or subcategory. This way they can increase the relevance of the documents that they retrieved. Today, most search Web sites are based on this principle.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The context of the query in general is very important to be able to return the relevant results. As an example, if the word Java is used with the context of a coffee type, then this information must be communicated to the search engine. Otherwise, the search engine would return results out of context such as references to a computer language or a germ or a lyric. One way to associate a context to a query is to look at a user profile. A user profile contains a set of categories or a taxonomy that identifies user interests. When the user forms a query, it can be associated to one or more categories, which helps to determine and possibly expand the context of the query.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The amount of information published over the Internet grew so rapidly that it became very difficult to find the information. In order to make the searching of Internet content more practical, categorization of the Web content was proposed. The unstructured Web content was categorized by using specific taxonomies. Today, for many search engines, users are expected to know and select the category for the information that they look for. In general, the categories are organized in a tree structure. There are seven to 15 main categories, such as Art, Business, Computers, Education, Entertainment, and the other subcategories are organized under these main categories. In order to cover the information space properly, seven to 15,000 subcategories were proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For a user who has a very specific area of interest, these categories are less than useful at times. For instance, a category that is useful to a particular user may be either too specific to belong to a general taxonomy or will make navigation difficult for the user, as the user might have to navigate through much of a taxonomy tree. As an example, the category &#x201c;Think Pad Model 600&#x201d; is a very specific category which is not part of a general taxonomy. One other problem of generalized taxonomy trees is the fact that these trees are ever growing and constantly need pruning. Consequently, new categories are added in time, and old categories are deleted. Users are expected to keep up with the changing taxonomy trees as they perform their searches. Yet another problem is that not all users are familiar with the categorization scheme. It takes an effort on behalf of the users to navigate through the taxonomy tree and find the information searched for within that category. This can cause, among other problems, a lack of returned information.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Metasearch systems help to alleviate the problem of insufficient returned information. A metasearch system is not a search engine but a system that merges results from a multitude of search engines. Thus, in the case of metasearch systems, a query is sent to a multitude of information sources and the results are grouped and merged. While a metasearch system retrieves more information, at the same time, the amount of returned information can be overwhelming.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, a need still exists for allowing users to search through a massive amount of information, yet provide users with more meaningful results than currently presented to the user when searching for information.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Aspects of the present invention improve upon conventional information search techniques by automatically selecting information sources that are most relevant to user queries. This is done by analyzing results of searches returned by information sources for queries and by ranking the information sources based on this analysis. The information sources that have high rankings for a query are subsequently used to search for relevant results for that query. In other words, information sources can be selected based on their rankings for a particular query. This process can be adaptive, as the returned results of old queries can be analyzed at a later date to update the ranking of the information sources, automatic searches can be performed to update the ranking of the information sources, new queries can be used for analysis and stored, new information sources added, and old information sources deleted.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Additionally, aspects of the present invention use an electronic library, referred to as a &#x201c;linguistic library&#x201d; herein, that is useful for storing personal categories for one or more users. Each personal category is associated with corresponding keywords and ranked lists of information sources. The personal categories help to expand a user query and to relate a user query to the ranked information sources. The library can also contain general categories, taxonomies, and dictionaries used to help broaden and interpret user queries. A user can interact with the linguistic library to select an appropriate modified query that is based on his or her original query and includes information determined from the linguistic library. Alternatively, the user can submit his or her original query.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention allows a user query to be categorized into a number of categories, where each category is associated with a ranked list of information sources. The categories effectively allow a user query to be &#x201c;expanded&#x201d; into a number of keywords that can be used as query terms. The categories also allow a user to navigate information instead of or in addition to writing his or her own user query. The categories, in one aspect of the invention, also contain a ranked list of information sources. To rank the information sources, a query that comprises a number of keywords is sent to each information source. The set of returned results from an information source is used to determine a ranking. The ranking is then used to search specific information sources with a user query that corresponds to the category. Generally, a specific user query is sent to only the highest ranking information sources. However, the user has the ability to override this. The results presented to the user generally come from a subset of all the information sources.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, there are personal and general categories. The personal categories are entered through interaction by the user with a linguistic library, and generally when the user is performing his or her searches. The general categories are categories that are pre-loaded. The general categories thus provide a user with an already available source of query terms for many queries.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In one embodiment of the invention, new user queries are generated, information sources are queried, and information sources are ranked based results returned against new user queries. The ranking in this embodiment is performed &#x201c;offline,&#x201d; so that the user experiences no slow down in functionality. The new user query may be based on a previously entered user query, which is given its own personal category or is related to a general category. If the user enters a user query that has no corresponding category, then it is beneficial to associate a category to the query. Once a category is associated with the query, then the corresponding keywords and the ranked list of information sources are also associated with the query. A linguistic library is used to find associated categories for queries that are not already categorized. Users may choose to interact with the linguistic library to determine the personal or general category of a query. The linguistic library may return one or more personal or general categories in order for the query to be categorized. This is done by using dictionaries specific to the domain of interest. The user may decide which category is the most appropriate. Optionally, the user may decide to send his or her original query, without any data from the linguistic library. In this situation, in one embodiment of the present invention, the query is treated as a metasearch and results are returned from all information sources.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Ranking the information sources generally takes place offline, as retrieving and ranking documents can take a measurable amount of time and may interfere with the speed experienced by the user. Additionally, if a user has added keywords to a category or modified a category in some other way, it is beneficial to again query the information sources and again determine rankings for the information sources. Furthermore, queries may be generated automatically from the keywords that represent a category to determine the rank of an information source. The keywords are sent to information sources and the returned results are analyzed for rankings. Each category is associated with a number of keywords, and the query is determined from the keywords corresponding to the category. Categories may be added, deleted, or modified, and information sources may be added, deleted, or modified.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The present invention overcomes a problem with metasearch systems. As explained previously, a metasearch system sends a query to a multitude of information sources and the results are grouped and merged. The results are either arranged based on the original scores of the documents or are grouped based on the search engine. If the relevance of these information sources and their categories to the query is not known, the returned results are usually not satisfactory. By ranking the information sources, the present invention has the ability to return a higher percentage of relevant documents to the user in a faster fashion. In other words, embodiments of the present invention can determine that several information sources return more relevant documents. If these information sources are searched first, then the results placed highest in a list of returned documents will generally be more pertinent than the results obtained by the metasearch system.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Additionally, the arrangement by original scores, where an &#x201c;original score&#x201d; is a score an information source gives to a document, is not effective as it could be. In particular, original scores are based on scoring systems from each of the information sources. As many information sources use different document ranking schemes, then uniformity of scoring is not guaranteed. For instance, a document given a score of &#x201c;90&#x201d; by one information source may be only given a score of &#x201c;50&#x201d; by another document source. Moreover, as the information sources themselves are not ranked by a metasearch system, there is generally wasted effort. In particular, if it is known, using the techniques of the present invention, that three information sources give excellent results for a particular query, then sending a query to information sources other than the three information sources could be considered wasted effort, as the results from the other sources are likely to be less relevant.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The user generally will be given the ability to control how results are viewed. The results could be viewed on one window by ranked information sources or by using rankings, provided by each information source, for pages within the returned results from the sources, or could be viewed so that each ranked source is in a separate window. There are additional options known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> is shown interacting with a variety of information sources <b>180</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>180</b>-N (collectively, information sources <b>180</b>) and interacting with a user <b>103</b> through user interface <b>105</b>. Personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> comprises a personal query manager <b>110</b>, a query generator <b>120</b>, adapter interface <b>130</b>, document retriever <b>140</b>, document analyzer <b>150</b>, information source analyzer <b>160</b>, linguistic library <b>170</b>, and personal query manager <b>110</b>. Adapter interface <b>130</b> comprises a number of adapters <b>135</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>135</b>-K (collectively, adapters <b>135</b>). It should be noted that the blocks that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are demarcated as such merely for exposition. The blocks themselves may be combined or even further divided, through techniques known to those skilled in the art. For instance, the blocks information source analyzer <b>160</b> and document analyzer <b>150</b> may be combined into a single functional equivalent of the two blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Information sources <b>180</b> are any type of information sources available, such as Internet databases, Internet search engines, or public or private databases. Any electronic repository of information that can be searched by sending a query and receiving a response can be an information source <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">User <b>103</b> interacts with personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> through user interface <b>105</b>. User interface <b>105</b> can comprise a monitor, keyboard, mouse, and other devices suitable for interacting with a computer system. In this embodiment, the personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> is a computer system or perhaps a server that the user interface <b>105</b> interacts with through a networked computer or a dumb terminal. Additionally, the user interface <b>105</b> may comprise a hand-held computer, Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), or cellular phone that access the personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> through a radio frequency network interface or hardwired network interface. Additionally, personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> may reside in a PDA or the like. User interface <b>105</b> can comprise any device suitable for communicating information from a user to a computer system.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In one embodiment of the present invention, there are two basic modes of operation for personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b>: an &#x201c;online&#x201d; mode and an &#x201c;offline&#x201d; mode. In the online mode, a user <b>103</b> creates requests <b>106</b> and receives results <b>143</b> through the user interface <b>105</b>. In this mode, the requests <b>106</b> can be expanded by the linguistic library <b>170</b> to include additional keywords and search terms (not shown) and include a ranked list (not shown) of information sources <b>180</b> to use. The ranked list can include rankings of all of the information sources <b>180</b> or optionally only a number of the highest ranking information sources <b>180</b>. The number of highest ranking information sources <b>180</b> can be user selectable. Additionally, the ranked list can be passed to personal query manager <b>110</b>, which can then determine, through user preferences or other criteria, how many of the information sources <b>180</b> are selected. Generally, this selection will be done on ranking, so that a number of highest ranking information sources <b>180</b> are used, but other criteria, such as Internet download speeds, could be used. Moreover, the user <b>103</b> can enter in a request <b>106</b> and the personal query manager <b>110</b> can, by accessing linguistic library <b>170</b>, determine an expanded query <b>171</b> based on information in the linguistic library <b>170</b>. This expanded query is shown to the user through feedback <b>107</b>. The user can accept this expanded query, modify it, or use the original query. Thus, feedback <b>107</b> provides an opportunity for the user to interact with the personal query manager <b>110</b> and linguistic library <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the offline mode, the personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> will communicate a number of queries to the information sources <b>180</b> and will then rank the information sources <b>180</b>. The queries sent to the information sources <b>180</b> are the keywords associated with different categories stored in linguistic library <b>170</b>. This way, a ranked list of relevant information sources <b>180</b> is obtained for each category. This offline mode can be adaptive, as the linguistic library <b>170</b> can automatically send keywords corresponding to categories to the personal query manager <b>110</b>, which then provides queries, through personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b>, to information sources <b>180</b>. The returned results from searches on the information sources <b>180</b> can then be ranked and the rankings stored in linguistic library <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the present specification, it will be assumed that personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> has both offline and online modes, although it should be understood that these modes can be combined into a single mode where information sources are ranked with each query of one or more information sources <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the online mode, the user <b>103</b> sends a user request <b>106</b>, through user interface <b>105</b>, to the personal query manager <b>110</b>. The user request <b>106</b> contains a description of a category or topic that the user is interested in, a user query, or both. Descriptions of categories and the categories themselves are stored in linguistic library <b>170</b>, which is described below in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. Generally, the user <b>103</b> will be using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in the user interface <b>105</b>, which will allow the user <b>103</b> to type in a user query or a description of a category, or select a category. Categories are used to determine the context of a query. For instance, if a user query, in request <b>106</b>, is &#x201c;java,&#x201d; it is sent to the linguistic library <b>170</b> for further analysis. The linguistic library <b>170</b> may have multiple categories associated with the query &#x201c;java,&#x201d; such as &#x201c;computer language,&#x201d; &#x201c;islands of Indonesia,&#x201d; &#x201c;types of coffee.&#x201d; If the user has previously used this query within the context of &#x201c;computer language,&#x201d; then only &#x201c;computer languages&#x201d; is returned as the category. Otherwise, the user is asked to select from multiple categories and his selection is stored in his personal profile in <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The personal query manager <b>110</b> takes the request <b>106</b> and generates a modified query <b>111</b> from input from the linguistic library <b>170</b>. The linguistic library <b>170</b> uses the request <b>106</b> and, through techniques described in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, expands the request <b>106</b> into an expanded query <b>171</b>. Modified and expanded queries are discussed in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">If the request <b>106</b> is already associated with one of the personal or general categories that are stored in the linguistic library <b>170</b>, then the query generator <b>120</b> sends a query to a certain number of information sources <b>180</b>. Generally, only a number of the highest ranking information sources <b>180</b> are used to perform the search. However, it is possible to send the query to all of the information sources <b>180</b> and then use the ranking for each of the information sources <b>180</b> to determine which results are displayed or the order in which results are displayed. The document retriever <b>140</b> retrieves the results, performs any formatting or other modifications, and sends the formatted results <b>143</b> back to the user <b>103</b> through user interface <b>105</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to retrieve relevant results, a user query is associated with a category. If there is a match between a user query and a category, then the keywords associated with the category are used to search. If there is no match, then the user interacts with the linguistic library <b>170</b> to determine an appropriate category. The details of generating query terms specific to a user category are discussed in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. If an appropriate category, either a user category or a general category, does not exist, then the personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> acts like a metasearch device, in that personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> sends the user query to each of the information sources <b>180</b> and returns the results to the user <b>103</b> through returned results <b>143</b>. Additionally, the user may choose to not interact with information sources <b>180</b> or may choose to have the personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> act as a metasearch device, regardless of whether or not an appropriate category can be found.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In offline mode, personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> operates as follows. The personal query manager <b>110</b> will send a number of queries to the information sources <b>180</b>. Each query generally comprises, as shown more particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one or more keywords. A query is sent to the query generator <b>120</b>, which performs formatting specific to each of the information sources <b>180</b>. Some information sources <b>180</b> may allow character strings to be sent to them as queries; other may require a specific format. The query generator <b>120</b> performs any needed formatting. Thus, the query generator <b>120</b> might create several different final queries <b>121</b>, which are then directed to the appropriate information sources <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Adapters <b>130</b> is a central location used to store a number of adapters <b>135</b>. Each adapter <b>135</b> is adapted to interact with one or more information sources <b>180</b>. Each adapter <b>135</b> performs low level communication with an information source <b>180</b>. For example, the adapter <b>135</b>-<b>1</b> could be an adapter for use with a database on the Internet, and the adapter <b>135</b>-<b>1</b> would open and close communications with the information source <b>180</b> using protocols specific to the information source <b>180</b>. Usually, there will be fewer adapters <b>135</b> than information sources <b>180</b>, as many information sources <b>180</b> will use the same protocols. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, there are K adapters <b>130</b> and N information sources <b>180</b>, where K&#x3c;N. Additionally, there could be an adapter <b>135</b> that exists but no information source <b>180</b> that corresponds to it.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each final query <b>121</b> is transmitted, through adapters <b>135</b> to the N information sources <b>180</b>. Each information source <b>180</b> returns results <b>136</b>. The document retriever <b>140</b> keeps track of the results. In particular, the document retriever <b>140</b> catalogs results from each of the information sources <b>180</b>. The cataloging by the document retriever <b>140</b> includes, in one embodiment, for each document, a title and a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). Any technique for allowing a system to access the document may be used by the document retriever <b>140</b>. Additionally, the number of documents returned by each information sources <b>180</b> is retained. This information is sent to the document analyzer <b>150</b> as returned results <b>141</b>. These returned results may be stored for later analysis, which is used to update the rankings of the information sources. In online mode, this information is also sent to the user as returned results <b>143</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Generally, the returned results <b>141</b>, <b>143</b> will be a list of HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) addresses, possibly along with titles, brief descriptions, and other information. For instance, an exemplary list of three entries in a returned result <b>141</b>, <b>143</b> for the query &#x201c;java and program and language&#x201d; could be the following:</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">1. &#x201c;Language Basics.&#x201d; http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">2. &#x201c;Essentials of the Java&#x2122; Programming Language, Part 1,&#x201d; http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/onlineTraining/Programming/BasicJava1/</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">3. &#x201c;Java&#x2014;Webopedia.com,&#x201d; http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/J/Java.htm</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the above returned results, the titles are &#x201c;Language Basics,&#x201d; &#x201c;Essentials of the Java&#x2122; Programming Language, Part 1,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Java&#x2014;Webopedia.com.&#x201d; The HTTP addresses corresponding to these titles follow the titles. Document retriever <b>140</b> will generally send complete entries in the returned results <b>143</b> to the user <b>103</b>. In other words, the entire entry, including title, HTTP address, and any other information, will be sent.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">It is also possible for the returned results <b>141</b>, <b>143</b> to include the documents themselves, instead of HTTP addresses. It should also be noted that the returned results <b>141</b>, <b>143</b> can include scores created by the information sources <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The document analyzer <b>150</b> analyzes the documents by determining a score for each document. The query is used to determine the score for a document. The score is determined through techniques known to those skilled in the art. Such techniques are described in Selberg, &#x201c;Towards Comprehensive Web Search,&#x201d; Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Washington (1999); Howe and Dreilinger, &#x201c;Savvy-Search: A Meta-Search Engine that Learns which Search Engine to Query,&#x201d; AI Magazine, 18(2) (1997); Lawrence and Giles, &#x201c;Inquirus, the NECI meta search engine,&#x201d; Seventh Intl World Wide Web Conference, Australia, 95-105 (1998), the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. By using a single technique to score documents for each of the information sources <b>180</b>, there is uniformity of scoring for each of the information sources <b>180</b>. For instance, it is possible to use scores from the information sources <b>180</b> themselves to perform the scoring. However, the techniques used to score documents for each information source <b>180</b> will likely differ, and some information sources <b>180</b> may not use any scoring mechanisms. Thus, using the same technique to score each document provides uniform scoring. It should be noted that two or more techniques may be used to score documents, and scores from each technique can be combined, such as through an average. However, each technique can take a measurable and sometimes substantial amount of time. Consequently, using only one technique is suitable for most applications.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The document analyzer <b>150</b> sends data <b>151</b> about an information source to information source analyzer <b>160</b>. The data <b>151</b> comprises a list of document scores and a total number of returned documents for each information source <b>180</b>. Information source analyzer <b>160</b> analyzes the scores and total number of returned documents and ranks sources. Exemplary analysis techniques are described below in more detail in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 6</figref>. The information source analyzer <b>160</b> sends the ranked list <b>161</b> of information sources <b>180</b> to the linguistic library <b>170</b>, along with the associated query and category. When the linguistic library <b>170</b> receives the ranked list of information sources <b>180</b> through link <b>161</b>, the linguistic library <b>170</b> updates the category with the ranked list <b>161</b> of information sources <b>180</b>, as described below in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Thus, in offline mode, the personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> ranks information sources <b>180</b> so that future requests <b>106</b> by a user will be transmitted, in online mode, to more appropriate information sources <b>180</b>. The personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> identifies the most relevant information sources <b>180</b> for most, if not all, requests <b>106</b> by a user.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Although reference numerals <b>106</b>, <b>107</b>, <b>111</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>121</b>, <b>136</b>, <b>141</b>, <b>151</b>, <b>161</b>, and <b>171</b> have been primarily described by the data passing through these &#x201c;links,&#x201d; it is not necessary to have any type of hardware implementation for these links. For instance, link <b>161</b> simply indicates that data is passed between modules. The actual link <b>161</b> could simply be a reference to an object or memory location, as is known in the art. Any mechanism suitable for passing data may be used as a link. Moreover, multiple types of data can pass through any link.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">It should be noted that personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> could be implemented as a &#x201c;plug in&#x201d; to a browser or similar software. In this configuration, the personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> would operate largely at a remote site out of sight for most users.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Before turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is worthwhile to provide an example. If a user enters the request <b>106</b> of &#x201c;java,&#x201d; then, as discussed above, the personal query manager <b>110</b> will access the linguistic library <b>170</b> to determine if there are any suitable categories for this request <b>106</b>. The user <b>103</b> can then be presented with categories such as &#x201c;computer language,&#x201d; &#x201c;islands of Indonesia,&#x201d; and &#x201c;types of coffee.&#x201d; If the user <b>103</b> select &#x201c;computer language,&#x201d; the fact that the user selected this category and not another category may be stored in linguistic library <b>170</b>, particularly in the user profile/preferences (described below). Once the user selects a category, the linguistic library <b>170</b> will provide keywords associated with that category. Alternatively, the keywords could be provided at the same time as the categories are provided. The keywords could include, for example, lava, &#x201c;program,&#x201d; &#x201c;language,&#x201d; and &#x201c;computer.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">These keywords are sent to personal query manager <b>110</b>, which allows the user <b>103</b> to modify or add to these keywords, if desired. It will be assumed, for sake of simplicity, that the user <b>103</b> does not modify the keywords. The keywords are sent to the query generator <b>120</b>, which then formats one final query <b>121</b> as &#x201c;java program language computer,&#x201d; where the boolean operation &#x201c;and&#x201d; or &#x201c;or&#x201d; is assumed to occur between words. Another final query <b>121</b> may be formatted by query generator <b>120</b> as &#x201c;java and program and language and computer.&#x201d; Each of these final queries <b>121</b> is directed to an appropriate adapter <b>135</b>, which then directs the final query to one or more information sources <b>180</b>. Results <b>136</b> are returned to document retriever <b>140</b>, which collects the results <b>136</b>, organizes them by source (if desired), and sends them to user <b>143</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">If the user decides to not select a category and just sends the request <b>106</b> as &#x201c;java,&#x201d; then this query is passed through the personal query manager <b>110</b>, to the query generator <b>120</b>, which performs any needed formatting, through the adapters <b>135</b> and to the information sources <b>180</b>. Results <b>136</b> are passed through document retriever <b>140</b>, which collects and organizes the results per information sources <b>180</b> and then sends the organized result list on link <b>143</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">During offline mode, the linguistic library <b>170</b> will pass keywords for each of the categories &#x201c;computer language,&#x201d; &#x201c;islands of Indonesia,&#x201d; and &#x201c;types of coffee&#x201d; to the personal query manager <b>110</b>, which will forward each set of keywords to query generator <b>120</b>, which then formats each query appropriately for the adapters <b>135</b>. The adapters <b>135</b> send the queries to the appropriate information sources <b>180</b>, which return results <b>136</b>. The document retriever <b>140</b> determines how many results are returned for each information sources <b>180</b> and catalogs the results. This data is sent through link <b>141</b> to document analyzer <b>150</b>, which analyzes the documents and scores the relevancy of the documents. The total number of returned documents for each information sources <b>180</b> and scores are sent to information source analyzer <b>160</b>, which determines rankings of the information sources <b>180</b> for each of the queries.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a portion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown in greater detail. Personal query manager <b>110</b> comprises a request handler <b>210</b>, a search utility <b>220</b>, and a query interface generator <b>215</b>. The linguistic library <b>170</b> comprises one or more tables of general categories <b>235</b>, user specific taxonomies <b>240</b>, table of personal categories <b>245</b>, and dictionaries <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A user request <b>106</b>, which could be a user category description, category, or query, is sent to request handler <b>210</b>. The request <b>106</b> is received by the request handler <b>210</b>, which parses the user description and sends the parsed terms to the linguistic resources library <b>170</b> via search utility <b>220</b> and link <b>112</b>. The search utility <b>220</b> finds the related terms and categories associated with the description or query in the request <b>106</b> as well as the most relevant information sources <b>180</b> that should be searched against the request <b>106</b>. Additionally, the search utility <b>220</b> can find personal preferences stored in user profile/preferences <b>255</b>. A search of the general categories <b>235</b> yields categories that have the same keywords or description as the user request <b>106</b>. User specific taxonomies <b>240</b> are classifications specific to the user. A search of these will yield classifications used to broaden the request <b>106</b>. A dictionary <b>250</b> provides definitions that may be used to broaden the request <b>106</b> or used to associate categories with the user request <b>106</b>. It should be noted that a dictionary can contain thesaurus information. A table suitable for general categories <b>235</b> and personal categories <b>245</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">If the search by the search utility <b>220</b> returns at least one category and associated information sources <b>180</b>, then this information is used to retrieve relevant documents. The linguistic library <b>170</b> generates terms related to the request <b>106</b> and returns the terms back to the personal query manager <b>110</b> through link <b>171</b>. An expanded query is created by search utility <b>220</b> and linguistic library <b>170</b> and terms for the expanded query, or the expanded query itself, are passed through link <b>171</b> and shown to the user through link <b>107</b>. At this point, user <b>105</b> may choose to modify these terms before they are submitted to the query generator <b>120</b>. The final version of the keywords and query terms <b>115</b> are then submitted to the query generator <b>120</b>, through query generator interface <b>215</b>, where the adapters <b>170</b> are invoked to submit multiple search requests to various information sources <b>180</b> simultaneously. The query generator interface <b>215</b> sends keywords, or other terms determined from linguistic library <b>170</b>, to the query generator <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an exemplary table of categories <b>300</b> is shown. The table of categories <b>300</b> may be the table of general categories <b>235</b> or the table of personal categories <b>245</b>. As noted above, the personalized and adaptive search service <b>100</b> generally will come with a number of categories in the table of general categories <b>235</b>, and the user (or users) can add his or her own additional categories in the table of personal categories <b>245</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the structure of a table to be used to store and retrieve categories and associated keywords and information sources. In table of categories <b>300</b>, the first column <b>305</b> is for the textual description of the user category, the second column <b>310</b> is for the array of keywords that are associated with the category description, and the last column <b>315</b> is for the list of information sources that are sorted based on their rank and related to the category described in the first column. Category <b>320</b> corresponds to L keywords <b>325</b> and ranked list <b>330</b>; category <b>335</b> corresponds to M keywords <b>340</b> and ranked list <b>345</b>; and category <b>350</b> corresponds to P keywords <b>355</b> and ranked list <b>360</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, there are Z categories.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The user queries and descriptions are first checked against the table of personal categories <b>245</b> and the table of general categories <b>235</b>. If there exists a category, in either of these tables, that is found when compared to a user query or description, then associated information sources in a corresponding ranked list <b>315</b> are used to retrieve information. Otherwise, a new category is created in the table of personal categories <b>245</b> by querying the user as to the textual description of the category and populating another row in the table. The keywords <b>310</b> for the new row in the table of personal categories <b>245</b> come from the table of general categories <b>235</b> and dictionary <b>250</b>. The dictionary is used to determine words related to the newly added textual description of the category. These words are then used to determine similar categories in the table of general categories <b>235</b>, and the keywords for the similar categories from table of general categories <b>235</b> are added to the table of personal categories <b>245</b> as keywords. The newly added keywords are generally shown to the user, who can then determine to add, delete, or modify the keywords.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each ranked list <b>315</b> of information sources <b>180</b> is in order of information source and not ranking. However, the list may be placed in order of ranking if desired. One benefit to having the ranked lists <b>315</b> ordered in order of information source is that it is easier to remove or add sources.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">There are multiple ways of ranking information sources <b>180</b>. One possible way of ranking the information sources <b>180</b> is based on the number of documents returned from each information source <b>180</b>. The information source <b>180</b> that returns more documents is ranked higher than other information sources <b>180</b> that return less number of documents. As an example, source A that returns <b>100</b> documents on one subject is ranked higher than source B that returns <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">However, the relevance of the returned documents is important. Another ranking policy that takes relevancy into consideration works as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Broadly, each document is assigned a relevance score by the source. During the ranking process of method <b>400</b>, a keyword score for a particular keyword can be calculated based on a formula which defines the keyword score as the linear combination of the number of documents and their mean relevancy. Method <b>400</b> determines a keyword score for each keyword and should be run once for each keyword and information source <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Method <b>400</b> begins in step <b>405</b>, when an index and a total score are set to zero. In step <b>410</b>, the index is incremented. In step <b>415</b>, a score of the current document is determined. This score is determined for a particular keyword or query. Generally, the information source analyzer <b>160</b> performs method <b>400</b> and will simply retrieve the score for the document. In other words, the score has already been determined by the document analyzer <b>150</b> for the keyword and the information source analyzer <b>160</b> just retrieves the score. Alternatively, it is possible to have the document analyzer <b>150</b> determine the score in step <b>415</b> and have the document analyzer <b>150</b> provide the score to information source analyzer <b>160</b>. It is also possible to have the information source analyzer <b>160</b> determine the score, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In step <b>420</b>, the current score for the keyword is added to the total document score. In step <b>425</b>, it is determined if there are more documents. If there are more documents, the method <b>400</b> continues in step <b>410</b>, otherwise step <b>430</b> is performed. The loop of steps <b>410</b> through <b>425</b> will create a total document score that is a linear addition of all of the scores for documents that contain a keyword and that are from a single source.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In step <b>430</b>, an average document score is created for the information source by dividing the total score by the number of documents returned. A measure of quality is determined in step <b>435</b> using the following formula:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>a*average document score,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where &#x201c;a&#x201d; is a constant. A measure of quantity is determined in step <b>440</b> by using the following formula:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>b*number of documents returned,<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
where &#x201c;b&#x201d; is another constant. The constants a and b are to be determined depending on the importance of quality or the quantity. If the quality (i.e., relevance) is not important, then b=0; on the other hand, if the quantity (i.e., number of documents) is not important, then a=0. The values of a and b can be determined by users as part of their profile. Here, it is assumed that the document scores retrieved from different sources are normalized. In step <b>445</b>, a keyword score is determined by the following equation:

<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a representation of how information sources are scored and ranked. The information source A is scored based on all the keywords that represent the category of choice. In this example, there are four keywords, keyword, through keyword<sub>4</sub>, for the category being examined. The scores of source A are 50, 76, 55 and 20, for the four keywords, respectively. Each score is determined through method <b>400</b>. Hence, the total score of source A is 201, which is a simple addition of each of the keyword scores, that ranks this source as the 3rd after source B and D. The rank is determined from the source scores; the higher the score, the lower the rank in this example (i.e., lower scores are better).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">More complex analyses may be used in the techniques described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. For instance, weighting may be applied to the scores of each keyword, such that one keyword could be weighted higher than another.
