<p id="p-0046" num="0045">An exemplary embodiment of the invention will be described below with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic structural diagram of an image forming device.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">An image forming device <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> forms an electrostatic latent image on the surface of a photoreceptor, forms a toner image by developing the electrostatic latent image with a toner, and finally transfers the toner image to a paper sheet and fixes the transferred toner image, thereby forming the fixed toner image on the paper sheet. Incidentally, this image forming device <b>100</b> accepts not only a paper recording medium but a resinous recording medium represented by an OHP sheet. However, the following description will be provided by using the paper recording medium as a representative example unless otherwise specified.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, the image forming device <b>100</b> is a tandem type of color printer in which six image forming sections <b>10</b>A, <b>10</b>B, <b>100</b>, <b>10</b>D, <b>10</b>E and <b>10</b>F that respectively form images of mutually different colors are disposed in parallel. The image forming device <b>100</b> is capable of printing a single-colored image in a single-color mode and a color image formed by toner images of plural colors in a full-color mode. For example, among the six image forming sections <b>10</b>A through <b>10</b>F, the four image forming sections <b>100</b>, <b>10</b>D, <b>10</b>E and <b>10</b>F correspond to yellow (Y), magenta (M), cyan (C) and black (K), respectively, and the remaining two image forming sections <b>10</b>A and <b>10</b>B correspond to special colors except these YMCK colors. The special colors include, for example, colors that are not easy to precisely express by the combination of YMCK, such as a color that represents a particular company, pastel colors, and transparent colors for luster. The image forming device <b>100</b> includes six toner cartridges <b>18</b>A, <b>18</b>B, <b>18</b>C, <b>18</b>D, <b>18</b>E and <b>18</b>F that contain toners of the colors corresponding to the image forming sections <b>10</b>A through <b>10</b>F, respectively. Furthermore, the image forming device <b>100</b> has, in addition to a single-sided printing mode that is a default setting, a double-sided printing mode. The image forming device <b>100</b> is an exemplary embodiment of the image forming device according to an aspect of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Since the six image forming sections <b>10</b>A through <b>10</b>F have similar structures, the image forming section <b>10</b>F corresponding to black will be described as representing these six image forming sections.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The image forming section <b>10</b>F includes a photoreceptor <b>110</b>, a charging device <b>120</b> that charges the surface of the photoreceptor <b>110</b>, an exposure device <b>130</b> that irradiates the photoreceptor <b>110</b> with exposure light based on an image signal supplied externally, a developing device <b>140</b> that develops the surface of the photoreceptor <b>110</b> with a toner, and a primary transfer device <b>150</b> that transfers the toner image to an intermediate transfer belt <b>200</b>. The photoreceptor <b>110</b> has a surface in the shape of a cylinder and rotates in the direction of an arrow &#x201c;a&#x201d; around an axis of the cylinder.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, the image forming device <b>100</b> includes the intermediate transfer belt <b>200</b> to which the toner image is transferred from the photoreceptor <b>110</b> of each of the image forming sections <b>10</b>A through <b>10</b>F, a secondary transfer device <b>300</b> that transfers the toner image from the intermediate transfer belt <b>200</b> to a paper sheet, a fixing device <b>400</b> that fixes the toner on the paper sheet, a decurler device <b>1</b> that corrects a curl of the paper sheet, and a paper conveyance section <b>600</b> that conveys the paper sheet. Furthermore, the image forming device <b>100</b> includes paper containers <b>710</b> and <b>720</b> that contain the paper sheet (s), a deburring device <b>800</b> that removes burrs of the paper sheet before image formation, a posture correcting section <b>730</b> that corrects the posture of the paper sheet, a cooling device <b>740</b> that cools the paper sheet after the toner image is fixed, an output paper container <b>690</b> that receives the paper sheet after the image formation by the image forming device <b>100</b> is completed, and a main-unit controller <b>101</b> that controls each section of the image forming device <b>100</b>. Incidentally, the image forming device <b>100</b> has a conveyance course R<b>1</b> along which an image is formed on the surface of a paper sheet being conveyed and a front-and-back inversion course R<b>2</b> along which the paper sheet with one side where the toner image is fixed is turned upside down.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The intermediate transfer belt <b>200</b> is a belt-shaped endless member supported by belt support rolls <b>210</b>, <b>220</b> and <b>230</b>, and circulates in the direction of an arrow &#x201c;b&#x201d; that passes by the image forming sections <b>10</b>A through <b>10</b>F and the secondary transfer device <b>300</b> in this order.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The paper conveyance section <b>600</b> includes drawing rolls <b>610</b> and <b>620</b> that draw paper sheets from the paper containers <b>710</b> and <b>720</b>, respectively, a registration roll <b>640</b> that sends each of the paper sheets to the secondary transfer device <b>300</b> in timing for the transfer of the toner image by the secondary transfer device <b>300</b>, sucking conveyance devices <b>650</b> that convey the paper sheet from the secondary transfer device <b>300</b> to the fixing device <b>400</b> while making the paper sheet cling to the outer surfaces of conveyance belts <b>651</b>, an output roll <b>660</b> that outputs the paper sheet to the outside of the image forming device <b>100</b>, and conveyance rolls <b>680</b> that are respectively disposed along the conveyance course R<b>1</b> and the front-and-back inversion course R<b>2</b> and convey the paper sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The paper conveyance section <b>600</b> conveys the paper sheet from each of the paper containers <b>710</b> and <b>720</b> along the conveyance course R<b>1</b> passing through the deburring device <b>800</b>, the posture correcting section <b>730</b>, the secondary transfer device <b>300</b>, the fixing device <b>400</b>, the cooling device <b>740</b> and the decurler device <b>1</b> sequentially. When a double-sided printing is executed, the paper conveyance section <b>600</b> conveys the paper sheet along the front-and-back inversion course R<b>2</b> diverging from the conveyance course R<b>1</b> and returning to the conveyance course R<b>1</b>. The paper sheet, which has one side where the toner image is fixed while passing through the conveyance course R<b>1</b>, is turned upside down while passing through the front-and-back inversion course R<b>2</b>. The paper sheet after being turned upside down returns to the conveyance course R<b>1</b>, subsequently passes through the deburring device <b>800</b> and the posture correcting section <b>730</b> again, and the toner image is transferred by the secondary transfer device <b>300</b> to the reverse side of the paper sheet, namely the side to which the toner image is yet to be transferred.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A basic operation of the image forming device <b>100</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> will be described. The description will be provided by taking a mode in which an image of black (K) is formed by the corresponding image forming section <b>10</b>F as an example of the single-color mode. The photoreceptor <b>110</b> is driven to rotate in the direction of the arrow &#x201c;a&#x201d;, and a charge is applied to the surface of the photoreceptor <b>110</b> by the charging device <b>120</b>. The exposure device <b>130</b> forms an electrostatic latent image on the surface of the photoreceptor <b>110</b> by irradiating the photoreceptor <b>110</b> with exposure light based on an image signal supplied externally. To be more specific, the exposure device <b>130</b> forms the electrostatic latent image on the surface of the photoreceptor <b>110</b> by emitting the exposure light based on data corresponding to black in the image signal. The developing device <b>140</b> forms a toner image on the surface of the photoreceptor <b>110</b> by developing the electrostatic latent image with a black toner. The developing device <b>140</b> of the image forming section <b>10</b>F is supplied with the toner by the toner cartridge <b>18</b>F. The photoreceptor <b>110</b> retains the toner image upon formation of the toner image. The toner image formed on the surface of the photoreceptor <b>110</b> is transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>200</b> by the primary transfer device <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Meanwhile, the paper sheets in the paper containers <b>710</b> and <b>720</b> are taken out by the drawing rolls <b>610</b> and <b>620</b>, and then conveyed along the conveyance course R<b>1</b> in the direction of an arrow &#x201c;c&#x201d; by the conveyance roll <b>680</b> and the registration roll <b>640</b> toward the secondary transfer device <b>300</b>. As for the paper sheet conveyed toward the secondary transfer device <b>300</b>, burr at an edge of the paper sheet is removed by the deburring device <b>800</b> disposed in the conveyance course R<b>1</b>. After the deburring by the deburring device <b>800</b>, the posture and position of the paper sheet is corrected by the posture correcting section <b>730</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The secondary transfer device <b>300</b> transfers the toner image on the intermediate transfer belt <b>200</b> to the paper sheet by causing, between the intermediate transfer belt <b>200</b> and the paper sheet, a potential difference for transfer. The paper sheet to which the toner image is transferred is conveyed in the direction of an arrow &#x201c;d&#x201d; by the conveyance belts <b>651</b>, and then the toner image is fixed on the surface of the paper sheet by the fixing device <b>400</b>. In this way, an image is formed on the paper sheet. The fixing device <b>400</b> has a heating belt to raise thermal capacity. The paper sheet with the surface where the image is formed is cooled by the cooling device <b>740</b>, and then a curl of the paper sheet is corrected by the decurler device <b>1</b>. Subsequently, the paper sheet is output by the output roll <b>660</b> and is laid in the output paper container <b>690</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the full-color mode, the five image forming sections <b>10</b>A through <b>10</b>E corresponding to the colors except black operate like the image forming section <b>10</b>F corresponding to black, and thereby toner images corresponding to the respective colors are formed. In the image forming sections <b>10</b>A through <b>10</b>F, image formation and transfer timing is adjusted so that the toner images formed on the respective photoreceptor surfaces are superimposed while being transferred to the intermediate transfer belt <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the double-sided printing mode, the paper conveyance section <b>600</b> conveys, along the front-and-back inversion course R<b>2</b>, a paper sheet after an image is fixed to one side of the paper sheet and a curl is corrected while the paper sheet is conveyed along the conveyance course R<b>1</b>. Subsequently, the paper conveyance section <b>600</b> turns the paper sheet upside down and then conveys the paper sheet along the conveyance course R<b>1</b> again during which the image is fixed to the other side of the paper sheet and a curl is corrected. This is an outline of the image formation movements in the image forming device <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, the decurler device <b>1</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective diagram of the decurler device when viewed from a side.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The decurler device <b>1</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes: a receiving chute <b>2</b> that receives the paper sheet that has passed through the cooling device <b>740</b>, a roll decurler section <b>3</b> that corrects a curl of the paper sheet, a belt decurler section <b>4</b> disposed downstream from the roll decurler section <b>3</b> in a sheet conveyance direction, a conveyance roll section <b>5</b> that conveys the paper sheet after the curl is corrected, and an output chute section <b>6</b> that outputs the paper sheet from the decurler device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The roll decurler section <b>3</b> includes a conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> that is driven to rotate thereby conveying the paper sheet sent from the receiving chute <b>2</b>, a correction roll <b>32</b> that corrects a curl of the paper sheet held between the correction roll <b>32</b> and the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b>, and a first holding member <b>33</b> that holds both ends of an arbor <b>321</b> of the correction roll <b>32</b> for the purpose of allowing the correction roll <b>32</b> to freely rotate. The roll decurler section <b>3</b> further includes a first off-center cam <b>34</b> that touches one end <b>331</b> of the first holding member <b>33</b>, and a first rotating shaft <b>35</b> to which the first off-center cam <b>34</b> is fixed and which is connected to a rotating shaft of a stepping motor provided in the main unit side of the image forming device <b>100</b>. The first holding member <b>33</b> is allowed to change the posture within a predetermined range. The decurler device <b>1</b> is an exemplary embodiment of the medium correction device.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The roll decurler section <b>3</b> further includes a weight <b>36</b> attached to the first rotating shaft <b>35</b>, and a first support member <b>37</b> that supports the first holding member <b>33</b> while allowing the posture of the first holding member <b>33</b> to change in the predetermined range. In the roll decurler section <b>3</b>, the first holding member <b>33</b>, the first off-center cam <b>34</b> and the first support member <b>37</b> are each provided in a pair.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The surface of the correction roll <b>32</b> is softer than the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b>, and the correction roll <b>32</b> rotates following the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b>. As the posture of the first holding member <b>33</b> changes, the amount of biting of the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> into the correction roll <b>32</b> changes.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The first holding member <b>33</b> is a resin molded member having a thickness of around 5 mm. One end of the first holding member <b>33</b> is provided with a contact section <b>331</b> contacting the first off-center cam <b>34</b>, and the other end is provided with a through hole <b>332</b> formed along a direction in which the correction roll <b>32</b> extends. Further, the first holding member <b>33</b> holds both ends of the arbor <b>321</b> of the correction roll <b>32</b> for the purpose of allowing the correction roll <b>32</b> to freely rotate in a central part.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The first rotating shaft <b>35</b> is rotatably supported by a frontward housing part and a rearward housing part of an upper housing <b>11</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Also, the first off-center cam <b>34</b> is eccentrically fixed at a position on an inner side of a supported part of the first rotating shaft <b>35</b> supported by each of the frontward and rearward housing parts of the upper housing <b>11</b>. This position corresponds to the contact section <b>331</b> of the first holding member <b>33</b>. Further, the first rotating shaft <b>35</b> is coupled to the stepping motor provided in the main unit side of the image forming device <b>100</b>, through a coupler fixed further outwardly than the rearward housing part of the upper housing <b>11</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Incidentally, the weight <b>36</b> attached to the first rotating shaft <b>35</b> will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although details will be described later, the first support member <b>37</b> is a metal member having, at one end, a penetrating shaft <b>371</b> passing through the through hole <b>332</b> of the first holding member <b>33</b>, and the other end is fixed to the upper housing <b>11</b> by a screw <b>38</b>. Each tip of the penetrating shaft <b>371</b> passing through the through hole <b>332</b> is inserted into a hole formed in each of the frontward housing part and the rearward housing part illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> of the upper housing <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">When the stepping motor provided in the main unit side is driven for only the specified number of steps, the first rotating shaft <b>35</b> coupled to this stepping motor rotates by only a rotation angle according to the specified number of steps. As a result, the posture of the first off-center cam <b>34</b> eccentrically fixed to the first rotating shaft <b>35</b> changes.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Since the contact section <b>331</b> of the first holding member <b>33</b> is in contact with the first off-center cam <b>34</b>, the first holding member <b>33</b> is caused to rotate around the penetrating shaft <b>371</b> passing through the through hole <b>332</b> by the change in the posture of the first off-center cam <b>34</b>. As the posture, which centers on the penetrating shaft <b>371</b>, of the first holding member <b>33</b> changes, the amount of biting of the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> into the correction roll <b>32</b> held by the first holding member <b>33</b> varies. When the amount of biting of the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> into the correction roll <b>32</b> changes, correction intensity with respect to the paper sheet passing between the correction roll <b>32</b> and the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> changes.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The roll decurler section <b>3</b> serves to correct the posture of the paper sheet conveyed in the conveyance course R<b>1</b>, i.e. to correct the paper sheet curling up at both ends. The more the amount of biting of the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> into the correction roll <b>32</b> is, the stronger the degree of correcting the curl of the paper sheet passing between the correction roll <b>32</b> and the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> is. On the other hand, the less the amount of biting of the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> into the correction roll <b>32</b> is, the weaker the degree of correcting the curl of the paper sheet passing between the correction roll <b>32</b> and the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> is. This roll decurler section is an example of the correction section, and the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> and the correction roll <b>32</b> are examples of the rod-like rotation body. The correction roll <b>32</b> is an example of the rotating body.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The belt decurler section <b>4</b> includes a belt unit <b>41</b> that conveys the paper sheet, a pressing member <b>42</b> that presses the paper sheet against the belt unit <b>41</b>, a paper conveyance guide <b>45</b> that guides the conveyance of the paper sheet, and a second off-center cam <b>46</b> that adjusts the press of the paper sheet against the belt unit <b>41</b> by the pressing member <b>42</b>. The belt decurler section <b>4</b> further includes a second rotating shaft <b>43</b> to which the second off-center cam <b>46</b> is fixed and whose end part is connected to the rotating shaft of a stepping motor provided in the main unit side of the image forming device <b>100</b>, and an intermediate member <b>44</b> that touches both the second off-center cam <b>46</b> and the pressing member <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The belt unit <b>41</b> includes a rotational drive roll <b>411</b> that is driven to rotate, a suspension roll <b>412</b> that is rotatable, an endless belt <b>413</b> held by the rotational drive roll <b>411</b> and the suspension roll <b>412</b>, and a tension roll <b>414</b> that provides the endless belt <b>413</b> with tension. The rotational drive roll <b>411</b> has an arbor <b>4111</b> in the center, and the arbor <b>4111</b> is rotatably supported by a frontward housing part and a rearward housing part, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, of the upper housing <b>11</b>. Further, a coupler is attached to the arbor <b>4111</b> at a point further rearward than a part supported by the rearward housing part. The arbor <b>4111</b> is coupled to a rotary motor provided in the main unit side of the image forming device <b>100</b> via this coupler.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Like the first rotating shaft <b>35</b>, the second rotating shaft <b>43</b> is rotatably supported by a frontward housing part and a rearward housing part, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, of the upper housing <b>11</b>. The second off-center cam <b>46</b> is fixed slightly further inward than parts supported by the frontward housing part and the rearward housing part illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The second rotating shaft <b>43</b> is coupled to the stepping motor provided in the main unit side of the image forming device <b>100</b>, via a coupler fixed further outwardly than the rearward housing part.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The intermediate member <b>44</b> includes a disc member <b>441</b> contacting the second off-center cam <b>46</b>, and a first moving shaft <b>442</b> penetrating the center of the disc member <b>441</b>. The disc member <b>441</b> is fixed to both ends of the first moving shaft <b>442</b>. Because the disc member <b>441</b> is in contact with the second off-center cam <b>46</b>, the first moving shaft <b>442</b> moves up and down in a predetermined range according to a change in the posture of the second off-center cam <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The pressing member <b>42</b> includes a second moving shaft <b>422</b> with both ends contacting the disc member <b>441</b>, and a pressing roll <b>421</b> contacting the endless belt <b>413</b>. The second moving shaft <b>422</b> serves as an arbor of the pressing roll <b>421</b>. Because the disc member <b>441</b> of the intermediate member <b>44</b> and the second moving shaft <b>422</b> are in contact with each other, the pressing member <b>42</b> moves up and down in a predetermined range while following the motion of the intermediate member <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Both ends of the paper conveyance guide <b>45</b> are connected to both edges of the second moving shaft <b>422</b>, and the posture of the paper conveyance guide <b>45</b> changes according to the up-and-down motion of the second moving shaft <b>422</b>. Since the posture of the paper conveyance guide <b>45</b> changes according to the up-and-down motion of the second moving shaft <b>422</b>, smooth conveyance of the paper sheet is ensured.</p>

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In the decurler device <b>1</b>, the paper conveyance in the roll decurler section <b>3</b> is controlled by using the drive system of the local motor M<b>2</b> provided in the decurler device <b>1</b>, and the paper conveyance in the belt decurler section <b>4</b> is controlled by using the drive system of the main motor M<b>1</b> provided in the main unit side. For example, when the paper conveyance in the roll decurler section <b>3</b> and the paper conveyance in the belt decurler section <b>4</b> are performed by the same drive system, there is a possibility that a difference may be caused between the sheet conveyance speed in the roll decurler section <b>3</b> and the sheet conveyance speed in the belt decurler section <b>4</b>. Therefore, in the decurler device <b>1</b>, the paper conveyance in the roll decurler section <b>3</b> and the adjustment of the sheet conveyance speed in the belt decurler section <b>4</b> are performed by using separate drive systems, so that the sheet conveyance speeds are made to agree with each other with high precision. Hence, for example, a Z crease due to a high sheet conveyance speed in the roll decurler section <b>3</b> and a low sheet conveyance speed in the belt decurler section is prevented from occurring.

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The description of the decurler device <b>1</b> is temporarily stopped here, and the fixing device <b>400</b> provided in the image forming device <b>100</b> will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a schematic structural diagram of a part around the fixing device.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The fixing device <b>400</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> includes a heat applying section <b>401</b>, a pressure roll <b>402</b> and a cooling fan <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The heat applying section <b>401</b> includes a heating belt <b>4013</b>, a first heating roll <b>4011</b>, a second heating roll <b>4012</b> and a tension roll <b>4014</b>.

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The cooling fan <b>403</b> is disposed below the pressure roll <b>402</b>, and blows air from below the pressure roll <b>402</b>, thereby preventing the pressure roll <b>402</b> from being overheated.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates the sucking conveyance devices <b>650</b> disposed upstream and downstream from the fixing device <b>400</b> in the sheet conveyance course so that the fixing device <b>400</b> is disposed in between. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> also illustrates the cooling device <b>740</b> provided downstream from the sucking conveyance device <b>650</b> disposed downstream from the fixing device <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Each of the sucking conveyance devices <b>650</b> has the conveyance belt <b>651</b>, a drive roll <b>653</b>, a tension roll <b>654</b> and an exhaust fan <b>652</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The conveyance belt <b>651</b> has a small-diameter bore passing through both sides of the conveyance belt <b>651</b>. Air in a space surrounded by the conveyance belt <b>651</b>, the drive roll <b>653</b> and the tension roll <b>654</b> is exhausted by the exhaust fan <b>652</b> to form a negative pressure inside the space, so that the paper sheet is made to cling to the surface of the conveyance belt <b>651</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates the paper sheet immediately before that the tip arrives at a nip portion formed by the heat applying section <b>401</b> and the pressure roll <b>402</b>. Here, a paper sheet P curling down at both ends is indicated by a solid line, while the paper sheet P&#x2032; curling up at both ends is indicated by a dotted line.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">When the paper sheet P&#x2032; indicated by the dotted line enters the nip portion, the tip of the paper sheet P&#x2032; may collide with the heating belt <b>4013</b>, forming a fold so-called dog-ear at a corner of the paper sheet, or the tip of the paper sheet P&#x2032; may not successfully enter the nip portion, thereby causing a jam.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Therefore, it is conceivable to suppress the curling up of the tip by making the exhaust fan <b>652</b> stronger thereby allowing the tip to cling to the conveyance belt <b>651</b>. However, when the exhaust fan <b>652</b> is strongly operated, an air stream to lower the temperature of the heating belt <b>4013</b> is caused. For this reason, in the image forming device <b>100</b>, the exhaust fan <b>652</b> is made to operate to a required minimum degree and thus, it is difficult to use the exhaust fan <b>652</b> to prevent the curling up.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Incidentally, it is considered that a curl like that of the paper sheet P&#x2032; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is formed at a paper sheet having a toner image fixed only on one side. Therefore, a dog-ear or a jam is highly likely to often occur at the time of the second fixing in the double-sided printing mode in which the fixing of the toner image is carried out for each side, i.e. twice in total. For example, when the paper sheet having a toner image fixed on one side and conveyed on the conveyance course illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> curls down thereby bulging in a central part upon passing through the roll decurler section <b>3</b> and the belt decurler section <b>4</b>, the paper sheet is subsequently conveyed to the front-and-back inversion course R<b>2</b> so that the toner image is transferred to the other side and the paper sheet is then conveyed to the fixing device <b>400</b>. The state of this paper sheet is the same as that of the paper sheet P&#x2032; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. Thus, in the decurler device <b>1</b>, in a case where the double-sided printing mode is selected, when the paper sheet after the toner image is fixed on one side has a curl with an upward bulge in the central part, the paper sheet is corrected to have a curl with a slightly downward bulge in the central part. On the other hand, when the paper sheet after the toner image is fixed on one side originally has a curl with a downward bulge in the central part, the curl is corrected to be soft to the extent that the curl does not have an upward bulge in the central part. Further, in this decurler device <b>1</b>, in a case where the double-sided printing mode is selected, when the paper sheet after the toner image is fixed on one side is accompanied by a curl with a slightly downward bulge in the central part, no correction is performed. In the decurler device <b>1</b>, based on various conditions such as a temperature, a humidity and an image density other than the type of paper sheet selected by the operator, a curl of the paper sheet after the fixing is estimated and corrected in the manner described above. Further, the decurler device <b>1</b> recognizes the types of paper sheet whose central part is likely to bulge downward always after the toner image is fixed even when the conditions such as the temperature, humidity and image density are changed. When the type of paper sheet selected by the operator is one of the recognized types of paper sheet, no correction is performed. Furthermore, in the decurler device <b>1</b>, when the single-sided printing mode is selected, in either of two cases, where the paper sheet after the toner image is fixed on one side is accompanied by a curl with an upward bulge in a central part and where the paper sheet after the toner image is fixed on one side is accompanied by a curl with a downward bulge in a central part, the curl is corrected to be soft. Here, the description of the exemplary embodiment is temporarily stopped, and an experimental example will be described.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">For this example, a sucking fan disposed immediately upstream from a fixing device in a printer made by Fuji Xerox is replaced with another one capable of switching between ON (use in low output) and OFF, and a high temperature (35&#xb0; C.) a high humidity (70%), a normal temperature (20&#xb0; C.) and a normal humidity (40%) are prepared as operation environments. Further, as the paper sheets to be conveyed, there are prepared surface untreated plain sheets having the same size of SRA<b>3</b> and different basis weights as well as surface treated coated sheets having the same size of SRA<b>3</b> and different basis weights.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In this example, after transferring and fixing a toner image on one side of each type of paper sheet, the combination of the amounts of biting of the roll decurler section and the belt decurler section is changed every 45 sheets. Also, for some of the sheets, a curl is corrected every 45 sheets in each of a case where the sucking fan is turned on and a case where the sucking fan is turned off, and under these conditions, for the sheets after finishing the transfer of the toner image on the other side and conveyed toward the fixing device again to undergo the fixing, there are observed and evaluated: a behavioral tendency of the tip of the paper sheet immediately before entering a nip portion of the fixing device; a maximum amount of curling up; the timing of occurrence of a jam; and the number of dog-eared sheets. As for the remaining sheets other than the some of the sheets, a curl is corrected while leaving the sucking fan on, and there are observed and evaluated: a behavioral tendency of the tip of the paper sheet immediately before entering the nip portion of the fixing device; a maximum amount of curling up; the timing of occurrence of a jam; and the number of dog-eared sheets. Incidentally, three levels of large (R<b>3</b>), medium (R<b>2</b>) and small (R<b>1</b>) are prepared as the amount of biting in the roll decurler section, whereas three levels of large (B<b>3</b>), medium (B<b>2</b>) and small (B<b>1</b>) are prepared as the amount of biting in the belt decurler section. The larger the amount of biting is, the stronger the correction intensity is. Also, when the amounts of biting are in the same level, the intensities of correcting the sheets are equal.</p>

<p id="p-0180" num="0179">From the comparative examples 1-9 and the examples 1-3, it is found that, in the normal temperature and humidity environment, for the plain sheet having a basis weight of 64 gsm or more and the toner image fixed only on one side, the correction by the belt decurler section that depresses the side where the toner image is fixed and thereby raising the both ends is intensified, so that the toner image transferred to the other side is successfully fixed regardless of the on/off state of the fan.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">From the comparative examples 10 and 11, and the examples 4-7, it is found that, in the normal temperature and humidity environment, for the coated sheet having a basis weight of 73 gsm or more and the toner image fixed only on one side, even when the correction by the roll decurler section that bulges the side where the toner image is fixed is intensified, the toner image transferred to the other side is barely fixed if the fan is turned on.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">Further, from the examples 8-13, it is found that, in the normal temperature and humidity environment, for the coated sheet having a basis weight of 73 gsm or more and the toner image fixed only on one side, if the roll decurler section and the belt decurler section are equal in terms of correction intensity, the toner image transferred to the other side is successfully fixed regardless of the on/off state of the fan.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Thus, it is found that as compared to the plain sheets, the coated sheets are likely to have a downwardly bulging curl in the central part, and the correction intensity of the belt decurler section in the double-sided printing mode is not required to greatly exceed the correction intensity of the roll decurler section.</p>

<p id="p-0234" num="0233">From the comparative examples 12-23 and the examples 14-16, it is found that, in the high temperature and humidity environment, for the plain sheet having a basis weight of 64 gsm or more and the toner image fixed only on one side, unless the correction by the belt decurler section that depresses the side where the toner image is fixed is intensified, the toner image transferred to the other side is not successfully fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">From the comparative examples 24 and 25 and the example 17, it is found that, in the high temperature and humidity environment, for the coated sheet having a basis weight of 73 gsm and the toner image fixed only on one side, if the correction intensity of the roll decurler section is far stronger than that of the belt decurler section, the toner image transferred to the other side is barely fixed successfully as long as the fan is turned on, but the toner image is not successfully fixed even if the fan is turned on for the coated sheet having a basis weight of 104 gsm.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Further, from the examples 18 and 19 and the comparative example 26, it is found that, in the high temperature and humidity environment, for the coated sheet having a basis weight of 73 gsm and the toner image fixed only on one side, if the correction intensity of the roll decurler section is stronger than that of the belt decurler section, the toner image transferred to the other side is successfully fixed regardless of the on/off state of the fan, but the toner image is not successfully fixed even when the fan is turned on for the coated sheet having a basis weight of 104 gsm.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">Furthermore, from the examples 20 to 22, it is found that, in the high temperature and humidity environment, for the coated sheet having a basis weight of 73 gsm or more and the toner image fixed only on one side, if the roll decurler section and the belt decurler section are equal in term of correction intensity, the toner image transferred to the other side is successfully fixed regardless of the on/off state of the fan.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">In view of the above results, it is found that as compared to the plain sheets, the coated sheets are likely to have a curl with a downward bulge in the central part due to the fixing of the toner image on the one side, and the correction intensity of the belt decurler section in the double-sided printing mode is not required to greatly exceed the correction intensity of the roll decurler section. Furthermore, in the high temperature and humidity environment, the degree of the correction intensity of the belt decurler section exceeding the correction intensity of the roll decurler section may need to be larger than that in the normal temperature and humidity environment. This concludes the description of efforts to prevent the occurrence of a jam in the double-sided mode and thus completes the description of the experimental examples.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">Now, the decurler device <b>1</b> will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">In the decurler device <b>1</b>, the cooling device <b>740</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and a drawer are both capable of being drawn from the main-unit housing of the image forming device <b>100</b>.

For this reason, in a return to the inside of the main-unit housing, in order to prevent the decurler device <b>1</b> from colliding with other members in the main-unit housing when the drawer plate <b>102</b> is pushed toward the main unit side by the operator, a guide member <b>103</b> is provided on the top surface of the drawer plate <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a state in which a first notch <b>121</b><i>a </i>and a second notch <b>121</b><i>b </i>are formed on an bottom-part flank <b>121</b> of a lower housing <b>12</b> of the decurler device <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> further illustrates a protruding member <b>900</b> provided on a rearward side of the main-unit housing.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">The protruding member <b>900</b> includes a lower section <b>901</b> that enters the guide member <b>103</b> as the drawer plate <b>102</b> travels and an upper section <b>902</b> that touches the bottom-part flank <b>121</b> of the decurler device <b>1</b>. The upper section <b>902</b> is provided with a first convex section <b>9021</b> and a second convex section <b>9022</b> which are protruded by the pressing of a spring provided inside and sink into the upper section <b>902</b> when being pushed by receiving a force of a certain or greater strength. The protruding member <b>900</b> moves along the bottom-part flank <b>121</b> of the decurler device <b>1</b> while accompanying the travel of the drawer plate <b>102</b>. The first convex section <b>9021</b> is engaged in the first notch <b>121</b><i>a </i>and the second notch <b>121</b><i>b</i>, at a moment when the first convex section <b>9021</b> faces the first notch <b>121</b><i>a </i>and a moment when the first convex section <b>9021</b> faces the second notch <b>121</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Meanwhile, the second convex section <b>9022</b> is engaged in the second notch <b>121</b><i>b </i>at a moment when the second convex section <b>9022</b> faces the second notch <b>121</b><i>b</i>. Incidentally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates the state in which the protruding member <b>900</b> is completely removed from the guide member <b>103</b> for convenience of the description. However, actually, even when the drawer plate <b>102</b> is drawn from the main-unit housing to a maximum extent, the first convex section <b>9021</b> is in the state of being engaged in the second notch <b>121</b><i>b </i>and a tapered part <b>9011</b> of the lower section <b>901</b> is not removed from the guide member <b>103</b>. On the other hand, in a state in which the drawer plate <b>102</b> is completely housed in the main-unit housing, the first convex section <b>9021</b> is engaged in the first notch <b>121</b><i>a </i>and the second convex section <b>9022</b> is engaged in the second notch <b>121</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">In this structure, an orbit of the drawer plate <b>102</b> placed on the decurler device <b>1</b> when the drawer plate <b>102</b> is attached to and detached from the main-unit housing is stable. Therefore, a collision between the decurler device <b>1</b> and the members adjacent to the decurler device <b>1</b> within the main unit is avoided.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Now, there will be described an opening and closing mechanism of the decurler device <b>1</b> divided into the upper section and the lower section at the conveyance course of the paper sheet serving as a boundary.</p>

<p id="p-0251" num="0250">The locking system <b>7</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> includes an operating lever <b>70</b>, an upper plate <b>71</b> to which the operating lever <b>70</b> is attached, and a pressure plate <b>72</b> attached to a surface of the upper plate <b>71</b> opposite to a surface where the operating lever <b>70</b> is attached. The locking system <b>7</b> further includes a torsion spring <b>73</b>, a penetrating shaft <b>74</b> around which the torsion spring <b>73</b> is wound, and an upper frame <b>75</b> fixed to the upper housing <b>11</b> and supporting the penetrating shaft <b>74</b> while allowing the penetrating shaft <b>74</b> to be rotatable. The locking system <b>7</b> further includes a locking member <b>76</b> fixed to both ends of the penetrating shaft <b>74</b>, a locking shaft <b>78</b> that holds the locking member <b>76</b>, and a lower frame <b>77</b> provided with the locking shaft <b>78</b> and attached to the lower housing <b>12</b>. One end of the torsion spring <b>73</b> is fixed to the penetrating shaft <b>74</b>, and the other end is supported by the upper frame <b>75</b>. In this locking system <b>7</b>, the operating lever <b>70</b> is lifted to remove the locking member <b>76</b> from the locking shaft <b>78</b> so that the locking is released, and after the release, the upper section of the device is locked into the lower section when the operating lever <b>70</b> is pushed hard downward.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a perspective view of the locking system illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> when viewed from a side.</p>

Incidentally, the penetrating shaft <b>74</b> has a part exposing on the outer side of the upper frame <b>75</b> and shaped like a semicolumn. On the inner side of the upper frame <b>75</b> however, the penetrating shaft <b>74</b> has a plate-like part <b>741</b> where a pressing force from the pressure plate <b>72</b> located above is exerted on the semicolumn. The plate-like part <b>741</b> is shaped to protrude while having a gap formed therein in a part along an axial direction. The torsion spring <b>73</b> is in a state of winding around the part shaped like the semicolumn of the penetrating shaft <b>74</b> by passing through the gap.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a state of these members also depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> when the operating lever <b>70</b> is yet to be operated. Here, there is illustrated a state in which the other end <b>731</b> of the torsion spring <b>73</b> is supported on an inside bottom of the upper frame <b>75</b>, and the locking member <b>76</b> is held by the locking shaft <b>78</b> with an urging force in the direction of an arrow illustrated in Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Further, Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a state in which a gap with an angle &#x3b1; is formed between the plate-like part <b>741</b> of the penetrating shaft <b>74</b> and the pressure plate <b>72</b>. This gap provides the pressure plate <b>72</b> with a so-called &#x201c;play&#x201d;, i.e. a free movement between a horizontal state and a state of tilting by only the angle &#x3b1; in a counterclockwise direction.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">Here, Part (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a state of these members when the locking shaft <b>78</b>, although actually provided, is absent.

<p id="p-0257" num="0256">Part (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a state in which the operating lever <b>70</b> is lifted counterclockwise by only the angle &#x3b1; and thereby the pressure plate <b>72</b> is tilted counterclockwise by only the angle &#x3b1;. However, this is in the range of the &#x201c;play&#x201d; and thus, there is no change from the penetrating shaft <b>74</b> illustrated in Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">In part (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the operating lever <b>70</b> is lifted counterclockwise up to an angle &#x3b2; (&#x3b2;&#x3e;&#x3b1;) against the urging force in the direction of the arrow illustrated in Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, so that the pressure plate <b>72</b> is tilted counterclockwise by only the angle &#x3b2;, and the plate-like member <b>741</b> receives the pressing force from the pressure plate <b>72</b>. And, the penetrating shaft <b>74</b> rotates counterclockwise only by an angle (&#x3b2;&#x2212;&#x3b1;). As a result, the locking member <b>76</b> starts leaving the locking shaft <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">In Part (e) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the operating lever <b>70</b> is further lifted counterclockwise up to an angle &#x3b3; (&#x3b3;&#x3e;&#x3b2;), so that the pressure plate <b>72</b> is tilted counterclockwise by only the angle &#x3b3;, and the plate-like member <b>741</b> receives the pressing force from the pressure plate <b>72</b>.

In the state of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the pressure plate <b>72</b> is rotated counterclockwise less than the angle &#x3b1; with respect to the horizontal position. Thus, even when the operating lever <b>70</b> is operated in a range illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the unlocking movement is not initiated because the &#x201c;play&#x201d; is provided.</p>

In other words, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> illustrates a state in which the pressure plate <b>72</b> is rotated counterclockwise an angle equal to or larger than the angle &#x3b1; with respect to the horizontal position, so that the unlocking is initiated by the operation of the operating lever <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> illustrates, as depicted in Part (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the locking member <b>76</b> is kept away from the locking shaft <b>78</b>, and the operating lever <b>70</b> is further lifted and then released. Incidentally, although illustration is omitted, when the operating lever <b>70</b> is pressed in the state illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the posture of the penetrating shaft <b>74</b> moves downward while maintaining the state depicted in Part (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. Then, the tip of the locking member <b>76</b> collides with the locking shaft <b>78</b> for a moment, but afterwards, the locking shaft <b>78</b> starts sliding along a tapered part <b>761</b> provided at the tip.

In other words, before the operating lever <b>70</b> is lifted to an extent of causing the unlocking, the convex portion <b>701</b> hits the front frame <b>500</b> of the main-unit housing, thereby preventing the unlocking in the main-unit housing. The operating lever <b>70</b> is an example of the operating member. Incidentally, a cover <b>700</b> is provided over the locking system <b>7</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0269" num="0268">In the decurler device <b>1</b>, the roll decurler section <b>3</b> having the pair of rolls sandwiching the conveyed paper sheet is disposed upstream in the sheet conveyance direction, and the belt decurler section <b>4</b> having the plural endless belts <b>413</b> intermittently aligned in the direction crossing the sheet conveyance direction is disposed downstream. The reason is as follows. Immediately after arriving at the decurler device <b>1</b> upon passing through the cooling device <b>740</b>, the surface of the paper sheet is yet to be completely cooled. Therefore, when the paper sheet yet to be completely cooled is conveyed while being sandwiched by members in which a part touching the surface of the payer sheet and a part not touching the surface of the payer sheet are mixed, a difference in luster is produced on the surface of the paper sheet. Therefore, in this decurler device <b>1</b>, the roll decurler section <b>3</b> having the pair of rolls touching the entire surface of the paper sheet is disposed at a position closer to the cooling device <b>740</b>, where the surface of the paper sheet is yet to be completely cooled.</p>

For this reason, in a case where the torsion spring that produces the urging force in the direction of lifting the upper section upon unlocking is employed to be suitable for the chute made of metal, when this chute made of metal is replaced later with the chute made of resin, the force to release the upper section becomes too strong, placing a burden on a part where the upper section and the lower section of the device are coupled to each other. On the other hand, in a case where the torsion spring is employed to be suitable for the chute made of resin, there is a possibility that when this chute made of resin is replaced later by the chute made of metal, the force to release the upper section becomes insufficient, causing an inconvenience. Therefore, in this decurler device <b>1</b>, an effort is made to ensure a stable urging force when either chute is used.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> is a diagram that illustrates the part where the upper section and the lower section of the decurler device are coupled to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates the part where the upper section and the lower section of the decurler device <b>1</b> are coupled to each other. Here, there are illustrated an upper bearing section <b>112</b> attached to the upper housing <b>11</b>, a lower bearing section <b>123</b> attached to the lower housing <b>12</b>, a linking shaft <b>80</b> that links the upper bearing section <b>112</b> and the lower bearing section <b>123</b> by passing through these sections. One end <b>811</b> of the torsion spring <b>81</b> is connected to the upper housing <b>11</b>, and the other end <b>812</b> is engaged in either a first engagement hole <b>123</b><i>a </i>or a second engagement hole <b>123</b><i>b </i>formed in the lower bearing section <b>123</b>. This lower bearing section <b>123</b> is an example of the attachment section, and the torsion spring <b>81</b> is an example of the elastic member and also an example of the toggle spring.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">Because the one end <b>811</b> of the torsion spring <b>81</b> is connected to the upper housing <b>11</b> and the other end <b>812</b> is engaged in either the first engagement hole <b>123</b><i>a </i>or the second engagement hole <b>123</b><i>b </i>of the lower bearing section <b>123</b>, an urging force resisting the motion to close the upper section is produced in the torsion spring <b>81</b>. In the decurler device <b>1</b>, at the time of unlocking, the upper section is lifted to some extent by this urging force produced in the torsion spring <b>81</b> in the locked state.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> illustrates a state in which the other end <b>812</b> of the torsion spring <b>81</b> is engaged in the second engagement hole <b>123</b><i>b </i>on the right side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. In this case, the urging force resisting the motion to close the upper section is larger than that in the case in which the other end <b>812</b> is engaged in the first engagement hole <b>123</b>. Therefore, the other end <b>812</b> is engaged in the first engagement hole <b>123</b><i>a </i>when the chute made of resin is used, and the other end <b>812</b> is engaged in the second engagement hole <b>123</b><i>b </i>when the chute made of metal is used, so that when the replacing chute is either type, the force to lift the upper section is produced to some extent.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref> is a diagram that illustrates a cover of a harness that links the upper section and the lower section.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">In the decurler device <b>1</b>, a harness <b>910</b> for transmitting a signal from various sensors disposed in the upper section to the lower section is arranged on the side where there is provided the linking shaft linking the lower section and the upper section and also illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a harness cover <b>920</b> covering a bundle of the harness <b>910</b> arranged on the linking shaft side is screwed.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">In this way, since the harness <b>910</b> linking the upper section and the lower section is covered by the harness cover <b>920</b> on the linking shaft side where the upper section and the lower section are coupled to each other, the length of the harness <b>910</b> is a minimum and the harness <b>910</b> is prevented from spreading.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">Incidentally, the decurler device <b>1</b> is housed in the main-unit housing after the upper section and the lower section are locked. The decurler device <b>1</b> is devised to weaken a resistance produced by the contact between the correction roll <b>32</b> and the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> when the upper section is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> is a schematic diagram of the roll decurler section.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the decurler device <b>1</b> is drawn from the main-unit housing, the connection between the coupler <b>13</b> attached to the end of the first rotating shaft <b>35</b> of the roll decurler section <b>3</b> and the drive shaft of the stepping motor SM<b>1</b> provided in the main unit side is released. Further, when the upper section of the decurler device <b>1</b> is opened, if no effort is made, the first rotating shaft <b>35</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is rotated by torque produced in the first off-center cam <b>34</b> fixed to both ends of the first rotating shaft <b>35</b>, and the first off-center cam <b>34</b> is in the posture in which a center of gravity of the first off-center cam <b>34</b> is located at a lower point in a vertical direction passing through the center of the first rotating shaft <b>35</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates a posture of the first off-center cam <b>34</b> after the upper section is opened. Part (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates a state in which the amount of biting of the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> into the correction roll <b>32</b> in the roll decurler section <b>3</b> is a maximum. Part (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> illustrates a state in which the amount of biting of the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> into the correction roll <b>32</b> in the roll decurler section <b>3</b> is a minimum. In the posture of the first off-center cam <b>34</b> illustrated in Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the amount of biting of the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> into the correction roll <b>32</b> is smaller than that in the posture illustrated in Part (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, but slightly larger than that in the posture illustrated in Part (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. Therefore, it is not convenient to close and lock the upper section while leaving the first off-center cam <b>34</b> in the posture illustrated in Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, since the resistance is strong.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">Thus, in the decurler device <b>1</b>, this resistance is weakened by attaching a weight <b>36</b> to the first rotating shaft <b>35</b> as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> is a diagram that illustrates a state in which the weight attached to the first rotating shaft is viewed from the direction indicated by an arrow Z illustrated in Part (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates the weight <b>36</b> screwed on a part of the circumferential surface of the first rotating shaft <b>35</b>. The weight <b>36</b> is provided to enable, when the upper section is opened, the first off-center cam <b>34</b> to be in the posture illustrated in Part (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, in which the amount of biting of the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> into the correction roll <b>32</b> is a minimum. The position and the heaviness of the weight <b>36</b> illustrated in Part (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> are determined to produce torque that offsets the torque produced in the first off-center cam <b>34</b> taking the posture illustrated in Part (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. By making such an effort, in the decurler device <b>1</b>, the resistance caused due to the contact between the correction roll <b>32</b> and the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> is weakened when the upper section is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> is a diagram that illustrates a modification of the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates a front view and a side view of the first off-center cam <b>34</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. Further, in Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, a center of rotation of the first off-center cam <b>34</b> is indicated by &#x201c;o&#x201d; and a center of gravity is indicated by &#x201c;x&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">Part (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref> illustrates a front view and a side view of an off-center cam <b>340</b> partially thicker as compared to the first off-center cam <b>34</b> illustrated in Part (a) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. When viewed from the front, the first off-center cam <b>34</b> and the off-center cam <b>340</b> are equal in size and shape. Further, in Part (b) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>, a center of rotation of the off-center cam <b>340</b> is indicated by &#x201c;o&#x201d; and a center of gravity is indicated by &#x201c;x&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">The off-center cam <b>340</b> is made partially thicker as compared to the first off-center cam <b>34</b>, so that when the off-center cam <b>340</b> is in the posture as illustrated in Part (c) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref> in which the amount of biting of the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> into the correction roll <b>32</b> is the minimum, the center of gravity is located at a lower position in the vertical direction of the arbor.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">When the upper section is opened, the off-center cam <b>340</b> is in the position in which the amount of biting of the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> into the correction roll <b>32</b> is the minimum. Therefore, in the decurler device <b>1</b>, by using the off-center cam <b>340</b> in place of the weight <b>36</b> illustrated in Part (d) of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>, the resistance produced by the contact between the correction roll <b>32</b> and the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> is weakened when the upper section is closed. This concludes the description of an effort to weaken the resistance produced by the contact between the correction roll <b>32</b> and the conveyance drive shaft <b>31</b> when the upper section is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Incidentally, the correction roll <b>32</b> used in the roll decurler section <b>3</b> of the decurler device <b>1</b> is a consumable component made of a material softer than that of the conveyance drive shaft <b>35</b> and thus is replaceable.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">However, the correction roll <b>32</b> is a rotatably supported member, and the first rotating shaft <b>35</b> and the like are disposed above the correction roll <b>32</b> and therefore, when, for example, the arbor of the correction roll <b>32</b> is supported by the frontward housing part and the rearward housing part of the upper housing <b>11</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, labor and time are consumed in replacement. Thus, in this decurler device <b>1</b>, the labor and time in replacement are saved by making an effort as described below.</p>

Incidentally, although illustration on the other side is omitted, the other tip of the penetrating shaft <b>371</b> is similarly supported by the upper housing <b>11</b> on the other side. The first holding member <b>33</b> is an example of the bearing member, and the first support member <b>37</b> is an example of the holding member.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 29</figref> is an external perspective view of the correction roll supported by the first support member.</p>
