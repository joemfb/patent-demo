<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It should be understood at the outset that although illustrative implementations of one or more embodiments are illustrated below, the disclosed systems and methods may be implemented using any number of techniques, whether currently known or later in existence. The disclosure should in no way be limited to the illustrative implementations, drawings, and techniques illustrated below, but may be modified within the scope of the appended claims along with their full scope of equivalents.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Referencing documents by their location within a hierarchical file system alone may make it difficult to later find the document, for example when the position of the document is deep within the tree-like structure of a complex hierarchical file system. The various embodiments are directed to linking information from a handset, mobile phone, or personal digital assistant (PDA) with a document to provide additional information that can be used to assist finding the document in the file system. A file system is used to organize and store the documents in a storage device, and at least some of the embodiments link information from a handset to the documents contemporaneously with storing the documents in the storage device. For example, a mobile phone belonging to individual A may be aware that a meeting is scheduled between individual A, individual B, and individual C at 10 AM. Using location information, the mobile phone also may be aware that at 10 AM it is substantially co-located with mobile phones associated with individual B and individual C. In this case, if a document is created or updated and saved by a computer substantially co-located with the mobile phone belonging to individual A, for example by a laptop computer associated with individual A or by the mobile phone belonging to individual A, the information related to the meeting between A, B, and C and the time of the meeting can be saved along with the document. This information related to the meeting may be used later, for example, to locate the document. While the example is directed to a mobile phone, one of ordinary skill in the art would recognize that the example could equally have been directed to other similar devices such as a personal digital assistant (PDA), a media player, a pager, a mobile computer, or a combination of functionalities of these devices. A document is an electronic file such as a textual document describing a design, a digital photograph, or an electronic mail. A storage device is a memory device such as a computer, a database or a tape drive. A computer is an electronic device configured to perform operations on an electronic file.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In at least some embodiments, an operation is performed on an electronic file stored on a computer system, and information about the mobile telephony device is determined. The information is linked with the electronic file on the computer system, and the electronic file and the information linked with the electronic file are stored in a memory device, for example in a memory of the computer system. As an example, but not by way of limitation, the information that is linked with the electronic file may be the date of a meeting, the time of the meeting, and the participants of the meeting.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a system <b>100</b> in accordance with at least some embodiments. In particular, the system <b>100</b> comprises an application program <b>102</b> executed on a computer system <b>140</b>, an electronic file database <b>104</b> executed on a computer system <b>144</b>, an information database <b>106</b> executed on a computer system <b>142</b>, a base transceiver station <b>112</b> and mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b>. The mobile telephony device <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> may take various forms. In an embodiment, the mobile telephony device may take various forms with a screen size reduced to a maximum of 4 inches by 6 inches, including a mobile phone, a PDA, a handheld gaming device, a handheld wireless mobile device, a pager, a digital camera, a media player, and a digital calculator. The mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> are communicatively coupled to the computer system <b>140</b> by way of wireless communication (e.g., radio frequency identification (RFID), WIFI, BLUETOOTH&#xae;, infrared, or other) and the computer system <b>140</b> communicates with a network <b>110</b> (e.g., wireline or wireless). The mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> wirelessly communicate with the base transceiver station <b>112</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the system <b>100</b> comprising two mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> and one base transceiver station <b>112</b>, however the system <b>100</b> may comprise any number of mobile telephony devices and base transceiver stations.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In at least some embodiments, the computer system <b>140</b> performs operations on an electronic file <b>150</b>. For example, the operations performed on a first electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>a </i>by the computer system <b>140</b> may comprise creating the first electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>a</i>, editing the first electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>a</i>, deleting the first electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>a</i>, executing the first electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>a</i>, or a combination of one or more of these operations. The first electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>a </i>may be copied and/or saved in the electronic file database <b>104</b> as the second electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>b</i>. In an embodiment, the first electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>a </i>may be a local copy of the electronic file <b>150</b> and the second electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>b </i>may be a public copy of the electronic file <b>150</b> available to users of the electronic file database <b>104</b>. In at least some embodiments, a copy of the electronic file <b>150</b> is stored on the electronic file database <b>104</b>, and a &#x2018;pointer&#x2019; to the electronic file <b>150</b> is stored as a local copy on the computer system <b>140</b>. Additionally, the computer system <b>140</b> executes the application program <b>102</b>, and the application program <b>102</b> is communicatively coupled with the information database <b>106</b> and the electronic file database <b>104</b> by way of the network <b>110</b>. The application program <b>102</b> determines information about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> and/or information about the user of the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> and links the information determined about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> with the electronic file <b>150</b> when the computer system <b>140</b> performs operations on the electronic file <b>150</b>, for example when the computer system <b>140</b> writes and/or saves the electronic file <b>150</b>. This information may be referred to as contextual information. In an embodiment, the contextual information may include the name of the user of the mobile telephony device <b>120</b>, a location or place, a time and date, and file types. In an embodiment, the contextual information may include environment information including temperature, humidity, raining, snowing, or other environmental information. In an embodiment, the contextual information may include biometric information. In other embodiments, the contextual information may include other information. The contextual information also may be referred to as contextual cues.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The discussion now turns to the various embodiments of determining information about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> and linking the information with the electronic file <b>150</b>. In at least some embodiments, the mobile telephony device wirelessly communicates with the computer system <b>140</b>. The application program <b>102</b> determines the information about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> by direct wireless communication between the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> and the computer system <b>140</b>. For example, the application program <b>102</b> by direct wireless communication between the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> and the computer system <b>140</b> determines information about location of the mobile telephony device <b>120</b>, for example the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> may send location information in the form of coordinates or some other format to the computer system <b>140</b>. In addition to information about the location, the application program <b>102</b> determines other information such as information about a user of the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> (e.g., name), and information from a calendar on the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> (e.g., a scheduled meeting, or a teleconference).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment, the application program <b>102</b> may determine a presence of the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> by inference, based on the wireless coupling between the computer system <b>140</b> and the telephony device <b>120</b>. For example, if the wireless coupling is supported by a wireless technology having a range limit of several feet, the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> may infer from the wireless coupling that the computer system <b>140</b> and the telephony device <b>120</b> are located no more than about several feet of each other. In other embodiments the application program <b>102</b> determines a presence of the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> by monitoring the wireless communication between the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> and the base transceiver station <b>112</b>. In particular, the application program <b>102</b> determines if the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> is proximate (e.g., within five feet) to the computer system <b>140</b> by determining the location of the mobile telephony device. The location of the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> may be determined by any one or more of a number of available location determination approaches (e.g., Global Positioning System (GPS), by triangulation from multiple base transceiver station <b>112</b>, signal strength, or other). If the presence of the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> is determined, then the application program <b>102</b> may determine information about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> by monitoring the wireless communication between the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> and the base transceiver station <b>112</b>. The application program <b>102</b> is configured to link the information determined about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> with the electronic file <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Consider, for purpose of explanation, that the computer system <b>140</b> performs an operation on the first electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>a </i>(e.g., creating an electronic file). When the computer system <b>140</b> performs the operation, the application program <b>102</b> determines the information about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b>. As previously discussed, the application program <b>102</b> determines information about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> by direct wireless communication between the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> and the computer system <b>140</b>, or by monitoring wireless communication between the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> and the base transceiver station <b>112</b>. The application program <b>102</b> captures information such as information about the user of mobile telephony device <b>120</b> (e.g., John Doe), information from the calendar on the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> (e.g., a teleconference with Jane Smith at 10:00 AM on Monday Dec. 1, 2007), and information about the location of the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> (e.g., Building 1A, Room Number 101 or GPS coordinates) proximate to (e.g., within ten feet of) the computer system <b>140</b>. In other embodiments, the mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> &#x2018;listen&#x2019; (i.e. performs voice recognition) when the computer system <b>104</b> is performing operations on the electronic file <b>150</b>. The application program <b>102</b> captures information &#x2018;listened&#x2019; (e.g., items discussed during the meeting) by the mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In at least some embodiments, the application program <b>102</b> automatically links all of the information determined (i.e. John Doe, teleconference with Jane Smith, Building 1A, Room Number 101, and items discussed in the meeting) based on the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> with the first electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>a</i>, and the application program <b>102</b> stores the information linked with the first electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>a </i>and the first electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>a </i>in a memory device such as the computer system <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In at least some embodiments, the application program <b>102</b> stores the information linked with the electronic file <b>150</b> in the information database <b>106</b> and the second electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>b </i>on the electronic file database <b>104</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the electronic file database <b>104</b> stores electronic files after the computer system <b>140</b> has performed an operation on the first electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>a</i>. The electronic file database <b>104</b> makes the second electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>b </i>available to the computer system <b>140</b> and possibly other computer systems unrelated to the system of linking information from the mobile telephony device with the electronic file. The electronic files stored in the electronic file database <b>104</b>, for example the second electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>b</i>, are linked with the information stored in the information database <b>106</b>. The information database <b>106</b> stores the information linked with the electronic file <b>150</b>. In at least some embodiments, it is possible that at least some of the information stored on the information database <b>106</b> may be linked with a plurality of electronic files stored on the electronic files database <b>104</b>. For example, the computer system <b>140</b> may perform operations on a plurality of electronic files from the same location (e.g., Building 1A, Room 101). The application program <b>102</b> links the information about the location (i.e., Building 1A, Room 101) determined about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> with each of the plurality of electronic files and stores the information about the location in the information database <b>106</b>. Thus, the information about the location (i.e., Building 1A, Room 101) in the information database <b>106</b> is linked with each of the plurality of electronic files on the electronic file database <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In at least some embodiments, the application program <b>102</b> is enabled to link selected information determined about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> with the electronic file. Consider, for purpose of explanation, the previously discussed example where the application program <b>102</b> determines the information about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> when the computer system <b>140</b> is performing an operation on the electronic file. The application program <b>102</b> makes available the information determined about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> to a user (i.e., the user is performing the operation on the electronic file by way of the computer system <b>140</b>), and the user selects at least some of the information made available by the application program <b>102</b>. For example, the application program <b>102</b> makes the information (e.g., John Doe's telephone was present, teleconference with Jane Smith was on the phone's calendar, and Building 1A, Room Number 101) determined about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> available to the user, and the user may select either all of the information made available by the application program <b>102</b> or any combination of the information made available by the application program <b>102</b>. Based on the information selected by the user, the application program <b>102</b> links the selected information with the electronic file and stores the information linked with the electronic file on the information database <b>106</b>, or the mobile telephony device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In other embodiments, the application program <b>102</b> learns, based on the information selected by the user, to make available to the user additional relevant information determined about the mobile telephony device <b>120</b>. In particular, the application program <b>102</b> learns by any one or more of a number of available learning approaches (e.g., artificial neural networks, supervised learning techniques, unsupervised learning techniques, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In still other embodiments, the application program <b>102</b> automatically selects uniform information to be linked with the electronic file <b>150</b>. For example, the application program <b>102</b> automatically selects the information such as the information about the location of the mobile telephony device <b>120</b>, and the information from the calendar of the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> and links the information with the electronic file <b>150</b>. Stated otherwise, the application program <b>102</b> links the same information with each of the electronic files.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In alternative embodiments the application program <b>102</b> is configured to determine information about a plurality of mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> and link the information determined about the plurality of mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> with the electronic file <b>150</b>. As previously discussed, the application program <b>102</b> determines the presence of the mobile telephony device <b>122</b> by determining if the mobile telephony device <b>122</b> is substantially proximate to the mobile telephony device <b>120</b>. In alternative embodiments, the application program <b>102</b> determines the presence of the mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> by determining if one or both the mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> are collocated with the computer system <b>140</b>. In particular, the application program <b>102</b> determines the location of the mobile telephony device <b>122</b> by any one or more of the location determination approaches. If the location of the mobile telephony device <b>122</b> is proximate to the mobile telephony device <b>120</b>, then the application program <b>102</b> determines that the mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> are collocated. The application program <b>102</b> may determine the presence of the mobile telephony device <b>122</b> by monitoring the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> to mobile telephony device <b>122</b> communication. The application program <b>102</b> determines information (e.g., information about a user of the mobile telephony device <b>122</b>, and information from a calendar on the mobile telephony device <b>122</b>) about the mobile telephony device <b>122</b> and links the information with the electronic file <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In yet other embodiments, the mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> captures a picture of the individuals proximate to the computer system <b>140</b> when the computer system <b>140</b> is performing an operation on the electronics file <b>150</b>. The application program <b>102</b> associates information about the individuals to the pictures, and the application program <b>102</b> links the information about the individuals and the pictures to the electronic file <b>150</b>. For example, the application program <b>102</b> stores the pictures of the individuals and information about the individuals, thus, when the individuals are again proximate to the computer system <b>140</b> (i.e. after the storage of the pictures and information about the individuals) the application program <b>102</b> automatically links information about the individuals and the pictures to the electronic file <b>150</b>.</p>

The information database <b>106</b> is queried based on user specified information, and an electronic file linked with the user specified information is retrieved from the electronic file database <b>104</b>, for example the second electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>b</i>. Consider, for purpose of explanation, that the information database <b>106</b> is queried with the user specified information such as John Doe, and Building 1A, Room Number 101. The information database <b>106</b> is searched based on the user specified information, and the electronic file linked with the user specified information is retrieved from the electronic file database <b>104</b>, for example the second electronic file <b>150</b>-<i>b</i>. In other embodiments, at least some of the information stored on the information database <b>106</b> is linked with a plurality of electronic files stored on the electronic files database <b>104</b>. In this case, a results list formed of the plurality of electronic files linked with the user specified information is retrieved from the electronic file database <b>104</b>. In at least some embodiments, the information database <b>106</b> is searched based on pre-determined information. For example, the information from the mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> is automatically pre-determined, and the information database <b>104</b> is searched based on the pre-determined information from the mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In other embodiments, the information linked with the electronic file is stored on the mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b>. In particular, a copy of the information linked with the electronic file or a cache of the information linked with the electronic file is stored on the mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b>. Thus, search and retrieval of electronic files from the electronic file database <b>104</b> is provided based on the information stored on the mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In particular, search and retrieval may be provided from any location by way of the mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> with direct wireless communication with a computer system, for example the computer system <b>140</b> or some other computer system, and the computer system communicating with the electronic file database <b>104</b>. The mobile telephony devices <b>120</b>-<b>122</b> are queried based on user specified information, and a results list formed of a plurality of electronic files linked with the user specified information is retrieved from the electronic file database <b>104</b>. For example, individual A wants to retrieve electronic files <b>150</b> relating to a project. If a copy of the information linked with electronic files <b>150</b> is stored on the individual A's mobile telephony device <b>120</b>, then individual A may use the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> to retrieve the electronic files <b>150</b>. The individual A enters specific information (e.g., meeting with Tom, Monday Jul. 1, 2007, Building A, room 806, etc.) into the mobile telephony device <b>120</b>, and the mobile telephony device <b>120</b> by communicating with the electronic file database <b>104</b> retrieves the electronic files <b>150</b>. In an embodiment, the system <b>100</b> and/or the application <b>102</b> may recognize that the user is browsing files associated with a particular location, event, or other recognizable contextual cue and query the user if they want to retrieve all files associated with the contextual cue. For example, when visiting a location of a cabin and browsing picture files, the system <b>100</b> and/or the application <b>102</b> may identify the association between the current location at the cabin and a large number of picture files (for example pictures taken during a family vacation at the cabin in a previous year) that are associated with the contextual cue of the location of the cabin and ask if the user wants to retrieve all picture files associated with the location of the cabin.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In addition to associating contextual information with the electronic files <b>150</b> automatically, in an embodiment, the system <b>100</b> and/or the application <b>102</b> may provide an interface for a user to manually or explicitly associate cues or tags with the files <b>150</b> for use in searching for and retrieving the files <b>150</b>.</p>
