<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to the field of communication networks and in particular to dynamic networks with bitrate agility.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Current communication networks comprises different types of transmission links having different bitrates. Thus, in order to reduce transmission costs while providing enhanced services, an idea is to aggregate a plurality of low bitrate data streams into a high bitrate data stream for high speed communications.
<br/>
In the state of the art, concentrators allowing to aggregate several signals are known but the bitrate of the output transmission link is always the same whatever the number of received signals. Indeed, in case of inactive inputs, bit padding is achieved in order to compensate for the missing signal.
<br/>
Thus, useless signals are transmitted which maximizes the required amount of energy and may lead to a reduced signal quality.
<br/>
Besides, another solution for adapting the bitrate of the output port of a concentrator is to modify the Internet Protocol (IP) router so that it can deliver variable bitrates. However, such solution requires significant and expensive modifications and may lead to compatibility issues with existing routers.
</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">It is therefore an object of the present invention to overcome the above cited drawbacks of the state of the art and provide a method allowing to aggregate a variable number of input low bitrate signals into an output signal with a variable high bitrate without requiring important modifications in the network design.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Thus, the present invention refers to a signal concentrator comprising:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0005">a parallel to serial conversion device comprising a plurality of parallel inputs and a serial output,</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0006">a control unit comprising detection means adapted for detecting the activity of said plurality of parallel inputs of said parallel to serial conversion device, indication means adapted for indicating the active parallel inputs to the parallel to serial conversion device and controlling means adapted for setting an operating bitrate of the serial output in function of said activity of said plurality of parallel inputs.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0007">According to another embodiment, the controlling means comprise a clock signal generator for generating a clock signal in function of the activity of said plurality of parallel inputs, said clock signal allowing the setting of the operating bitrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0008">According to a further embodiment, the plurality of parallel inputs of the parallel to serial conversion device are coupled to a plurality of fixed bitrate transmission lines and the activity detection of a parallel input comprises the detection of a received data signal at said parallel input.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0009">According to an additional embodiment, the transmission lines have the same bitrate.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0010">According to another embodiment, the operating bitrate of the serial output is determined by detecting the number of active parallel inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0011">According to a further embodiment, the signals received by the parallel inputs have different bitrates and the control unit comprises determination means adapted to determine the bitrate of the received signals.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0012">According to an additional embodiment, the clock signal corresponds to the sum of the clock rates of the active parallel inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0013">According to another embodiment, the parallel to serial conversion device comprises a First In First Out (FIFO) queue, the active parallel inputs are sequentially scanned and a predetermined number of bits of the signals received on said active parallel inputs is transmitted to the FIFO queue the output of which corresponds to the output of the parallel to serial conversion device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0014">According to a further embodiment, the predetermined number of bits is equal to one.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0015">According to an additional embodiment, the predetermined number of bits corresponds to a byte.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0016">According to another embodiment, the predetermined number of bits corresponds to a frame.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0030">As used herein, the term &#x201c;active input&#x201d; refers to an input receiving data signals;</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0031">As used herein, the term &#x201c;Gb/s&#x201d; refers to the unit gigabit per second;</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0032">As used herein, the term &#x201c;GHz&#x201d; refers to the unit gigahertz;</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0033">An embodiment of the present invention refers to a concentrator or transmission system <b>1</b> as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> allowing to aggregate the signals received on a plurality of parallel input channels <b>3</b> onto a serial output channel <b>5</b> having a bitrate equal to the sum of the bitrates of the input channels <b>3</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the transmission system comprises four input channels <b>3</b> having each a 10 Gb/s bitrate such that the output channel <b>5</b> has a 40 Gb/s bitrate. Moreover, a clock signal <b>7</b> corresponding to the bitrate of the output channel (40 GHz in the present case) is provided. Besides, if only three of the input channels <b>3</b> are active as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bitrate of the output channel <b>5</b> becomes 30 Gb/s corresponding to a clock signal <b>7</b> of 30 GHz. In addition, an adaptation of the bitrate to the actual needs allows to save energy and to improve the signal quality when the bit rate is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents a possible embodiment of a transmission system <b>1</b> according to the present invention. Said transmission system <b>1</b> comprises four input channels <b>3</b>, also called tributaries, having each a bit rate of 10 Gb/s.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0035">It has to be noted that the value of 10 Gb/s and the number of four input channels <b>3</b> are given as examples (because of the general use of 10 and 40 Gb/s transmission links in the current communication networks) but any value may be used in the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0036">Said tributaries <b>3</b> are connected to parallel First In First Out (FIFO) inputs <b>9</b>. An additional control data channel <b>11</b> provides the status (active or idle) of the input channels <b>3</b>. Said control data channel <b>11</b> is connected to the activity detection means <b>15</b> of each FIFO inputs <b>9</b>. In the first section <b>101</b> of the transmission system <b>1</b>, the data of the active streams transmitted on the input channels <b>3</b> are received in the corresponding queues of the FIFO inputs <b>9</b>. Then, a predetermined number of bits <b>13</b>, corresponding to the slot size, of each active FIFO queue is copied to the corresponding input <b>17</b> of a switch <b>19</b> at a clock rate of 10 GHz.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0037">Said predetermined number of bits <b>13</b> depends on the configuration chosen and allow to select the optimal trade-off between buffer size (queue length) and clock frequency. It can be, for example, a bit per bit, a byte per byte or a frame per frame selection.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0038">In section <b>102</b>, the switch <b>19</b> scans sequentially the selected predetermined number of bits of each active input <b>17</b> and write said bits in an output FIFO queue <b>21</b>. The scanning rate is equal to (40/n) GHz where n is the predetermined number of bits <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0039">Besides, the control data channel <b>11</b> is also connected to a frequency generator <b>23</b>. Thus, at step <b>103</b>, the frequency generator <b>23</b> generates a clock signal <b>7</b> corresponding to the actual total bitrate, for example, in the present example with four active input streams of 10 Gb/s, the generated clock signal is 4*10 GHz, that is to say 40 GHz.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0040">The data of the output FIFO queue <b>21</b> are therefore read out, multiplexed and transmitted to the output channel <b>5</b> at a 40 Gb/s bitrate.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0041">If one of the input channels <b>3</b> becomes inactive, as it is the case in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the information of such inactivity (idle status) is brought by the control data channel to the transmission system <b>1</b>. As a consequence, the switch <b>21</b> will only scan the three remaining active inputs <b>17</b> and the frequency generator <b>23</b> will generate a clock signal of 30 GHz such that the data of the output FIFO queue <b>21</b> will be read out and transmitted to the output channel <b>5</b> at a 30 Gb/s bitrate.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0042">Besides, in the case of an optical network, a variable bitrate optical transponder may be coupled to the output channel <b>5</b> in order to convert the electronic signal into a corresponding optical signal having the same bitrate. Thus, the bitrate of the transmitted optical signal varies in function of the amount of data needed to be transmitted through the optical network.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0043">After transmission through the communication network, the signal is received at the egress node. In the case of an optical transmission network, the signal is converted to an electronic signal thanks to an optical transponder located at the input of the egress node.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> represents a possible embodiment of a distributor or reception system <b>2</b>. The operation achieved by said reception system <b>2</b> corresponds to the converse operation with respect to the transmission system <b>1</b> presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0045">The transmitted signal is received on a FIFO input <b>27</b> through an input channel <b>25</b>. The clock signal <b>7</b> is also transmitted and received at the reception system <b>2</b>. Said clock signal <b>7</b> is transmitted to the FIFO input <b>27</b> in order to allow said input to process the received data. In addition, a control data channel <b>37</b> comprising information required for demultiplexing the received signals is connected to the reception system <b>2</b>. Said information comprises, for example, the total bitrate, the number of active input channels and the slot size (number of bits used for the multiplexing). Based on this information and using the clock signal <b>7</b>, a switch controller <b>31</b> manages the position of the switch <b>29</b> in order to distribute the signal among the FIFO outputs <b>33</b>. A clock signal (for example of 10 GHz) generated by a clock generator <b>35</b> is distributed to the different FIFO outputs <b>33</b> in order to transmit the demultiplexed signals at the required bitrate (for example 10 Gb/s) to the output channels <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0046">Based on the previous example, if the received signal has a bitrate of 40 Gb/s and is composed of four active input channels which have a slot size of one byte, then the switch controller <b>31</b> will send the first received byte to the first FIFO output <b>33</b>, the second byte to the second FIFO output <b>33</b> and so on sequentially such that the four initial signals received at the four input channels <b>3</b> of the transmission system <b>1</b> will be recreated at the FIFO outputs <b>33</b>. In the case described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the signal received on the input channel <b>25</b> has a bitrate of 30 Gb/s and is composed of three active input channels. Said information is transmitted through the control data channel <b>37</b> and in the same way, the three signals will be recreated at the three corresponding output channels <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0047">According to another embodiment, the signals received on the different input channels <b>3</b> have different bitrates (for example 10 Gb/s for the first two input channels and 5 Gb/s for the two following input channels) or different format corresponding to slightly different bitrates. In such situation, the position of the switch <b>19</b> will be monitored in order to take into account the different bitrates such that the time spent by the switch in a position corresponds to the time required in function of the bitrate of the corresponding input channel <b>3</b>. Moreover, additional data (such as the individual bitrates) will be added in the control data signal <b>37</b> in order to allow the switch controller <b>31</b> and the switch <b>29</b> to correctly demultiplex the received signal. Besides, the clock generator <b>35</b> will have to generate individual clock signal for each signal in order to recreate the initial signal at the FIFO outputs <b>33</b>. Thus with two input channels of 10 Gb/s and two channels of 5 Gb/s, when all the input channels <b>3</b> are active, the operating bitrate of the output channel <b>5</b> is 30 Gb/s and comprises four tributaries. The control data channel will then transmit said information to the reception system <b>2</b> in order to recreate the four signals with two signals having a 10 Gb/s bitrate and two signals having a 5 Gb/s bitrate at the output channels <b>39</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0048">As a conclusion, the embodiments of the present invention allow to adapt the bitrate of transmitted signals in function of the number of active input channel signals. Such bitrate agility reduces the power consumption, allows adaptation of the network to the customers needs and eases the upgrade of the current networks to improved capacities. Moreover, the reduction of the bitrate of the transmitted signal reduces signal impairments and therefore leads to a better signal quality.</p>
