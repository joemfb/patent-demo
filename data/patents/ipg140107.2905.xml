<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a polyester resin composition containing a triazine compound and a polyester resin, and a molded article using the composition.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">Conventionally, it has been done to impart an ultraviolet absorbing property by using an ultraviolet absorber in combination with various resins or the like. An inorganic ultraviolet absorber or an organic ultraviolet absorber is used as the ultraviolet absorber. In the case of an inorganic ultraviolet absorber (see, for example, Patent Documents 1 to 3), the durability such as weather resistance and heat resistance is excellent, but since the absorption wavelength is determined by the band gap of the compound, the latitude in selection is narrow, leading to the fact that an absorber capable of absorbing light even in the long-wavelength ultraviolet (UV-A) region of around 400 nm is not known and an absorber capable of absorbing light in the long-wavelength ultraviolet region has absorption also in the visible region and therefore, involves coloring.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">In contrast, the organic ultraviolet absorber has a wide latitude in designing the absorber structure and therefore, absorbers having various absorption wavelengths can be obtained by designing the absorber structure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Systems using various organic ultraviolet absorbers have been heretofore studied, and Patent Document 4 discloses a triazole-based ultraviolet absorber. Also, Patent Document 5 describes a trisaryl-s-triazine having an alkoxy group and a hydroxy group at specific positions. However, those having a maximum absorption wavelength in the long-wavelength ultraviolet region are poor in the light resistance, and their ultraviolet blocking effect wears off with the passage of time.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">Furthermore, a material applied to a solar cell or the like recently under development must be exposed to sunlight outdoors for a long period of time, and due to exposure to ultraviolet light over long term aging, the material is unavoidably deteriorated in its property. Accordingly, a compound exhibiting a blocking effect even in the UV-A region and being usable as an ultraviolet absorber with more excellent light resistance than ever is demanded.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">On the other hand, the benzophenone-based or benzotriazole-based ultraviolet absorber has relatively good light resistance and when the concentration or film thickness is increased, can relatively clearly cut light up to a long-wavelength region (see, for example, Patent Documents 6 and 7). However, in the case of coating such an ultraviolet absorber by mixing it with a resin or the like, the film thickness is usually limited to about tens of &#x3bc;m at most. For cutting light up to a long-wavelength region with such a film thickness, an ultraviolet absorber must be added in a fairly high concentration, but mere addition in a high concentration is faced with a problem of causing precipitation of the ultraviolet absorber or bleed-out during long-term use. Addition in a high concentration may also bring about a problem in terms of odor. In addition, many of the benzophenone-based or benzotriazole-based ultraviolet absorbers have low solubility, and it has been difficult to coat the absorber by mixing it with a resin or the like in a high concentration.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">Problems that the Invention is to Solve</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0014">An object of the present invention is to provide a polyester resin composition being able to maintain a long-wavelength ultraviolet-blocking effect for a long period of time, ensuring high solubility for a solvent and no problem in terms of odor, and having excellent light resistance. Another object of the present invention is to provide a molded article having a long-wavelength ultraviolet-blocking effect, such as film, where thanks to high solubility for a solvent, precipitation or bleed-out scarcely occurs with long-term aging and the color hue is kept from changing.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Advantage of the Invention</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0044">By virtue of containing the compound represented by formula (1), which exhibits high solubility in an organic solvent and an ultraviolet-blocking effect even in the long-wavelength ultraviolet region as well as light resistance, the polyester resin composition of the present invention maintains a long-wavelength ultraviolet-blocking effect for a long period of time, exhibits high solubility for a solvent, and is reduced in change of the color hue with long-term aging. Furthermore, by molding the composition, a molded article having a long-wavelength ultraviolet-blocking effect, such as film, where precipitation or bleed-out scarcely occurs with long-term aging and the color hue is kept from changing, can be obtained. In addition, although the ultraviolet absorber composition is preferably odorless depending on the application, the ultraviolet absorber composition of the present invention is odorless even when used in a high concentration and is excellent also in view of odor.</p>

<p id="p-0078" num="0099">The maximum absorption wavelength and half-value width specified in the present invention can be easily measured by one skilled in the art. The measuring method is described, for example, in <i>Dai </i>4-<i>han Jikken Kagaku Koza </i>7<i>, Bunko II </i>(4<i>th ed., Experimental Chemistry Course </i>7<i>, Spectroscopy II</i>), pp. 180-186, edited by Chemical Society of Japan, Maruzen (1992). Specifically, the sample is dissolved in an appropriate solvent and the spectrum is measured in a spectrophotometer by using two quartz-made or glass-made cells, that is, one cell for the sample and another cell for control, whereby the maximum absorption wavelength and half-value width are determined. The properties required of the solvent used here are, for example, to dissolve the sample, have no absorption in the measurement wavelength region, cause little interaction with the solute molecule, and be not excessively volatile. An arbitrary solvent may be used as long as the requirements above are satisfied. In the present invention, the measurement is performed using ethyl acetate (EtOAc) as the solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0100">The maximum absorption wavelength and half-value width of the compound in the present invention are a value determined using a quartz cell having an optical path length of 10 mm after preparing a solution in a concentration of about 5&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>mol&#xb7;dm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>by using ethyl acetate as the solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0101">The spectral half-value width is described, for example, in <i>Dai </i>4-<i>han Jikken Kagaku Koza </i>3<i>, Kihon Sosa III </i>(4<i>th ed., Experimental Chemistry Course </i>3<i>, Basic Operation III</i>), page 154, edited by Chemical Society of Japan, Maruzen (1991). Incidentally, the half-value width is described in the literature above by labeling the abscissa with a wavenumber scale, but the half-value width used in the present invention is a value when the axis is marked with a wavelength scale, and the unit of the half-value width is nm. Specifically, the half-value width indicates the width of the absorption band of &#xbd; of the absorbance at the maximum absorption wavelength and is used as an indicator of the absorption spectral shape. A spectrum with a small half-value width is a sharp spectrum, and a spectrum with a large half-value width is a broad spectrum. The ultraviolet absorbing compound giving a broad spectrum has absorption also in a broad region on the longer wavelength side than the maximum absorption wavelength and therefore, in order to effectively block light in the long-wavelength ultraviolet range with no yellow tinting, an ultraviolet absorbing compound giving a spectrum with a small half-value width is preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0102">As described in Sumio Tokita, <i>Kagaku Seminar </i>9<i>, Color Chemistry </i>(<i>Chemistry Seminar </i>9<i>, Color Chemistry</i>), pp. 154-155, Maruzen (1982), the absorption intensity of light, namely, the oscillator intensity, is proportional to the integral of the molar extinction coefficient and when the absorption spectrum has good symmetry, the oscillator intensity is proportional to the product of the absorbance at the maximum absorption wavelength and the half-value width (here, the half-value width is a value when the axis is marked with a wavelength scale). This indicates that as long as the value of transition moment is the same, a compound having a spectrum with a small half-value width exhibits large absorbance at the maximum absorption wavelength. Use of such an ultraviolet absorbing compound is advantageous in that light in the region around the maximum absorption wavelength can be effectively blocked only by its use in a small amount, but absorbance at the wavelength a little distance away from the maximum absorption wavelength rapidly decreases, and this makes it impossible to block light over a wide region.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0103">The molar extinction coefficient at the maximum absorption wavelength of the compound represented by formula (1) is preferably 20,000 or more, more preferably 30,000 or more, still more preferably 50,000 or more. With a molecular extinction coefficient of 20,000 or more, the absorption efficiency per mass of the compound represented by formula (1) is sufficiently high and the amount of the compound represented by formula (1) used for completely absorbing light in the ultraviolet region can be reduced. This is also preferred from the standpoint of preventing irritation to skin or accumulation in vivo and hardly causing bleed-out. Incidentally, the molar extinction coefficient used here is based on the definition described, for example, in <i>Shin</i>-<i>han Jikken Kagaku Koza </i>9<i>, Bunseki Kagaku [II</i>] (<i>New Edition, Experimental Chemistry Course </i>9<i>, Analytical Chemistry [II</i>])&#x201d;, page 244, edited by Chemical Society of Japan, Maruzen (1977) and can be determined together at the time of determining the above-described maximum absorption wavelength and half-value width.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0104">The polyester resin composition of the present invention can contain the compound represented by formula (1) in an arbitrary amount necessary to impart the desired performance. The content varies depending on the compound or resin used but can be appropriately determined. The content in the resin composition is preferably from 0.01 to 30 mass %, more preferably from 0.1 to 15 mass %, still more preferably from 1.0 to 4.0 mass %. The content in the range above is preferred, because a higher ultraviolet-blocking effect is obtained and the bleed-out can be more effectively suppressed.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0105">The polyester resin composition of the present invention may contain, as the ultraviolet absorber, two or more kinds of compounds represented by formula (1) having different structures, as described above. Also, the compound represented by formula (1) and one or more kinds of ultraviolet absorbers having a structure other than the formula above may be used in combination. When two kinds (preferably three kinds) of ultraviolet absorbers differing in the basic framework structure are used, ultraviolet light in a wide wavelength region can be absorbed. Also, use of two or more kinds of ultraviolet absorbers has an action of stabilizing the dispersion state of the ultraviolet absorbers. As for the ultraviolet absorber having a structure other than formula (1), any ultraviolet absorber may be used, and examples thereof include triazine-based, benzotriazole-based, benzophenone-based, merocyanine-based, cyanine-based, dibenzoylmethane-based, cinnamic acid-based, cyanoacrylate-based and benzoic ester-based compounds. Other examples include the ultraviolet absorbers described in <i>Fine Chemical</i>, pp. 28-38 (May 2004), <i>Kobunshi</i>-<i>yo Kinousei Tenkabutsu no Shin Tenkai </i>(<i>New Development of Functional Additives for Polymers</i>), pp. 96-140, issued by Toray Research Center Inc., Technical Survey Dept. (Toray Research Center Inc., 1999), and Yasuichi Okatsu (supervisor), <i>Kobunshi Tenkazai no Kaihatsu to Kankyo Taisaku </i>(<i>Development of Polymer Additives and Environmental Measures</i>), pp. 54-64, CMC Publishing (2003).</p>

<p id="p-0086" num="0107">As described above, the polyester resin composition of the present invention preferably contains a compound represented by formula (1) and a benzoxazinone-based compound in combination. The compound represented by formula (1) has excellent light resistance also in the long-wavelength region and therefore, produces an effect of preventing deterioration of benzoxazinone that can block light up to a longer wavelength region, and thanks to use together with a benzoxazinone-based compound, the blocking effect up to a longer wavelength region can be advantageously maintained for a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0108">The polyester resin composition of the present invention can practically produce a sufficient ultraviolet-blocking effect only by using the compound represented by formula (1) as the ultraviolet absorber but, if the requirement is more strict, a white pigment having a strong hiding power, such as titanium oxide, may be used in combination.

(wherein m represents the degree of polymerization, and R is hydrogen, silicon or a metal such as magnesium and aluminum). In this way, a complete inorganic silica-based binder is obtained. As the inorganic silica-based binder, silica gel (SiO<sub>x</sub>.nH<sub>2</sub>O) may be also used. In the hardcoat layer, the hardcoat performance is important and therefore, it is preferred to contain as much inorganic silica-based compound as possible within a range where the required adherence is maintained. Also, in the hardcoat layer, an inorganic ultraviolet scattering agent may be incorporated, if desired, as long as the scratch resistance is not impaired. The hardcoat layer can be formed by coating a hardcoat agent-containing coating solution on the multilayer substrate by a known method such as bar coating, knife coating, roll coating, blade coating, die coating and gravure coating, and then heating and thereby curing the coating.

<p id="p-0273" num="0297">Photovoltaic modules were fabricated using the solar cell protective sheets of Production Examples 1 to 4 and measured for the energy conversion efficiency. It was found that as for the energy conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic module having a solar cell protective sheet using the polyester resin composition of the present invention, a high energy conversion efficiency is obtained as compared with the conventional protective sheet using an ultraviolet absorber. The solar cell protective sheet using the polyester resin composition of the present invention can be incorporated into a known photovoltaic module. As Comparative Examples 3 to 6, films containing the same amount of comparative ultraviolet absorbers in place of the ultraviolet absorbers used in Production Examples were produced in the same manner, and Examples 14 to 17 were evaluated based on Comparative Examples 3 to 6.</p>

<p id="p-0275" num="0299">Incidentally, measurement of the energy conversion efficiency of the photovoltaic cell was performed as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0300">A xenon lamp of 500 W (manufactured by Ushio, Inc.) was mounted with a correction filter for sunlight simulation (AM1.5 direct (trade name), manufactured by Oriel), and the solar cell was irradiated with a pseudo-sunlight having an incident light intensity of 100 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, from the side of the porous semiconductor fine particle electrode (photosensitive electrode). The device was fixed closely on the stage of a thermostat, and the temperature of the device during irradiation was controlled to 50&#xb0; C. The DC voltage applied to the device was scanned by using a current voltage analyzer (Source Measure Unit Model 238, manufactured by Keithley Instruments, Inc.) at a constant rate of 10 mV/sec, and the photocurrent output from the device was measured to measure the photocurrent-voltage characteristics and thereby determine the energy conversion efficiency.</p>

<p id="p-0282" num="0306">Polyethylene terephthalate having an intrinsic viscosity of 1.0 was spun by an extruder-type spinning machine, and the obtained fiber was imparted with an oil containing Compound (m-21) as the ultraviolet absorber and then stretched to obtain a polyester yarn having a fineness of 1,260 deniers and a single-yarn fineness of 11.7 deniers. The amount of the oil attached was 1 mass % based on the mass of the fiber. The obtained fiber had good light resistance.</p>
<p id="h-0057" num="0000">Industrial Applicability</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0307">By virtue of containing the compound represented by formula (1), which exhibits high solubility in an organic solvent and an ultraviolet-blocking effect even in the long-wavelength ultraviolet region as well as light resistance, the polyester resin composition of the present invention maintains a long-wavelength ultraviolet-blocking effect for a long period of time, exhibits high solubility for a solvent, and is reduced in change of the color hue with long-term aging. Furthermore, by molding the composition, a molded article such as film having a long-wavelength ultraviolet-blocking effect and being kept from precipitation or bleed-out with long-term aging as well as change in the color hue can be obtained. In addition, although the ultraviolet absorber composition is preferably odorless depending on the application, the ultraviolet absorber composition of the present invention is odorless even when used in a high concentration and is excellent also in view of odor.</p>
