<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The conductive member <b>160</b> is disposed to be connected to a side surface of the chassis <b>130</b> and a grounding pattern <b>151</b><i>a </i>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the main FPC <b>150</b>. For example, the conductive member <b>160</b> may extend along the y-axis, while the liquid display panel <b>110</b> may extend along the x-axis. Here, the conductive member <b>160</b> may not exceed the side part <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the chassis <b>130</b>, e.g., the conductive member <b>160</b> may not extend along the y-axis beyond the bottom part <b>130</b><i>a </i>of the chassis <b>130</b>. Thus, a thickness of the liquid crystal display apparatus <b>100</b> is not increased.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A width of the conductive member <b>160</b> along the x-axis may be adjusted variously. For example, the conductive member may be spaced apart from the PCB <b>140</b> along the x-axis, so the conductive member <b>160</b> and the PCB <b>140</b> do not contact each other. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the conductive member <b>160</b> is separated a predetermined distance from the PCB <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The conductive member <b>160</b> may be formed of various materials and in various shapes. For example, the conductive member <b>160</b> may be formed as a tape. Thus, the conductive member <b>160</b> easily contacts the chassis <b>130</b> and the main FPC <b>150</b>. In particular, the conductive member <b>160</b> easily contacts the grounding pattern <b>151</b><i>a </i>of the main FPC <b>150</b>. Connection between the conductive member <b>160</b> and the grounding pattern <b>151</b><i>a </i>will be described later.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In another example, the conductive member <b>160</b> may be formed of a conductive paste. That is, the conductive paste is disposed to contact the side part <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the chassis <b>130</b> and the grounding pattern <b>151</b><i>a </i>of the main FPC <b>150</b>, and then, dried to form the conductive member <b>160</b> at a solid state.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The conductive member <b>160</b> is elongated in a predetermined direction. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the conductive member <b>160</b> is formed to have a length along the z-axis corresponding to a width of the main FPC <b>150</b> in a same direction, i.e., along the z-axis. In more detail, the conductive member <b>160</b> is formed so that the length corresponds to a width of the main FPC <b>150</b> in a direction that is perpendicular to a direction connecting an end portion contacting the liquid crystal panel <b>110</b> and the other end contacting the PCB <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Since the conductive member <b>160</b> is formed to be sufficiently long to correspond to the width of the main FPC <b>150</b> in a certain direction, e.g., the conductive member <b>160</b> and the main FPC <b>150</b> may overlap each other, the conductive member <b>160</b> effectively supports the main FPC <b>150</b>. As such, the conductive member <b>160</b> prevents the main FPC <b>150</b> from being torn or damaged, thereby improving the durability of the main FPC <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The connection between the conductive member <b>160</b> and the grounding pattern <b>151</b><i>a </i>of the main FPC <b>150</b> will be described in detail as follows. For the convenience of description, the conductive member <b>160</b> is not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the main FPC <b>150</b> includes a base member <b>153</b>, a wiring pattern <b>151</b>, and a protective layer <b>152</b>. The wiring pattern <b>151</b> includes the grounding pattern <b>151</b><i>a</i>, and the protective layer <b>152</b> includes a penetration portion <b>152</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The base member <b>153</b> may be formed as a film by using an insulating material, such as polyimide. A plurality of wiring patterns <b>151</b> are formed on the base member <b>153</b>, and each of the wiring patterns <b>151</b> includes one or more grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The protective layer <b>152</b> is formed on the wiring patterns <b>151</b> by using an insulating material. The protective layer <b>152</b> includes a penetration portion <b>152</b><i>a </i>having a predetermined size. The penetration portion <b>152</b><i>a </i>is formed to correspond to the grounding pattern <b>151</b><i>a</i>, e.g., the penetration portion <b>152</b><i>a </i>exposes the grounding pattern <b>151</b><i>a</i>, so the grounding pattern <b>151</b><i>a </i>is not covered by the protective layer <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The conductive member <b>160</b> is disposed to cover the penetration portion <b>152</b><i>a</i>, and thus the conductive member <b>160</b> contacts the grounding pattern <b>151</b><i>a</i>. Since the conductive member <b>160</b> is formed as a tape or formed of a conductive paste, the conductive member <b>160</b> contacts the grounding pattern <b>151</b><i>a </i>with flexibility, and then an adhering force between the conductive member <b>160</b> and the grounding pattern <b>151</b><i>a </i>may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the protective layer <b>152</b> includes two penetration portions <b>152</b><i>a</i>. That is, in the present embodiment, two grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a </i>are formed, and two penetration portions <b>152</b><i>a </i>corresponding to the grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a </i>are formed. However, the example embodiments are not limited thereto. That is, the number of the grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a </i>may be variously set, and the number of the penetration portions <b>152</b><i>a </i>may also vary depending on the number of the grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the conductive member <b>160</b> contacts the base member <b>153</b> and the protective layer <b>152</b>, as well as the grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a</i>. Thus, the coupling force between the conductive member <b>160</b> and the main FPC <b>150</b> may be improved. In addition, the supporting effect of the conductive member <b>160</b> with respect to the main FPC <b>150</b> is increased, and thus the durability of the main FPC <b>150</b> is also improved.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In addition, the conductive member <b>160</b> is formed to have a width that may cover the penetration portions <b>152</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>. Therefore, the grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a </i>may not be exposed to outside via the penetration portions <b>152</b><i>a</i>, and accordingly, contamination or damage of the grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a </i>may be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a silicon member <b>190</b> is formed to contact the side surface of the liquid crystal panel <b>110</b> and the main FPC <b>150</b>. In detail, the silicon member <b>190</b> is formed on the first surface <b>150</b><i>a </i>of the main FPC <b>150</b>, and is disposed between the conductive member <b>160</b> and the liquid crystal panel <b>110</b>. The silicon member <b>190</b> may contact the conductive member <b>160</b> and the chassis <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the liquid crystal display apparatus <b>100</b> according to the present embodiment, the conductive member <b>160</b> is formed to contact the side part <b>130</b><i>b </i>of the chassis <b>130</b> and the grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a </i>of the main FPC <b>150</b>. The conductive member <b>160</b> functions as a path for static electricity or for other electromagnetic waves. Thus, defects of the liquid crystal display apparatus <b>100</b> caused by the static electricity may be prevented. In particular, static electricity generated around the PCB <b>140</b> or the main FPC <b>150</b> may be diverted via the conductive member <b>160</b>, thereby preventing or substantially minimizing potential defects around the PCB <b>140</b> or the main FPC <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In addition, since the conductive member <b>160</b> is formed on the grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a </i>in a state where the conductive member <b>160</b> is flexible, e.g., due to its shape of a tape or a paste, the adhering force between the conductive member <b>160</b> and the grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a </i>is improved. Thus, conductive member <b>160</b> effectively functions as the path of the static electricity.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In addition, the grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a </i>for the grounding are not disposed on an additional member, but disposed in the wiring patterns <b>151</b> of the main FPC <b>150</b>. Therefore, the fabrication processes may be simple and integration effect of the liquid crystal display apparatus <b>100</b> is improved. Further, since the grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a </i>are exposed via the penetration portions <b>152</b><i>a </i>and the penetration portions <b>152</b><i>a </i>are covered by the conductive member <b>160</b>, the grounding patterns <b>151</b><i>a </i>are not exposed to outside and may not be damaged.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In addition, the conductive member <b>160</b> simultaneously contacts the chassis <b>130</b> and the main FPC <b>150</b>, and thus, the conductive member <b>160</b> may support the main FPC <b>150</b> so that the durability of the main FPC <b>150</b> is improved. In particular, the conductive member <b>160</b> is elongated so as to correspond to the width of the main FPC <b>150</b>, and thus, the conductive member <b>160</b> effectively supports the main FPC <b>150</b>, and thereby improving the durability of the main FPC <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic cross-sectional view of a liquid crystal display apparatus <b>200</b> according to another embodiment. For the convenience of description, elements that are different from those of the previous embodiment will be described as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the liquid crystal display apparatus <b>200</b> includes a liquid crystal panel <b>210</b>, a PCB <b>240</b>, a chassis <b>230</b>, a light source <b>220</b>, a main FPC <b>250</b>, and a conductive member <b>260</b>. The liquid crystal panel <b>210</b> includes an upper substrate <b>201</b>, a lower substrate <b>202</b>, and liquid crystal disposed between the upper and lower substrates <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>. A driving IC <b>215</b> is mounted on a side portion of the liquid crystal panel <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A reflective plate <b>227</b> is formed between the light source <b>220</b> and the chassis <b>230</b>. A light source FPC <b>225</b> is disposed on an end portion of the light source <b>220</b> and supplies a driving power to the light source <b>220</b>. An optical sheet <b>280</b> is disposed between the light source <b>220</b> and the liquid crystal panel <b>210</b>. A mold frame <b>270</b> is disposed around the light source <b>220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The conductive member <b>260</b> is disposed so as to be connected to a side surface of the chassis <b>230</b> and a grounding pattern (not shown) of the main FPC <b>250</b>. The conductive member <b>260</b> has the same structure as that of the previous embodiment, and thus, detailed descriptions are not provided here.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Unlike the liquid crystal display apparatus <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the liquid crystal display apparatus <b>200</b> of the present embodiment does not include the silicon member <b>190</b>. Therefore, fabrication processes of the liquid crystal display apparatus <b>200</b> are simplified, and generation of impurities, which may occur when the silicon member is formed, may be prevented. It is noted that the mold frame <b>270</b> may be larger than the mold <b>170</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and may occupy a space of the silicon member <b>190</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Thus, the coupling force between the mold frame <b>270</b> and the chassis <b>230</b> may be improved.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">According to the liquid crystal display apparatus of the example embodiments, defects caused by static electricity may be prevented and the durability of the apparatus may be improved. In contrast, a liquid crystal display apparatus without a conductive member may have defects caused by the static electricity generated on the PCB, i.e., generates signals for driving the liquid crystal panel, and the FPC, on which a plurality of wires are formed, thereby exhibiting reduced quality.</p>
