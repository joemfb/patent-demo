<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">As the demand for smaller electronic products grows, manufacturers and others in the electronics industry continually seek ways to reduce the size of integrated circuits used in the electronic products. In that regard, three-dimensional type integrated circuit packaging techniques have been developed and used.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">One packaging technique that has been developed is Package-on-Package (PoP). As the name implies, PoP is a semiconductor packaging innovation that involves stacking one package on top of another package. A PoP device may combine vertically discrete memory and logic packages. In PoP package designs, the top package may be interconnected to the bottom package using through assembly vias (TAVs) and/or solder balls in a ball grid array (BGA). Unfortunately, the TAVs and the BGA solder balls may present undesirable limitations.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The making and using of the presently preferred embodiments are discussed in detail below. It should be appreciated, however, that the present disclosure provides many applicable inventive concepts that can be embodied in a wide variety of specific contexts. The specific embodiments discussed are merely illustrative and do not limit the scope of the disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present disclosure will be described with respect to preferred embodiments in a specific context, namely a package-on-package (PoP) semiconductor device. The concepts in the disclosure may also apply, however, to other semiconductor structures or circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a conventional PoP device <b>10</b> is illustrated. The PoP device <b>10</b> generally includes a top package <b>12</b> and a bottom package <b>14</b>. The top package <b>12</b> may include, for example, vertically discrete memory components while the bottom package <b>14</b> may include a logic component (a logic integrated circuit, analog circuit, and so on).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The top package <b>12</b> may be mounted to the bottom package <b>14</b> using, for example, a flip-chip bonding process such as chip-on-wafer (CoW). As such, the top package <b>12</b> and the bottom package <b>14</b> are electrically and mechanically coupled to each other through a plurality of solder bumps <b>16</b> and top contacts <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The top and bottom packages <b>12</b>, <b>14</b> are also electrically coupled to each other by way of through assembly vias (TAVs) <b>20</b>. The through assembly vias <b>20</b>, which may also be known as through mold vias (TMVs) if formed in a wafer mold layer <b>22</b> of the PoP device <b>10</b>, generally extend vertically through a portion of the bottom package <b>14</b>. As shown, the through assembly vias <b>20</b> extend between one of the top contacts <b>18</b> and one of the redistribution layers <b>24</b> formed in a substrate <b>26</b> of the bottom package <b>14</b>. As such, the top contacts <b>18</b> are electrically coupled to the top redistribution layer <b>24</b> in the bottom package <b>14</b>. As shown, the redistribution layers <b>24</b>, along with bottom contacts <b>28</b> and solder balls <b>30</b> in a ball grid array (BGA) <b>32</b>, may be employed to electrically couple the entire PoP device <b>10</b> to other electronic circuitry such as, for example, a printed circuit board (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a PoP device <b>34</b> in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure is illustrated. The PoP device <b>34</b> generally includes a top package <b>36</b> and a bottom package <b>38</b>. The top package <b>34</b> may include, for example, vertically discrete memory components while the bottom package <b>38</b> may include a logic component (a logic integrated circuit, analog circuit, and so on). In some embodiments, the top and bottom packages <b>36</b>, <b>38</b> may include a variety of other electronic devices and/or circuitry as well.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The top package <b>36</b> may be mounted to the bottom package <b>38</b> using, for example, a flip-chip bonding process such as chip-on-wafer (CoW). As such, the top package <b>36</b> and the bottom package <b>38</b> are electrically and mechanically coupled to each other through a plurality of solder bumps <b>40</b> and top contacts <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In contrast to the PoP device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the top package <b>36</b> of the PoP device <b>34</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is electrically coupled to a redistribution layer <b>44</b> in a substrate <b>46</b> of the bottom package <b>38</b> by a first inductor <b>48</b> and a second inductor <b>50</b>. In other words, the PoP device <b>34</b> includes pairs of inductors <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> on opposing sides of a wafer mold layer <b>52</b> instead of using the through assembly vias <b>20</b> found in the PoP device <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Indeed, the wafer mold layer <b>52</b> of the PoP device <b>10</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is free of through assembly vias <b>20</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In an embodiment, the first inductor <b>48</b> is physically and electrically connected to one or more contacts <b>42</b>, the second inductor <b>50</b> is physically and electrically connected to the top redistribution layer <b>44</b>, and the first and second inductors <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> are electrically coupled by inductive coupling. As such, the front side and backside communication in the PoP device <b>34</b> may occur through the coupling effect of the first and second inductors <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In some embodiments, the first inductor <b>48</b> and the second inductor <b>50</b> in the PoP device <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are vertically aligned with each other. In other words, the first inductor <b>48</b> and the second inductor <b>50</b> have profiles that overlap when they are viewed from above or below. In some embodiments, the first inductor <b>48</b> and the second inductor <b>50</b> in the PoP device <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are disposed outside a die area <b>54</b>. In some embodiments, the first and second inductors <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> may be formed using a fan out process. In some embodiments, one or both of the first inductor <b>48</b> and the second inductor <b>50</b> engages the wafer mold layer <b>52</b>. Also, while a single pair of inductors <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> is depicted on either side of the die area <b>54</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, more or fewer pairs of the inductors may be included in other embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one of the inductors (e.g., the first inductor <b>48</b> or the second inductor <b>50</b>) is illustrated in greater detail. As shown, in some embodiments one or both of the first inductor <b>48</b> and the second inductor <b>50</b> is formed from concentric octagon-shaped rings <b>56</b>. In some embodiments, the first and second inductors <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> may resemble other shapes or have other configurations. Indeed, the first and second inductors <b>48</b>, <b>50</b> may be formed from concentric rectangles, squares, circles, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bottom package <b>38</b> also includes bottom contacts <b>58</b> and solder balls <b>60</b> in a ball grid array (BGA) <b>62</b>. The bottom contacts <b>58</b> and the solder balls <b>60</b>, which are electrically coupled to the redistribution layers <b>44</b> in the bottom package <b>38</b>, may be employed to electrically couple the entire PoP device <b>34</b> to other electronic circuitry such as, for example, a printed circuit board (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref><i>a</i>-<b>4</b><i>g</i>, a method of forming the PoP device <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> in accordance with various embodiments of the present disclosure is collectively illustrated. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, a die <b>64</b> (which defines the die area <b>54</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) is attached to a glass carrier <b>66</b>. Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>, a wafer molding material <b>68</b> is applied to provide for the wafer mold layer <b>52</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>c</i>, a wafer grinding process takes place to remove an excess portion of the wafer mold layer <b>52</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>d</i>, redistribution layer (RDL) stacking is performed to provide the redistribution layer <b>44</b> metallization and, in particular, to form the second inductor <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>e</i>, testing is conducted to test the redistribution layer <b>44</b> metallization and/or the function of the attached die <b>64</b>. Thereafter, the solder balls <b>60</b> are provided to form the ball grid array <b>62</b>. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>f</i>, the glass carrier <b>66</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>e</i>) is removed and a backside redistribution layer (RDL) process is performed to provide further redistribution layer <b>44</b> metallization and, in particular, to form the first inductor <b>48</b>. In an embodiment, this generally completes the bottom package <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Thereafter, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>g</i>, the top package <b>36</b> is mounted to the bottom package <b>38</b> and an underfill material <b>70</b> is provided in, for example, a flip-chip bonding process such as chip-on-wafer (CoW) to form the PoP device <b>34</b>. Other suitable processes of mounting packages or components to each other may also be employed in other embodiments. Indeed, additional or further processing steps may not have been described for brevity and simplicity of explanation.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">It should be recognized that the PoP device <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides numerous advantages relative to conventional PoP devices that rely on TAVs, TMVs, and the like. For example, the PoP device <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may have a smaller vertical profile. In other words, the thickness of the PoP device <b>34</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is less than conventional PoP devices due to the elimination of the TAVs, TMVs, and the like. In addition, the PoP device <b>34</b> has a low cost and is suitable for low pin count applications.</p>
