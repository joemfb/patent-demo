<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates generally to an integrated circuit packaging system, and more particularly to a system for an integrated circuit packaging system with an interposer.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Increased miniaturization of components, greater packaging density of integrated circuits (&#x201c;ICs&#x201d;), higher performance, and lower cost are ongoing goals of the computer industry. Semiconductor package structures continue to advance toward miniaturization, to increase the density of the components that are packaged therein while decreasing the sizes of the products that are made using the semiconductor package structures. This is in response to continually increasing demands on information and communication products for ever-reduced sizes, thicknesses, and costs, along with ever-increasing performance.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">These increasing requirements for miniaturization are particularly noteworthy, for example, in portable information and communication devices such as cellular phones, hands-free cellular phone headsets, personal data assistants (&#x201c;PDA's&#x201d;), camcorders, notebook computers, and so forth. All of these devices continue to be made smaller and thinner to improve their portability. Accordingly, large-scale IC (&#x201c;LSI&#x201d;) packages that are incorporated into these devices are required to be made smaller and thinner. The package configurations that house and protect LSI require them to be made smaller and thinner as well.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many conventional semiconductor (or &#x201c;chip&#x201d;) packages are of the type where a semiconductor die is molded into a package with a resin, such as an epoxy molding compound. Numerous package approaches stack multiple integrated circuit dice or package in package (PIP) or a combination. Other approaches include package level stacking or package on package (POP). POP designs face reliability challenges and higher cost.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, a need still remains for an integrated circuit packaging system providing low cost manufacturing, improved yield, low profile, and improved reliability. In view of the ever-increasing need to save costs and improve efficiencies, it is more and more critical that answers be found to these problems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Solutions to these problems have been long sought but prior developments have not taught or suggested any solutions and, thus, solutions to these problems have long eluded those skilled in the art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention provides a method of manufacture of an integrated circuit packaging system including: mounting a device over an integrated circuit having a through via; attaching an interposer, having an opening, and the integrated circuit with the device within the opening; and forming an encapsulation at least partially covering the integrated circuit and the interposer facing the integrated circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides an integrated circuit packaging system, including: an integrated circuit having a through via; a device mounted over the integrated circuit having the through via; an interposer having an opening attached to the integrated circuit having the through via with the device within the opening of the interposer; and an encapsulation at least partially covering the integrated circuit and the interposer facing the integrated circuit.</p>
