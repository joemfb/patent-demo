<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims benefit of U.S. provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/327,072, filed Apr. 22, 2010, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Embodiments of the present invention relate generally to wireless networks and, more specifically, to an apparatus for associating a client device or service with a wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Home networks, in which multiple computing and/or peripheral devices are communicatively linked together in a consumer's home, are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. A home environment may include one or more computers, a wireless router, a DSL modem, and one or more other client devices capable of connecting to the home network. Conventionally, each device in the home network must be individually configured to connect to the network and, once configured, may then communicate with each of the other devices attached to the home network.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In practice, procedures for associating client devices and provisioning services on a home network are typically too involved for the majority of home network users to implement reliably. For example, a network user may need to manually reconfigure the home network router, determine a network IP address and/or hostname for each client device, establish network credentials, register the various services for each device, and manually track which network IP address is associated with which client device or service in order to configure client devices to communicate on the home network.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The involved configuration procedures described above make it a challenge for unsophisticated users to reliably setup a home network and associate client devices or services on the home network. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for systems and methods that enable the user of a home network to conveniently and securely connect one or more devices or services to the home network.</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is an exemplary illustration of an overarching network system <b>100</b> configured to implement one or more aspects of the present invention. The network system <b>100</b> comprises a smart network <b>102</b>, an external network <b>110</b>, and an applet store <b>116</b>. The external network <b>110</b> may comprise the well-known Internet or any other data network system. The smart network <b>102</b> includes a smart network host device <b>120</b> configured to transmit network data packets between the external network <b>110</b> and connected devices within the smart network <b>102</b>, such as computer <b>170</b> and client devices <b>130</b>. Any technically feasible wireless or wired physical transport technology may be implemented to transmit the network data packets. The smart network host device <b>120</b> maintains a network state model <b>178</b> that represents the different entities and related services operating within the smart network <b>102</b>. For example, if client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) implements a printer with an integrated scanner and flash memory reader, then the network state model <b>178</b> would include an entry for client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>), and related attributes for a printer service, scanner service, and file (or block device) service. New devices register with the smart network host device <b>120</b>, which then updates the network state model <b>178</b> to include the new device.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">A portal application <b>172</b>, residing within the computer <b>170</b>, is configured to access the network state model <b>178</b> to determine which client devices <b>130</b> are available within the smart network <b>102</b>, which services the client devices <b>130</b> provide, and to access and use the services. The portal application <b>172</b> may include one or more applets <b>174</b>, configured to extend functionality of the portal application <b>172</b>. A given applet <b>174</b> may be associated with a specific client device <b>130</b> and may facilitate specific usage models for the client device <b>130</b> via the extended functionality. When a new client device <b>130</b> registers with the smart network <b>102</b>, a most recent version of a corresponding applet <b>174</b> may not be available within the portal application <b>172</b>. However, the portal application <b>172</b> may retrieve the corresponding applet <b>174</b> or version of the corresponding applet <b>174</b> from the applet store <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The applet store <b>116</b> is configured to facilitate access to applets <b>174</b> by the portal application <b>172</b>. The applet store <b>116</b> provides storage for applets <b>174</b> corresponding to client devices <b>130</b> and makes the applets <b>174</b> available for download to the portal application <b>172</b> via the external network <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the smart home network <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, according to one example embodiment of the present invention. As shown, the smart network <b>102</b> comprises a smart network host device <b>120</b>, one or more client devices <b>130</b>, and a wide area network (WAN) interface device <b>112</b>, coupled to the external network <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. The WAN interface device <b>112</b> may implement a cable modem, digital subscriber line (DSL) modem, fiber to the home interface, or any other technically feasible device that provides digital network connectivity to the external network <b>110</b>. The WAN interface device <b>112</b> is coupled to the smart network host device <b>120</b> via a network interface <b>118</b>. In one embodiment, the network interface <b>118</b> implements the well-known Ethernet standard.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The smart network host device <b>120</b> implements a wireless network interface coupled to antenna <b>122</b>, which is configured to convert electrical signals to electromagnetic signals for transmitting data packets, and electromagnetic signals to electrical signals for receiving data packets. The antenna <b>122</b> may comprise plural independent radiator structures, each having a separate radiation pattern for implementing spatial multiplexing. In one embodiment, the wireless network interface implements one or more well-known standards, such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard 802.11, which defines a system for wireless local area networking. The antenna <b>122</b> is configured establish wireless client links <b>134</b> to antennas <b>132</b> coupled to corresponding client devices <b>130</b>. The smart network host device <b>120</b> implements layer <b>2</b> forwarding (bridging) for wireless data packets forwarded among client devices <b>130</b> as well as Internet protocol (IP) layer <b>3</b> routing between an IP domain associated with the smart network <b>102</b> and the external network <b>110</b>. In this configuration, the smart network host device <b>120</b> provides related services and protocols, such as dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP), network address translation (NAT), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The smart network host device <b>120</b> acts as a central authentication authority for the smart network <b>102</b> and implements authentication services for devices registering with the smart network <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, authentication is implemented via Identification (ID) devices <b>136</b> that are uniquely paired with corresponding client devices <b>130</b>. For example, client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) may be uniquely paired with ID device <b>136</b>(<b>0</b>) by a manufacturer of the client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>). An ID device <b>136</b>(<b>0</b>) is physically presented to the smart network host device <b>120</b> as an authentication credential to allow a client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) paired to the ID device <b>136</b>(<b>0</b>) to join the smart network <b>102</b>. Furthermore, the client device <b>130</b>(<b>0</b>) is able to authenticate the smart network <b>102</b> as a trusted network by accessing credentials for the corresponding ID device <b>136</b>(<b>0</b>) specifically via the smart network <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, the ID devices <b>136</b> are implemented as near field radio frequency identification (RFID) tags. Each one of the RFID tags is configured to retain authentication credentials necessary to uniquely associate the one RFID tag with one instance of the client device <b>130</b>. In this way, an RFID tag may be paired with a given client device <b>130</b>. Persons skilled in the art will recognize that any technique may be implemented to generate and represent authentication credentials without departing the scope and spirit of the present invention. For example, in another embodiment, the ID devices <b>136</b> could be implemented as a physical token that includes a printed bar code on a face of the token. The bar code may encode authentication credentials for a corresponding client device <b>130</b>. In such an embodiment, the smart network host device <b>120</b> may include an optical scanner capable of reading the printed bar code from the physical token. In alternative embodiments, other forms of ID devices <b>136</b> may implement storage of the authentication credentials. For example, a universal serial bus (USB) storage device may be used to present authentication credentials to the smart network host device <b>120</b> for authenticating a related device, such as the computer <b>170</b>. In other alternative embodiments, a user may manually authenticate a client device <b>130</b> with the smart network host device <b>120</b>. For example, the user may log onto a management web page generated by the smart network host device <b>120</b> and manually enter authentication credentials, such as a printed code associated with the client device <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one usage scenario involving ID device <b>136</b>, the user wishes to add a new device, such as a smart network-enabled printer to the smart network <b>102</b>. The printer includes an ID device <b>136</b> implemented as an RFID tag that is paired to the printer. The user places the ID device <b>136</b> in close physical proximity to the smart network host device <b>120</b>, which is the able to read the ID device <b>136</b> and authenticate the printer. The printer registers with the smart network host device <b>120</b> and is then available for use by devices connected within the smart network <b>102</b>. Upon successfully reading the ID device <b>136</b>, the smart network host device <b>120</b> may indicate success to the user by flashing a light-emitting diode (LED), or by generating any technically feasible indication.</p>

Each smart network extender device <b>140</b> is configured to act as a network bridge between a client device <b>130</b> and the smart network host device <b>120</b>. For example, client devices <b>130</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>130</b>(N) may be physically located such that they are able to connect to the smart network extender device <b>140</b>, but not to the smart network host device <b>120</b>. Furthermore, the smart network extender device <b>140</b> is able to connect to the smart network host device <b>120</b> via bridge link <b>128</b>. Data packets transmitted by client devices <b>130</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>130</b>(N) and destined to the external network <b>110</b> are received by the smart network extender device <b>140</b> and retransmitted by the smart network extender device <b>140</b> via bridge link <b>128</b> to the smart network host device <b>120</b>, which then forwards the data packets to the external network <b>110</b>. Similarly, data packets from the external network <b>110</b> that are destined to any of the client devices <b>130</b>(<b>1</b>) through <b>130</b>(N) are transmitted via bridge link <b>128</b> to the smart network extender device <b>140</b>, which retransmits the data packets via wireless client links <b>134</b>(<b>1</b>)-<b>134</b>(N). Persons skilled in the art will understand that wireless client links <b>134</b>(<b>1</b>)-<b>134</b>(N) may each be configured to operate on a separate channel or band, or a common channel or band. Furthermore, bridge link <b>128</b> may operate on a separate channel or band with respect to the wireless client links <b>134</b>.</p>

A backhaul link <b>158</b> is established between the smart network host device <b>120</b> and the smart network connector device <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Network data traffic between client device <b>130</b>(N) and the external network <b>110</b> traverses wireless client link <b>134</b>(N), bridge link <b>128</b>, and backhaul link <b>158</b>. This network data traffic is also forwarded by smart network extender device <b>140</b>, smart network host device <b>120</b>, and smart network connector device <b>150</b>.

In such an embodiment, identification information and authentication credentials for a client device <b>130</b>(N) or service are encoded in the bar code.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the example embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the ID device <b>136</b>(N) includes a controller <b>210</b>, an I/O interface <b>220</b>, a universally unique identifier (UUID) <b>230</b>, and an authorization credential <b>240</b>. The controller <b>210</b> is configured to execute the requisite functions for the operation of the ID device <b>136</b>(N), and the I/O interface <b>220</b> is configured to enable communication between the ID device <b>136</b>(N) and the smart network host device <b>120</b>. In embodiments in which the ID device <b>136</b>(N) comprises a near-field RFID tag, the controller <b>210</b> includes an integrated circuit for storing and processing information, modulating and demodulating a radio-frequency (RF) signal, and performing other specialized functions associated with the operation of the RFID tag. In such embodiments, the I/O interface <b>220</b> includes an antenna for receiving and transmitting the RF signal, and the UUID <b>230</b> and the authorization credential <b>240</b> may reside in the integrated circuit included in the controller <b>210</b>. Alternatively, the UUID <b>230</b> and the authorization credential <b>240</b> may be stored in a memory that is part of the ID device <b>136</b>(N). In other example embodiments, in which the ID device <b>136</b>(N) does not comprise an RFID tag, the I/O interface <b>220</b> may include a USB port or other technically feasible interface for physically connecting the ID device <b>136</b>(N) to the smart network host device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The UUID <b>230</b> includes a unique reference number used as an identifier for the client device <b>130</b>(N) that enables the smart network host device <b>120</b> to differentiate the client device <b>130</b>(N) from other devices and services found in the network system <b>100</b>. In some example embodiments, the UUID <b>230</b> is similar in format to globally unique identifiers (GUIDs), however, other formats known in the art suitable for the UUID <b>230</b> may be utilized without departing from the scope of the invention. For example, the UUID <b>230</b> may include the media access control address (MAC address) of the client device <b>130</b>(N), in order to uniquely identify the client device <b>130</b>(N). The MAC address of the client device <b>130</b>(N) is a unique identifier that has no risk of name conflicts with any other devices in the smart network <b>102</b> or the network system <b>100</b>. Thus, the ID device <b>136</b>(N) can be permanently associated with the client device <b>130</b>(N) via the UUID <b>230</b>. In alternative embodiments, the ID device <b>136</b>(N) may be configured such that UUID <b>230</b> may be written to the ID device <b>136</b>(N) by the smart network host device <b>120</b> or other device, and therefore can be associated with a different client device <b>130</b>(N) at a later time as desired by the user. For example, a UUID associated with the smart network <b>102</b> may be written to the ID device <b>136</b>(N), and the ID device <b>136</b>(N) may then be used to associate the smart network <b>102</b> with other smart networks on the network system <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The authorization credential <b>240</b>, when obtained from the ID device <b>136</b>(N) by the smart network host device <b>120</b>, provides a layer of security to the smart network <b>102</b> when the smart network host device <b>120</b> sets up a secure connection between the smart network <b>102</b> and the client device <b>130</b>(N). The authorization credential <b>240</b> may be an encrypted key for device-to-device authentication, in this case between the smart network host device <b>120</b> and the client device <b>130</b>(N), and may be stored in or permanently written to the ID device <b>136</b>(N) when the ID device <b>136</b>(N) is manufactured. Thus, in some embodiments, the authorization credential <b>240</b> is stored in a write-protected storage medium, such as the write-protected encrypted bits of a USB drive or RFID tag, the manufactured key of an optical disk or SD memory card, or the like. The data included in the authorization credential <b>240</b> may be stored in any format known in the art suitable for authorization credentials without departing from the scope of the invention. In one example embodiment, the authorization credential <b>240</b> includes at least a portion of the MAC address of the client device <b>130</b>(N). In some embodiments, the authorization credential <b>240</b> is a high-entropy key, such as a 128-bit key.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">How the ID device <b>136</b>(N) provides the UUID <b>230</b> and the authorization credential <b>240</b> to the smart network host device <b>120</b> depends on the configuration of the ID device <b>136</b>(N). For example, when the ID device <b>136</b>(N) comprises a USB drive with write-protected encrypted bits, the ID device <b>136</b>(N) is detected by the smart network host device <b>120</b> when the ID device <b>136</b>(N) is inserted into an appropriate USB port of the smart network host device <b>120</b>, and the smart network host device <b>120</b> can obtain the UUID <b>230</b> and the authorization credential <b>240</b> using any technically feasible protocol. When the ID device <b>136</b>(N) includes a bar code, the ID device <b>136</b>(N) is scanned across a suitable bar code reader coupled to the smart network host device <b>120</b>. When the ID device <b>136</b>(N) comprises an RFID tag, connection to the smart network host device <b>120</b> can be as straight-forward as physically presenting the ID device <b>136</b>(N) to the smart network host device <b>120</b>. Thus, as soon as the ID device <b>136</b>(N) is within a working radius of ID device reader <b>164</b> disposed in the smart network host device <b>120</b>, e.g., within about 10 cm, the smart network host device <b>120</b> detects the ID device <b>136</b>(N) and reads the UUID <b>230</b> and the authorization credential <b>240</b> from the ID device <b>136</b>(N). Alternatively, the RFID reader in the smart network host device <b>120</b> may be configured to read information only from an RFID tag that is within the working radius of the RFID reader and also has a prescribed orientation with respect to the smart network host device <b>120</b>, or is physically mounted in a specific location on the smart network host device <b>120</b>. In such an example embodiment, faking of an RFID tag output signal is difficult to simulate, thereby preventing unwanted devices and/or services from being registered on the smart network <b>102</b> by the smart network host deice <b>120</b>. Whether the ID device <b>136</b>(N) comprises an RFID tag, a device that is physically connected to the smart network host device <b>120</b>, or a bar code that is scanned in to the smart network host device <b>120</b>, once the connection is made between the ID device <b>136</b>(N) and the smart network host device <b>120</b>, user involvement is no longer required for the client device <b>130</b>(N) to be associated with the smart network <b>102</b> by the smart network host device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some embodiments of the invention, the ID device <b>136</b>(N) includes a visual identifier <b>250</b> that is disposed on an outer surface of the ID device <b>136</b>(N). The visual identifier <b>250</b> provide symbolic and/or numeric markings which indicate to the user the specific client device <b>130</b> or service that is associated with the ID device <b>136</b>(N). The visual identifier <b>250</b> may include a logo of a company associated with the client device <b>130</b>(N) or service associated with the ID device <b>136</b>(N), an icon that represents the client device <b>130</b>(N) or service, a serial number associated with the client device <b>130</b>(N) or service, and/or a bar code that uniquely identifies the client device <b>130</b>(N) or service. Thus, a user can quickly determine from multiple ID devices <b>136</b>, which ID device <b>136</b>(N) is associated with a specific client device <b>130</b>. In order to conveniently differentiate between the ID devices <b>136</b> associated with similar client devices (e.g., multiple digital cameras), the visual identifier <b>250</b> may include both an iconic and a numeric component.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In operation, ID device <b>136</b>(N) enables the smart network host device <b>120</b> to associate a specific client device <b>130</b>(N) with the smart network <b>102</b>. The ID device <b>136</b>(N) is a physical representation of the client device <b>130</b>(N) that greatly simplifies the role of a user of the smart network <b>102</b> when adding the client device <b>130</b>(N) or a service to the smart network <b>102</b>, since the UUID <b>230</b> and the authorization credential <b>240</b> are automatically obtained by the smart network host device <b>120</b>. Further, an additional layer of security is provided to the smart network <b>102</b> since the UUID <b>230</b> and the authorization credential <b>240</b> can only be obtained by the smart network host device <b>120</b> when a suitable ID device <b>136</b>(N) is positioned in close proximity to or physically connected to the smart network host device <b>120</b>. In this way, the smart network host device <b>120</b> obtains the UUID <b>230</b> and the authorization credential <b>240</b> in a convenient and secure fashion, and can automatically associate the client device <b>130</b>(N) that is paired to the ID device <b>136</b>(N) with the smart network <b>102</b> with little risk of the authorization credential <b>240</b> being spoofed, or an unauthorized UUID being accepted by the smart network host device <b>120</b>. In some embodiments, as an added layer of security, the smart network host device <b>120</b> is configured to automatically disassociate the client device <b>130</b>(N) or service associated with the ID device <b>136</b>(N) and the smart network <b>102</b> when the ID device <b>136</b>(N) is detected to be no longer in close proximity to or physically connected to the smart network host device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart of method steps for automatically associating a client device or service with a smart network, according to one example embodiment of the present invention. Although the method steps are described in conjunction with the smart network <b>102</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and the configuration of the ID device <b>136</b>(N) illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, persons skilled in the art will understand that any wireless network and ID device configured to perform the method steps, in any order, is within the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As shown, the method <b>300</b> begins at step <b>301</b>, where the smart network host device <b>120</b> detects the presence of the ID device <b>136</b>(N), which is associated with the client device <b>130</b>(N) or a service that can be connected to smart network <b>102</b>. In one embodiment, the ID device <b>136</b>(N) may be detected when mounted in a prescribed fashion on a surface of the smart network host device <b>120</b> and ID device reader <b>164</b> in the smart network host device <b>120</b> detects the presence of an RFID tag included in the ID device <b>136</b>(N) once the ID device <b>136</b>(N) is within the near field of the reader. In another embodiment, the ID device <b>136</b>(N) may be swiped near the ID device reader <b>164</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In step <b>302</b>, the smart network host device <b>120</b> automatically obtains from the ID device <b>136</b>(N) the UUID <b>230</b> and the authorization credential <b>240</b> for the client device <b>130</b>(N) or service associated with the ID device <b>136</b>(N). The UUID <b>230</b> and the authorization credential <b>240</b> may be obtained placing the ID device <b>136</b>(N) near the smart network host device <b>120</b>, or by physically connecting the ID device <b>136</b>(N) to the smart network host device <b>120</b> via a USB port or other technically feasible connection mechanism. In an alternative embodiment, the UUID <b>230</b> and the authorization credential <b>240</b> may be encoded in a printable medium, such as a bar code, and read by swiping the bar code under an optical scanner included in the smart network host <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In step <b>303</b>, the smart network host device <b>120</b> receives a registration request from the client device <b>130</b>(N) or a service associated with the ID device <b>136</b>(N). Such a registration request may take place when the client device <b>130</b>(N) is first powered up, rebooted, etc. within the operational radius of the antenna <b>122</b> of the smart network host device <b>120</b>. Upon receiving the registration request, the smart network host device <b>120</b> then updates the network state model <b>178</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> to include the new client device <b>130</b>(N) and/or service. In an alternative embodiment, the registration request from the client device <b>130</b>(N) may be received by any access point of the smart network <b>102</b>, including smart network extender device <b>140</b> and smart network connector device <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In step <b>304</b>, the smart network host device <b>120</b> associates the client device <b>130</b>(N) or the desired service with the smart network <b>102</b> based on the UUID <b>230</b> and the authorization credential <b>240</b> obtained from the ID device <b>136</b>(N) in step <b>301</b>. In some example embodiments, the smart network host device <b>102</b> may set up a secure connection between the smart network <b>102</b> and the client device <b>130</b>(N) or service using a protocol handshake between the client device <b>130</b>(N) and the smart network host device <b>120</b>. Such a protocol includes a dual challenge mechanism, in which the authorization credential <b>240</b> is never broadcast between the client device <b>130</b>(N) and the smart network host device <b>120</b>. Instead, using encryption algorithms known in the art, the client device <b>130</b>(N) proves to the smart network host device <b>120</b> that the client device <b>130</b>(N) knows the authorization credential <b>240</b> and the smart network host device <b>120</b> proves to the client device <b>130</b>(N) that the smart network host device <b>120</b> also knows the authorization credential <b>240</b>. If either device fails to provide the correct information during such a protocol handshake, the other device terminates the session and no network connection will be established therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some embodiments, an additional step <b>305</b> may be performed when a user has removed the ID device <b>136</b>(N) from close proximity of the smart network host device <b>120</b>. In step <b>305</b>, the smart network host device <b>120</b> detects that the ID device <b>136</b>(N) is no longer present, and, in response, automatically terminates the association of the client device <b>130</b>(N) to the smart network <b>102</b>. Thus, in such embodiments, a user may disconnect a client device or service by simply removing the associated ID device <b>136</b>(N) from the smart network host device <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In sum, example embodiments of the invention provide systems and methods for automatically associating a client device or service with a smart network. A network association apparatus automatically provides identification information and an authorization credential that are associated with the client device or service to be connected to a wireless network. The network association apparatus advantageously enables the host device of the wireless network to automatically associate the client device or service to the wireless network with little or no user involvement required, while providing an additional layer of security to the process of accessing the wireless network. The added security layer stems from the required possession by a user of the network association apparatus and the proximity of the network association apparatus to the smart network host device in order to associate a client device or service to the smart network.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">One embodiment of the invention may be implemented as a program product for use with a computer system. The program(s) of the program product define functions of the embodiments (including the methods described herein) and can be contained on a variety of computer-readable storage media.
