<p id="p-0001" num="0000">The present disclosure provides a femoral prosthesis for use during a revision procedure. The femoral prosthesis includes a body, a neck, a stem, and a sleeve. The sleeve facilitates reattachment of an osteotomized proximal femur, specifically the greater trochanter, following a revision femoral prosthesis surgery involving an extended trochanteric osteotomy. Additionally, the sleeve promotes ingrowth of the osteotomized proximal femur with the sleeve.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a femoral prosthesis. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to a femoral prosthesis for use during a revision procedure, the femoral prosthesis including a sleeve to facilitate reattachment of the greater trochanter.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An orthopaedic prosthesis may be used to replace some or all of a patient's hip joint in order to restore use of the hip joint following a traumatic injury or deterioration due to aging or illness, for example. A femoral prosthesis having a stem, a neck, and a head may be used to replace a portion of the patient's femur and an acetabular prosthesis may be used to replace a portion of the patient's acetabulum.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">If problems develop with an original or primary prosthesis over time, the original prosthesis may need to be removed and replaced with a new prosthesis, a procedure known as a revision procedure. A revision procedure may be necessary if an infection develops around the original prosthesis, if the original prosthesis experiences excessive wear or damage, or if the original prosthesis begins to loosen in the patient's bone due to deterioration of the patient's bone around the original prosthesis, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">During a revision procedure of the hip joint, for example, it may be necessary to remove an original or primary femoral prosthesis and replace the original femoral prosthesis with a revision femoral prosthesis. As part of the removal of the original femoral prosthesis, in order to obtain access to the original femoral prosthesis, a surgeon may need to perform an extended trochanteric osteotomy (ETO). An ETO procedure typically involves temporary removal of a portion of the proximal femur including the greater trochanter. Upon completion of the original femoral prosthesis removal, the surgeon implants the revision femoral prosthesis and reattaches the portion of the proximal femur osteotomized during the ETO procedure. The surgeon may, in order to reattach the osteotomized proximal femur, wrap cables or sutures around the proximal femur. However, the greater trochanter may remain exposed superior to the remainder of the proximal femur. Such exposure of the greater trochanter may lead to potential loosening of the revision femoral prosthesis and/or degradation of the reattachment of the osteotomized proximal femur.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present disclosure provides a femoral prosthesis for use during a revision procedure. The femoral prosthesis includes a body, a neck, a stem, and a sleeve. The sleeve facilitates reattachment of an osteotomized proximal femur, specifically the greater trochanter, following a revision femoral prosthesis surgery involving an extended trochanteric osteotomy. Additionally, the sleeve promotes ingrowth of the osteotomized proximal femur with the sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the present disclosure, a femoral prosthesis having a proximal end and a distal end and configured for implantation in a patient's proximal femur is provided. The femoral prosthesis comprises a proximal body located toward the proximal end of the femoral prosthesis; a neck coupled to the proximal body and extending medially from the proximal body; a distal stem located at the distal end of the femoral prosthesis; and a sleeve couplable to the proximal body. The sleeve includes a plurality of apertures and includes a lateral exterior surface, at least a portion of the lateral exterior surface being positioned laterally and proximally to the proximal body.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another embodiment of the present disclosure, a method of implanting a femoral prosthesis into a proximal femur of a patient is provided. The femoral prosthesis includes a proximal body having a neck extending medially and proximally from the proximal body, a distal stem coupled to the proximal body, and a sleeve coupled to the proximal body and having a lateral exterior surface and at least a first and a second aperture. The method comprises the steps of: osteotomizing a portion of the proximal femur of the patient; and implanting the femoral prosthesis such that the distal stem is substantially disposed within the proximal femur of the patient and such that a portion of the lateral exterior surface of the sleeve is positioned laterally and proximally to the proximal body; and attaching the osteotomized portion of the proximal femur to the lateral exterior surface of the sleeve.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to yet another embodiment of the present disclosure, a femoral prosthesis having a proximal end and a distal end and configured for implantation in a patient's proximal femur is provided. The femoral prosthesis comprises: a proximal body located toward the proximal end of the femoral prosthesis; a neck coupled to the proximal body, the neck extending medially from the proximal body; a distal stem located at the distal end of the femoral prosthesis; and a sleeve having a lateral exterior surface, an anterior flange, a posterior flange, and a plurality of apertures. A portion of the lateral exterior surface comprises a porous surface and the anterior flange is spaced anteriorly to the porous surface of the lateral exterior surface and the posterior flange is spaced posteriorly to the porous surface of the lateral exterior surface.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, an exemplary revision femoral prosthesis <b>100</b> is illustrated including proximal body <b>102</b>, sleeve <b>110</b>, and distal stem <b>130</b>. Upon assembly of prosthesis <b>100</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, proximal body <b>102</b> is disposed substantially within sleeve <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, proximal body <b>102</b> is also couplable to distal stem <b>130</b>. As described and exemplified herein, prosthesis <b>100</b> may be used to replace an original or primary femoral prosthesis that has been removed from a proximal femur of a patient for various reasons.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the illustrative prosthesis <b>100</b> shows proximal body <b>102</b> having neck <b>104</b>, proximal portion <b>106</b>, distal portion <b>108</b>, and distal end <b>109</b>. As shown, neck <b>104</b> extends medially and proximally (for example, at approximately a 135&#xb0; angle) from proximal portion <b>106</b> and distal portion <b>108</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, neck <b>104</b> is configured to receive head H which will articulate with the patient's natural acetabulum or a prosthetic acetabular component. Embodiments of the present disclosure also include neck <b>104</b> being rigidly affixed to, or integral with, proximal portion <b>106</b> of proximal body <b>102</b>. Additional embodiments of the present disclosure include neck <b>104</b> comprising a modular component receivable within proximal portion <b>106</b> of proximal body <b>102</b>, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/025,827, entitled &#x201c;MODULAR REVISION FEMORAL PROSTHESIS,&#x201d; filed Feb. 11, 2011, the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. It should also be understood that neck <b>104</b> may comprise varying lengths and extension angles, as well as varying anteversion and offset dimensions for desired cooperation with the patient's natural acetabulum or the prosthetic acetabular component, as described in the above-incorporated U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/025,827.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B</figref>, <b>1</b>C, and <b>1</b>D, the surgeon may select a desired proximal body from a set of various proximal bodies <b>102</b>, <b>102</b>&#x2032;, <b>102</b>&#x2033; that differ in shape and/or size. For example, proximal body <b>102</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> comprises a medial protrusion <b>107</b>&#x2032; distal to neck <b>104</b>&#x2032; which may aid in resisting subsidence of the proximal femur. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> shows an exemplary embodiment of proximal body <b>102</b>&#x2033; smaller in size than the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 1C</figref> and comprising a medial protrusion <b>107</b>&#x2033; also distal to the neck <b>104</b>&#x2033;. The embodiment of proximal body <b>102</b>&#x2033; exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref> may be preferred when a patient has relatively minimal bone deficiencies. Proximal bodies <b>102</b>, <b>102</b>&#x2032;, <b>102</b>&#x2033; may be available in varying sizes, such that the selected proximal body may extend along as little as 20%, 25%, or 30% of the length of prosthesis <b>100</b>, or along as much as 35%, 40%, or 45% of the length of prosthesis <b>100</b>, or within any range delimited by any pair of the foregoing values.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure include at least a portion of proximal body <b>102</b> having a porous outer surface. For example, portions of proximal body <b>102</b> not disposed within sleeve <b>110</b>, such as neck <b>104</b> and proximal portion <b>106</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>), may be plasma sprayed or grit blasted circumferentially to create an outer porous layer. Further, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that at least a portion of proximal body <b>102</b> may be constructed of the highly porous biomaterial described in further detail below, and as is also described in the above-incorporated U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/025,827. Embodiments of the present disclosure having at least a portion of proximal body <b>102</b> including a porous outer layer may promote bone and tissue ingrowth when prosthesis <b>100</b> is implanted into the patient's femoral canal.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, distal portion <b>108</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) of proximal body <b>102</b> is shown disposed within sleeve <b>110</b>. Exemplary embodiments of proximal body <b>102</b> include distal portion <b>108</b> having a tapered shape (see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). In other embodiments of proximal body <b>102</b>, distal portion <b>108</b> may comprise a substantially uniform size and shape throughout. Additionally, assembled prosthesis <b>100</b> may include distal portion <b>108</b> fully disposed within sleeve <b>110</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, distal end <b>109</b> of proximal body <b>102</b> may extend completely through sleeve <b>110</b>, such that distal end <b>109</b> is disposed distal to distal region <b>114</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, sleeve <b>110</b> includes body <b>111</b> having proximal region <b>112</b>, proximal end <b>113</b>, distal region <b>114</b>, distal end <b>115</b>, anterior flange <b>116</b>, posterior flange <b>118</b>, and exterior surface <b>119</b>. Sleeve <b>110</b> also defines cavity <b>120</b> which comprises proximal opening <b>122</b> and distal opening <b>124</b>. It is within the scope of the present disclosure that variations in the shape of sleeve <b>110</b> are possible. By way of example, anterior and posterior flanges <b>116</b>&#x2032;, <b>118</b>&#x2032; of sleeve <b>110</b>&#x2032; shown in the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> each define a rounded trapezoidal shape within a common vertical plane, whereas anterior and posterior flanges <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> in the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> each define a rounded rectangular shape within a common vertical plane.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Further, the illustrative embodiment of sleeve <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> includes proximal end <b>113</b> extending linearly along a horizontal plane between anterior and posterior flanges <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, the horizontal plane being perpendicular to axis <b>140</b>. By contrast, proximal end <b>113</b>&#x2032; in the illustrative embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> extends proximally in a substantially rounded or curved manner along axis <b>140</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) between anterior and posterior flanges <b>116</b>&#x2032;, <b>118</b>&#x2032;. A rounded proximal end <b>113</b>&#x2032;, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, may provide a desired contour for attachment of soft tissue and/or attaching an osteotomized greater trochanter to exterior surface <b>119</b>&#x2032; of sleeve <b>110</b>&#x2032; and may also allow for an increased range of motion at the patient's hip joint.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Also, the illustrative embodiment of sleeve <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> includes cavity <b>120</b>, defined by the distal region <b>114</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>, which is sized to receive distal portion <b>108</b> of proximal body <b>102</b>. In exemplary embodiments of sleeve <b>110</b>, cavity <b>120</b> may be tapered such that proximal opening <b>122</b> is wider that distal opening <b>124</b>. Embodiments of sleeve <b>110</b> may also include cavity <b>120</b> having a substantially uniform size throughout. It is also within the scope of the present disclosure that cavity <b>120</b> may comprise any of a substantially circular, square, or rectangular shape, wherein the shape of cavity <b>120</b> corresponds to the shape of distal portion <b>108</b> of proximal body <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Referring to the illustrative embodiment of sleeve <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, proximal body <b>102</b> is disposed within sleeve <b>110</b>. As shown, when proximal body <b>102</b> is disposed within sleeve <b>110</b>, proximal portion <b>106</b> of proximal body <b>102</b> is positioned medial and distal to the proximal-most portions of exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>. However, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, the proximal-most portions of neck <b>104</b> may extend proximally to the proximal-most portions of exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>. See, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, where neck <b>104</b> extends proximally to the proximal-most portions of exterior surface <b>119</b>&#x2032; of sleeve <b>110</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With reference to the illustrative embodiments of sleeve <b>110</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, anterior and posterior flanges <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> are positioned at the anterior and posterior areas of proximal region <b>112</b>. As shown, anterior and posterior flanges <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> and portions of exterior surface <b>119</b> of proximal region <b>112</b> may include a plurality of apertures <b>126</b>. Following implantation of an assembled prosthesis <b>100</b>, a surgeon may attach one or more surgical fasteners to apertures <b>126</b> for securing an osteotomized tissue between the surgical fastener and exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> shows an illustrative embodiment of prosthesis <b>100</b>, implanted in the femur F of a patient. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a surgeon may thread a surgical suture, cable, tape, or the like between apertures <b>126</b> of the anterior and posterior flanges <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, thereby securing the greater trochanter GT (osteotomized from the proximal femur F at line O), for example, against the lateral and proximal portion of exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Illustrative embodiments of sleeve <b>110</b> in which the number of apertures <b>126</b> included within anterior and posterior flanges <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>, as well as exterior surface <b>119</b> of proximal region <b>112</b>, vary are within the scope of the present disclosure and the number of apertures <b>126</b> of sleeve <b>110</b> is not intended to be limited to the number depicted herein. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows an embodiment of sleeve <b>110</b> wherein anterior and posterior flanges <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> include four apertures <b>126</b> and proximal region <b>112</b> includes no apertures <b>126</b>. Another embodiment of sleeve <b>110</b>&#x2032;, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, includes anterior and posterior flanges <b>116</b>&#x2032;, <b>118</b>&#x2032; including three apertures <b>126</b>&#x2032; and proximal region <b>112</b>&#x2032; including four apertures <b>126</b>&#x2032;. As such, it should be understood that the number of apertures <b>126</b> defined by anterior and posterior flanges <b>116</b>, <b>118</b> and exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b> may vary.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that body <b>111</b> of sleeve <b>110</b> may comprise a biocompatible metal, such as titanium, a titanium alloy, cobalt chromium, cobalt chromium molybdenum, tantalum, or a tantalum alloy. According to an illustrative embodiment of the present disclosure, body <b>111</b> may comprise a Ti-6A1-4V ELI alloy, such as Tivanium&#xae; Alloy which is available from Zimmer, Inc., of Warsaw, Ind. Tivanium&#xae; is a registered trademark of Zimmer, Inc. Exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b> may also comprise a biocompatible metal, such as titanium, a titanium alloy, cobalt chromium, cobalt chromium molybdenum, tantalum, or a tantalum alloy.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">At least a portion of exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b> may be porous. Because exterior surface <b>119</b> defines at least a portion of the bone-contacting surface of sleeve <b>110</b>, bone and/or soft tissue of the patient's proximal femur, including the greater trochanter, may grow into exterior surface <b>119</b> over time to enhance the fixation (i.e., osseointegration) between sleeve <b>110</b> and the patient's proximal femur. In some exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure the entire exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b> may be porous. In other embodiments within the scope of the present disclosure only portions of exterior surface <b>119</b> within proximal region <b>112</b> of sleeve <b>110</b> may be porous. According to embodiments of the present disclosure, exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b> may be plasma sprayed circumferentially to create an outer porous layer or grit blasted circumferentially to form a corundumized outer layer of exterior surface <b>119</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Additionally, exterior surface <b>119</b> may be in the form of a fiber metal pad or a sintered metal layer, such as a CSTi&#x2122;, Cancellous-Structured Titanium&#x2122; coating or layer, for example. CSTi&#x2122; porous layers are manufactured by Zimmer, Inc., of Warsaw, Ind. CSTi&#x2122; is a trademark of Zimmer, Inc. When assembled prosthesis <b>100</b> is implanted (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>), the porous layer of exterior surface <b>119</b> may promote bone and/or tissue ingrowth, as well as facilitate reattachment of osteotomized bone such as an osteotomized greater trochanter GT.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It is also within the scope of the present disclosure that sleeve <b>110</b> and/or exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b> may be comprised of a highly porous biomaterial. A highly porous biomaterial is useful as a bone substitute and as cell and tissue receptive material. A highly porous biomaterial may have a porosity as low as 55%, 65%, or 75% or as high as 80%, 85%, or 90%. An example of such a material is produced using Trabecular Metal&#x2122; Technology generally available from Zimmer, Inc., of Warsaw, Ind. Trabecular Metal&#x2122; is a trademark of Zimmer, Inc. Such a material may be formed from a reticulated vitreous carbon foam substrate which is infiltrated and coated with a biocompatible metal, such as tantalum, by a chemical vapor deposition (&#x201c;CVD&#x201d;) process in the manner disclosed in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 5,282,861, the disclosure of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. In addition to tantalum, other metals such as niobium, or alloys of tantalum and niobium with one another or with other metals may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Generally, the porous tantalum structure includes a large plurality of ligaments defining open spaces therebetween, with each ligament generally including a carbon core covered by a thin film of metal such as tantalum, for example. The open spaces between the ligaments form a matrix of continuous channels having no dead ends, such that growth of bone through the porous tantalum structure is uninhibited. The porous tantalum may include up to 75%-85% or more void space therein. Thus, porous tantalum is a lightweight, strong porous structure which is substantially uniform and consistent in composition, and closely resembles the structure of natural bone, such as natural cancellous bone, thereby providing a matrix into which soft tissue and/or bone may grow. According to exemplary embodiments of prosthesis <b>100</b>, a portion of exterior surface <b>119</b> may comprise porous tantalum which provides a matrix into which the bone tissue of the osteotomized greater trochanter may grow, thereby providing fixation of the osteotomized greater trochanter to the implanted sleeve <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The porous tantalum structure may be made in a variety of densities in order to selectively tailor the structure for particular applications. In particular, as discussed in the above-incorporated U.S. Pat. No. 5,282,861, the porous tantalum may be fabricated to virtually any desired porosity and pore size, and can thus be matched with the surrounding natural bone in order to provide an improved matrix for bone ingrowth and mineralization.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">According to further exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, porous portions of exterior surface <b>119</b> may be impregnated with and/or coated with biologically active agents. Suitable biologically active agents include, for example, antibiotics to reduce the potential for infection and to promote healing, and growth factors to promote bone and/or soft tissue ingrowth into exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring again to the illustrative embodiment of prosthesis <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, distal stem <b>130</b> is shown having proximal end <b>132</b>, distal end <b>134</b>, engagement member <b>136</b>, and beveled member <b>138</b>. Beveled member <b>138</b> is positioned at distal end <b>134</b> of distal stem <b>130</b> and may comprise one of or both of an anterior and/or posterior bevel, as described in the above-incorporated U.S. patent application Ser.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Distal stem <b>130</b> may be circular in cross-section and may taper towards distal end <b>134</b> thereby defining a taper angle relative to longitudinal axis <b>140</b> or an axis parallel thereto. According to an exemplary embodiment of the present disclosure, the taper angle may be approximately 3.5&#xb0;. The tapered geometry of distal stem <b>130</b> may promote stability of prosthesis <b>100</b> in the patient's femur by encouraging distal stem <b>130</b> to become wedged into the patient's femoral canal. Also, the tapered geometry of distal stem <b>130</b> may evenly distribute axial and bending loads to the patient's femur to resist subsidence and stress shielding. Further, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that distal stem <b>130</b> may extend along as little as 55%, 60%, or 65% of the length of prosthesis <b>100</b>, or along as much as 70%, 75%, or 80% of the length of prosthesis <b>100</b>, or within any range delimited by any pair of the foregoing values, with proximal body <b>102</b> and sleeve <b>110</b> extending along the remaining length of prosthesis <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Although not illustrated herein, it is also within the scope of the present disclosure that distal stem <b>130</b> may include a plurality of longitudinal splines. As depicted and described in the above-incorporated U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/025,827, each longitudinal spline may project radially outwardly from distal stem <b>130</b>. Each longitudinal spline may project outwardly from distal stem <b>130</b> at a distance of about 0.75 mm, for example. When distal stem <b>130</b> is implanted into the patient's femoral canal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>), the longitudinal splines may engage bone that surrounds the canal to provide initial fixation during insertion of prosthesis <b>100</b> and to limit rotational movement of prosthesis <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Even further, according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure, at least a portion of distal stem <b>130</b> may be roughened. Similar to embodiments of proximal body <b>102</b> described above, distal stem <b>130</b> may be plasma sprayed or grit blasted circumferentially to form an outer porous surface. When distal stem <b>130</b> is implanted into the patient's femoral canal (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>), the porous outer surface may promote bone ingrowth. Additionally, in some embodiments of the present disclosure, distal stem <b>130</b> may be constructed of highly porous biomaterial. It is also within the scope of the present disclosure that embodiments of distal stem <b>130</b> may include a plurality of longitudinal splines having a porous surface, thereby providing initial fixation of prosthesis <b>100</b> and promoting bone ingrowth.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring again to the illustrative embodiment of assembled prosthesis <b>100</b>&#x2032; shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, proximal body <b>102</b> is shown disposed within cavity <b>120</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>. During assembly, distal portion <b>108</b> of proximal body <b>102</b> is inserted through proximal opening <b>122</b> into cavity <b>120</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>. According to an exemplary embodiment of prosthesis <b>100</b>, distal portion <b>108</b> of proximal body <b>102</b> and sleeve <b>110</b> may be connected by a Morse type taper-lock arrangement. According to this embodiment, during assembly, a user manipulates proximal body <b>102</b> such that distal end <b>109</b> of proximal body <b>102</b> enters cavity <b>120</b> through proximal opening <b>122</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>. The user then forces the externally tapered distal portion <b>108</b> of proximal body <b>102</b> into the Morse type taper-lock engagement with the internally tapered body <b>111</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>, thereby locking proximal body <b>102</b> within sleeve <b>110</b>. Although described herein as a Morse type taper-lock arrangement, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that other forms of locking arrangements may be used to secure proximal body <b>102</b> within sleeve <b>110</b>, such as fixation screws, threaded arrangements, and locking nuts.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 6</figref>, upon assembly of proximal body <b>102</b> within sleeve <b>110</b>, distal end <b>109</b> of proximal body <b>102</b> may extend through cavity <b>120</b> and out of distal opening <b>124</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>. During assembly, distal end <b>109</b> of proximal body <b>102</b> couples to engagement member <b>136</b> of distal stem <b>130</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, engagement member <b>136</b> is an externally threaded component that screws into internal threads <b>105</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) of proximal body <b>102</b>. Additionally, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that engagement member <b>136</b> may also comprise a Morse type taper-lock mechanism or fixation screws, for example, for coupling to proximal body <b>102</b>. Still other embodiments of prosthesis <b>100</b> within the scope of the present disclosure may comprise engagement member <b>136</b> being directly couplable to sleeve <b>110</b>, for example to body <b>111</b> within cavity <b>120</b>, in any manner disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Another embodiment of the present disclosure includes proximal body <b>102</b> being integrally or monolithically formed with distal stem <b>130</b>. An integral arrangement of proximal body <b>102</b> and distal stem <b>130</b> may ensure a strong, stable connection between proximal body <b>102</b> and distal stem <b>130</b>. Also, this integral arrangement may simplify a surgeon's preoperative planning and selection process by requiring only selection of the total length and diameter of prosthesis <b>100</b>, for example, rather than consideration of the lengths and diameters of proximal body <b>102</b> and distal stem <b>130</b> individually.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Further, according to some embodiments of the present disclosure, proximal body <b>102</b> and distal stem <b>130</b> may be connected prior to coupling proximal body <b>102</b> and/or distal stem <b>130</b> to sleeve <b>110</b>. In such embodiments, during assembly, proximal body <b>102</b> and distal stem <b>130</b> are coupled in any manner as disclosed herein. Thereafter, distal end <b>134</b> of distal stem <b>130</b> is inserted through proximal opening <b>122</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>, thereby extending through cavity <b>120</b> and exiting cavity <b>120</b> through distal opening <b>124</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>. The user may then lock proximal body <b>102</b> and/or distal stem <b>130</b> to sleeve <b>110</b> in any manner disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">It is also within the scope of the present disclosure that the various embodiments, shapes, and sizes of proximal body <b>102</b>, sleeve <b>110</b>, and distal stem <b>130</b> disclosed herein, may be combined such that desired configurations of prosthesis <b>100</b> are possible. For example, an embodiment of prosthesis <b>100</b> may include proximal body <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>), <b>102</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>), or <b>102</b>&#x2033; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>), combined with sleeve <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>) or <b>110</b>&#x2032; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), and distal stem <b>130</b> including a tapered form with longitudinal splines and a beveled member as described herein. As such, the present disclosure allows surgeons to selectively configure prosthesis <b>100</b> to address a patient's specific medical needs such as bending, range of motion, load distribution, and enhanced bone and/or tissue ingrowth with portions of prosthesis <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In use, embodiments of prosthesis <b>100</b> disclosed herein may be utilized during a femoral prosthesis revision procedure. As part of a femoral prosthesis revision procedure, a surgeon may need to perform an extended trochanteric osteotomy (ETO) procedure which involves temporary removal of at least a portion of the proximal femur, possibly including the greater trochanter, in order to access the originally implanted femoral prosthesis.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Following removal of the originally implanted femoral prosthesis, an assembled prosthesis <b>100</b> is implanted into the femoral canal of the patient for replacing the originally implanted femoral prosthesis. Optionally, distal stem <b>130</b> of prosthesis <b>100</b> may be secured in the femoral canal of patient with bone cement C, or distal stem <b>130</b> may be press fitted in femur F without use of bone cement C. The surgeon then reattaches the portion of the proximal femur F temporarily removed during the ETO procedure to exterior surface <b>119</b> of the lateral side of sleeve <b>110</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. For the sake of simplicity and consistency, the portion of the proximal femur F temporarily removed during the ETO procedure is referred to herein as the greater trochanter GT. However, it should be understood that the portion of the proximal femur F temporarily removed during the ETO procedure, and subsequently reattached, may include only a portion of the greater trochanter GT and/or may include additional portions of the proximal femur.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, a surgeon may reattach the greater trochanter GT by positioning the greater trochanter GT in contact with exterior surface <b>119</b> at the lateral side of proximal region <b>112</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>. At least one surgical fastener S, such as a surgical cable, suture, netting, or tape, may then be threaded through one or more apertures <b>126</b> of either anterior or posterior flange <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>. For the purpose of simplicity and consistency herein, the surgical fastener S is described as initially coupled to, or threaded through, an aperture <b>126</b> of anterior flange <b>116</b>, although it is within the scope of the present disclosure that the surgical fastener S may initially be coupled to an aperture <b>126</b> of posterior flange <b>118</b>. Remaining with the illustrative embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the surgical fastener S is then positioned around a lateral portion of the greater trochanter GT such that the surgical fastener S secures the greater trochanter GT against exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>. The surgical fastener S may then be threaded through one or more apertures <b>126</b> of posterior flange <b>118</b> and may be secured at posterior flange <b>118</b>. Additional embodiments of the present disclosure include the surgical fastener S being continually threaded from anterior flange <b>116</b> to posterior flange <b>118</b> for securing the greater trochanter GT against external surface <b>119</b> until the surgeon secures the surgical fastener S at one of the flanges <b>116</b>, <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additional information regarding surgical fasteners and uses thereof for securing tissue to apertures <b>126</b> is set forth in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2011/0009973, entitled &#x201c;METHODS AND APPARATUSES FOR ATTACHING TISSUE TO ORTHOPAEDIC IMPLANTS,&#x201d; filed Nov. 13, 2009, assigned to the assignee of the present application, the disclosure of which is hereby expressly incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the surgical fastener S may secure the greater trochanter GT to a proximal portion of exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b>, thereby maintaining contact between the greater trochanter GT and exterior surface <b>119</b>. Maintaining direct contact between the greater trochanter GT and exterior surface <b>119</b> in embodiments of prosthesis <b>100</b> which include external surface <b>119</b> having a porous layer, such as Trabecular Metal&#x2122; material or a plasma sprayed porous layer impregnated with biologically active agents, for example, promotes ingrowth of the greater trochanter GT with sleeve <b>110</b>. Enhanced ingrowth of the greater trochanter GT with the exterior surface <b>119</b> of sleeve <b>110</b> may aide in preventing the reattached greater trochanter GT from becoming exposed superior to the remainder of the proximal femur F and may aide in preventing loosening of distal stem <b>130</b> and/or degradation of the reattached greater trochanter GT.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, embodiments of the present disclosure described herein may also include the use of prosthesis <b>100</b> when portions of the proximal femur, such as the greater trochanter, must be permanently removed. In such embodiments, portions of sleeve <b>100</b>, including exterior surface <b>119</b>, may be used for attachment of soft tissue previously attached to the removed portion(s) of the proximal femur. Embodiments of prosthesis <b>100</b> including external surface <b>119</b> having a porous layer, as described herein, promote ingrowth of the soft tissue with sleeve <b>110</b>, thereby facilitating fixation of the soft tissue to sleeve <b>100</b> and enhancing soft tissue stability at the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Further, while exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure have described prosthesis <b>100</b> for femoral prosthesis revision procedures, it is also within the scope of the present disclosure that prosthesis <b>100</b>, and its various embodiments described herein, may be used in non-revision procedures. For example, embodiments of prosthesis <b>100</b> may be used as a primary femoral prosthesis for implantation into a traumatized hip and/or femur of a patient. Additionally, it is within the scope of the present disclosure that prosthesis <b>100</b> may be used as a primary femoral prosthesis when implantation of a femoral prosthesis requires removal of proximal portions of the femur, such as the greater trochanter, which the surgeon wishes to reattach.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">While this disclosure has been described as having exemplary designs, the present disclosure can be further modified within the spirit and scope of this disclosure. This application is therefore intended to cover any variations, uses, or adaptations of the disclosure using its general principles. Further, this application is intended to cover such departures from the present disclosure as come within known or customary practice in the art to which this disclosure pertains and which fall within the limits of the appended claims.</p>
