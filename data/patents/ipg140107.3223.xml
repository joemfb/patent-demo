<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to a light emitting diode (LED).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">LEDs are semiconductors that convert electrical energy into light. Compared to conventional light sources, the LEDs have higher energy conversion efficiency, higher radiance (i.e., they emit a larger quantity of light per unit area), longer lifetime, higher response speed, and better reliability. LEDs also generate less heat. Therefore, LED modules are widely used as light sources in optical imaging systems, such as displays, projectors, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">LEDs include an N-type semiconductor layer, a P-type semiconductor layer, an active layer, an N-type electrode, and a P-type electrode. The active layer is located between the N-type semiconductor layer and the P-type semiconductor layer. The P-type electrode is located on the P-type semiconductor layer. The N-type electrode is located on the N-type semiconductor layer. Typically, the P-type electrode is transparent. In operation, a positive voltage and a negative voltage are applied respectively to the P-type semiconductor layer and the N-type semiconductor layer. Thus, holes in the P-type semiconductor layer and photons in the N-type semiconductor layer can enter the active layer and combine with each other to emit visible light.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, the extraction efficiency of LEDs is low because the contact area between the N-type semiconductor layer and the active layer is not large enough. Thus the electron-hole recombination density is low, and the photons in the LED are sparse, thereby degrading the extraction efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">What is needed, therefore, is a light emitting diode which can overcome the above-described shortcomings.</p>

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The disclosure is illustrated by way of example and not by way of limitation in the figures of the accompanying drawings in which like references indicate similar elements. It should be noted that references to &#x201c;an&#x201d; or &#x201c;one&#x201d; embodiment in this disclosure are not necessarily to the same embodiment, and such references mean at least one.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one embodiment of an LED <b>10</b> includes a first semiconductor layer <b>110</b>, an active layer <b>120</b>, a second semiconductor layer <b>130</b>, a first electrode <b>112</b>, and a second electrode <b>132</b>. The first semiconductor layer <b>110</b> includes a first surface and a second surface opposite to the first surface. The active layer <b>120</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>130</b> are stacked on the second surface of the first semiconductor layer <b>110</b> in that order. The surface of the second semiconductor layer <b>120</b> away from the active layer <b>120</b> is configured as the light emitting surface of LED <b>10</b>. The second surface of the first semiconductor layer <b>110</b> defines a plurality of three-dimensional nano-structures <b>113</b>. The light emitting surface of LED <b>10</b> defines a plurality of three-dimensional nano structures <b>133</b>. The first electrode <b>112</b> is electrically connected with and covers the first surface of the first semiconductor layer <b>110</b>, and the second electrode <b>132</b> is electrically connected with the second semiconductor layer <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first semiconductor layer <b>110</b> is an N-type semiconductor or a P-type semiconductor. The material of the N-type semiconductor can include N-type gallium nitride, N-type gallium arsenide, or N-type copper phosphate. The material of the P-type semiconductor can include P-type gallium nitride, P-type gallium arsenide, or P-type copper phosphate. The N-type semiconductor is configured to provide electrons, and the P-type semiconductor is configured to provide holes. The thickness of the first semiconductor layer <b>110</b> ranges from about 1 &#x3bc;m to about 5 &#x3bc;m. In one embodiment, the first semiconductor layer <b>110</b> is an N-type gallium nitride doped with Si. The first semiconductor layer <b>110</b> includes a first surface and a second surface opposite to the first surface. The first surface contacts the first electrode <b>112</b>. The active layer <b>120</b> and the second semiconductor layer <b>130</b> are stacked on the second surface.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In one embodiment, a buffer layer (not shown) can be sandwiched between the substrate and the first semiconductor layer <b>110</b>. Because the first semiconductor layer <b>110</b> and the substrate have different lattice constants, the buffer layer is used to reduce the lattice mismatch, thus the dislocation density of the first semiconductor layer <b>110</b> will decrease. The thickness of the buffer layer ranges from about 10 nanometers to about 300 nanometers, and the material of the buffer layer can be GaN or AlN.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the second surface of the first semiconductor layer <b>110</b> is a patterned surface. The first semiconductor layer <b>110</b> can be separated into a main body <b>110</b><i>a </i>and a protruding part <b>110</b><i>b </i>and distinguished by an &#x201c;interface.&#x201d; The interface can be substantially parallel with the first surface of the first semiconductor layer <b>110</b>. The interface is defined as a surface of the main body <b>110</b><i>a </i>hereafter, and the protruding part <b>110</b><i>b </i>extends away from the surface of the main body <b>110</b><i>a</i>. The protruding part <b>110</b><i>b </i>defines the plurality of three-dimensional nano-structures <b>113</b>, and the plurality of three-dimensional nano-structures <b>113</b> form the patterned surface of the first semiconductor layer <b>110</b>. The three-dimensional nano-structure <b>113</b> can be a protruding structure. The protruding structure protrudes out from the interface of the main body <b>110</b><i>a</i>. The plurality of three-dimensional nano-structures <b>113</b> is a protruding structure located on the surface of the main body <b>110</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The plurality of three-dimensional nano-structures <b>113</b> can be arranged side by side. Each of the three-dimensional nano-structures <b>113</b> can extend along a straight line, a curvy line, or a polygonal line. The extending direction is substantially parallel with the surface of the first semiconductor layer <b>110</b>. The two adjacent three-dimensional nano-structures are arranged a certain distance apart from each other. The distance ranges from about 0 nanometers to about 1000 nanometers, such as 10 nanometers, 30 nanometers or 200 nanometers. The extending direction of the three-dimensional nano-structure <b>113</b> can be fixed or varied. While the extending direction of the three-dimensional nano-structure <b>113</b> is fixed, the plurality of three-dimensional nano-structures <b>113</b> extends along a straight line, otherwise the three-dimensional nano-structures <b>113</b> extends along a polygonal line or a curvy line. The cross-section of the three-dimensional nano-structure <b>113</b> along the extending direction is M-shaped. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the three-dimensional nano-structures <b>113</b> are a plurality of substantially parallel bar-shaped protruding structures extending along a straight line. The plurality of three-dimensional nano-structures <b>113</b> are substantially uniformly and equidistantly distributed on the entire surface of the main body <b>110</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Also referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the three-dimensional nano-structure <b>113</b> extends from one side of the semiconductor layer <b>110</b> to the opposite side along the X direction. The Y direction is substantially perpendicular to the X direction and substantially parallel with the surface of the main body <b>110</b><i>a</i>. The three-dimensional nano-structure <b>113</b> is a double-peak structure including two peaks. The cross-section of the double-peak structure is M-shaped. The first peak <b>1132</b> and the second peak <b>1134</b> extend substantially along the X direction. The first peak <b>1132</b> includes a first surface <b>1132</b><i>a </i>and a second surface <b>1132</b><i>b</i>. The first surface <b>1132</b><i>a </i>and the second surface <b>1132</b><i>b </i>intersect to form an intersection line and an included angle &#x3b8; of the first peak <b>1132</b>.
