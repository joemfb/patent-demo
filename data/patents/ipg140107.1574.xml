<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The instant disclosure relates to a wireless network interface device; in particular, a wireless network interface device with concealable electrical interface.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the wide spread of personal computers and internet, a vast array of information resources are exchanged. Currently, most internet connections are based on landlines such as cable internet access or fiber optic cables. However, the installation and maintenance costs for the fixed line infrastructures are very high. The ubiquitous adaptation of wireless network would resolve such issue.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, mobile electronic devices such as laptop computers require the installation of wireless internet interfaces to establish wireless internet connection. Heavy emphasis has been given to increasing data transfer speed of such wireless interface devices. Major advancements in such area includes the 2G Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), 2.5G General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), the 3G Wideband Code Division Multiple Access (W-CDMA), and the 3.5G High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Most conventional wireless internet cards require antennas for transferring and receiving wireless signals. The location and design of the antenna is very critical for the data transfer speed and quality. In addition, the setting of the wireless network varies regionally, so the optimization of the antenna design is very critical in assuring data transfer quality.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">With the maturity of wireless interface technology, modern wireless internet interface devices have been designed to incorporate Universal Serial Bus (USB) interface. The USB interface provides fast and convenient adaptation of wireless interface devices to modern personal computing devices. However, the exposing connector of the USB device is less robust than the traditional bulky connecting interfaces, such as the PCMCIA card bus. Thus, conventionally, a cover is used to shield the exposed USB interface from being damaged. However, because the cover is not interconnected to the device, the cover can be easily lost or misplaced accidentally. In addition, the cover may loosen from the device after repeated use. Therefore, the cover does not offer a secured protection for the USB interface, which enhances the risk of damaging the USB interface and shorten the service life.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To address the above issues, the inventor proposes the following solution.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The instant disclosure provides a wireless network interface device with concealable electrical interface to address the issue of shielding the electrical interface. The device comprises a casing unit, a wireless receiver unit, an elastic assembly, and an actuator. The casing unit has an outer body, where the outer body is slotted in forming at least one interface opening and at least one actuator opening. Internal of the outer body, the wireless receiver unit has a receiving module and an I-shaped groove formed thereon. The I-shaped groove is defined by a first recess, a second recess, and a connecting recess bridging the first and second recess. The electrical interface is electrically connected to one end of the receiving module and can penetrate through at least one interface opening to be exposed externally. The elastic assembly has at least one first elastic member disposed within the outer body and compressed in between the casing unit and the receiving module. The actuator comprises a second elastic member disposed within the outer body, a releaser member attached to the second elastic member and exposed outside the outer body by penetrating at least one actuator opening, and a locking member connected to the second elastic member for engaging the first or second recess of the I-shaped groove. Thereby, when the locking member engages to the first recess of the I-shaped groove, at least one first elastic member is compressed in concealing the electrical interface within the outer body. Conversely, when the releaser member is pressed in dislodging the locking member from the first recess of the I-shaped groove, the receiving module is pushed to expose the electrical interface from the outer body. As the connecting recess slides past the locking member, it engages the second recess. The electrical interface is thus locked in the exposed position.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The instant disclosure further provides a wireless network interface device with concealable electrical interface to address the issue of shielding the electrical interface. The device comprises a casing unit, a wireless receiver unit, an elastic assembly, and an actuator. The casing unit has an outer body, where the outer body is slotted in forming at least one interface opening and at least one actuator opening. Internal of the outer body, the wireless receiver unit has a receiving module and a groove formed thereon. The electrical interface is electrically connected to one end of the receiving module and can penetrate through at least one interface opening to be exposed externally. The elastic assembly has at least one first elastic member disposed within the outer body and compressed in between the casing unit and the receiving module. The actuator comprises a second elastic member disposed within the outer body, a releaser member attached to the second elastic member and partially exposed outside the outer body by penetrating at least one actuator opening, and a locking member connected to the second elastic member for engaging the first or second recess of the groove.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Yet, the instant disclosure provides another wireless network interface device with concealable electrical interface to address the issue of shielding the electrical interface. The device comprises a casing unit, a wireless receiver unit, an elastic assembly, and an actuator. The casing unit has an outer body, where the outer body is slotted in forming at least one interface opening and at least one actuator opening. Internal of the outer body, the wireless receiver unit has a receiving module and a first engaging member formed thereon. The electrical interface is electrically connected to one end of the receiving module and can penetrate through at least one interface opening to be exposed externally. The elastic assembly has at least one first elastic member disposed within the outer body and compressed in between the casing unit and the receiving module. The actuator comprises a second elastic member disposed within the outer body, a releaser member attached to the second elastic member and exposed outside the outer body by penetrating at least one actuator opening, and a second engaging member connected to the second elastic member for complementing the first engaging member.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In summary, the first aspect of the instant disclosure comprises an I-shaped groove having a first recess, a second recess, and a connecting recess, along with an actuator having a second elastic member, a releaser member, and a locking member. In another aspect, the instant disclosure comprises a groove and an actuator having a second elastic member, a releaser member, and a locking member. Yet, in another aspect, the instant disclosure comprises a first engaging member and an actuator having a second elastic member, a releaser member, and a second engaging member. Based on any of the above aspect, the electrical interface of the wireless network interface device can be concealed internally of the casing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to further appreciate the characteristics and technical contents of the instant disclosure, references are hereunder made to the detailed descriptions and appended drawings in connection with the instant disclosure. However, the appended drawings are merely shown for exemplary purposes, rather than being used to restrict the scope of the instant disclosure.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Please refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B, <b>2</b>A, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b>, which show a wireless network interface device with concealable electrical interface C having a casing unit <b>1</b>, a wireless receiver unit <b>2</b>, an elastic assembly <b>3</b>, and an actuator <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The casing unit <b>1</b> has an outer body <b>10</b>, where the outer body <b>10</b> is slotted in forming at least one interface opening <b>11</b> and at least one actuator opening <b>12</b>. The electrical interface C can be exposed from the interface opening <b>11</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 2B</figref>. Optionally, the casing unit <b>1</b> may further comprise a fixing frame <b>13</b> having a thru hole <b>130</b> adjacent to the interface opening <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Next, the wireless receiver unit <b>2</b> has a receiving module <b>20</b> and an I-shaped groove <b>21</b> formed thereon internal of the outer body <b>10</b>. If the fixing frame <b>13</b> is excluded, the receiving module <b>20</b> is directly enclosed by the outer body <b>10</b>. If the fixing frame <b>13</b> is included, the receiving module <b>20</b> would be enclosed by the fixing frame <b>13</b> instead as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. Meanwhile, an I-shaped groove <b>21</b> is defined by grooving the outer surface of the receiving module <b>20</b>. The I-shaped groove <b>21</b> has a first recess <b>210</b>, a second recess <b>211</b>, and a connecting recess <b>212</b> bridging the first recess <b>210</b> and the second recess <b>211</b>. The electrical interface C is electrically connected to one end of the receiving module <b>20</b> and can penetrate through at least one interface opening <b>11</b> to be exposed externally. Such condition is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Within the outer body <b>10</b>, the elastic assembly <b>3</b> has at least one first elastic member <b>30</b>. If the fixing frame <b>13</b> is excluded, at least one first elastic member <b>30</b> is disposed in between the inner surface <b>100</b> of the casing unit <b>10</b> and the side surface <b>200</b> of the receiving module <b>20</b>. If the fixing frame <b>13</b> is included, at least one first elastic member <b>30</b> is disposed in between the inner surface <b>131</b> of the fixing frame <b>13</b> and the side surface <b>200</b> of the receiving module <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Next, the actuator <b>4</b> comprises a second elastic member <b>40</b> internal of the outer body <b>10</b>; a releaser member <b>41</b> connected to the second elastic member <b>40</b> and exposed from the outer body <b>10</b> by penetrating at least one actuator opening <b>12</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>; and a locking member <b>42</b> connected to the second elastic member <b>40</b>, where the locking member <b>42</b> can be engaged to the first recess <b>210</b> or the second recess <b>211</b> of the I-shaped groove <b>21</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>. The second elastic member <b>40</b> may be manufactured from metallic or plastic materials. When the fixing frame is excluded, the ends of the second elastic member <b>40</b> are secured to the inner surface <b>100</b> of the casing unit <b>10</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, if the fixing frame <b>13</b> is included, the ends of the second elastic member <b>40</b> are secured to the fixing frame <b>13</b> instead.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Yet, when the fixing frame <b>13</b> is included for the instant disclosure, the wireless network interface device with concealable electrical interface further includes an internal antenna <b>5</b>. The antenna <b>5</b> has at least one antenna module <b>50</b> disposed internal of the outer body <b>10</b> and in between the inner surface <b>100</b> of the casing unit <b>10</b> and the side surface of the fixing frame <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Next, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the releaser member <b>41</b>, which comprises a main body <b>410</b> and an extension <b>411</b>. The extension <b>411</b> protrudes off the bottom of the main body <b>410</b> and is connected to the second elastic member <b>40</b>. The main body <b>410</b> is partially accommodated within at least one actuator opening <b>12</b>, with other portion exposed from the outer body <b>10</b>. Meanwhile, the locking member <b>42</b> has a locking piece <b>420</b> and a connecting arm <b>421</b>, where the connecting arm <b>421</b> protrudes off the top of the locking piece <b>420</b> and connects to the second elastic member <b>40</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, the locking piece <b>420</b> can engage to the first recess <b>210</b> or the second recess <b>211</b> of the I-shaped groove <b>21</b>, while the connecting arm <b>421</b> can slide within the connecting recess <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Functionally, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>2</b>A, and <b>4</b>A show the electrical interface C as being concealed in the outer body <b>10</b>, with at least one first elastic member <b>30</b> in compressed state, and the locking member <b>42</b> engages to the first recess <b>210</b> of the I-shaped groove <b>21</b>. To expose the electrical interface C, the releaser member <b>41</b> is pressed downward as indicated by the arrow in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. The downward motion releases the locking member <b>42</b> from the first recess <b>210</b> of the I-shaped groove <b>21</b>. By disengaging from the locking member <b>42</b>, the receiving module <b>20</b> is moved by at least one first elastic member <b>30</b> in releasing the stored energy. Meanwhile, the receiving module <b>20</b> slides past the connecting arm <b>421</b> of the locking member <b>42</b> via the connecting recess <b>212</b>. Finally, the receiving module <b>20</b> is stopped by the actuator <b>4</b> as the releaser member <b>41</b> is let go. When the releaser member <b>41</b> is let go, the locking member <b>42</b> is pushed upward by the second elastic member <b>40</b> and engages the second recess <b>211</b> of the I-shaped groove <b>21</b>. The above process is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D and 4E</figref>. At such state, the electrical interface C is completely exposed from the outer body <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1B and 2B</figref>.</p>
