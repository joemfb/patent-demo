<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method and an apparatus according to an embodiment of the invention includes a controller to process a travel assistance request for communication through a satellite and terrestrial mobile communication network. Data related to multiple assistance providers can be received in response to the request. At least one criterion can be processed for the assistance providers based on, for example, historical trip data. The assistance providers can be graphically represented for user selection based on the criterion. Data related to a selected assistance provider can be displayed, including navigation data to and/or from the assistance provider. In another embodiment, the travel assistance request can be communicated to a service center through the network. The service center can communicate data related to an assistance provider, including navigation data to and/or from the assistance provider. A rating of the assistance provider can be communicated to a specified community-of-interest through the network.</p>

No 13/619,848. The above-identified U.S. patent application is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>

<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates generally to travel assistance and more particularly to devices providing interactive travel assistance services and methods for using such devices.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A hybrid satellite and terrestrial communication system, such as a Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) system with an Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC), for example, can provide a more efficient spectrum utilization and a more effective coverage in rural and urban areas than can be provided by stand-alone mobile satellite systems. For that reason, existing MSS/ATC systems have been typically used to provide voice communication with wide geographic coverage. Using existing MSS/ATC systems to make available other types of services, however, poses many implementation challenges. For instance, to support mobile interactive services, an MSS/ATC system design may need to effectively handle multicast transmissions across both satellite networks and ancillary terrestrial networks along with interactive communications with individual users. When properly designed, an MSS/ATC system can support one or more mobile interactive services, including travel assistance services, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In a typical travel or roadside assistant service, a request is made from a vehicle to a service center through a cellular network. The service center can dispatch, automatically and/or through a live operator, for example, a service vehicle to where the person making the request is located. These types of services are limited, however, since user preferences are not generally part of the criteria used in the service center's selection of the service provider. For example, the service center may dispatch a service provider because it is the closest one to the requester, but it is one with whom the requester has had a bad experience in the past. In many instances restrictions in the scope of travel assistant services provided can result from the system and/or the network supporting those services.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Thus, a need exists for interactive services and/or devices that use satellite and terrestrial communication systems to offer users a wide geographic coverage along with a more flexible, effective, and/or feature-rich travel assistance experience.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An apparatus may include a controller to process a travel assistance request for communication through a satellite and terrestrial mobile communication network. Data related to multiple assistance providers can be received in response to the request. At least one criterion can be processed for the service assistance based on, for example, historical trip data. The assistance providers can be graphically represented for user selection based on the criterion. Data related to a selected assistance provider can be displayed, including navigation data to and/or from the assistance provider. In another embodiment, the travel assistance request can be communicated to a service center through the network. The service center can communicate data related to an assistance provider, including navigation data between the assistance provider and the user making the request. A rating of the assistance provider can be communicated to a specified community-of-interest through the network.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The devices and methods described herein are generally related to mobile or in-vehicle interactive navigation services. For example, the devices and methods are suitable for use in a hybrid satellite and terrestrial (satellite/terrestrial) communication system, such as a Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) system with an Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC). An example of such a hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication system is described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/797,048 to Zufall et, al., the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. An MSS MSS/ATC system can use one or more satellites to support a wide geographic coverage of mobile satellite interactive services. For example, a portion of the 2 GHz spectrum allocated for MSS satellite communications can be used to provide effective service coverage to rural and remote areas. Along with the MSS network, the land-based ATC network can facilitate service penetration in urban and suburban areas through effective satellite and terrestrial frequency reuse.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The mobile interactive satellite services described herein can be used to provide interactive travel assistance services. A user can request travel assistance (e.g., vehicle repair assistance, medical care assistance, travel guidance assistance) through a mobile interactive services system. In one embodiment, data related to multiple assistance service providers (e.g., gas stations, auto repair shops, police stations, medical centers, clinics, hospitals) for a specified assistance category (e.g., auto repair providers, medical care providers, public safety providers) can be received in response to the request via a hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network. At least one criterion can be processed for the assistance providers based on, for example, historical trip data. In some instances, data related to each of the assistance providers can be graphically represented based on the criterion to assist the user in the selection process. Navigation data and/or other information to and/or from the selected assistance provider can be displayed to assist the user getting appropriate assistance.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In another embodiment, the travel assistance request can be communicated to a service center through the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network. The service center can communicate data related to a specified assistance provider, including navigation data to and/or from the assistance provider and/or information related to a service vehicle dispatched by the assistance provider. In some instances, the user can provide ratings and/or reviews of the assistance provider that can be shared with a specified community-of-interest (COI) through the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It is noted that, as used in this written description and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; include plural referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, the term &#x201c;a route segment&#x201d; is intended to mean a single segment or a combination of segments. Similarly, the term &#x201c;a destination area&#x201d; is intended to mean, for example, a single destination area or more than one destination areas.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a schematic representation of a satellite and terrestrial mobile communication network, according to an embodiment of the invention. A hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b> can be configured to provide mobile interactive satellite services, such as interactive travel assistance services, for example. The hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b> can include a first satellite <b>110</b>, terrestrial antennas <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, and/or <b>154</b>, a first ground station <b>120</b>, and a network <b>130</b>. In some instances, the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b> can have a second satellite <b>111</b> and/or a second ground station <b>121</b> to support other mobile interactive satellite services, such as mobile video services that provide satellite television multicasting, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The first satellite <b>110</b> can be configured to communicate with the first ground station <b>120</b> through one or more signals in a connection or communication path <b>170</b> that includes, for example, uplink signals and downlink signals. The uplink signals can be used to communicate information or data from the first ground station <b>120</b> to the first satellite <b>110</b>. The uplink-communicated information can include a multicast portion or component (e.g., video, music, traffic reports, radio) and/or an interactive component (e.g., navigation data, travel assistance data). The downlink signals can be used to communicate data, such as interactive data (e.g., requests for navigation services, requests for travel assistance services), from the first satellite <b>110</b> to the first ground station <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The first ground station <b>120</b> can be configured to process at least a portion of the data or information related to an interactive service that can be supported by the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b>. In this regard, the first ground station <b>120</b> can be configured to process multicast, interactive, and/or control data for communication with the first satellite <b>110</b>. In one example, the first ground station <b>120</b> can generate ground-based beam-forming (GBBF) information that is communicated to the first satellite <b>110</b> via the communication path <b>170</b>. The GBBF information can be used to configure a transmission antenna, such as an antenna array, for example, which can be used by the first satellite <b>110</b> to generate an appropriate number of beam spots and beam spot locations, and/or appropriate beam spot shapes to effectively communicate with a mobile interactive services system, such as one that can be used in the vehicle <b>140</b>, and/or with terrestrial antennas <b>150</b> and <b>152</b>. The GBBF information can be dynamically modified to adjust communication operations, including spectrum bandwidth and/or geographic coverage, for example, between the first satellite <b>110</b> and users of mobile interactive satellite services. In emergency situations, such as during a natural disaster, for example, GBBF information can be processed in a manner such that priority in spectrum bandwidth and/or geographic coverage can be given to affected areas.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The first satellite <b>110</b> can be configured to communicate with a mobile interactive services system through one or more signals in a connection or communication path <b>172</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first satellite <b>110</b> can communicate with a mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b>. The communication path <b>172</b> can include a downlink signals through which the first satellite <b>110</b> can wirelessly transmit multicast and/or interactive data to the mobile interactive services system and an uplink signals to wirelessly transmit interactive data from the mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> to the first satellite <b>110</b>. In this regard, a user can request data, such as travel assistance data, data related to a specific destination, and/or data related to a destination or assistance category of interest, for example, through one or more mobile interactive satellite services supported though the uplink signals in the communication path <b>172</b>. Moreover, a mobile interactive services system can communicate with a service provider (e.g., navigation service provider, travel assistance service provider, a travel assistance service center) through the downlink and uplink signals in the communication path <b>172</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In some embodiments, the first satellite <b>110</b> can be configured to communicate with terrestrial antennas <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> using one or more signals through communication paths <b>174</b> and <b>176</b>, respectively. For instance, communication paths <b>174</b> and <b>176</b> can each include a downlink path from the first satellite <b>110</b> to the terrestrial antennas <b>150</b> and <b>152</b>, respectively. Each of the downlink paths can support multicast and/or interactive data communication to the terrestrial antenna. In one example, the terrestrial antenna <b>150</b> can be configured to further communicate multicast and/or interactive data received from the first satellite <b>110</b> to a mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> through a downlink path in a communication path <b>178</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, however, terrestrial antenna <b>150</b> may not be configured to receive interactive data from the mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> (e.g., communication path <b>178</b> may not support uplink signals to terrestrial antenna <b>150</b>). In another example, terrestrial antenna <b>152</b> can be configured to further communicate multicast and/or interactive data received from the first satellite <b>110</b> to a mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> through a downlink path in a communication path <b>182</b>. Along with the downlink path, communication path <b>182</b> can have an uplink path that can support transmission of signals that include interactive data from the mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> to the terrestrial antenna <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The ground station <b>120</b> can be configured to communicate with terrestrial antennas <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, and <b>154</b> through a network <b>130</b>. In this regard, land-based communication of multicast and/or interactive data can occur through terrestrial antennas <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, and <b>154</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, terrestrial antennas <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, and <b>154</b> can be configured to communicate multicast and/or interactive data via at least one of communication paths <b>178</b>, <b>182</b>, and <b>180</b>, respectively, with a mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b>. Terrestrial antennas <b>152</b> and <b>154</b>, for example, can be configured for bi-directional communication and can receive interactive data from the mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> through uplink paths in communication paths <b>182</b> and <b>180</b>, respectively. Terrestrial antennas <b>152</b> and <b>154</b> can be configured to communicate interactive data received from the mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> to the ground station <b>120</b> through the network <b>130</b> for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The network <b>130</b> can include at least a portion of, for example, a public switched telephone network (PSTN), a packet-switched network, a satellite network, and/or a wireless network. The packet-switched network can be a multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) network that can carry different kinds of traffic such as Internet protocol (IP) packets, asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) frames, synchronous optical network (SONET) frames, and/or Ethernet frames, for example. The ground station <b>120</b> can be configured to communicate with the network <b>130</b> through a network connection or communication path <b>162</b>. Terrestrial antennas <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, and <b>154</b> can communicate with the network <b>130</b> through a network connection or communication path <b>160</b>. Communication paths <b>160</b> and <b>162</b> can include, in some instances, a broadband and/or long-haul optical fiber connection.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Other embodiments of the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b> can include a number of ground stations, terrestrial antennas, and/or satellites that can be different from those of the different embodiments described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Moreover, other embodiments of the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b> can support multiple devices that like the mobile interactive services system in the vehicle <b>140</b> can be configured to communicate with the first satellite <b>110</b> and with the terrestrial antennas <b>150</b>, <b>152</b>, and/or <b>154</b>. For example, handheld devices, laptops, and/or in-vehicle systems can be configured to receive and/or transmit data related to mobile interactive satellite services through an embodiment of the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref> are block diagrams of a mobile interactive services system for satellite and terrestrial communication, according to embodiments of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a schematic representation of an mobile interactive services system <b>200</b> that can be configured to provide mobile interactive satellite services. In some instances, the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b> can be an in-vehicle system (i.e., can operate within and/or coupled to a vehicle, for example). The mobile interactive services system <b>200</b> can include a controller module <b>210</b>, a modem module <b>220</b>, and/or a media server module <b>230</b>. In some instances, the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b> can include one or more passenger device modules <b>240</b><sub>0</sub>, . . . , <b>240</b><sub>N</sub>. The controller module <b>210</b>, the modem module <b>220</b>, the media server module <b>230</b>, and the passenger device modules <b>240</b><sub>0</sub>, . . . , <b>240</b><sub>N </sub>can be software-based (e.g., set of instructions executable at a processor, software code) and/or hardware-based (e.g., circuit system, processor, application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), field programmable gate array (FPGA)). In some embodiments, the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b> can be configured to communicate with a vehicle communication network, such as, for example, a controller area network (CAN), an on-board diagnostics II (OBD-II), a media-oriented system transport (MOST), or other like vehicle communication networks.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The controller module <b>210</b> can be configured to process and/or display data such as data received from other modules or components of the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b>, data that is provided as input from a user, and/or data received from a vehicle communication network or bus. For instance, the controller module <b>210</b> can receive, process, and/or display multicast and/or interactive data that is received via the modem module <b>220</b>. In some instances, the controller module <b>210</b> can receive, process, and/or display data (e.g., video, audio, navigation, and/or travel assistance data) stored in the media server module <b>230</b>. The data processing provided by the controller module <b>210</b> can include processing that supports mobile interactive satellite services such as mobile interactive travel assistance services, for example. The controller module <b>210</b> can be configured to store data before, during, and/or after processing.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the controller module <b>210</b> can be configured to collect and/or process historical trip data from one or more previous trips. In other embodiments, the controller module <b>210</b> can process historical trip data for transmission to a service provider or service center that may further process the historical trip data to generate, for example, navigation and/or travel assistance data. The travel assistance data generated from the processed historical trip data can be subsequently received by the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b>. Historical trip data can include, for example, departure time and/or location, arrival time and/or location, road or route segments traveled, travel time, travel distance, time of departure, and/or date (day, week, month, and/or year) of travel. In some embodiments, historical trip data can include navigation data or guidance data that may have been received from a navigation service provider for consideration by a user during a previously occurring trip.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">An example of historical trip data processing can include determining which trips are routine or regularly occurring trips. In one embodiment, routinely occurring trips can be determined by generating statistical information which may be compared to specified thresholds to determine when a certain trip (e.g., weekday morning commute to work) occurs routinely. A road or route segment traveled during a routine trip can be referred to as a routine route segment and a destination location or destination area arrived to during a routine trip can be referred to as a routine destination location or a routine destination area, respectively, for example. In other embodiments, a user of the mobile interactive services system <b>200</b> may indicate to the system that a trip is a routine trip.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic representation of a navigation map, including routine trip data, according to an embodiment of the invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a navigation map <b>500</b> can be a graphical representation of a geographic area or region that includes information regarding multiple locations (e.g., towns, cities, places, landmarks, addresses) and/or road information (e.g., road identification, road lanes, exit identification, road intersections and junctions, speed limits). The geographic region in the navigation map <b>500</b> can correspond to a region for which mobile interactive satellite services can be provided. In this regard, the navigation map <b>500</b> can include information that can be used by a mobile interactive travel assistance service to determine and/or provide travel assistance instructions and/or other assistance-related data.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the navigation map <b>500</b> can include multiple locations S, A, B, C, D, E, and F, multiple road or route segments, and/or multiple road or route nodes. A route segment can refer to a road or to a portion of a road between two route nodes, for example. As shown, a solid-line route segment can be associated with a large road, such as a highway, for example, and a dotted-line route segment can be associated with a local road, such as a back road or a rural road, for example. In this regard, a solid-line route segment can generally correspond to a route segment in which a driver can travel at a faster speed than when traveling through a dotted-line route segment. For example, local roads tend to have fewer lanes of traffic and have more traffic lights, both of which may tend to reduce the average travel speed. A route node can refer to an intersection or junction between two or more route segments, for example. In some instances (not shown), a route node can also refer to a location or landmark in a route segment that need not be associated with a road intersection or junction.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Within the geographic area described by the navigation map <b>500</b>, multiple different trips can occur. For example, for a trip between location S and location A, route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, S<b>3</b>, and S<b>4</b> and nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>1</b>, N<b>2</b>, and N<b>3</b> may be traversed. In another example, for a trip between location S and location B, route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>8</b> and nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>1</b>, and N<b>2</b> may be traversed. Traveling between location S and location C, for example, may involve traversing route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>10</b>, S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>13</b> and nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>5</b>, N<b>6</b>, and N<b>7</b>. In yet another example, traveling between location A and location F may involve traversing route segments S<b>4</b>, S<b>5</b>, S<b>6</b>, S<b>13</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>16</b> and nodes N<b>3</b>, N<b>4</b>, location C, N<b>7</b>, and N<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some instances, there may be more than one possible route for a trip that involves going from a first location to a second location. For example, a first route for a trip starting at location S and having as destination location B can include traversing route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>8</b> and nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>1</b>, and N<b>2</b>. A second route for a trip starting at location S and having as destination location B can include traversing route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>10</b>, S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>9</b> and nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>5</b>, N<b>6</b>, and N<b>7</b>, for example. The first and second routes can differ in multiple aspects, including total travel distance, travel time, average travel speed, route segments and/or nodes traversed, travel areas or neighborhoods, ease or comfort in traveling (e.g., highway traffic or local road traffic), and/or costs (e.g., tolls), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Differences in routes for a particular trip can result in a user of a mobile interactive services system (e.g., a driver or vehicle passenger) having a preference for one route over another route. In this regard, the user may routinely or regularly prefer to travel using a particular route for trips between specified locations. An example of a regularly occurring trip can be going from the user's home to their place of work at the beginning of a work day. Another example of a regularly occurring trip can be the return trip home at the end of the work day. In this regard, the user or driver can have a preference for one of multiple possible routes that may be available when traveling to and from work, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">A regularly occurring trip can be referred to as a routine trip and the route segments traversed during the routine trip can be referred to as routine route segments, for example. As described above, a mobile interactive navigation system can be used to collect historical trip data which can be processed to determine whether a trip occurs with a sufficient degree of regularity to be a routine trip. Historical trip information that can be processed to determine whether a trip is a routine trip can include, but need not be limited to, starting and destination locations, departure time, arrival time, and/or day of travel (e.g., Monday, weekday, weekend). In some instances, the mobile interactive navigation system can process the historical trip data while in other instances the historical trip data can be communicated to a provider of navigation and/or travel assistance services for processing. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a routine trip <b>502</b> can include traveling from a location S to a destination at location C. The routine trip <b>502</b> can include a route that traverses route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>10</b>, S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>12</b> and nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>5</b>, N<b>6</b>, and N<b>7</b>. In this example, an &#x201c;R&#x201d; can be used to label routine route segments associated with the routine trip <b>502</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In some instances, a user may prefer to use routine route segments when making a trip that is different from the routine trip <b>502</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, to travel from location S to a destination at location B, a user can select between, for example, a first route that includes traversing route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>8</b> and route nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>1</b>, and N<b>2</b>, and a second route that includes traversing route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>10</b>, S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>9</b> and route nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>5</b>, N<b>6</b>, and N<b>7</b>. In this instance, the user or driver may prefer the second route over the first route because it includes routine route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>10</b>, S<b>11</b>, and S<b>12</b> with which the user may be more comfortable and/or familiar, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Routine route segments can be temporally defined, that is, can be associated with a specific time of day and/or with specific days. In some instances, a route segment can be a routine route segment for a first trip but may not be a routine route segment for a second trip because of the time and/or day in which the second trip is occurring.</p>

The areas A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, and A<b>4</b> can each have a specified or defined geographic area, however, they need not have similar areas, shapes, contours, and/or outlines. In other embodiments, the areas can have different areas, shapes, contours, and/or outlines from those described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. Moreover, other embodiments can include a different number of areas than the number used in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. Each of the locations S, A, B, C, D, E, and F can be located within one of the areas A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, and A<b>4</b>, for example. For example, locations S, D, and E can be located within area A<b>1</b>. In another example, locations C and F can be located within area A<b>3</b>. In some instances, such as when a location is at a boundary or interface between areas, the location may be included within more than one of the areas A<b>1</b>, A<b>2</b>, A<b>3</b>, and A<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A starting area can refer to an area or region in which the starting point of a trip is located, for example. Similarly, a destination area can refer to an area or region in which the destination of a trip is located, for example. For instance, when traveling from location S to location A, a user of a mobile interactive services system can start at location S in area A<b>1</b> and can arrive at location A in area A<b>2</b>. In this example, area A<b>1</b> is the starting area and area A<b>2</b> is the destination area. When traveling between any two locations in the navigation map <b>600</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a user or driver may travel from one area to another area or may travel within one of the areas (i.e., the starting and destination areas can be the same).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">A user of a mobile interactive services system may routinely or regularly prefer to travel to a specific destination area. For example, the user's place of work, preferred supermarket, and preferred shopping mall may all be located in area A<b>3</b>. A regularly occurring destination area can be referred to as a routine destination area, for example. As described above, a mobile interactive navigation system can be used to collect historical trip data which can be processed to determine whether a particular destination area occurs with a sufficient degree of regularity to be a routine destination area.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Destination areas can be temporally defined, that is, can be associated with a specific time of day and/or with specific days. In some instances, a destination area can be a routine destination area for a first trip but may not be a routine destination area for a second trip because of the time and/or day in which the second trip is occurring.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a schematic representation of a navigation map including dynamic destination areas, according to an embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> depicts a navigation map <b>650</b> that includes the location information and road information described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6A</figref>. Also shown are multiple areas B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, and B<b>3</b>, which can each be dynamically specified or defined based on, for example, historical trip data. For instance, the area, contour, shape, and/or size of each of the areas B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, and B<b>3</b> can be adjusted or modified based on statistical information that can result from the processing of historical trip data. Areas B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, and B<b>3</b> can, in some instances, overlap such that a location in the navigation map <b>650</b> can be included in more than one of areas B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, and B<b>3</b>. Moreover, as areas B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, and B<b>3</b> can dynamically change, whether a location is included within a specified area can vary over time.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, the home of a user of a mobile interactive services system can be in location S and the user may take short trips, such as for local grocery shopping, for example, to locations D and E. Thus, the geographic scope of area B<b>1</b> may be at least partially determined from historical trip data collected from trips between the user's home and local shopping at locations D and E. Changes in the user's local shopping habits can result in changes to area B<b>1</b>. In another example, the user's place of work can be in location C. The user may generally stop at locations B and F (e.g., gas station, coffee shop) when traveling to and/or from work. Thus, the geographic scope of area B<b>3</b> may be determined at least partially from historical trip data collected from trips to and/or from work. Changes in the user's travel habits to work (e.g., dropping off and/or picking up a child at daycare near location A) can result in changes to area B<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As described above, a user of a mobile interactive services system may routinely or regularly prefer to travel to a specific destination area. For example, area B<b>3</b> can be a routine destination area when the user travels to area B<b>3</b> as a destination area with a sufficient degree of regularity. In this regard, the user can have a preference for route segments located within a routine destination area when making a trip. For example, when traveling from location S in area B<b>1</b> to location B in areas B<b>2</b> and B<b>3</b>, the user can select between, for example, a first route that includes route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>1</b>, S<b>2</b>, and S<b>8</b> and route nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>1</b>, and N<b>2</b>, and a second route that includes route segments S<b>0</b>, S<b>10</b>, S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>9</b> and route nodes N<b>0</b>, N<b>5</b>, N<b>6</b>, and N<b>7</b>. In this instance, the user can have a preference for the second route because it includes more route segments (e.g., S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, and S<b>9</b>) associated with routine destination area B<b>3</b> than the first route (e.g., S<b>8</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In some instances, the user's travel preferences, including routine route segments and/or routine destination areas, for example, can be used to provide and/or adjust travel assistance instructions or data provided by a travel assistance service provider. For example, upon requesting travel assistance (e.g., requesting auto repair assistance, medical care assistance) through a mobile interactive services system, a user may receive navigation data and/or other data related to one or more assistance providers. The user may select or accept one from multiple available assistance providers based on, for example, preferences in the routes to and/or from the assistance providers. For example, when traveling to receive medical care, a user can prefer a medical care facility for which the route to the facility uses routine route segments and/or the medical care facility is located in a routine destination area. In another example, when requesting auto repair service, a user can prefer an auto repair shop for which an assistance vehicle dispatched by the auto repair shop would use routine route segments in reaching the place where assistance is desirable and/or the auto repair shop is located in a routine destination area.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic representation of navigation data including location of the assistance request and of multiple assistance providers, according to an embodiment of the invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a navigation map <b>700</b> that includes the location information, road information, and area information described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. Also shown are multiple assistance service providers (e.g., auto repair shops, gas stations, police stations, medical centers) that can be associated with an assistance category. For medical assistance requests, for example, the assistance providers illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can include police stations and/or medical centers. In another example, for auto repair assistance the assistance providers in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> can include auto repair shops.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the assistance providers can be located near one of the locations S, A, B, C, D, E, and F. For instance, the assistance provider S<b>1</b> is shown near location S and assistance providers A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> are shown near location A. Other assistance providers also shown in the example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> include B<b>1</b>, C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b>, E<b>1</b>, E<b>2</b>, E<b>3</b>, F<b>1</b>, and F<b>2</b>. In some instances, one or more assistance providers may be recommended (e.g., highly or positively rated) by a community-of-interest (COI) to which the user belongs and/or participates. In this example, COI-recommended assistance providers are shown in solid lines and those not recommended by a COI are shown in dotted lines. The user can, for example, have a preference to use or select an assistance provider that is recommended by a COI. Also shown in the navigation map <b>700</b> is a location X that can correspond to the location of the vehicle or person that requested the assistance. In some instances, location X can correspond to the current location of the vehicle or person that requested assistance, which can be different from the location at which the assistance request took place.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The request for assistance can result from the user's own perception or experience (e.g., flat tire, ill passenger, low oil light on in dashboard) or from an automated event (e.g., vehicle diagnostics system activates request for assistance) that engages the mobile interactive services system to contact a travel assistance service. In one embodiment, the travel assistance service can provide the user with data related to one or more assistance providers that correspond to the desired assistance such that the user can select a preferred assistance provider. In another embodiment, the travel assistance service can provide a service center with which the user can communicate to make the assistance request. The service center can subsequently provide the user with data related to an assistance provider. In some instances, the user may accept the assistance provider suggested by the service center. In other instances, the user may prefer a different assistance provider than the one suggested based on, for example, the user's own prior experience with the originally suggested assistance provider.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, at least a portion of the data related to the assistance providers (e.g., navigation data, name of place, location, scope of services provided) can be graphically represented in the mobile interactive services system to assist the user in the selection process. In this regard, data related to the assistance providers can be graphically represented to indicate a relative preference between multiple assistance providers based on, for example, travel preferences and/or COI recommendations.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a schematic representation of navigation data related to the multiple assistance providers, according to an embodiment of the invention. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a travel diagram <b>800</b> that includes information related to multiple travel or navigation routes between different assistance providers and location X as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. In some embodiments, a mobile interactive services system, such as the mobile interactive services systems <b>200</b> and <b>300</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, respectively, can be used to collect, process, operate, display, and/or select data such as the navigation data illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The travel diagram <b>800</b> can have data that is based on collected and/or processed historical trip data, including route segment information (e.g. routine route segments) and/or travel area information (e.g., routine destination area). In some embodiments, at least a portion the navigation data shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> can be received from a travel assistance service through a hybrid satellite/terrestrial mobile communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The example illustrated by the travel diagram <b>800</b> includes a first route <b>802</b> between location X and assistance provider B<b>1</b>, a second route <b>804</b> between location X and assistance provider E<b>2</b>, and a third route <b>806</b> between location X and assistance provider A<b>1</b>. Other examples can illustrate travel routes for a trip between locations X and other assistance providers different from those shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The first route <b>802</b> can correspond to, for example, a route resulting in the least amount of travel time and the shortest travel distance. In this regard, assistance can reach location X or can be sought from B<b>1</b> in the shortest amount of time, for example. The first route <b>802</b> can include a portion of route segment S<b>8</b>, which is not a routine route segment (R). In this example, the assistance provider B<b>1</b> is not recommended (e.g., not highly rated, negative reviews, not covered) by a community or group of interest to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The second route <b>804</b> can correspond to, for example, a travel route resulting in the multiple routine route segments being used. The second route <b>804</b> can include route segments S<b>15</b>, S<b>11</b>, S<b>12</b>, S<b>9</b>, and S<b>8</b>, of which route segments S<b>11</b> and S<b>12</b> are routine route segments (R). The second route <b>804</b> can result in the longest travel distance and/or the most travel time. In this regard, assistance can reach location X or can be sought from B<b>1</b> in the most amount of time, for example, when compared to the first route <b>802</b> and the third route <b>806</b>. For the second route <b>804</b>, the assistance provider E<b>2</b> is recommended (e.g., highly rated, positive reviews, covered) by a community or group of interest to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The third route <b>806</b> can correspond to, for example, a travel route that can include route segments S<b>4</b>, S<b>3</b>, and S<b>8</b>, none of which is a routine route segment (R). The third route <b>806</b> can result in neither the longest or shortest travel distance nor the most or least travel time. For the third route <b>806</b>, the assistance provider A<b>1</b> is recommended (e.g., highly rated, positive reviews, covered) by a community or group of interest to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the example illustrated by the travel diagram <b>800</b>, when determining an assistance provider, a user of a mobile interactive services system can have a preference for, for example, the fastest travel route, the shortest travel route distance, the travel route with the most routine route segments, the travel route to a routine destination area, and/or a combination of the above. Based on these preferences, the user may select the navigation data of one of the assistance providers in the travel diagram <b>800</b>. For example, the user can prefer the second route <b>806</b> because it includes a large number of routine route segments and because assistance provider E<b>2</b> is recommended by a COI. Routine route segments and positive ratings or reviews may give the user a level of comfort, ease, and/or familiarity from previous experiences (e.g., previous trips) that can overcome, in some instances, the benefits of faster travel times and shorter travel distances provided by the first route <b>802</b> and the third route <b>806</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">A user's preferences can be included in the navigation data to and from an assistance provider that is provided by a travel assistance service through a mobile interactive services system. In some embodiments, the mobile interactive services system can process the user's preferences to generate at least a portion of the navigation data illustrated by the travel diagram <b>800</b>. In other embodiments, a travel assistance service can process the user's preferences and communicate navigation data that is based on these preferences to the mobile interactive services system through a hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The processing of a user's preferences can include providing a weight, ranking, and/or priority to multiple aspects of a trip to and/or from an assistance provider such as, but need not limited to, travel time, travel distance, starting and/or destination location, destination area information, route segment information, traffic conditions, time of day, day of travel, and/or COI rating. The weighted aspects of the trip can be combined to determine a criterion that can be used to select one of the assistance providers that are possible for a particular assistance request. In one example, the combination can be a linear combination while in another example the combination can be non-linear. In one embodiment, the criterion can be used to graphically represent a relative preference between multiple assistance providers for user selection.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In another embodiment, at least one criterion can be used by a travel assistance service operated through a mobile interactive services system to determine a preferred assistance provider. For example, when a user connects with a service center to obtain travel assistance, the service center operator may provide the user with a preferred assistance provider. The navigation data of the preferred assistance provider can be made available (e.g., graphically represented or displayed on a display screen) to the user through a mobile interactive services system. In some embodiments, routine route segments, routine destination areas, and/or COI ratings or reviews may be given significant weight when determining the criterion from which to select an assistance provider.</p>

In this regard, when selecting an assistance provider, the travel assistance service can consider the location of where the service is to be provided, the user travel preferences, and/or ratings of possible assistance providers, for example. Data related to the assistance provider can be communicated from the service center to the user through the hybrid satellite/terrestrial communication network, for example. At <b>1206</b>, the mobile interactive services system can graphically represent or display data related to the assistance provider offered by the service center.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">At <b>1208</b>, when the type of assistance is such that the user may prefer to travel to the assistance provider (e.g., medical care), the mobile interactive service system can at <b>1210</b> display navigation data to aid the user in reaching the assistance provider. Back at <b>1208</b>, when the type of assistance is such that the user may prefer to have the assistance provider reach the user (e.g., auto breakdown), the mobile interactive service system can at <b>1214</b> display navigation data to provide tracking of a dispatched service vehicle from the assistance provider. At <b>1212</b> and <b>1216</b>, after the service is rendered, the user can provide a rating or review of the assistance provider to be shared with others in certain communities or groups with common interests. After <b>1212</b> and <b>1216</b>, the method can proceed to end <b>1218</b>.</p>
