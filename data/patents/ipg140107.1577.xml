</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0006">Connectors of this type are used particularly in the oil and methane industries, in the field of construction of power lines within the drill strings used in the construction of drilling wells. These power lines are used to transmit to the surface signals representative of the conditions of operation of the drilling equipment, or of the geological or environmental conditions within the well.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0007">Generally, the strings used comprise hundreds of pipes and any other components connected in series. The power lines must therefore transmit their signals through all the joints between successive components of the strings. Consequently, a single faulty connections may result in the malfunctioning of the entire line.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0008">There are different factors affecting the reliability of connectors. First, because in general the connection between the drill string components is done by screwing, and because the manufacturing tolerances of the drilling components generally do not reach the level of precision required by electrical equipment, upon completing the assembly it may occur that the electrical contacts of successive components are not aligned with each other, and/or that there is still an axial gap between them that prevents the achievement of the contact. In addition, a certain angular displacement between a component and another can occur accidentally during the operation of the drill string, thereby causing misalignment of the contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0009">These issues have been addressed for example in U.S. Pat. No. 6,929,493, which describes an electrical connector of the type defined herein in the preamble. The connector of U.S. Pat. No. 6,929,493 includes a pair of annular contacts, which are received in respective annular seats by being drowned in an elastic material. Although this device appears to solve the above problems, however, it seems to be able to cover only those manufacturing tolerances that are not too large, and certainly does not seems to be able to cope with a situation where there is a significant relative angular displacement and therefore also a significant approach, between a component and another of the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0010">An object of the invention is therefore to provide an electrical connector which effectively solves the above problems.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0011">Accordingly, the object of the invention is an electric connector as defined above, in which said second contact element is positioned at a limited circumferential arc of the abutment ring, stop means being provided for stopping the first contact element at the second contact element for providing the coupling between the first and second connector parts, wherein in the coupled condition the resilient support structure of the first connector part biases the first contact element in the axial direction against the abutment ring, and in the circumferential direction against said stop means.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0012">According to this provision, the flexible coupling between the resilient structure and the abutment ring allows not only to avoid misalignment and axial spaces between the electrical contacts upon assembly, but also allows to compensate for relative angular displacements between the supports during the operation, as well as to withstand the subsequent rapprochement between the supports.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0013">Electric connection devices according to claims <b>10</b> and <b>15</b> are also a subject of the invention.</p>

<p id="p-0025" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a pair of drill pipes, indicated respectively by references <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>. Although the invention will be described as being applied to these pipes, it is understood that it is not limited to that specific application, as it can find employment in other technology areas in addition to the drilling of the ground. These pipes are conventionally made of tubular elements, to which ends are fixed, usually by soldering, connection end elements which are intended to implement the joint between consecutive pipes of a drill string (the so-called &#x201c;tool joints&#x201d;). These end elements are generally provided with tapered threads. In particular, the end elements that are intended to make the male part of the joints, and which are provided with an external thread have been indicated with <b>1</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a </i>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, whereas the end elements that are intended to make the female part of joints, and which are provided with an internal thread have been designated with <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> shows more clearly a male end element <b>3</b><i>a </i>and a female end element <b>1</b><i>b </i>when the assembly has not yet been completed. In the figure are visible the internal thread <b>1</b><i>f </i>and external thread <b>3</b><i>f </i>of the female end element <b>1</b><i>b </i>and male end element male <b>3</b><i>a</i>. Primary and secondary shoulder surfaces <b>1</b><i>g</i>, <b>1</b><i>h </i>are further provided on the female end element <b>1</b><i>b</i>, which are arranged at opposite ends of the internal thread <b>1</b><i>f</i>; corresponding primary and secondary shoulder surfaces <b>3</b><i>g</i>, <b>3</b><i>h </i>are provided on the male end element <b>3</b><i>a</i>, which surfaces are arranged at the opposite ends of the external thread <b>3</b><i>f</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> show that between corresponding shoulder surfaces <b>1</b><i>g</i>, <b>3</b><i>g </i>and <b>1</b><i>h</i>, <b>3</b><i>h</i>, there is a certain distance which indicates that the screw coupling between the female end element <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the male end element <b>3</b><i>a </i>has not yet been completed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows female end element <b>1</b><i>b </i>and male end element <b>3</b><i>a </i>when the coupling has not yet been completed, in a condition in which these elements are however further screwed together relative to the condition in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. In the condition of full coupling (not shown) the distance between corresponding shoulder surfaces <b>1</b><i>g</i>, <b>3</b><i>g </i>and <b>1</b><i>h</i>, <b>3</b><i>h </i>is substantially reduced to zero, except for manufacturing tolerances.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0029">On the inner surface of each drill pipe <b>1</b>, <b>3</b> is placed a respective piece of electric cable C<b>1</b>, C<b>3</b>. Preferably, this piece of cable C<b>1</b>, C<b>3</b> is embedded in a coating of ceramic material, which by hardening causes the wire to be integral with the respective inner surface of the tube. At the end elements <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and <b>3</b><i>a</i>, <b>3</b><i>b </i>is arranged a further respective piece of cable, indicated by C<b>1</b>&#x2032;, C<b>3</b>&#x2032;, which is passed through holes or grooves made in the body of the end elements. Within each drill pipe <b>1</b>, <b>3</b> the piece of cable C<b>1</b>, C<b>3</b> of the middle part of the pipe is connected to each of the pieces of cable C<b>1</b>&#x2032;, C<b>3</b>&#x2032; of the end elements by respective internal connection members <b>5</b>, which are housed in respective seats being provided in the end elements of the pipes. One of these internal connection members is illustrated in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> and is, in this example, implemented as a screw tightening clamp. As a result, the member <b>5</b> includes first and second parts of the terminal <b>6</b>, <b>7</b>, each of which includes a housing <b>6</b><i>a</i>, <b>7</b><i>a </i>made of an insulating material, inside which a respective contact body <b>6</b><i>b</i>, <b>7</b><i>b </i>is arranged, which is made of electrically conductive material. To secure the first and second parts of the terminal <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> to each other, a clamping element <b>8</b> is provided, which comprises a bush having an external thread capable of engaging a corresponding internal thread that is provided within the seat which houses the connection member <b>5</b>. By means of elastic means <b>8</b><i>a </i>being interposed between the clamping element and the first part of the terminal <b>6</b>, the clamping element <b>8</b> screwed within the seat urges the first part of the terminal <b>6</b> against the second part of the terminal <b>7</b>, which rests against the bottom the seat, thereby providing the clamping connection member <b>5</b>. The ends of the cable pieces C<b>1</b>, C<b>1</b>&#x2032; are interposed between the first part of the terminal <b>6</b> and the second part of the terminal <b>7</b>, in contact with the contact bodies <b>6</b><i>b</i>, <b>7</b><i>b</i>, which ends are inserted from opposite sides relative thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0030">Female end element <b>1</b><i>b </i>and male end element <b>3</b><i>a </i>support first and second parts of connector, which are indicated with <b>10</b> and <b>20</b>, respectively. These first and second parts of connector <b>10</b>, <b>20</b> are housed in respective annular seats that are obtained in the primary shoulder surfaces <b>1</b><i>g </i>and <b>3</b><i>g </i>of the female end element <b>1</b><i>b </i>and male end element <b>3</b><i>a</i>, and are therefore arranged co-axially with the common axis of extension y defined by the drill pipes <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>, relative to which, consequently, the female end element <b>1</b><i>b </i>and male end element <b>3</b><i>a </i>extend co-axially. In the example given herein, the y-axis is in fact also the axis of engagement of the pipes <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0031">The first connector part <b>10</b> and the second connector part <b>20</b> are couplable to each other and comprise a first contact element <b>11</b> and a second contact element <b>21</b>, respectively, which are made of a conductive material, that are suitable for closing an electric contact with one another when first and second connector parts are coupled to each other. This coupling between the first and second parts of the connector is achieved when the female end element <b>1</b><i>b </i>and the male end element <b>3</b><i>a </i>is at least partially grafted to each other, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0032">As can be more clearly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the first connector part <b>10</b> comprises a resilient support structure <b>13</b>, a proximal end <b>13</b><i>a </i>thereof being made integral to the first support, and a distal end <b>13</b><i>b </i>thereof supporting the first contact element <b>11</b>. The resilient support structure <b>13</b> has the shape of a coil spring extending co-axially with the axis of coupling y, and whose body has a hollow section. In the example shown, the hollow section is also circular. However, the circularity of the section is not essential, and this could also be different, for example square. Within the inner cavity <b>15</b> of the support elastic structure body <b>13</b> the end piece C<b>1</b>&#x2032; is passed which is connected to the piece of electric cable C<b>1</b>, so as to electrically connect this cable to the first contact element <b>11</b> (for simplicity of representation the piece C<b>1</b>&#x2032; within the cavity <b>15</b> is not illustrated). In this application, the resilient support structure <b>13</b> may be made of a metal material, e.g. steel.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0033">At the distal end <b>13</b><i>b </i>of the resilient support structure <b>13</b>, a box-like body <b>17</b> is fixed which is opened in the distal direction, the first contact element <b>11</b> being housed therein. As can be particularly seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, the first contact element <b>11</b> has the shape of a bar, and is provided with a middle flanged portion <b>11</b><i>a</i>. The first contact element <b>11</b> is slidingly inserted within an intermediate bush-shaped housing <b>19</b> that is made from insulating material, which is in turn slidingly inserted within the box-like body <b>17</b>. The sliding direction of the first contact element <b>11</b> and the intermediate housing <b>19</b> is parallel to the y-axis. In the example shown herein, there are two first contact elements <b>11</b>, connected to two respective leads of the electric cable C<b>1</b>&#x2032;, which in the example given herein is a bipolar cable.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0034">The first contact element <b>11</b> and the intermediate housing <b>19</b> are biased, independently of each other, in the distal direction, so as to protrude outwardly from the distal surface of the box-like body <b>17</b>, when the first part of the connector <b>10</b> is not coupled with the second part of connector <b>20</b> (condition shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>). To this end, within the box-like body <b>17</b>, resilient means <b>19</b><i>a </i>associated with the intermediate housing <b>19</b> and resilient means <b>19</b><i>b </i>associated with the first contact element <b>11</b> are accommodated co-axially with respect to each other. Particularly, the resilient means <b>19</b><i>a </i>consist of a pack of Belleville washers, which abuts on the one side against an inner surface of the box-like body <b>17</b> and on the other side abuts against a surface of the intermediate housing <b>19</b>; the resilient means <b>19</b><i>b </i>consist of a tubular element made of elastic and insulating material being arranged around that end of the cable C<b>1</b>&#x2032; which is connected to an end part of the first contact element <b>11</b>, where said cylinder on the one side abuts against the inner surface of the box-like body <b>17</b>, and on the other side abuts against the middle flanged portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the first contact element <b>11</b>. A snap ring <b>19</b><i>c </i>interposed between the intermediate housing <b>19</b> and the box-like body <b>17</b> is arranged so as to define the maximum travel of the intermediate housing <b>19</b> outside the box-like body <b>17</b>. On the other hand, a shoulder surface of the intermediate housing <b>19</b> cooperating with the flanged portion <b>11</b><i>a </i>of the first contact element <b>11</b> defines the maximum travel of the first contact element <b>11</b> outside the intermediate housing <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0035">As can be seen most clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the second part of connector <b>20</b> comprises an abutment ring <b>23</b> suitable of being slidingly engaged by the first contact element <b>11</b> during the fitting between the pipes <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>. The abutment ring <b>23</b> accommodates the second contact element <b>21</b>. The contact element <b>21</b> is electrically connected to the end piece C<b>3</b>&#x2032; connected with the piece of cable C<b>3</b> associated with the second drill pipe <b>3</b>. In this application, the abutment ring <b>23</b> may be made of metallic material, e.g. steel.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0036">The second contact element <b>21</b> is located at a limited circumferential arc of the abutment ring <b>23</b>. By limited circumferential arc is meant a circumferential arc of the circumference of the abutment ring <b>23</b> having a length such that the ratio of the length of the arc to the length of the circumference of the abutment ring is less than 1. Particularly, the second contact element <b>21</b> has the shape of a bar, and is provided with a middle flanged portion <b>21</b><i>a </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>). The second contact element <b>21</b> is inserted in a steady state within a housing <b>27</b> that is bush-shaped and made of insulating material, which is in turn placed in a steady state within a hole in the body of the abutment ring <b>23</b>. In the example shown herein, there are two second contact elements <b>21</b>, connected to two respective leads of the electric cable C<b>3</b>&#x2032;, which in the example given herein consists of a bipolar cable. As can be seen particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the second contact elements <b>21</b> and the respective housings <b>27</b> are arranged so as to have their respective distal surfaces flush with the distal annular surface <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the abutment ring <b>23</b>, i.e. the surface on which the first contact element <b>11</b> slides in the final screwing step, between the first and second drill pipes <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0037">According to the invention stop means <b>30</b> are provided which are suitable to stop the first contact element <b>11</b> at the second contact element <b>21</b> to achieve the coupling between first and second parts of connector <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In the condition of coupling between the first and second parts of connector <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>, the resilient support structure <b>13</b> of the first part of the connector <b>10</b> biases the first contact element <b>11</b> in the axial direction against the abutment ring <b>23</b> and in the circumferential direction against the stop means <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0038">Preferably, the means <b>30</b> include a protruding formation <b>31</b> provided on the abutment ring <b>23</b>, which axially protrudes from the distal annular surface <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the abutment ring <b>23</b>. Such protruding formation is suitable to be engaged by a notch <b>17</b><i>a </i>which is shaped in a manner corresponding thereto and provided on the box-like body <b>17</b> within which the first contact element <b>11</b> is accommodated. Preferably, the projecting formation <b>31</b> and the notch <b>17</b><i>a </i>have respective undercut surfaces <b>31</b><i>b</i>, <b>17</b><i>b </i>by means of which they are intended to engage each other.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0039">In the final screwing step between the drill pipes <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>, at a certain point the first contact element <b>11</b> starts to engage the distal annular surface <b>23</b><i>a </i>of the abutment ring <b>23</b>. When the screwing operation is continued, the contact element <b>11</b> and the intermediate housing <b>19</b> thereof are pushed inwardly of the box-like body <b>17</b>, against the action of the pack of Belleville washers <b>19</b><i>a </i>and of the resilient element <b>19</b><i>b</i>. When a certain circumferential position is achieved for the abutment ring <b>23</b>, the box-like body <b>17</b> abuts against the protruding formation <b>31</b> of the abutment ring <b>23</b>, thereby preventing a further relative rotation of the box-like body <b>17</b> relative to the abutment ring <b>23</b>. At this point, the first contact element <b>11</b> supported by the box-like body <b>17</b> is aligned with the respective contact element <b>21</b> supported by the abutment ring <b>23</b>, thereby resulting in the closure of the electrical contact, and then the coupling between first and second parts of connector <b>10</b>, <b>20</b>. The sliding movement between the first contact element <b>11</b> and the abutment ring <b>23</b>, which occurs in the final screwing step until the stop of the box-like body <b>17</b> against the protruding formation <b>31</b> causes a friction of the distal surfaces of the contact elements <b>11</b> and <b>21</b> which removes any dirt that may be present thereon. The further screwing between the drill pipes after the stop of the box-like body <b>17</b> against the protruding formation <b>31</b> has the effect of increasing the elastic load on the resilient support structure <b>13</b> until the completion of the fitting between the pipes.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0040">The maintenance of the contact between the first and second contact elements <b>11</b>, <b>21</b> is thus ensured by the resilient force of the resilient support structure <b>13</b> of the first connector part <b>10</b> which urges the first contact element <b>11</b> against the second contact element <b>21</b> and by the resilient means <b>19</b><i>b </i>which bias the first contact element <b>11</b> against the second contact element <b>21</b>. To prevent electrical parts from being reached by water, mud and other fluids during operation, gaskets G<b>1</b>, G<b>2</b>, G<b>3</b> have been provided, which are placed:
<ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0004" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0041">on the distal surface of the intermediate housing <b>19</b> around the first intermediate contact element <b>11</b> (gasket G<b>1</b>);</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0042">between the intermediate housing <b>19</b> and the box-like body <b>15</b> (O-ring G<b>2</b>), and</li>
        <li id="ul0004-0003" num="0043">between enclosure <b>27</b> of the second contact element <b>21</b> and the abutment ring <b>23</b> (O-ring G<b>3</b>).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0044">The undercut surfaces <b>17</b><i>b </i>and <b>31</b><i>b </i>of the box-like body <b>17</b> and of the protruding formation <b>31</b> of the abutment ring <b>23</b> act as an inclined plane that contribute along with the resilient force of the resilient support structure <b>13</b> of the first connector part <b>10</b> to hold the box-like body <b>17</b>, and accordingly the contact element <b>11</b> against the abutment ring <b>23</b>, and then against the second contact element <b>21</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0045">If, during assembly or in operation, a further relative angular displacement should occur between the first and second drill pipes <b>1</b>, <b>3</b>, this movement would not cause any misalignment of the contact elements <b>11</b>, <b>21</b>, but simply a further deformation of the resilient support structure <b>13</b>, which has the beneficial effect of increasing the elastic force that biases the first contact element <b>11</b> in the axial direction against the abutment ring <b>23</b>, and in the circumferential direction against the protruding formation <b>31</b> of the abutment ring <b>23</b>. The resilient support structure <b>13</b> also supports the crushing increase which is due to the rapprochement between the pipe end elements.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a variant embodiment in which the first part of the connector <b>10</b> comprises a resilient support structure <b>13</b> having the form of a right-handed coil spring, unlike the embodiment previously described, in which the spring was left-handed. This is to adapt the electrical connector according to the invention to a different way of screwing. Since the elements of the variant embodiment in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> correspond to those of the previous embodiment, they have been designated with the same numerical references, and will not be further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows the first connector part according to a variant embodiment in which the first connector part <b>10</b> includes a resilient support structure <b>13</b> having a tubular shape. This resilient support structure <b>13</b> includes a coil spring extending co-axially with the fitting axis y, and having a hollow section body, which spring is similar in structure and function to the coil springs described above. A coating <b>13</b><i>c </i>of elastomeric material is also a part of the structure <b>13</b> of the same variant embodiment, which coating is arranged to cover the space between the coils of the spring in order to provide the continuity of the structure <b>13</b>. This variant embodiment provides a better sealing than the implementations without an elastomeric coating. Since the elements of the variant embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, except for the coating of elastomeric material, correspond to those of previous embodiments, they have been designated with the same numerical references, and will not be further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">Although the invention will be described as being applied to drill pipes, it will be understood that it is not limited to that specific application, as it can find employment in other technology fields in addition to the drilling of the ground. Accordingly, instead of being supported by respective end elements of drill pipes, the first and second connector parts can be supported, more generally, by first and seconds supports, respectively, which can be assembled to one another by screw- or bayonet-fitting. It is essential that in the fitting movement between these supports a translational movement in the direction of the fitting axis (which in the above-described example coincides with the extension axis y of the pipes <b>1</b> and <b>3</b>) and a rotational movement around the fitting axis are combined.</p>
