<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND INFORMATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">As semiconductor devices approach limits for scaling, pitch doubling and three-dimensional stacking have been considered as alternative techniques to increase device density and lower costs. While lithography limitations may be addressed via pitch doubling either by using a spacer hard mask or double patterning, contacting the less than nominal pitch features between devices at three-dimensional layers may be challenging due to critical dimension and alignment constraints.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It will be appreciated that for simplicity and/or clarity of illustration, elements illustrated in the figures have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For example, the dimensions of some of the elements may be exaggerated relative to other elements for clarity. Further, if considered appropriate, reference numerals have been repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding and/or analogous elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth to provide a thorough understanding of claimed subject matter. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that claimed subject matter may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components and/or circuits have not been described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the following description and/or claims, the terms coupled and/or connected, along with their derivatives, may be used. In particular embodiments, connected may be used to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical and/or electrical contact with each other. Coupled may mean that two or more elements are in direct physical and/or electrical contact. However, coupled may also mean that two or more elements may not be in direct contact with each other, but yet may still cooperate and/or interact with each other. For example, &#x201c;coupled&#x201d; may mean that two or more elements do not contact each other but are indirectly joined together via another element or intermediate elements. Finally, the terms &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;overlying,&#x201d; and &#x201c;over&#x201d; may be used in the following description and claims. &#x201c;On,&#x201d; &#x201c;overlying,&#x201d; and &#x201c;over&#x201d; may be used to indicate that two or more elements are in direct physical contact with each other.
