<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments of the present invention relate to wireless communication systems in general and, more particularly, to cross-carrier resource mapping in multi-carrier wireless communication systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This section is intended to provide a background or context to the disclosed embodiments. The description herein may include subject matter that could be pursued, but which has not necessarily been previously conceived or pursued. Therefore, unless otherwise indicated herein, what is described in this section is not prior art to the description and claims in this application and is not admitted to be prior art by inclusion in this section.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various types of communication content such as voice, data, and so on. These systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication with multiple users by sharing the available system resources (e.g., bandwidth and transmit power). Examples of such multiple-access systems include code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, frequency division multiple access (FDMA) systems, 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) systems, and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) systems.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In conventional wireless networks, data and control signals are confined to the same carrier. In these systems, a wireless terminal can decode the control information in a downlink carrier to determine which of the data resources transmitted on the carrier are allocated to the wireless terminal. The wireless terminal also uses the control information to determine the uplink resources that have been granted to the wireless terminal by the base station serving the wireless terminal. For example, in Release 8 of the 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) LTE (Long Term Evolution) standard, each subframe of the downlink carrier includes a physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) and a physical downlink shared data channel (PDSDCH). The PDCCH includes a control format indicator (CFI), in a downlink control format indicator channel (PDCFICH) at the beginning of the subframe, that identifies the duration of the PDCCH by the number of symbols it occupies in the time domain. Using this information, the wireless terminal knows where the control channel ends and the data channel begins.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In the following description, for purposes of explanation and not limitation, details and descriptions are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the various disclosed embodiments. However, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the various embodiments may be practiced in other embodiments that depart from these details and descriptions.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;component,&#x201d; &#x201c;module,&#x201d; &#x201c;system&#x201d; and the like are intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, firmware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on a computing device and the computing device can be a component. One or more components can reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. In addition, these components can execute from various computer readable media having various data structures stored thereon. The components may communicate by way of local and/or remote processes such as in accordance with a signal having one or more data packets (e.g., data from one component interacting with another component in a local system, distributed system, and/or across a network such as the Internet with other systems by way of the signal).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Furthermore, certain embodiments are described herein in connection with a user equipment. A user equipment can also be called a user terminal, and may contain some or all of the functionality of a system, subscriber unit, subscriber station, mobile station, mobile wireless terminal, mobile device, node, device, remote station, remote terminal, terminal, wireless communication device, wireless communication apparatus or user agent. A user equipment can be a cellular telephone, a cordless telephone, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) phone, a smart phone, a wireless local loop (WLL) station, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a laptop, a handheld communication device, a handheld computing device, a satellite radio, a wireless modem card and/or another processing device for communicating over a wireless system. Moreover, various aspects are described herein in connection with a base station. A base station may be utilized for communicating with one or more wireless terminals and can also be called, and may contain some or all of the functionality of, an access point, node, Node B, evolved NodeB (eNB) or some other network entity. A base station communicates over the air-interface with wireless terminals. The communication may take place through one or more sectors. The base station can act as a router between the wireless terminal and the rest of the access network, which can include an Internet Protocol (IP) network, by converting received air-interface frames to IP packets. The base station can also coordinate management of attributes for the air interface, and may also be the gateway between a wired network and the wireless network.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Various aspects, embodiments or features will be presented in terms of systems that may include a number of devices, components, modules, and the like. It is to be understood and appreciated that the various systems may include additional devices, components, modules, and so on, and/or may not include all of the devices, components, modules and so on, discussed in connection with the figures. A combination of these approaches may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Additionally, in the subject description, the word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used to mean serving as an example, instance or illustration. Any embodiment or design described herein as &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments or designs. Rather, use of the word exemplary is intended to present concepts in a concrete manner.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The various disclosed embodiments may be incorporated into a communication system. In one example, such communication system utilizes an orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) that effectively partitions the overall system bandwidth into multiple (N<sub>F</sub>) subcarriers, which may also be referred to as frequency sub-channels, tones or frequency bins. For an OFDM system, the data to be transmitted (i.e., the information bits) is first encoded with a particular coding scheme to generate coded bits, and the coded bits are further grouped into multi-bit symbols that are then mapped to modulation symbols. Each modulation symbol corresponds to a point in a signal constellation defined by a particular modulation scheme (e.g., M-PSK or M-QAM) used for data transmission. At each time interval, which may be dependent on the bandwidth of each frequency subcarrier, a modulation symbol may be transmitted on each of the N<sub>F </sub>frequency subcarriers. Thus, OFDM may be used to combat inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by frequency selective fading, which is characterized by different amounts of attenuation across the system bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Generally, a wireless multiple-access communication system can simultaneously support communication for multiple wireless terminals. Each terminal communicates with one or more base stations through transmissions on the forward and reverse links. The forward link (or downlink) refers to the communication link from the base stations to the terminals, and the reverse link (or uplink) refers to the communication link from the terminals to the base stations. This communication link can be established through a single-in-single-out, multiple-in-single-out or a multiple-in-multiple-out (MIMO) system.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A MIMO system employs multiple (N<sub>T</sub>) transmit antennas and multiple (N<sub>R</sub>) receive antennas for data transmission. A MIMO channel formed by the N<sub>T </sub>transmit and N<sub>R </sub>receive antennas may be decomposed into N<sub>S </sub>independent channels, which are also referred to as spatial channels, where N<sub>S</sub>&#x2266;min{N<sub>T</sub>, N<sub>R</sub>}. Each of the N<sub>S </sub>independent channels corresponds to a dimension. The MIMO system can provide improved performance (e.g., higher throughput and/or greater reliability) if the additional dimensionalities created by the multiple transmit and receive antennas are utilized. A MIMO system also supports time division duplex (TDD) and frequency division duplex (FDD) systems. In a TDD system, the forward and reverse link transmissions are on the same frequency region so that the reciprocity principle allows the estimation of the forward link channel from the reverse link channel. This enables the base station to extract transmit beamforming gain on the forward link when multiple antennas are available at the base station.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a wireless communication system within which the various disclosed embodiments may be implemented. A base station <b>100</b> may include multiple antenna groups, and each antenna group may comprise one or more antennas. For example, if the base station <b>100</b> comprises six antennas, one antenna group may comprise a first antenna <b>104</b> and a second antenna <b>106</b>, another antenna group may comprise a third antenna <b>108</b> and a fourth antenna <b>110</b>, while a third group may comprise a fifth antenna <b>112</b> and a sixth antenna <b>114</b>. It should be noted that while each of the above-noted antenna groups were identified as having two antennas, more or fewer antennas may be utilized in each antenna group.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a first user equipment <b>116</b> is illustrated to be in communication with, for example, the fifth antenna <b>112</b> and the sixth antenna <b>114</b> to enable the transmission of information to the first user equipment <b>116</b> over a first forward link <b>120</b>, and the reception of information from the first user equipment <b>116</b> over a first reverse link <b>118</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates a second user equipment <b>122</b> that is in communication with, for example, the third antenna <b>108</b> and the fourth antenna <b>110</b> to enable the transmission of information to the second user equipment <b>122</b> over a second forward link <b>126</b>, and the reception of information from the second user equipment <b>122</b> over a second reverse link <b>124</b>. In a Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) system, the communication links <b>118</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>124</b> <b>126</b> that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may use different frequencies for communication. For example, the first forward link <b>120</b> may use a different frequency than that used by the first reverse link <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In some embodiments, each group of antennas and/or the area in which they are designed to communicate is often referred to as a sector of the base station. For example, the different antenna groups that are depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> may be designed to communicate to the user equipment in a sector of the base station <b>100</b>. In communication over the forward links <b>120</b> and <b>126</b>, the transmitting antennas of the base station <b>100</b> utilize beamforming in order to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the forward links for the different user equipment <b>116</b> and <b>122</b>. Also, a base station that uses beamforming to transmit to user equipment scattered randomly throughout its coverage area causes less interference to user equipment in the neighboring cells than a base station that transmits omni-directionally through a single antenna to all its user equipment.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a block diagram of an exemplary communication system which may accommodate various aspect of the present disclosure. The MIMO communication system <b>200</b> that is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> comprises a transmitter system <b>210</b> (e.g., a base station or access point) and a receiver system <b>250</b> (e.g., an access terminal or user equipment) in a MIMO communication system <b>200</b>. It will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill that even though the base station is referred to as a transmitter system <b>210</b> and a user equipment is referred to as a receiver system <b>250</b>, as illustrated, embodiments of these systems are capable of bi-directional communications. In that regard, the terms &#x201c;transmitter system <b>210</b>&#x201d; and &#x201c;receiver system <b>250</b>&#x201d; should not be used to imply single directional communications from either system. It should also be noted the transmitter system <b>210</b> and the receiver system <b>250</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are each capable of communicating with a plurality of other receiver and transmitter systems that are not explicitly depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. At the transmitter system <b>210</b>, traffic data for a number of data streams is provided from a data source <b>212</b> to a transmit (TX) data processor <b>214</b>. Each data stream may be transmitted over a respective transmitter system. The TX data processor <b>214</b> formats, codes and interleaves the traffic data for each data stream, based on a particular coding scheme selected for that data stream, to provide the coded data.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The coded data for each data stream may be multiplexed with pilot data using, for example, OFDM techniques. The pilot data is typically a known data pattern that is processed in a known manner and may be used at the receiver system to estimate the channel response. The multiplexed pilot and coded data for each data stream is then modulated (symbol mapped) based on a particular modulation scheme (e.g., BPSK, QSPK, M-PSK or M-QAM) selected for that data stream to provide modulation symbols. The data rate, coding and modulation for each data stream may be determined by instructions performed by a processor <b>230</b> of the transmitter system <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the exemplary block diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the modulation symbols for all data streams may be provided to a TX MIMO processor <b>220</b>, which can further process the modulation symbols (e.g., for OFDM). The TX MIMO processor <b>220</b> then provides N<sub>T </sub>modulation symbol streams to N<sub>T </sub>transmitter system transceivers (TMTR) <b>222</b><i>a </i>through <b>222</b><i>t</i>. In one embodiment, the TX MIMO processor <b>220</b> may further apply beamforming weights to the symbols of the data streams and to the antenna from which the symbol is being transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each transmitter system transceiver <b>222</b><i>a </i>through <b>222</b><i>t </i>receives and processes a respective symbol stream to provide one or more analog signals, and further condition the analog signals to provide a modulated signal suitable for transmission over the MIMO channel. In some embodiments, the conditioning may include, but is not limited to, operations such as amplification, filtering, up-conversion and the like. The modulated signals produced by the transmitter system transceivers <b>222</b><i>a </i>through <b>222</b><i>t </i>are then transmitted from the transmitter system antennas <b>224</b><i>a </i>through <b>224</b><i>t </i>that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">At the receiver system <b>250</b>, the transmitted modulated signals may be received by the receiver system antennas <b>252</b><i>a </i>through <b>252</b><i>r</i>, and the received signal from each of the receiver system antennas <b>252</b><i>a </i>through <b>252</b><i>r </i>is provided to a respective receiver system transceiver (RCVR) <b>254</b><i>a </i>through <b>254</b><i>r</i>. Each receiver system transceiver <b>254</b><i>a </i>through <b>254</b><i>r </i>conditions a respective received signal, digitizes the conditioned signal to provide samples and may further processes the samples to provide a corresponding &#x201c;received&#x201d; symbol stream. In some embodiments, the conditioning may include, but is not limited to, operations such as amplification, filtering, down-conversion and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">An RX data processor <b>260</b> then receives and processes the symbol streams from the receiver system transceivers <b>254</b><i>a </i>through <b>254</b><i>r </i>based on a particular receiver processing technique to provide a plurality of &#x201c;detected&#x201d; symbol streams. In one example, each detected symbol stream can include symbols that are estimates of the symbols transmitted for the corresponding data stream. The RX data processor <b>260</b> then, at least in part, demodulates, de-interleaves and decodes each detected symbol stream to recover the traffic data for the corresponding data stream. The processing by the RX data processor <b>260</b> may be complementary to that performed by the TX MIMO processor <b>220</b> and the TX data processor <b>214</b> at the transmitter system <b>210</b>. The RX data processor <b>260</b> can additionally provide processed symbol streams to a data sink <b>264</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some embodiments, a channel response estimate is generated by the RX data processor <b>260</b> and can be used to perform space/time processing at the receiver system <b>250</b>, adjust power levels, change modulation rates or schemes, and/or other appropriate actions. Additionally, the RX data processor <b>260</b> can further estimate channel characteristics such as signal-to-noise (SNR) and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the detected symbol streams. The RX data processor <b>260</b> can then provide estimated channel characteristics to a processor <b>270</b>. In one example, the RX data processor <b>260</b> and/or the processor <b>270</b> of the receiver system <b>250</b> can further derive an estimate of the &#x201c;operating&#x201d; SNR for the system. The processor <b>270</b> of the receiver system <b>250</b> can also provide channel state information (CSI), which may include information regarding the communication link and/or the received data stream. This information, which may contain, for example, the operating SNR and other channel information, may be used by the transmitter system <b>210</b> (e.g., base station or eNodeB) to make proper decisions regarding, for example, the user equipment scheduling, MIMO settings, modulation and coding choices and the like. At the receiver system <b>250</b>, the CSI that is produced by the processor <b>270</b> is processed by a TX data processor <b>238</b>, modulated by a modulator <b>280</b>, conditioned by the receiver system transceivers <b>254</b><i>a </i>through <b>254</b><i>r </i>and transmitted back to the transmitter system <b>210</b>. In addition, a data source <b>236</b> at the receiver system <b>250</b> can provide additional data to be processed by the TX data processor <b>238</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the processor <b>270</b> at the receiver system <b>250</b> may also periodically determine which pre-coding matrix to use. The processor <b>270</b> formulates a reverse link message comprising a matrix index portion and a rank value portion. The reverse link message may comprise various types of information regarding the communication link and/or the received data stream. The reverse link message is then processed by the TX data processor <b>238</b> at the receiver system <b>250</b>, which may also receive traffic data for a number of data streams from the data source <b>236</b>. The processed information is then modulated by a modulator <b>280</b>, conditioned by one or more of the receiver system transceivers <b>254</b><i>a </i>through <b>254</b><i>r</i>, and transmitted back to the transmitter system <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In some embodiments of the MIMO communication system <b>200</b>, the receiver system <b>250</b> is capable of receiving and processing spatially multiplexed signals. In these systems, spatial multiplexing occurs at the transmitter system <b>210</b> by multiplexing and transmitting different data streams on the transmitter system antennas <b>224</b><i>a </i>through <b>224</b><i>t</i>. This is in contrast to the use of transmit diversity schemes, where the same data stream is sent from multiple transmitter systems antennas <b>224</b><i>a </i>through <b>224</b><i>t</i>. In a MIMO communication system <b>200</b> capable of receiving and processing spatially multiplexed signals, a precode matrix is typically used at the transmitter system <b>210</b> to ensure the signals transmitted from each of the transmitter system antennas <b>224</b><i>a </i>through <b>224</b><i>t </i>are sufficiently decorrelated from each other. This decorrelation ensures that the composite signal arriving at any particular receiver system antenna <b>252</b><i>a </i>through <b>252</b><i>r </i>can be received and the individual data streams can be determined in the presence of signals carrying other data streams from other transmitter system antennas <b>224</b><i>a </i>through <b>224</b><i>t. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Since the amount of cross-correlation between streams can be influenced by the environment, it is advantageous for the receiver system <b>250</b> to feed back information to the transmitter system <b>210</b> about the received signals. In these systems, both the transmitter system <b>210</b> and the receiver system <b>250</b> contain a codebook with a number of precoding matrices. Each of these precoding matrices can, in some instances, be related to an amount of cross-correlation experienced in the received signal. Since it is advantageous to send the index of a particular matrix rather than the values in the matrix, the feedback control signal sent from the receiver system <b>250</b> to the transmitter system <b>210</b> typically contains the index of a particular precoding matrix. In some instances the feedback control signal also includes a rank index which indicates to the transmitter system <b>210</b> how many independent data streams to use in spatial multiplexing.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Other embodiments of MIMO communication system <b>200</b> are configured to utilize transmit diversity schemes instead of the spatially multiplexed scheme described above. In these embodiments, the same data stream is transmitted across the transmitter system antennas <b>224</b><i>a </i>through <b>224</b><i>t</i>. In these embodiments, the data rate delivered to receiver system <b>250</b> is typically lower than spatially multiplexed MIMO communication systems <b>200</b>. These embodiments provide robustness and reliability of the communication channel. In transmit diversity systems each of the signals transmitted from the transmitter system antennas <b>224</b><i>a </i>through <b>224</b><i>t </i>will experience a different interference environment (e.g., fading, reflection, multi-path phase shifts). In these embodiments, the different signal characteristics received at the receiver system antennas <b>252</b><i>a </i>through <b>254</b><i>r </i>are useful in determining the appropriate data stream. In these embodiments, the rank indicator is typically set to 1, telling the transmitter system <b>210</b> not to use spatial multiplexing.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Other embodiments may utilize a combination of spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity. For example in a MIMO communication system <b>200</b> utilizing four transmitter system antennas <b>224</b><i>a </i>through <b>224</b><i>t</i>, a first data stream may be transmitted on two of the transmitter system antennas <b>224</b><i>a </i>through <b>224</b><i>t </i>and a second data stream transmitted on remaining two transmitter system antennas <b>224</b><i>a </i>through <b>224</b><i>t</i>. In these embodiments, the rank index is set to an integer lower than the full rank of the precode matrix, indicating to the transmitter system <b>210</b> to employ a combination of spatial multiplexing and transmit diversity.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">At the transmitter system <b>210</b>, the modulated signals from the receiver system <b>250</b> are received by the transmitter system antennas <b>224</b><i>a </i>through <b>224</b><i>t</i>, are conditioned by the transmitter system transceivers <b>222</b><i>a </i>through <b>222</b><i>t</i>, are demodulated by a transmitter system demodulator <b>240</b>, and are processed by the RX data processor <b>242</b> to extract the reserve link message transmitted by the receiver system <b>250</b>. In some embodiments, the processor <b>230</b> of the transmitter system <b>210</b> then determines which pre-coding matrix to use for future forward link transmissions, and then processes the extracted message. In other embodiments, the processor <b>230</b> uses the received signal to adjust the beamforming weights for future forward link transmissions.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In other embodiments, a reported CSI can be provided to the processor <b>230</b> of the transmitter system <b>210</b> and used to determine, for example, data rates as well as coding and modulation schemes to be used for one or more data streams. The determined coding and modulation schemes can then be provided to one or more transmitter system transceivers <b>222</b><i>a </i>through <b>222</b><i>t </i>at the transmitter system <b>210</b> for quantization and/or use in later transmissions to the receiver system <b>250</b>. Additionally and/or alternatively, the reported CSI can be used by the processor <b>230</b> of the transmitter system <b>210</b> to generate various controls for the TX data processor <b>214</b> and the TX MIMO processor <b>220</b>. In one example, the CSI and/or other information processed by the RX data processor <b>242</b> of the transmitter system <b>210</b> can be provided to a data sink <b>244</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In some embodiments, the processor <b>230</b> at the transmitter system <b>210</b> and the processor <b>270</b> at the receiver system <b>250</b> may direct operations at their respective systems. Additionally, a memory <b>232</b> at the transmitter system <b>210</b> and a memory <b>272</b> at the receiver system <b>250</b> can provide storage for program codes and data used by the transmitter system processor <b>230</b> and the receiver system processor <b>270</b>, respectively. Further, at the receiver system <b>250</b>, various processing techniques can be used to process the N<sub>R </sub>received signals to detect the N<sub>T </sub>transmitted symbol streams. These receiver processing techniques can include spatial and space-time receiver processing techniques, which can include equalization techniques, &#x201c;successive nulling/equalization and interference cancellation&#x201d; receiver processing techniques, and/or &#x201c;successive interference cancellation&#x201d; or &#x201c;successive cancellation&#x201d; receiver processing techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A radio protocol architecture may take on various forms depending on the particular application. An exemplary radio protocol architecture for an LTE system is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the radio protocol architecture for the UE and eNodeB is shown as having three layers: Layer 1, Layer 2, and Layer 3. Layer 1 (L1) <b>302</b> is the lowest layer and implements various physical layer signal processing functions. Layer 1 will be referred to herein as the physical layer <b>302</b>. Layer 2 (L2) <b>304</b> is above the physical layer <b>302</b> and is responsible for the link between the UE and eNodeB over the physical layer <b>302</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the user plane, the L2 layer <b>304</b> includes a media access control (MAC) sublayer <b>310</b>, a radio link control (RLC) sublayer <b>312</b>, and a packet data convergence protocol (PDCP) sublayer <b>314</b>, which are terminated at the eNodeB on the network side. Although not shown, the UE may have several sublayers above the L2 layer <b>304</b> including a network layer (e.g., an IP layer) and an application layer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The PDCP sublayer <b>314</b> provides multiplexing between different radio bearers and logical channels. The PDCP sublayer <b>314</b> also provides header compression for upper layer data packets to reduce radio transmission overhead, security by ciphering the data packets, and handover support for UEs between eNodeBs. The RLC sublayer <b>312</b> provides segmentation and reassembly of upper layer data packets, retransmission of lost data packets, and reordering of data packets to compensate for out-of-order reception due to hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ). The MAC sublayer <b>310</b> provides multiplexing between logical and transport channels. The MAC sublayer <b>310</b> is also responsible for allocating the various radio resources (e.g., resource blocks) in one cell among the UEs. The MAC sublayer <b>310</b> is also responsible for HARQ operations.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the control plane, the radio protocol architecture for the UE and eNodeB is substantially the same for the physical layer <b>308</b> and the L2 layer <b>304</b> with the exception that there is no header compression function for the control plane. The control plane also includes a radio resource control (RRC) sublayer <b>316</b> in Layer 3 (L3) <b>306</b>. The RRC sublayer <b>316</b> is responsible for obtaining radio resources (i.e., radio bearers) and for configuring the lower layers using RRC signaling between the eNodeB and the UE.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Various frame structures may be used to support the DL and UL transmissions. An exemplary DL frame structure used in LTE Rel-8 is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that the frame structure for any particular application may be different depending on any number of factors, including the applicable wireless standard and allowed variations therein. In this example, a 10 ms frame is divided into 10 equally sized sub-frames, and each sub-frame includes two consecutive time slots.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">A resource grid illustrates the two time slots, where each time slot comprises a number of resource block (RBs), sometimes referred to as physical resource blocks (PRBs). The number of resource blocks in a sub-frame depends on the system bandwidth, and can vary between 6 (as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and 110 for LTE Rel-8. Wider bandwidths are proposed for LTE-A. As shown, a transport block can be mapped to RBs in the exemplary DL frame structure.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The resource grid is further divided into multiple resource elements (REs). In LTE, a resource block contains 12 consecutive subcarriers in the frequency domain and, for a normal cyclic prefix in each OFDM symbol, 7 consecutive OFDM symbols in the time domain, for a total of 84 resource elements. When an extended cyclic prefix is used (e.g., based on channel conditions), the number of OFDM symbols per resource block is reduced to 6 and the number of resource elements per resource block is reduced to 72. The number of bits carried by each resource element depends on the modulation scheme (e.g., 2 bits for QPSK, 4 bits for 16-QAM and 6 bits for 64-QAM).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For purposes of the following discussion, an exemplary time/frequency resource allocation <b>500</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The exemplary resource allocation <b>500</b> is provided for convenience and ease of discussion alone, and embodiments disclosed and claimed herein are not so limited. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a sub-frame includes 14 OFDM symbols numbered 1 to 14 spanning the full system bandwidth. In this arrangement, one transport block can be transmitted in one transmission time interval corresponding to one sub-frame.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The initial OFDM symbols comprise the physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) that carries downlink control information (DCI). The UE decodes the DCI to determine which RBs in the data portion (physical downlink shared channel, PDSCH) are allocated to the UE, either on a dedicated basis or in common with other UEs. In addition to the DCI, the PDCCH includes a physical control format indicator channel (PCFICH) in the first OFDM symbol, extending over the full system bandwidth. A coded control format indicator (CFI) in the PCFICH indicates the number of OFDM symbols used for the PDCCH, so that the UE knows when the control channel ends and the data channel begins. For LTE Rel-8, the number of OFDM symbols used for the transmission of the PDCCH is 1, 2, or 3 if the system bandwidth is greater than 10 resource blocks, and 2, 3, or 4 if the system bandwidth is between 6 and 10 resource blocks. However, embodiments contemplated herein are not so limited. The PDCCH also includes the physical hybrid automatic repeat request indicator channel (PHICH), and demodulation reference signals (DM-RS). The rest of the allocation comprises the physical downlink shared data channel (PDSCH).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In LTE-Advanced (LTE-A), a UE may be capable of receiving multiple carriers with cross-carrier resource allocations. For example, a UE may be configured to receive carrier A and carrier B. If the PCFICH for carrier A is unreliable (e.g., due to high levels of interference or fading), it may be desirable to transmit control information for both carrier A and carrier B on carrier B.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In one aspect of the present disclosure, the CFI for carrier A is included in the data channel (PDSCH) of carrier B, which can be conveyed by layer 3 RRC signaling. In another aspect, the CFI for carrier A is conveyed through the conventional PCFICH on carrier A (for UEs that can correctly decode the CFI from the PCFICH on carrier A) and also on carrier B with RRC signaling in the data channel of carrier B (for UEs that cannot decode the CFI from the PCFICH on carrier A).</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Changes in the CFI are asynchronous and can occur from sub-frame to sub-frame. When the CFI is transmitted in the conventional manner, using the PCFICH on the carrier that is being scheduled, the UE decodes the symbols of a sub-frame in the order they are received, starting at the first OFDM symbol (symbol <b>1</b>) in slot <b>0</b> of the sub-frame, through to the end of the sub-frame. After the first OFDM symbol is decoded, the UE knows how many OFDM symbols are used for the PDCCH and where the PDSCH begins. That is, if the PDCCH occupies 1 OFDM symbol (symbol <b>1</b>), then the PDSCH begins at OFDM symbol <b>2</b>. If the PDCCH occupies 2 OFDM symbols (symbols <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>), the PDSCH begins at OFDM symbol <b>3</b>. If the PDCCH occupies 3 OFDM symbols (symbols <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b>), the PDSCH begins at OFDM symbol <b>4</b>. If the system bandwidth is less than 10 RBs wide, then the size of the PDCCH can be 2, 3 or 4 OFDM symbols with the PDSCH beginning at symbol <b>3</b>, <b>4</b> or <b>5</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In one embodiment of a multi-carrier system, an eNodeB may transmit a PCFICH for a carrier A in a conventional manner in the first OFDM symbol of a transport block of carrier A. If the UE receives and correctly decodes the PCFICH for carrier A on carrier A, then processing of the carrier A transport block can continue normally. However, if the UE cannot decode the PCFICH on carrier A, it may be configured to decode a CFI for carrier A from the data channel of a transport block of carrier B, where the CFI in the data channel may be signaled by the RRC layer of the eNodeB.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">However, in this scenario, the UE and the eNodeB may be out of synchronization if the CFI signaled in the data channel of carrier B represents a change in the current size of the control channel for carrier A (either an increase or a decrease). The eNodeB could stop transmitting to the UE on carrier A until it received an acknowledgement from the UE that the new CFI value had been decoded. At that point, the eNodeB could continue transmitting to the UE using carrier A with a synchronized control channel size where the UE knows where the control channel ends and the data channel begins in the transport blocks of carrier A. Otherwise, the UE might decode data as control information, corrupting the control information, or decode control information as data, corrupting the data. However, halting transmission on carrier A while waiting for the acknowledgement from the UE may not be desirable as it would reduce throughput.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In one aspect of the present disclosure, to maximize throughput, the UE and the eNodeB may implement a set of rules that allow continuous transmission and reception with only a minor degradation. Assume, for example, that the UE has been previously configured by the eNodeB to expect a control channel size of N OFDM symbols and the eNodeB and the UE are synchronized. Now assume that the eNodeB signals a new control channel size N&#x2032; (N prime) for carrier A in the data channel of carrier B. Rather than wait to receive an acknowledgement from the UE, the present disclosure allows the eNodeB to continue transmitting with certain restrictions.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">For the following discussion, for clarity, a LTE Rel-8 sub-frame structure using a short cyclic prefix is assumed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). In this structure, there are 14 OFDM symbols numbered 1-14, such that the cardinal numbering (1-14) matches the ordinal numbering (1<sup>st</sup>-14<sup>th</sup>)</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Assume that the UE and the eNodeB are synchronized at N=2 (i.e., OFDM symbols <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> comprise the control channel and OFDM symbols <b>3</b>-<b>14</b> comprise the data channel). If N&#x2032;=3 (i.e., N&#x2032;&#x3e;N), the eNodeB signals the new value on carrier B but continues to transmit transport blocks on carrier A with a control channel consisting of 2 OFDM symbols (symbols <b>1</b> &#x26; <b>2</b>). The eNodeB transmits data on OFDM symbols <b>4</b>-<b>14</b>, leaving OFDM symbol <b>3</b> unpopulated, until it receives an acknowledgement from the UE that the UE has decoded the new CFI value (N&#x2032;) and knows the correct size of the control channel and the data channel on carrier A. At that point, the eNodeB can begin to populate OFDM symbol <b>3</b> with control information, knowing that it will be interpreted correctly by the UE</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In this scenario, where the UE and eNodeB are initially synchronized at N=2 and the eNodeB signals a change from N=2 to N&#x2032;=3 (N&#x2032;&#x3e;N), the UE behaves as follows. When the UE decodes the new CFI value from the data channel of carrier B, it sends an acknowledgement to the eNodeB and begins to decode subsequent carrier A transport blocks using a non-sequential order. Assume, for this discussion, a system bandwidth for which the maximum size of the control channel on carrier A is Nmax=3. When the CFI value increases (from 2 to 3), the UE begins to decode the transport block starting from the (Nmax+1)th OFDM symbol (OFDM symbol <b>4</b> in this example) all the way to the last OFDM symbol in the transport block (symbol <b>14</b>). The UE then returns to the (Nmax)th symbol (symbol <b>3</b>) and decodes symbols <b>3</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>1</b> in that order (the transport blocks may be stored in a buffer where they can be decoded in any order). This order for decoding guarantees that the initial symbols to be decoded are actually data symbols (and demodulation reference signals), rather than noise, and results in better decoding</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The UE next attempts to decode symbols <b>1</b>, <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> as control channel symbols. However, because symbol <b>3</b> is initially unpopulated by the eNodeB (until it receives the ACK from the UE), symbol <b>3</b> will decode as noise and the signal-to-noise ratio of the control channel will be somewhat degraded&#x2014;but the control channel will not be corrupted. Using the new CFI value (N&#x2032;), the UE will interpret symbols <b>4</b>-<b>14</b> as data. As described above, the data transmitted by the eNodeB will be confined to symbols <b>4</b>-<b>14</b>, so the data will be correctly decoded.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The operation is different if N&#x2032;&#x3c;N. Assume, for example, that the UE and the eNodeB are synchronized at N=2 (i.e., OFDM symbols <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> comprise the control channel and OFDM symbols <b>3</b>-<b>14</b> comprise the data channel, as above). If N&#x2032;=1 (i.e., N&#x2032;&#x3c;N), the eNodeB signals the new value on carrier B and transmits transport blocks on carrier A in an allocation for which the control channel consists of 1 OFDM symbol (symbol <b>1</b>). The eNodeB may transmit data on OFDM symbols <b>3</b>-<b>14</b> (leaving OFDM symbol <b>2</b> unpopulated) until it receives an acknowledgement from the UE that the UE has decoded the new CFI value (N&#x2032;) and knows the correct size of the control channel and the data channel on carrier A. At that point, the eNodeB can populate OFDM symbol <b>2</b> with data, knowing that it will be interpreted correctly by the UE.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this scenario, where the UE and eNodeB are initially synchronized at N=2 and the eNodeB signals a change from N=2 to N&#x2032;=1 (N&#x2032;&#x3c;N), the UE behaves as follows. When the UE decodes the new CFI value from the data channel of carrier B, it sends an acknowledgement to the eNodeB and begins to decode subsequent carrier A transport blocks using a non-sequential order, as described above. Assume again that the maximum size of the control channel on carrier A is Nmax=3. When the CFI value decreases (from 2 to 1), the UE begins to decode the transport block starting from the (Nmax+1)th OFDM symbol (OFDM symbol <b>4</b> in this example, as described above) all the way to the last OFDM symbol in the transport block (symbol <b>14</b>). The UE then returns to the (Nmax)th symbol (symbol <b>3</b>) and decodes symbols in the reverse order 3, 2 and 1 (as before, the transport blocks can be stored in a buffer and can be read in any order).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The UE will attempt to decode symbol <b>1</b> as control information and symbols <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> as data symbols. As described above, the control channel will be confined to symbol <b>1</b> by the eNodeB when it signals the change in CFI, so the UE will correctly interpret symbol <b>1</b> as control information. Using the new CFI value (N&#x2032;=1), the UE will attempt to decode symbols <b>2</b>-<b>14</b> as data. However, because symbols <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> are initially unpopulated by the eNodeB (until it receives the ACK from the UE), symbols <b>2</b> and <b>3</b> will decode as noise and the signal-to-noise ratio of the data channel will be somewhat degraded&#x2014;but the data channel will not be corrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">An alternative to the RRC signaling described above is to puncture the PDSCH data on carrier B at a predetermined OFDM symbol and to replace the punctured data with the CFI for carrier A. For example, the CFI may be punctured on a predetermined resource element (e.g., the 4<sup>th </sup>OFDM symbol in a transport block).</p>
