<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an electrostatic discharge protector, and more particularly, it relates to an electrostatic discharge protector capable of protecting electronic circuit boards having various designs against electrostatic discharge freely, simply and easily.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Electrostatic discharge (ESD) is one of destructive and unavoidable phenomena that electric systems and integrated circuits are attacked. From the electric view, ESD is a transitional high current phenomenon such that a peak current of several amperes continues for a period of time from 10 n sec to 300 n sec. Therefore, when ESD is generated, an integrated circuit is damaged so that it is hardly repaired, or its volume breaks down or deteriorates so that it does not work normally unless a current of several amperes is conducted outside the integrated circuit within several nano sec. Furthermore, the lightening, thinning and downsizing for electronic parts or electronic apparatuses advance rapidly in recent years. With the rapid progress, the degree of integration in semiconductors and the density of electronic parts mounted on printed wiring boards are increased remarkably with the result that integration is minute, or electronic elements or signal conductors mounted are present very closely each other. Under these circumstances, high frequency radiation noise is easily caused together with the accelerating of the signal-processing rate.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Conventionally, as an element for protecting from static electricity, which protects IC etc. in circuits from ESD, JP-A-2005-353845 discloses an element having a bulk structure, which comprises a sintered matter of a metal oxide etc. This element is a laminated chip varistor made from the sintered matter and is equipped with a laminate and one pair of external electrodes. The varistor has a property such that when the applied voltage reaches a certain value, the current, which has not been flown until now, begins to flow suddenly, and also has excellent blocking force to electrostatic discharge. However, in the production of the laminated chip varistor, which is a sintered matter, a complicated production process including sheet molding, internal electrode printing, sheet lamination, etc. is inevitable and the production also has a problem that delamination and other wrong conditions are easily caused during mounting.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">JP-A-2007-266479 discloses a protective element that on an insulating substrate, a discharge gap of 10 &#x3bc;m to 50 &#x3bc;m is formed and between one pair of electrode patterns which ends are faced each other, a functional film, which comprises ZnO as a main component and silicon carbide, is formed. As compared with the laminated chip varistor, the protective element has a merit that it can be produced on a substrate as a thick film element having a simple composition.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For these ESD protective elements, the reduction of the mounted area has been undertaken according to the progress of electronic apparatuses. However, since an element is mounted on a wiring substrate by soldering, the degree of the freedom in the design is low and it has limitations of the size including height. On this account, the provision for ESD does not limit to elements, and further, it is desired that the provision for ESD be practiced on a necessary part and a necessary area.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">WO/2001/523040 is a document that a resin composition is disclosed as an ESD protective material. This resin composition comprises a base material made from a mixture of an insulating binder, conductive particles having an average particle diameter of less than 10 micron and semiconductor particles having an average particle diameter of less than 100 micron. Furthermore, WO/2001/523040 also discloses the US patent invented by Hyatt et al and discloses a composition material that a mixture of conductive particles which surfaces are covered with an insulating oxide film, and semiconductor particles is combined by an insulating binder, a composition material which particle diameter range is determined, and a composition material that the surface gaps among conductive particles are determined. The methods described in the publications have technically unstable problems such that a high electric resistance value is not obtained at a low voltage or a low electric resistance value is not obtained at a high voltage, because the method of dispersing the conductive particles and the semiconductor particles is not optimized.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Moreover, the process for producing the electrostatic discharge protector has the following difficult problems. For example, the electrostatic discharge protector is required to have a high insulating resistance property at a normal operating voltage (usually the voltage shows less than 10 V). When an insulating member is not disposed between electrodes, aerial discharge is caused by application of a high voltage, and the electrodes are short-circuited by carbonization of a substrate provided with the electrodes. Therefore, it is necessary to dispose any member having voltage resistance between the electrodes. When the conductive member is only disposed but the insulating member is not disposed, the insulating resistance is not maintained. Therefore, it is essential that the insulating member is disposed in the gap between one pair of the electrodes. In the trial, when the insulating member is disposed so as to be bridged between the electrodes, it is possible to add high insulating resistance at a normal operating voltage and low electric resistance at the time of electrostatic discharge by optimizing the distance between the electrodes to the providing insulating member.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">For example, when the filler-free resin is used for the insulating member, the property as the electrostatic discharge protector is confirmed by determining the distance between the electrodes to 5 to 7 &#x3bc;m. However, when the electrostatic discharge protector comprises only one pair of the electrodes and the insulating member, it is difficult to produce it industrially because the proper distance of the electrodes is changed by a fine difference on quality in the insulating member and the permissible range of the distance between the electrodes is very small.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0037">The electrostatic discharge protector according to the present invention will be described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0038">The electrostatic discharge protector according to the present invention is characterized in that it comprises at least three conductive members containing a pair of electrodes and conductive members other than the electrodes, each conductive member is disposed having a gap width of 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m with at least one of other conductive members, an insulating member is disposed and embedded in at least one of gaps having a width of 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m which are adjacent to each conductive member, and one of the electrodes is connected to the other electrode paired with the one electrode through the insulating member and the conductive members other than the electrodes.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0039">In the electrostatic discharge protector of the present invention, when the plural conductive members are contacted each other, they are regarded as one conductive member. For example, when electrodes and conductive members other than the electrodes are contacted, they are regarded as one conductive member and one electrode.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Structure of Electrostatic Discharge Protector</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0040">The electrostatic discharge protector according to the present invention comprises at least three conductive members and at least two of the conductive members are one pair of electrodes. Namely, the electrostatic discharge protector of the present invention comprises one pair of electrodes and at least one conductive member as essential components, and optionally comprises other pairs of electrodes and other conductive members other than the other pairs of electrodes. Therefore, the conductive member may comprise a pair of two electrodes and one or two or more conductive members other than the electrodes, or may comprise two pairs of four electrodes and one or two or more conductive members other than the electrodes. When the conductive member comprises three or more pairs of electrodes, the following manner is also adapted.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0041">These conductive members are each disposed with a gap having a width of 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m between the one and at least one of other conductive members. Namely, any one of the above-described conductive members is necessarily disposed with a gap having a width of 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m between the one and any other conductive member. That is to say, each of the conductive members is not disposed with a gap having a width of over 10 &#x3bc;m between one and any other conductive member.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0042">Herein, the width of the gap between the conductive members means the shortest distance between the conductive members.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0043">In the gap having a width of 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m between one conductive member and other conductive member, the insulating member is disposed and embedded, and the one conductive member and the other conductive member are joined through the insulating member. Namely, the insulating member is disposed so as to be sandwiched with the one conductive member and the other conductive member. When there is a plurality of other conductive members with a gap having a width of 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m, an insulating member may be disposed in at least one of the gaps. That is to say, each of the conductive members is always in contact with the insulating member and the insulating member is always in contact with the other conductive member in a part different from the part that is in contact with the conductive member.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0044">Furthermore, three or more conductive members may be in contact with each other through one or two or more insulating members. For example, when the width of the gap between a conductive member A and a conductive member B is 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m and the width of the gap between the conductive member B and a conductive member C is 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m, an insulating member AB is disposed between the conductive member A and the conductive member B and an insulating member BC is disposed between the conductive member B and the conductive member C. In this case, these members are connected in the order of the conductive member A, the insulating member AB, the conductive member B, the insulating member BC and the conductive member C. The case of four or more conductive members can be considered in a similar manner as above.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0045">The width of the gap between one conductive member and other conductive member that is present most closely with the one conductive member is 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m, so that the thickness of the insulating member sandwiched with the one conductive member and the other conductive member is 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0046">In the electrostatic discharge protector of the present invention, the members are each connected as described above, and one of the electrodes is connected to the other electrode paired with the one electrode through the insulating member and the conductive member other than electrodes. For example, in the case of comprising one pair of two electrodes and one conductive member other than the electrodes as a conductive member, the one electrode, the insulating member and the conductive member other than the electrodes, the insulating member and the other electrode are connected in this order. In the case of comprising one pair of two electrodes and two or more conductive members other than the electrodes as a conductive member, the members can be connected in the same manner as above. Furthermore, in the case of comprising two or more pairs of electrodes, each pair of electrodes can be connected in the same manner as above.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0047">Incidentally, when there are two or more gaps among the conductive members and the insulating material is disposed on each of the gaps, it is possible to dispose the insulating material on each gap, or it is possible to dispose a part of the insulating member on one gap and dispose the other part of the insulating member on the other gap.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0048">As an example of the electrostatic discharge protector of the present invention, there is, for example, an electrostatic discharge protector, which comprises one pair of electrodes, a conductive member disposed so as to have a gap having a width of 0.1 to 10 &#x3bc;m with each of the electrodes, and an insulating member disposed between the gaps so as to connect each of the electrodes and the conductive member.</p>

<p id="p-0052" num="0053">The electrostatic discharge protector of the present invention is used as a protective circuit for releasing overcurrent to earth ground in order to protect a device at the time of electrostatic discharging. The electrostatic discharge protector of the present invention generally shows a high electric resistance value at the time of normal operating at a low voltage and feeds a current to the device without releasing the current to earth ground. Meanwhile, when transient phenomenon is caused at the time of electrostatic discharging, the electrostatic discharge protector shows a low electric resistance value instantly and releases overcurrent to earth ground and thereby prevents the device from feeding of overcurrent. When transient phenomenon is dissolved, the electrostatic discharge protector returns to have a high electric resistance value and feeds a current to the device. Since the electrostatic discharge protector of the present invention has the above structure, it exhibits such a function and realizes electrostatic discharge protection against devices and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an embodiment of using the electrostatic discharge protector of the present invention. The electrostatic discharge protector <b>51</b> is disposed on a wiring <b>54</b>, which is branched from a wiring <b>53</b> leading to a device <b>52</b> and leads to earth ground. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, &#x201c;I&#x201d; shows a direction of electric current flow at the time of generating electrostatic discharge. &#x201c;II&#x201d; shows a direction of electric current flow at the time of normal operating.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0055">The ESD protective circuit namely the electrostatic discharge protector can attain the object of protecting electrostatic discharge even if the electric resistance value is less than 10<sup>8</sup>&#x3a9; by leading overcurrent caused by overvoltage at the time of generating ESD from a protective circuit to earth ground, but some electric current leaks all the time even in the voltage at the time of normal operating. It is unfavorable that the electric resistance value in a voltage at the time of normal operating is less than 10<sup>8</sup>&#x3a9;, because a leaked electric current is likely to affect the device as noise. According to the present invention, constituting the insulating layer disposed between the two wiring patterns which are electrodes, it is possible to attain the resistance value of not less than 10<sup>8</sup>&#x3a9; in the case of applying a voltage of not more than DC10V between the two electrode and thereby the electrostatic discharge protection can be realized surely.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Conductive Member</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0056">The electrode of the conductive members is a member, which passes a current from the one side to the other side. The shape and materials are not particularly limited as far as it can pass overcurrent at the time of generating electrostatic discharge, and the electrode may be disposed in normal electric wiring.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0057">The conductive members other than the electrode are members of receiving a current flown from the electrode of one conductive member and further passing it to the other conductive member. The shape and materials of the conductive member are also not particularly limited as far as it can pass overcurrent at the time of generating electrostatic discharge. For example, the conductive members other than the electrode can be formed by a metal foil such as aluminum foil etc. and conductive materials containing a conductive filler and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0058">The materials of the conductive members other than the electrodes may include mixed materials obtainable by dispersing a conductive filler such as Ag powder, Ni powder, carbon powder, etc. in a resin, and further may include materials mixed in a binder, which materials comprise a resin as a main component and are obtainable by dipping a metal powder in a solution which comprises a chelating agent capable of dissolving the oxide film of the metal powder and a solvent for securing conductivity, thereby removing the natural oxide film from the metal surface, and forming a complex of the same metal.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0059">As the resin contained in the above conductive members, a conductive resin is given. Examples of the conductive resin are a polyacetylene resin and a polypyrol resin doped with a specific compound, etc. With regard to the resin contained in the conductive members, the following materials, further, are favorably used in the viewpoint of reliability to stability with the elapse of time and the cost of the material. They are resin compositions obtainable by dispersing a conductive filler in a versatile resin. Examples of the resin used in the resin compositions are a natural resin, a modified resin and an oligomeric synthetic resin.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0060">A typical example of the natural resin is rosin. Examples of the modified resin are a rosin derivative, a rubber derivative, etc. Examples of the oligomer synthetic resin are an epoxy resin, an acrylic resin, a maleic acid derivative, a polyester resin, a melamine resin, a polyurethane resin, a polyimide resin, a polyamic acid resin and a polyimide/amide resin.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0061">The conductive members other than the electrodes have a foil, film, sheet or plate-like shape.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0062">When a voltage of DC 10V is applied, the conductive members other than the electrodes have an electric resistance of preferably not more than 10<sup>3</sup>&#x3a9;&#xb7;cm, further preferably not more than 10<sup>2</sup>&#x3a9;&#xb7;cm. When the electric resistance is more than 10<sup>3</sup>&#x3a9;&#xb7;cm or larger, they sometime do not show properties as an electrostatic discharge protector even by regulating the film thickness of the insulating member and furthermore they are hardly produced industrially.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0063">The conductive members other than the electrodes are preferably molded articles formed from a conductive resin composition, and the molded articles are preferably layered articles. The conductive members other than electrodes are preferably molded articles formed from the conductive resin composition, because an electrostatic discharge protector can be formed on a necessary part in a necessary area simply, easily and freely without carrying out complicated steps. The molded articles are preferably layered articles prepared by coating and hardening because the electrostatic discharge protector can be formed readily.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0064">When the molded article is a layered article, the thickness thereof is preferably not less than 1 &#x3bc;m and not more than 100 &#x3bc;m, more preferably not less than 10 &#x3bc;m and not more than 100 &#x3bc;m. When the thickness is less than 1 &#x3bc;m, the dispersion of the capability for ESD protection is larger. When the thickness is over 100 &#x3bc;m, the conductive member is easily delaminated by impact and the like in mounting.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0065">The conductive resin composition preferably contains conductive particles and/or conductive fibers. In the conductive member, it is necessary to pass overcurrent for a nanosecond at the time of generating electrostatic discharge. When the conductive resin composition contains the conductive particles and/or the conductive fibers, such overcurrent can be moved smoothly.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0066">The content of the conductive particles and/or the conductive fibers in the conductive resin composition is preferably 1 to 80% by volume, more preferably 50 to 75% by volume. In order to exhibit such a property that at the time of generating ESD, a short circuit is quickly caused, and at the time of canceling ESD, a short circuit is canceled and the insulating capability is reproduced, electric charge needs to be moved smoothly. In this viewpoint, the content is favorably 50 to 70% by volume. When the above content is less than 1% by volume, a low electric resistance property necessary for the conductive member is not obtained occasionally.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">When the content is over 80% by volume, the conductive member is easily delaminated by impact etc. in mounting.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">Examples of the conductive particle are carbon particles such as graphite, and carbon blacks including furnace black and ketchen black etc.; and metallic conductive particles such as nickel particles, aluminum particles, tungsten particles, niobium particles and tantalum particles. Of these, carbon particles are preferable and further graphite is particularly preferable. The conductive particles have an average particle diameter of 0.1 to 30 &#x3bc;m. The average particle diameter can be determined using a laser diffraction light scattering particle size distribution measuring apparatus Microtrac SPA (manufactured by Nikkiso Co., Ltd.).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">Examples of the conductive fibers are carbon fiber and zinc oxide whisker. The conductive particles have a fiber diameter of preferably 0.1 to 30 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">As the conductive fibers, carbon fibers are preferred. When the conductive member contains the carbon particles and the carbon fibers, a property such that switching can be more easily performed can be added by a function as a kind of condenser in lowering a high electric resistance value for a nanosecond at the time of generating ESD. Furthermore, since the graphite and carbon fiber in a resin composition state have low cohesive force, the resin composition hardly has a high viscosity even if these contents are increased. When the concentration of the conductive resin composition is lowered by adding a solvent in order to regulate the printability, the graphite and the carbon fiber are scarcely separated, and thereby the stability with the elapse of time is added.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">The conductive resin composition has a viscosity at 25&#xb0; C. of preferably 2 to 200,000 mPa&#xb7;s. In this viscosity rage, coating thereof can be carried out by any of potting, bar coating, screen printing and spin coating. When the viscosity is over 200,000 mPa&#xb7;s, it is difficult to carry out printing, while when it is less than 2 mPa&#xb7;s, it is difficult to prepare a uniform film thickness. The viscosity can be determined at 25&#xb0; C. by an E type viscometer at a rotor revolution of 1 rpm.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0072">As the solvent used for viscosity regulation, a solvent having a glycol skeleton is given because of having excellent solubility to the resin, light odor and easy handling. Examples thereof are ethylene glycol dimethylether, ethylene glycol diethylether, carbitol acetate, propyleneglycol methylether acetate, dipropyleneglycol methylether acetate, ethyl carbitol acetate and butyl carbitol acetate.

<p id="p-0142" num="0152">The electrostatic discharge protector needs to have excellent basic properties as an electrostatic discharge protector, namely good resistance at the time of normal operating and good resistance at the time of ESD generation. Furthermore, the electrostatic discharge protector preferably has good repeating properties i.e. good high voltage resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0153">In Examples 1, 4 and 5, as a result, the basic properties of the electrostatic discharge protector, namely the resistance at the time of normal operating and the resistance at the time of ESD generation were good and the repeating properties i.e. the high voltage resistance were also good.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0154">In the electrostatic discharge protector obtained in Example 2, the basic properties were good but the repeating properties, i.e. high voltage resistance lowered. It is considered that this is caused by the fact the resin used in the insulating member has low voltage resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0155">In Example 3, the high voltage resistance was more improved by using silica particles for the resin composition of the insulating member as compared with that in Example 2.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0156">In Example 6, the basic properties of the electrostatic discharge protector were good. However, the repeating properties i.e. high voltage resistance lowered because a curable resin such as an epoxy resin etc. was not blended with the resin composition of the insulating member.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0157">In Example 7, the aluminum foil was used as the conductive member and the insulating member was made to have a thickness of 0.2 &#x3bc;m. As a result, the resistance at the time of ESD generation lowered and the high voltage resistance could be kept.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0158">In Comparative Example 1, the gap between the electrode and the conductive member was over 10 &#x3bc;m. As a result, the resistance at the time of ESD generation was excessively high.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0159">In Comparative Example 2, the insulating member was absent. As a result, the resistance at the time of normal operating was too low.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0160">In Comparative Example 3, the conductive member was absent. As a result, the resistance at the time of ESD generation was excessively high.</p>
