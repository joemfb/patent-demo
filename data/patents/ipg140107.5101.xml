<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/504,057, filed Jul. 16, 2009 (now U.S. Pat. No. 8,254,881) which is a divisional of U.S. application Ser. No. 11/874,660, filed Oct. 18, 2007 (now U.S. Pat. No. 7,580,699), which are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to network systems and methods and, more particularly, to network systems and methods for utilizing mobile devices to enhance customer experience.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many businesses offer membership programs. Some membership programs offer access to a store for the purchase of goods and services. This is common in membership warehouse stores. Other membership programs offer discounts on items for members. Yet other programs allow members to participate in incentive programs. Some membership programs are free while others require a one-time fee, a monthly fee, or a yearly fee.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Regardless of the type of membership program, a prospective member is often required to fill out a membership application prior to receiving an identification card with the member's membership information. The member can then pursue the benefits of the membership program.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Current membership programs rely on the identification cards as authentication of a customer's member status and to grant the customer access to the store, store discounts, and other membership benefits. This is undesirable to the customer due to the inconvenience having to carry the card. In the event the card is lost or stolen, there is little the customer can do to retrieve the card or at least prevent another person from gaining access to the membership benefits granted by the card. The store can issue another card but there is no tracking information associated with the member card as there is with a consumer credit card.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Many customers use written, typed, or mental lists as a reminder of items needed when going to a store. Electronic devices, such as PDAs and smart phones, now offer word processing programs that facilitate the creation of a shopping list. When the customer enters a store, it is the customer's responsibility to remember the list and find each item on the list. Stores are typically designed such that the items are logically arranged; however, it is impossible to arrange the items to satisfy each customer's needs.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Subtle changes, such as end cap changes, promotional rearrangements, and the like, can be confusing to the customer in trying to find an item that has been moved due to one of these changes. Currently, there are no systems that provide list and mapping functions on a mobile device in order to better serve the customer in finding each item.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">When a customer desires to purchase an item, the customer can use a check-out terminal operated by a store associate or a self check-out terminal for performing the check-out functions. The customer is often provided multiple payment options for purchasing the item including cash, credit card, debit card, check, gift certificate, gift card, traveler's checks, or government credits. These methods all require the customer to carry cash on hand, checks, or a number of cards for the varying payment methods.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The aforementioned art includes deficiencies that are overcome by the new systems and novel methods disclosed herein. The applicant desires to create a need and market for these new systems and novel methods that provide the following functions on a mobile device: membership program functions; list functions; item in-store mapping functions; item search functions; and remote charging functions using a mobile device or using a service provider account.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">One aspect of the present invention is a method for providing and accessing membership accounts via a mobile device.

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein. It must be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary examples of the invention that may be embodied in various and alternative forms, and combinations thereof. As used herein, the word &#x201c;exemplary&#x201d; is used expansively to refer to embodiments that serve as an illustration, specimen, model or pattern. The figures are not necessarily to scale and some features may be exaggerated or minimized to show details of particular components. In other instances, well-known components, systems, materials or methods have not been described in detail in order to avoid obscuring the present invention. Therefore, specific structural and functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to variously employ the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Referring now to the drawings wherein like numerals represent like elements throughout the several views, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating an exemplary communications network <b>100</b> in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The illustrated communications network <b>100</b> includes a mobile device <b>102</b> that is in communication with a service provider network <b>104</b> and a store network <b>106</b>. The mobile device <b>102</b> can be a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cellular telephone, a smart phone, a messaging device, a mobile game device, any combination thereof, and the like. The illustrated embodiment assumes that the mobile device <b>102</b> is capable of communication with a wireless service provider (e.g., service provider <b>104</b>) via a GSM (Global System for Mobile communications) and/or UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) link <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although applicable to any existing or yet to be developed wireless telecommunications network, aspects of the disclosed architecture can be implemented using GSM that uses general packet radio service (GPRS) as an enabling bearer. Examples of other suitable wireless and radio frequency data transmission systems include networks utilizing frequency division multiple access (FDMA), time division multiple access (TDMA), code division multiple access (CDMA), wideband CDMA (WCDMA), orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), and various other 2.5G, 3G (third generation) and further generation wireless communications systems. Examples of other suitable enabling bearers include UMTS, enhanced data rates for global evolution (EDGE), high speed downlink packet access (HSUPA), high speed uplink packet access (HSUPA), high speed OFDM packet access (HSOPA), evolution data optimized (EVDO), and similar communications protocols.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The service provider network <b>104</b> can provide various telecommunications services including but not limited to wireless voice service and data service (e.g., Internet access, email, and messaging). These services can be provided in prepaid or postpaid service plans. A prepaid plan allows a customer to pay for services prior to using them. After the customer has used the prepaid amount of voice minutes, data transfer (e.g., per kilobyte), or messages (e.g., text messages or multimedia messages), the customer is unable to use further services prior to replenishing the account. A postpaid plan, however, allows a customer to subscribe to a service plan at a fixed cost for a specified amount of voice minutes, data transfer, and/or messages, and is due at a specified interval (e.g., monthly). Should the customer exceed the specified amount of voice minutes, data transfer, and/or messages the customer is charged an overage fee for service levels exceeding those specified in the service plan. Postpaid customers are also typically provided add-on options for data, messages, or special services. As will be described herein, various aspects of the present invention can be tracked by a service provider and charged to a customer as a special service that may or may not entail additional cost. The service provider network <b>104</b> can include appropriate billing systems and supporting systems and subsystems (not shown) to enable proper tracking and billing for services rendered to customers.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The illustrated store network <b>106</b> includes a local area network (LAN) <b>108</b> that provides wireline network communications among various store network components and customer devices, such as a customer mobile device <b>102</b>. A wireless LAN (WLAN) <b>110</b> is also provided for IEEE 802.11x wireless communications among the store network components and/or the customer mobile device <b>102</b>. Although illustrated as separate elements, the LAN <b>108</b> will often be referred to as combining both the wireline LAN and wireless LAN components.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The LAN <b>108</b> provides access to a wide area network (WAN) <b>116</b> via a router <b>114</b>. The WAN <b>116</b> can be a corporate or private WAN. The WAN <b>116</b> is in communication with one or more vendor databases <b>118</b> and corporate databases <b>120</b>.

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The illustrated store network <b>106</b> also includes an accounting system <b>126</b>, a map database <b>128</b>, an inventory server <b>130</b>, a sales database <b>132</b>, a membership database <b>134</b>, and a policy database <b>136</b>. While other elements are possible and are in fact, contemplated, they are not illustrated in order to simplify the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The accounting system <b>126</b> provides accounting services for the store network <b>106</b>. Accounting services can include, for example, establishing periodic (e.g., daily, monthly, yearly) sales goals, managing store income and store expenses, managing payroll (if delegated at the store level), managing tills, and other accounting services.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The map database <b>128</b> can be configured to store and manage store maps. A store map can be updated for promotions, store layout changes, end cap changes, sales, and the like, and stored in the map database <b>128</b>. The map database <b>128</b> can store any number of maps. For example, multiple versions of a base store map can be generated and stored. The corporate database <b>120</b> can provide base maps, updated maps, and/or base map updates for a particular store based on the store location, current sales, promotions, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The inventory server <b>130</b> can be configured to store and manage inventory status for the store. As items are purchased, the inventory status is updated. Low stock items can be reordered as necessary. The inventory database can also provide real-time or near real-time inventory status for a plurality of items searchable via the mobile device <b>102</b>. An exemplary search process is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The sales database <b>132</b> can be configured to store and manage sale items, promotions, store coupons, and eligible manufacture coupons for the store. The sales database <b>132</b> can be updated periodically by the corporate database <b>120</b>, or manually by a store associate.</p>

Memberships can be store specific, franchise specific, chain specific, city specific, state specific, region specific, or customer specific, for example. Memberships can be provided free or for a cost specified by the store owner. The corporate database <b>120</b> can provide membership access specifications on a per customer basis. This information can be updated in the local membership database <b>134</b> for each applicable store.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The policy database <b>136</b> can be configured to store and manage membership policies for each customer. Policies can be global, group specific, store specific, franchise specific, chain specific, city specific, state specific, region specific, or customer specific, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">A sensor network <b>138</b> is illustrated. In one embodiment, the sensor network <b>138</b> is designed to be integrated into the store shelves and other item displays. When a customer removes an item from a shelf, a sensor is triggered to notify the inventory server <b>130</b> that an item has been removed. The inventory server <b>130</b> can maintain a status for items that have been removed from a shelf. This can provide associates with information regarding which items need to be restocked even prior to the items actually being sold. Further, items that are incorrectly placed on a shelf can be flagged and reported to the inventory server <b>130</b> and the item can be appropriately shelved. The inventory server <b>130</b> can also communicate with the membership database <b>134</b> to build a pre-checkout list corresponding to the items removed from the shelves by a particular customer. It is contemplated that the customer's mobile device <b>102</b> can be in communication with the server network <b>138</b> to establish that a particular item has been removed. When the customer desires to check-out, any pre-checkout list can be sent to the check-out terminal <b>124</b> and the items can be purchased.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The sensor network <b>138</b> can also include sensors configured in the shopping carts and shopping baskets in the store. These sensors can be stand-alone and any item movement can be recorded as entering and exiting the shopping cart/basket and updated in the inventory server and/or maintained in a pre-checkout list. These sensors can also be coupled with those installed in the store shelves and other item displays to confirm that an item removed from a shelf has been placed in the position of a customer and that the customer, at least for the time being, desires to purchase the item. Accordingly, a pre-checkout list can be generated for items placed in the shopping cart/basket.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The sensor network <b>138</b> can include radio frequency identification (RFID) sensors, such as RFID readers to read RFID tags attached to items. The sensor network <b>138</b> can alternatively include bar code scanner, near field communications (NFC), BLUETOOTH receivers and transmitters, scales, and the like to coordinate the status of items throughout the store.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although a single store network <b>106</b> is illustrated, it is contemplated that a group of stores, for example, a franchise or a chain, can be interconnected via the illustrated WAN <b>116</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The new membership process <b>400</b> enables a customer to establish a membership account with a store via a mobile device <b>102</b>. The new membership registration process <b>400</b> begins when the mobile device <b>102</b> interacts with an access point <b>122</b>. The access point <b>122</b> can provide connectivity via wireline or wireless communication mediums via 802.11x or a short communications medium as described above. In one embodiment, the mobile device <b>102</b> is connected to the access point <b>122</b> via a USE, IEEE 1394, Ethernet, or other wireline connection directly, or via a cradle apparatus. In another embodiment, the mobile device <b>102</b> is in communication with the access point <b>122</b> wirelessly via a short range communications medium or via 802.11x. In either case, the access point <b>122</b> can generate and send a membership_ID_request message <b>402</b> to the mobile device <b>102</b>. The membership_ID_request message <b>402</b> can prompt the customer to enter a member ID to access the store network <b>106</b> and the customer's membership account. In implementations that require security, a password, PIN, token, pass phrase, voice recognition, fingerprint recognition, retinal scan, security question(s), combinations thereof, and/or other security mechanisms known in the art can be used to limit access to authorized customers.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the illustrated process <b>400</b>, the customer does not have a membership_ID and accordingly can select a new membership button presented with the prompt. When a new_membership button is selected, a new_membership_request <b>404</b> can be generated and sent to the access point <b>122</b> to request a new membership account for the customer. The customer can be required to enter any combination of identifying information including, but not limited to name, address, telephone number, email address, date of birth, social security number, security question answer, and customer-created password. Any combination of the aforementioned identifying information can be appended to the new_membership_request <b>404</b> to aid in establishing a new membership account for the specified customer. Security measures may be enacted at a store network <b>106</b>, a mobile device <b>102</b>, or both to prevent theft of a user's personal information or requests for personal information from unauthorized users. The new_membership_request <b>404</b> is received at the access point <b>122</b> and forwarded to the membership database <b>134</b> via the LAN <b>108</b> or WLAN <b>110</b> (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Upon receipt of a new_membership_request <b>404</b> at the membership database <b>134</b>, a member ID is generated for the customer at step <b>406</b>.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a diagram illustrating an exemplary store map <b>700</b> is shown. The store map <b>700</b> can be displayed on a mobile device display <b>200</b> to provide a store map view of various items on a customer's shopping list, or inquired about through a search function, for example. The store map view can also provide the customer's present location using location sensors distributed throughout the store. The illustrated store map <b>700</b> is for a grocery store and, as such, includes various departments common in a grocery store including a dairy department, a meat department, a seafood department, a receiving department, a produce department, a bakery department, and a deli department. The illustrated store map <b>700</b> also includes eight aisles for other goods sold in the store. It should be understood that the present invention is equally applicable to stores of other types including, but not limited to, electronics stores, department stores, book stores, pet stores, warehouse stores, tool stores, home improvement stores, car dealerships, video stores, video game stores, entertainment stores, sports equipment stores, clothing stores, specialty stores, and the like. The present invention is also applicable to museums, amusement parks, aquariums, zoos, monuments, art galleries, libraries, other consumer attractions, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a message flow diagram illustrating a map list process <b>800</b>, according to the present invention, is shown. The map list process <b>800</b> allows a user/customer to generate a shopping list on a user computer <b>802</b>, and send the shopping list to a mobile device <b>102</b>. The shopping list can be used at a store to retrieve map information for the store. The map information can include notations of where each item in the customer's list is located, and the customer's current location within the store. The list can be store specific or can include keywords that identify particular products by manufacturer and/or product type.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">It is contemplated that the list can be created in a word processing program on the user computer <b>802</b>, or can be created using a program specific to such a task. The mobile device <b>102</b> can include a program for viewing the list, editing a list, creating a list, and using the list to create a map of a store. The list can be created and saved with file extensions compatible with a store mapping system, and may not need to be further formatted by a user computer program or mobile device program. That is, an unformatted word processing file can be received as an input to a store mapping system, and the mapping system can create a map from the items listed in the file.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The illustrated map list process <b>800</b> begins at the user computer <b>802</b> when a user creates a list on user computer <b>802</b>, at step <b>804</b>. The list can be sent to the mobile device <b>102</b> in a send_list message <b>806</b>. The list can be stored in a mobile device memory <b>204</b> at step <b>808</b>. Upon entering a store premises, the mobile device <b>102</b> establishes a connection with the store network <b>106</b> via the WLAN <b>110</b>, at step <b>810</b>. The following assumes the customer has signed in to a membership account associated with the customer or created a membership account. The membership account can be subject to policies that allow the customer access to map functions, and prevent other members from accessing this function. The mobile device <b>102</b> transmits the stored list to the inventory server <b>130</b> in a send_list message <b>812</b>. The inventory server <b>130</b> receives the send_list message <b>812</b> and can optionally determine the available items from the list, at step <b>814</b>, by communications with the store network <b>106</b> devices (not illustrated). This can ensure that only in-stock items will be mapped so as not to mislead the customer. This step can be eliminated. A map_request message <b>816</b> can be generated and sent to the map database <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The map database <b>128</b>, as described above, can include a plurality of maps for the store based on different store configurations. Upon receiving a map_request message <b>816</b>, the map database <b>128</b> determines the appropriate map for the current store state. For example, a map can be labeled for use between certain dates and set to expire on or after a date. In addition, the map database <b>128</b> can generate a customized map for the available items and save the customized map as an image file, for example, prior to sending a map_response message <b>818</b> to the mobile device <b>102</b> with the customized map. In the illustrated embodiment, the mobile device <b>102</b> has image viewing capabilities and needs no additional program. In some alternative embodiments, the map database <b>128</b> can generate instructions based on the available items for use by a program installed on the mobile device <b>102</b>. The mobile device processor <b>202</b> can execute the instructions to create a map for the available items. Though generating maps at a mobile device <b>102</b> may place further strain on the mobile device <b>102</b>, it may reduce network congestion on the store network <b>106</b>, and reduce the need for powerful processing requirements of the map database <b>128</b> and any associated systems/servers. In other alternative embodiments, the map database <b>128</b> can send a base map to a mobile device <b>102</b> upon registration of the mobile device <b>102</b> with the store network <b>106</b>. This can also be accomplished by the map database <b>128</b> sending a version number of the current base map to the mobile device <b>102</b>. The mobile device <b>102</b> can determine if the appropriate map is stored in memory <b>204</b>. The map database <b>128</b> can also send a request for the version number of the current base map stored in the memory <b>204</b>. If the version number is outdated, the map database <b>128</b> can send the current base map version to the mobile device <b>102</b> for storage in the memory <b>204</b>. The mobile device <b>102</b> can be configured to create a map based on the list or a revised list based on the available items as determined by the inventory server <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Turning again to the illustrated process <b>800</b>, the map database <b>128</b> can generate and send the map_response message <b>818</b> including the new map to the mobile device <b>102</b>. The mobile device <b>102</b> can then access the map at step <b>820</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a message flow diagram illustrating a product search process <b>900</b>, according to the present invention, is shown. The product search process <b>900</b> provides an item search function to a customer via a mobile device <b>102</b>. The item search function allows a customer to search for items and request the item to be mapped or instructions provided on where to locate the item. The illustrated product search process <b>900</b> begins when the mobile device <b>102</b> establishes a connection with the WLAN <b>110</b> at step <b>902</b>.

Suitable replacements can be store brands or other lower cost alternatives, and other brands that are in stock to replace a requested brand item that is not in stock. These alternative items are determined at step <b>1108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As an optional step, the inventory server <b>130</b> can generate a sales_request message <b>1110</b>, and send the sales_request message <b>1110</b> to the sales database <b>132</b> to retrieve any sales information for the requested item(s). This can provide assurance to the customer that the suggested items are the most economical solution for the requested item. Items currently on sale via store sales, coupons, promotions, combinations thereof, and the like, can be determined at the sales database <b>132</b> for the requested items and sent back to the inventory server <b>130</b> in a sales_response message <b>1112</b>. Any appropriate map can also be sent.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The inventory server <b>130</b> can include software to analyze the sales_response <b>1112</b> and generate suggestions based on the sales information provided by the sales database <b>132</b> at step <b>1114</b>. The inventory server <b>130</b> can send the suggestions to the mobile device <b>102</b> in a suggestions message <b>1116</b>. The suggestions message <b>1116</b> can be a text message notifying the customer of potential benefits (e.g., lower cost) for purchasing a suggested item over the item on the customer's list, for example. The suggestions message <b>1116</b> can also be used to manipulate the customer's list on the mobile device <b>102</b> to display the items originally listed by the customer, the store's suggestions, and any applicable coupons, coupon codes, promotion codes, or other information the customer would need to purchase the suggested items for the price offered.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Store suggestions can also be provided for related or similar items that are on a list but not co-located within the store. For example, one brand of an item may require refrigeration while all other brands do not require refrigeration. Accordingly, two locations offering similar items can be presented to the user for the user to select which location and which item the user would like to purchase. This selection can be used to generate an appropriate map including the selected location and may provide directions on where to find the item based upon the users present location within the store.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a message flow diagram illustrating a remote charging process <b>1200</b>, according to the present invention, is shown. Remote charging allows a customer to charge purchases to a remote account such as, but not limited to, a wireless service account or any other account. In the illustrated example, the service provider network <b>104</b> is shown generically as a network cloud for purposes of simplicity. It should be understood, however, that the service provider network <b>104</b> includes billing systems required for billing postpaid customers and receiving pre-payment from prepaid customers for services rendered by the service provider.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In the illustrated example, remote charging allows a customer to charge items to the wireless account for payment at the end of a billing cycle. Limits can be imposed on the customer's wireless account and the customer can be required to pay a charge balance in full at the end of each billing period along with any wireless service charges for the billing period. Alternatively, the wireless service provider can provide a credit line to the customer based on credit contracts developed between the parties.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Points systems can also be implemented. For example, a customer can earn points for using the remote charging feature. The points can be redeemable for discounts, gift certificates, plane tickets, hotel rooms, car rentals, vacations, cruises, or other goods and services. In another example, a customer can purchase points that can be redeemed at brick and mortar or online stores. In this example, the store would offer point requirements for goods and services. A transaction involving points can be handled in a manner similar to that described and illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">A remote charging feature using a points system is particularly applicable to a scenario in which a family has a joint service plan, for example, with one or more children. Each child can be assigned an allowance as a one-time allocation of points or on a periodic (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) basis. The child can then purchase items up to the available amount of points using a mobile device <b>102</b> at a check-out terminal <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">An exemplary remote charging process <b>1200</b> is now described. The process <b>1200</b> begins when a customer approaches a check-out terminal <b>124</b>. The check-out terminal <b>124</b> can be a self-checkout terminal or a check-out terminal operated by an associate. The check-out terminal <b>124</b> scans items at step <b>1202</b>. The mobile device <b>102</b> can establish a connection with the check-out terminal <b>124</b> before, during, or after the items are scanned at step <b>1204</b>. Once the connection is established, the mobile device <b>102</b> can transfer any digital coupons, e-coupons, coupon codes, promotion codes, or other sale information to the check-out terminal via a communications link established between the mobile device <b>102</b> and the check-out terminal <b>124</b> at step <b>1206</b>. It is contemplated that the mobile device <b>102</b> can be configured to display the bar code, or other scannable format, of a coupon on the mobile device display <b>200</b> to be scanned by the scanning equipment for the check-out terminal <b>124</b>. The mobile device <b>102</b> can communicate with the check-out terminal <b>124</b> via a direct wired connection, a cradle apparatus, or wirelessly through any short range wireless communications medium or 802.11x.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">The check-out terminal <b>124</b> can present the customer with options on how to pay for the scanned items. For example, the customer can choose cash, credit card, debit card, check, traveler's check, gift certificate, government credit, and/or remote charge for some or all of the purchase. If the customer chooses an option other than remote charge, the transaction is handled as is known in the art. However, if the customer chooses remote charge, the check-out terminal <b>124</b> can establish a connection with the service provider network <b>104</b>, at step <b>1208</b>, to provide a customer ID in a send_customer_ID message <b>1210</b>. The customer ID can be an identification provided by the service provider for the subscriber/customer. For example, the customer ID can be a telephone number or other subscriber ID provided by the service provider. The customer ID can also be of the customer's choosing, a member ID, or any other identification.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Upon receipt of the send_customer_ID message <b>1210</b>, the service provider network <b>104</b> can perform an authorization step <b>1212</b> to authorize the customer's account. Authorization can require a security mechanism to authenticate the customer. For example, the security mechanism can be, but is not limited to, a PIN number, password, pass phrase, security question answer, and the like. In one example, the service provider network <b>104</b> can send a request for this information to the check-out terminal <b>124</b>. The check-out terminal <b>124</b> can then request this information directly from the mobile device <b>102</b> without intervention of the customer. The check-out terminal <b>124</b> can alternatively request that the customer provide the requested information on a keypad or other input device connected to the check-out terminal <b>124</b>. The check-out terminal <b>124</b> can also receive the requested information from the mobile device <b>102</b> upon entry by the customer via a keypad or other input device on the mobile device <b>102</b>. The check-out terminal <b>124</b> can alternatively require the security information to be appended to the send_customer_ID message <b>1210</b> prior to being sent to the service provider network <b>104</b> to reduce transmissions between the service provider network <b>104</b> and the check-out terminal <b>124</b>. Accordingly, the check-out terminal <b>124</b> can request that the security information be supplied by the customer via one of the aforementioned methods prior to generating and sending the send_customer_ID message <b>1210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">The authorization step <b>1212</b> can also verify if the customer's wireless account is setup for remote charging, and that the account is in good standing prior to finalizing the authorization. Upon proper authorization, the service provider network <b>104</b> generates and sends an authorization_confirmation message <b>1214</b> to the check-out terminal <b>124</b>. If the authorization fails, the service provider network <b>104</b> can generate and send a notification to this effect to the check-out terminal <b>124</b> (not illustrated). The customer can then be notified accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The check-out terminal <b>124</b> can receive the authorization_confirmation <b>1214</b> and generate a charge_request message <b>1216</b> based on the amount the customer wishes to remotely charge to a service provider account, and send the charge_request message <b>1216</b> to the service provider network <b>104</b>. The service provider network <b>104</b> can route the charge to the appropriate billing system (not shown) and charge the account appropriately at step <b>1218</b>. A charge_response message <b>1220</b> can then be generated and sent to the check-out terminal <b>124</b> to verify that the charges were accepted. The check-out terminal <b>124</b> can then print a receipt at step <b>1222</b>. The remote charging transaction is then complete.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary mobile device <b>102</b> on which an item list <b>1300</b> is displayed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The illustrated mobile device <b>102</b> includes a display <b>200</b> on which the item list <b>1300</b> is displayed. The item list <b>1300</b> shows several products with Product B highlighted for selection via soft keys <b>1302</b> to engage either a Map function or a Search function. The soft keys <b>1302</b> can be programmed to engage any function or command. The mobile device <b>102</b> also includes a keypad <b>1304</b> input device for navigation of the item list <b>1300</b> and any menus or other features on the mobile device <b>102</b> that require a keypad <b>1304</b> or other input device. As described previously with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the mobile device <b>102</b> can include any input mechanism and is not specifically limited to the illustrated keypad <b>1304</b>. For example, the display <b>200</b> can also function as an input device.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary mobile device <b>102</b> on which a product map <b>1400</b> is displayed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The product map <b>1400</b> includes a map of an example grocery store as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. The product map <b>1400</b> is displayed in response to a user selecting the Map function via the Map soft key shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The product location is provided by a call-out <b>1402</b> to the item location and a description of the item location. The illustrated embodiment shows merely one way in which this information can be displayed. It should be understood that the map and product location information can be displayed in any way.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">It is contemplated that sensor networks, for example, sensor network <b>138</b> can also be used to provide approximate or exact locations for the products on the map in real-time or near real-time. The customer's location can also be tracked and displayed on the product map <b>1400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The product location information can also layout the products in order of proximity to the customer's location such that the customer can quickly find and purchase each of the mapped items sequentially. A map displaying an appropriate in-store route can also be provided. For example, a map can be generated to include each item on a specified list and include a route providing the most efficient way to find the listed items. As each item is found, the user can manually confirm that the item was found. The item can be removed from the list and/or the map, or an indication can be provided to remind the user the item has been found.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">As a user progresses through a store and selects mapped and/or listed items, those items can be automatically updated as found. For example, a sensor network <b>138</b> can be in place to update the list and/or map upon an item being placed in the user's shopping cart or shopping basket. Each shopping cart or shopping basket can provide content updates to the mobile device <b>102</b> to correlate shopping cart contents with a list and/or map on the mobile device <b>102</b> and make adjustments accordingly. The shopping cart or shopping basket can also be in communication with the inventory server <b>130</b> to temporarily adjust the stock status for the items and can be used to generate a pre-checkout list.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a diagram illustrating an exemplary mobile device <b>102</b> on which a product search <b>1500</b> is displayed in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The product search <b>1500</b> is displayed in response to a user selecting the Search function via the Search soft key shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>. The user can enter a search string in the search box <b>1502</b> and select the Enter soft key to engage a search function for the entered string. An exemplary search process <b>900</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">An item list can include supplemental features such as a calculator and a priority assignment feature. The calculator can keep track of list cost based on previous prices or prices provided to the mobile device <b>102</b> in real-time or near real-time in communications with the store network <b>106</b>. The store network <b>106</b> can supply related sales information and recalculate the new cost and/or provide suggestions to keep costs below a limit. The calculator can also provide suggestions for potential savings in purchasing one product over another. This information can be retrieved from the store network <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The item list can allow a customer to assign priority for items. The items can be arranged in the list according to the priority set for each item. If a limit is set, the list can highlight the items that would best utilize the funds for the set limit based on the priority set for each item. The customer can assign a favorites tag to items.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">An archive item list can also be tracked and periodically updated. The archive list can maintain prices, sales, coupons, and other information for each item placed on a customer's list in a specified time period. The customer can view recent lists, most purchased items, favorite items, least purchased items, items suggested by the customer, items suggested by the store, items suggested by a friend, items to avoid, and other item categories.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The store network <b>106</b> can also provide recipe suggestions to the customers. A recipe suggestion can be based on one or more items in a customer item list and sale items, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Item lists, maps, product reviews, member IDs, passwords, remote charge customer ID, recipes, and other information related to the present invention can be exchanged between mobile devices. A SIM or USIM can be configured to store at least a portion of this information and can be transferred to another mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Item lists can also be filtered based upon the store type a customer enters. For example, the customer can create a list including every item the user needs to purchase including groceries and clothing. Upon entry into a super store that includes both groceries and clothing, the list can be presented to the customer as created. However, if the customer enters a grocery store, for example, the items not available at that store can be grayed out or otherwise made unavailable to the user. This can be accomplished by communication between the mobile device <b>102</b> and the store inventory server <b>130</b>, for example.</p>
