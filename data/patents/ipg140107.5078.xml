<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This present application is related to a U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/173,923 entitled METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR DETERMINING THE IDENTITY OF A FEMTO CELL, by Michel J. Flanagan, filed currently herewith and commonly assigned to Arieso, Ltd.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Wireless communication systems, such as the 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation (3G) of mobile telephone standards and technology, are well known. An example of such 3G standards and technology is the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS&#x2122;), developed by the 3<sup>rd </sup>Generation Partnership Project (3GPP&#x2122;) (www.3gpp.org).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The 3<sup>rd </sup>generation of wireless communications has generally been developed to support macro-cell mobile phone communications. Such macro cells utilise high power base stations to communicate with wireless communication units within a relatively large geographical coverage area. These base stations are called &#x2018;NodeBs&#x2019;, in 3GPP.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, mobile/portable wireless communication units, or User Equipment (UEs) as they are often referred to in 3 G, communicate with a Core Network (CN) of the 3G wireless communication system. This communication is via a Radio Network Subsystem (RNS). A wireless communication system typically comprises a plurality of Radio Network Subsystems. Each Radio Network Subsystem comprises one or more cells to which UEs may attach, and thereby connect to the network.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Lower power femto cells (or pico-cells) are a recent development within the field of wireless cellular communication systems. These lower power cells have a smaller coverage area than Node Bs. The term femto cells is used hereafter to also encompass pico-cells or similar.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Femto cells are effectively communication coverage areas supported by low power base stations, which may also be referred to as Home NodeBs (HNBs). These femto cells are intended for use within a relatively small area of the cellular network. They may support communications to UEs in a restricted, for example &#x2018;in-building&#x2019;, environment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Typical applications for such femto Home NodeBs include residential and commercial, e.g. office, locations, and communication &#x2018;hotspots&#x2019;. In these uses, a Home NodeB can be connected to a core network of a communication system via, for example, the Internet. A broadband connection or the like may provide this connection. In this manner, femto cells can be provided in a simple, scalable deployment. They can be used in specific in-building locations where, for example, network congestion at the macro-cell level may be problematic. Significantly, the majority of HNBs are likely to be owned and deployed by members of the public, as opposed to a Network Operator owning a Node B.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Geo-location is the identification of the real-world geographical location of, say, a UE or the like. Geo-location of UEs can be performed in several ways. These include providing a UE with positioning equipment, such as GPS, or using network and mobile measurement data for nearby cells. A macro cell typically comprises a substantially unique Primary Scrambling Code (PSC) within its location area. A macro cell may therefore be distinguished from other macro cells, and thereby identified, based on its Location Area Code (LAC) and PSC. Accordingly, by identifying nearby macro cells for a UE, an approximate location of the UE may be determined, based on mobile measurement data for the identified macro cells. However, because of the relatively large coverage area of macro cells, this approach only provides some improvement in the degree of accuracy in identifying the location of the UE.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The use of femto cells for geo-location constitutes a special case. This is because femto cells have very limited range, unlike macro cells, and there can be many femto cells within the physical footprint of a single macro cell. Thus femto cells offer the potential for a higher degree of accuracy in identifying the locations of UEs. However, attempts to use femto cells for geo-location of a UE have tended to experience difficulties, for example:</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">(i) Femto cells are difficult to distinguish from one another in practice. This difficulty arises since they typically either share a single common Primary Scrambling Code (PSC), or a small number of shared PSCs. This can lead to considerable ambiguity in differentiating one femto cell from another.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">(ii) The relatively small number of femto cells has meant that a UE is typically only in contact with a femto cell for much less time than it has a macro cell available. Hence designers have tended to favor geo-location methods that rely on macro cells, rather than femto cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly, the invention seeks to mitigate, alleviate or eliminate one or more of the abovementioned disadvantages singly or in any combination.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A method of deriving reference timing information for a femto cell of a cellular wireless communication system in accordance with the invention may comprise at least one wireless communication unit receiving observed timing data for a femto cell within a macro cell, and observed timing data for the macro cell. Observed timing difference values are then determined, based at least partly on the observed timing data. The observed timing difference values are arranged into at least one set of observed timing difference values, for the femto cell. A central reference timing difference value can be determined for each set of observed timing difference values, and thereby for the femto cell. Reference timing information can then be set for the femto cell, in accordance with the determined central reference timing difference value or values.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The method of the invention may further comprise deriving an observed timing difference value dTm, which is the difference between:</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">(i) an observed timing offset value for the overlying macro cell (Tm_macro); and</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">(ii) an observed timing offset value for the femto cell (Tm_femto).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The method of the invention may further comprise arranging the observed timing difference values into the at least one set of observed timing difference values for the femto cell, on the basis of one or more of:</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">(i) A degree of correspondence of the observed timing difference values to previous observed timing difference values for the femto cell.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">(ii) Geographical location information corresponding to the observed timing difference values. This geographical location information may be provided by the wireless communication device, or may already be known to the communication system.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">(iii) Proximities of the observed timing difference values to current reference timing information for each of at least one previously mapped femto cell.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The method of the invention may comprise periodically using newly derived reference timing information for the femto cell, to replace currently held reference timing information for the femto cell. This allows the updating of the reference timing information.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A network element within a cellular wireless communication network may carry out a method in accordance with the invention. Alternatively, the method may be implemented in a mobile communication unit of the cellular communication system. The cellular wireless communication network comprises a plurality of macro cells and at least one femto cell associated with a macro cell. The network element may comprise at least one signal processing module arranged to receive observed timing data for a femto cell within a macro cell, and receive observed timing data for the macro cell, from at least one wireless communication unit. The network element may then determine observed timing difference values, based at least partly on the observed timing data, and arrange the observed timing difference values into at least one set of observed timing difference values for the femto cell, in accordance with geographical location information corresponding to the observed timing difference values. A central tendency timing difference value may be determined for each set of observed timing difference values, and the network element may then set reference timing information for the femto cell, in accordance with the determined central tendency timing difference value(s).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The signal processing module of the network element may be arranged to receive geographical location information for one or more femto cells associated with the macro cell, and arrange the observed timing difference values into the at least one set of observed timing difference values for the femto cell, by assigning the observed timing difference values to the femto cell whose currently held reference timing information corresponds most closely to the observed timing difference values.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The invention may also comprise a method for updating currently held reference timing information for a femto cell of a wireless communication system. The method of updating may comprise a wireless communication unit observing timing offset data for a femto cell, and timing offset data for a macro cell. A difference in timing offsets between the timing offset data for the femto cell and the timing offset data for the macro cell can be determined, and a reference timing difference value can be derived from the difference in timing offsets. The method of updating then comprises setting the derived reference timing difference value as new reference timing information for the femto cell.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The method of updating may further comprise a plurality of wireless communication units observing timing offset data for a plurality of femto cells, deriving a single reference timing value for each femto cell for which timing offset data for the femto cell and timing offset data of a macrocell have been observed, and updating the currently held reference timing information for each femto cell, by setting each single reference timing value as new reference timing information for the corresponding femto cell. The single reference timing value for each femto cell may be derived from timing offset data that has been obtained during a pre-defined time interval.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">A measurement report may be received from the wireless communication unit, the measurement report providing timing values for communications between the wireless communication unit and the femto cell, and between the wireless communication unit and more than one macro cell. The reference timing information for the femto cell can be derived from the measurement report, the derived reference timing information comprising a reference timing difference value for the femto cell and each of the more than one macro cells.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Updated reference timing information may be obtained for the femto cell during each of a plurality of time intervals, and the reference timing information can be used to calculate a rate of drift over time of the difference in timing offsets for the femto cell and one or more macro cells. The rate of drift can be:</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">(i) Used to identify a failing femto cell;</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">(ii) Used to extrapolate a known value of difference in timing offsets for the femto cell, to thereby derive a predicted value of difference in timing offsets.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Examples of the invention will be described in terms of a method and apparatus for deriving reference timing difference information for a femto cell of a cellular wireless communication system, the cellular wireless communication system comprising a plurality of macro cells and a plurality of wireless communication units. Typically, femto and macro cells are considered to be part of a &#x2018;network&#x2019;. The communications &#x2018;system&#x2019; may then be described as comprising the network, together with a plurality of wireless communication devices or UEs.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the following exemplary embodiments, a femto cell of a Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS&#x2122;) cellular wireless communication network is used. However, it will be appreciated by a skilled artisan that the inventive concept herein described may equally be implemented within cellular communication networks adapted in accordance with alternative wireless communication technologies and standards.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a number of applications, a network element in accordance with examples of the invention may be adapted to perform a method for deriving reference timing difference information for a femto cell within a macro cell of a cellular wireless communication network.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The method of the invention comprises determining at least one observed timing difference. The at least one observed timing difference is for communications between a wireless communication device and each of:</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">(i) a femto cell; and</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">(ii) the macro cell within which the femto cell is located, and possibly also other macro cells.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">One use of the derived reference timing difference information may be in a method of identifying the femto cell. Such a method is described in U.S. application Ser. No. 13/173,923, entitled Method and Apparatus for Determining The Identity of a Femto cell, by Michael J. Flanagan, commonly assigned to Arieso Limited, that is filed currently herewith and incorporated by reference in its entirety. Referring now to the drawings, and in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an example of part of a cellular communication system <b>100</b>, is illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The network of the cellular communication system <b>100</b> is adapted in accordance with an example embodiment of the invention. The example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a communication system in a form of a third generation partnership project (3GPP&#x2122;) UMTS&#x2122; network. Network <b>100</b> comprises a combination of a macro cell <b>185</b> and a plurality of 3G femto cells <b>150</b>, in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. For the example embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the radio network sub-system (RNS) comprises two distinct architectures, to handle the respective macro cell and femto cell communications.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the macro cell scenario, the RNS comprises a controller in the form of a Radio Network Controller (RNC) <b>136</b>. RNC <b>136</b> has, inter alia, signal processing logic <b>138</b>. The RNC <b>136</b> is operably coupled to a macro NodeB <b>124</b> for supporting communications within the macro cell <b>185</b>. The RNC <b>136</b> is further operably coupled to a core network element <b>142</b>, such as a serving general packet radio system (GPRS) support node (SGSN)/mobile switching centre (MSC), as known.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In a femto cell scenario, an RNS <b>110</b> comprises a network element, which for the illustrated example embodiment is in a form of a 3G Home NodeB (HNB) <b>130</b>. The HNB <b>130</b> is arranged to perform a number of functions generally associated with a base station. The RNS <b>110</b> further comprises a controller in the form of a 3G Access controller <b>140</b>. As will be appreciated by a skilled artisan, a Home NodeB (HNB), also referred to as a femto access point, is a communication element that supports communications within a communication cell, such as a 3G femto cell <b>150</b>. So the HNB <b>130</b> provides access to a cellular communication network via the 3G femto cell <b>150</b>. An HNB <b>130</b> may be purchased by a member of the public and installed in their home. The HNB <b>130</b> may then be connected to a 3G Access Controller <b>140</b> over the owner's broadband internet connection <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Thus, a 3G HNB <b>130</b> may be considered as encompassing a scalable, multi-channel, two-way communication device. The 3G HNB <b>130</b> may be provided within, say, residential and commercial (e.g. office) locations, &#x2018;hotspots&#x2019; etc, to extend or improve upon network coverage within those locations.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">There are no standard, defined criteria for the functional components of a 3G HNB. However, an example of a typical HNB for use within a 3GPP system may comprise some traditional macro NodeB functionality, and some aspects of the radio network controller (RNC) <b>136</b> functionality. For the illustrated embodiment, the HNB <b>130</b> comprises transceiver circuitry <b>155</b> arranged to enable communication with one or more wireless communication units. Those wireless communication units must be located within the general vicinity of the communication cell <b>150</b>, and in particular within the communication cell <b>150</b>. An example of such a wireless communication unit would be User Equipment (UE) <b>114</b>, connected via a wireless interface (Uu).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The 3G Access Controller <b>140</b> may be coupled to the core network element <b>142</b> via an Iu interface, as shown. In this manner, the HNB <b>130</b> is able to provide voice and data services to a cellular handset, such as UE <b>114</b>, in a femto cell. These services are provided in the same way as a conventional macro NodeB, but with the deployment simplicity of, for example, a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) access point.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For the illustrated example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the cellular communication network further comprises one or more network management systems (NMS) and/or operational support systems (OSS). These are illustrated generally at <b>150</b>. Such systems may typically support, for example, processes such as maintaining network inventory, provisioning services, configuring network components, managing faults, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates the limited range of femto cells. Due to their limited range, femto cells typically reside within the larger footprint of at least one macro cell. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates schematically:</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">(i) The distance between a wireless communication device <b>214</b> and the NodeB <b>224</b> that supports the macro cell <b>285</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">(ii) The distance between the wireless communication device <b>214</b> and HNBs <b>232</b> and <b>234</b>. HNB <b>232</b> supports a first femto cell <b>252</b> within the footprint of the macro cell <b>285</b>. HNB <b>234</b> supports a second femto cell <b>254</b>, which is also within the footprint of the macro cell <b>285</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">These distances vary, depending on the particular location of the wireless communication device <b>214</b> within the footprint of the macro cell <b>285</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Due to the limited range of femto cells <b>252</b> and <b>254</b>, the wireless communication device <b>214</b> must be in close proximity to one of the HNBs <b>232</b> or <b>234</b> in order for the wireless communication device <b>214</b> to be able to observe a femto cell <b>252</b> or <b>254</b>. Here &#x2018;close proximity&#x2019; may be typically within, 50 meters. Accordingly, if a femto cell <b>252</b> or <b>254</b> observed by a UE <b>214</b> can be identified, the geographical location of the UE <b>214</b> may be determined to be approximately that of the HNB <b>232</b> or <b>234</b> supporting that femto cell.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">However, a large number of femto cells have already been deployed in real world networks. An even greater number are anticipated to be deployed in the future. As specified above, conventional methods for identifying macros cells do not apply to femto cells. In particular, Primary Scrambling Codes (PSCs), which conventionally enable macro cells to be identified, are typically shared by many femto cells within a location area. Thus a PSC cannot be used to differentiate between different femto cells.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The inventors of the present invention have realised that timing offset data for femto and macro cells observed by a wireless communication device/UE may be used to derive and/or update reference timing information, for femto cells within the footprint of a macro cell. That reference timing information may be used for a variety of purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In particular, the inventors have realised that observed timing differences between an observed macro cell timing offset, and an observed femto cell timing offset, can be used. By updating reference timing difference information for a femto cell within a macro cell of a cellular wireless communication network, the reference information can be kept accurate. Such information may be fed into and used in other methods, for example in identifying a femto cell as described in the commonly owned patent application as referenced herein. So, in the commonly assigned patent application as identified herein. The reference timing difference information may serve other uses. For example, it may indicate faults in the wireless communication network or a macro cell.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In general terms, the observed timing differences provide a means by which a femto cell may be distinguished from one or more other femto cells within the same macro cell footprint. This approach may thus enable femto cells within a macro cell footprint to be identified. The reference timing difference information may also, for example, indicate faults in the wireless communication network or a macro cell.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates an example of observed timing difference data. The location of femto cells F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> at <b>310</b> and <b>320</b>. The location of UE <b>214</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is shown at <b>330</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Typically, UEs within cellular communication networks, such as a UMTS network, provide measurement reports to the network. Such reports comprise measured data for observed cells, including both femto and macro cells. The data typically comprises signal strength measurements and timing offset values for the observed cells. These timing offset values provide an indication of a signal delay between the UE and the femto cells and macro cells. Accordingly, when the UE <b>214</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> comes into range of femto cell <b>252</b> for example, it provides a measurement report. That measurement report will comprise measurement data, including timing offset data for:</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">(i) femto cell <b>252</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">(ii) macro cell <b>285</b>, within which femto cell <b>252</b> is located.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In this example, macro cell <b>285</b> may be referred to as the &#x2018;overlying macro cell&#x2019;. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, both first femto cell <b>252</b> and second femto cell <b>254</b> lie wholly within macro cell <b>285</b>. However, a femto cell may lie at the outer periphery of the coverage area of macro cell <b>285</b>. For such a femto cell, some part of the coverage area of the femto cell may lie outside the coverage area of macro cell <b>285</b>. In such a case, only a part of the femto cell can be described as lying within macro cell <b>285</b>. This is more likely for femto cells of comparatively greater size, and some femto cells may cover an area of up to a few hundred meters or more. A UE <b>214</b> will only be able to provide a measurement report to the network with timing offset data for both the femto cell and the macro cell, when it is within the part of the femto cell from which it can also see HNB <b>224</b> of the macro cell.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In accordance with the invention, an observed timing difference may be determined, upon receipt of a measurement report comprising measurement data for first femto cell <b>252</b> or second femto cell <b>254</b>, and overlying macro cell <b>285</b>. The timing difference is based at least partly on the observed timing offset data for the femto cell <b>252</b> or <b>254</b>, and the overlying macro cell <b>285</b>. For example, the observed timing data provided within the measurement report may comprise an observed timing offset value for each of one or more observed macro cells, and in particular for the observed femto cell <b>252</b> or <b>254</b> and the overlying macro cell <b>285</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">An observed timing difference value may be determined for the observed femto cell <b>252</b> or <b>254</b> and the overlying macro cell <b>285</b> by subtracting one of the timing offset values therefor from the other. For example, an observed timing difference value may be calculated by subtracting, say, the observed timing offset value for the overlying macro cell <b>285</b> from the observed timing offset value for the observed femto cell <b>252</b> or <b>254</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">If the following notation is used:</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">&#x2018;dTm&#x2019; for the observed timing difference value</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">&#x2018;Tm_macro&#x2019; for the observed timing offset value for the overlying macro cell <b>285</b></p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">&#x2018;Tm_femto&#x2019; for the observed timing offset value for the observed femto cell <b>252</b> or <b>254</b></p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Then the observed timing difference value (d&#x2122;) may be expressed as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>dTm=Tm</i>_femto&#x2212;<i>Tm</i>_macro&#x2003;&#x2003;[Eq. 1]<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Due to the limited range of femto cells, the observed timing offset value Tm_femto for an observed femto cell <b>252</b> or <b>254</b> will typically be relatively consistent within a small window of time. This means that dTm will not vary significantly at a particular femto cell, due to the limited range of the femto cell. As noted in the commonly assigned patent application as identified herein, different femto cells will tend have different dTm values.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The exact value of Tm_macro will usually be different at femto cell <b>252</b>, compared to the Tm_macro observed at femto cell <b>254</b>. This is because femto cell <b>252</b> and femto cell <b>254</b> are likely to be at different distances from NodeB <b>224</b> of the macro cell. What is important is that the dTm value will almost always be different at femto cell <b>252</b> compared to femto cell <b>254</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The femto cells are likely to have substantial timing drift, over time, compared to macro cells, because the femto cells are consumer electronic devices. The more expensive macro cells can afford to have expensive timing references, such as ovenized oscillators and sophisticated frequency lock loops. However, the femto cells typically have less accurate timing references. The drift of the timing reference of a femto cell can be tracked over time. The timing reference can then still be used to distinguish one femto cell from another.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The inventors have thus recognised that the observed timing difference value dTm for an observed femto cell <b>252</b> or <b>254</b> and an overlying macro cell <b>285</b> is capable of providing a defining characteristic for each femto cell <b>252</b> or <b>254</b>. This defining characteristic can be used as a differentiating characteristic between each of the femto cells in a macro cell, so serves as an identifier of the femto cell. See also Applicant's commonly owned application as referenced herein.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The present invention therefore provides a method of deriving reference timing difference information for a femto cell, and for updating that information over time.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The actual values of the offsets themselves, such as Tm_femto and Tm_macro, are defined by the 3GPP standards. Each offset is the time offset, between:</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">(i) The observed start of a 10 millisecond radio frame, transmitted by the cell in question, and as received by the wireless communication unit; and</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">(ii) The 10 millisecond timing reference used by the wireless communication unit.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The macro cell may, for example, provide a time stamp embedded in a communication that is sent to the wireless communication unit. The wireless communication unit will however see that time stamp as being offset from the timing reference used in the wireless communication unit, by an amount that depends on two parameters, as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">(i) One parameter is the amount by which the timing provided by timing circuitry in the NodeB of the macro cell differs from the timing reference used in the wireless communication unit. If, for example, the wireless communication unit has an &#x2018;absolute&#x2019; time reference available, such as the correct time for the time zone in which it is located, the timing circuitry within the Node B is likely not to provide exactly this absolute time. The time stamp inserted by the NodeB in a communication to the wireless communication unit will thus differ correspondingly from the &#x2018;absolute&#x2019; time reference used by the wireless communication unit.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">(ii) The other parameter is the time taken for the communication to travel from the location of the NodeB <b>224</b> to the wireless communication unit <b>214</b>. For a wireless communication unit within the footprint of one femto cell such as femto cell <b>252</b>, the distance to the NodeB of the macrocell varies little across the footprint of the femto cell.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The measurement unit for these offsets is the &#x2018;chip&#x2019;. UMTS has a chip rate of 3.84 Million chips per second. The unit of a chip is a thus a duration of 1/3.84 microseconds=260.4 nsec</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">So the timing offset values represent the number of &#x201c;chips&#x201d; in a 10 msec radio frame, and hence vary between 0 and 38399. So a measurement may yield one of 38400 possible Tm values. This is 3.84e6*10 e-3=38400.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Accordingly, a corresponding observed timing difference dTm, between the timing offset of a femto cell and the timing offset of a macro cell, may also vary from 0 to 38399. It is important to note that the Tm offset values are expressed modulo 38400. This is because the addition of an integer multiple of 38400 chips, such as 38400 or 76800 chips, does not change the relative location of the 10 millisecond timing boundaries. Examples of the value that a timing difference may take are therefore 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , 38399.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The input values of Tm on the right side of equation 1 are therefore given modulo 38400, for a UMTS system. So the output values of dTm on the left of equation 1 will also be expressed as a value between 0 and 38399. That is, this difference value of dTm is also expressed modulo 38400. In fact, an arbitrary offset can also be introduced. This could be arranged to lead, for example, to an output value that is expressed as a value between &#x2212;19200 and 19199. This example would still provide a total range of 38400, and be expressed modulo 38400. However, this allows negative numbers as well as positive numbers. In this latter approach, some example dTm values include: 0, 1, &#x2212;1, 2, &#x2212;2, 3, &#x2212;3, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Considering again the example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>:</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">(i) NodeB <b>224</b> supports the overlying macro cell <b>285</b>;</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">(ii) First femto cell F<b>1</b> <b>252</b> may be located relatively close to NodeB <b>224</b>; and</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">(iii) Second femto cell F<b>2</b> <b>254</b> may be located further away from NodeB <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">There will be no relationship between physical proximity and dTm values. Variability in dTm values will be driven mostly by the random timing initialization and timing drifts in the femto cell oscillators. The observed dTm value at the first femto cell <b>252</b> is a function of femto cell clock initialization and femto cell clock drift. For example, it might take a value of, say, &#x2018;9 chips&#x2019; at a particular point in time. This is illustrated below icon <b>310</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as dTm=9.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The value of dTm for femto cell <b>254</b> relative to NodeB <b>244</b> will generally be quite different than that for femto cell <b>252</b> relative to NodeB <b>244</b>, due to different clock initialization and subsequent clock drift. For example, it might take a value of, say, &#x2018;1019 chips&#x2019;. This is illustrated below icon <b>320</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, as dTm=1019.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The example illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, shows a measurement of &#x2018;10 chips&#x2019; as dTm for the current location <b>330</b> of the wireless communication device. The closest reference timing difference value to the observed value is the value &#x2018;9 chips&#x2019;, illustrated at <b>310</b> for femto cell <b>252</b> F<b>1</b>. Hence the observed value of &#x2018;10 chips&#x2019; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is most likely to be a measurement of the timing difference of femto cell F<b>1</b>. The observed value of 10 chips may then be added to the set of all values recorded from various wireless communication devices for femto cell F<b>1</b>. Thus, timing reference information can be derived by a process of &#x2018;mapping&#x2019; difference values for femto cells, in relation to individual overlying macros cells. This mapped timing reference information may then be used for other purposes. Importantly, it may be updated.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">A wireless communication device such as UE <b>214</b> is typically within range of more than one macro cell. Accordingly, a measurement report from a single wireless communication device may comprise observed timing data for more than one macro cell. It is therefore contemplated that the method for deriving reference information may use data from one measurement report from one wireless communication device to derive reference data for timing offsets between the femto cell and more than one macro cell.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The method for deriving reference timing difference information for a femto cell may be performed substantially anywhere within the cellular communication network <b>100</b> that timing data received from a UE is made available, and where reference timing difference data for macro cells is also made available.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The method may be implemented within the NMS/OSS <b>150</b> part of the network <b>100</b>, for example by way of a computer-readable code such as a software subroutine stored within a memory element <b>152</b> of the NMS/OSS <b>150</b> and executed on a signal processing module <b>155</b> thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates schematically an example of observed femto and macro cell timing data, received from at least one UE. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> also shows how geographical location information can be used with the measurements of femto cell and macro cell timing data, to determine observed timing difference values for femto cells within a footprint of a macro cell <b>485</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Firstly, timing difference values are obtained for the location of wireless communication devices in a macro cell. These values may then be arranged into one or more sets, or &#x2018;clusters&#x2019;, of values. This arrangement may be performed in accordance with, say, the geographical location information corresponding to the respective observed timing data. This is illustrated at <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The &#x2018;cloud&#x2019; shape <b>410</b> around femto cell F<b>1</b> <b>430</b> represents locations from which a wireless communication device in macro cell <b>485</b> observes timing data from both macro cell <b>485</b> and femto cell <b>430</b>. &#x2018;Cloud&#x2019; shape <b>420</b> around femto cell F<b>2</b> <b>432</b> represents locations from which a wireless communication device in macro cell <b>485</b> observes timing data from both macro cell <b>485</b> and femto cell <b>434</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">A central tendency timing difference value, for example an average or median value, may then be determined for each set of observed timing difference values. For example, if a set of observed timing difference values comprised the values: &#x201c;0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2&#x201d;, then a central tendency timing difference value might be, say, &#x201c;1&#x201d;. Similarly, a central tendency geographical location value may also be determined, based on the corresponding geographical location information, which may be provided by the wireless communication unit. Note that this value may be used to map the observed timing difference value in question to a location. This mapping may occur via the average/median location, or to a particular femto cell location in a look up table, via the closest femto cell to the average/median location.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Thus, observed femto and macro cell timing data, and geographical location information received from UEs, may be used to map central tendency timing difference and geographical location values for femto cells. Such mapped data may then be stored (set) within a memory element. That mapped data serves as reference information. The reference information is available for subsequent use. One use is to enable the identification of femto cells, by another wireless communication device that moves into the footprint of one of the femto cells. The method described above may be used to provide reference timing information for one or more femto cells, when no reference timing information was previously available. However, there also may be a need to update such information.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Due to the need to produce low cost HNB devices, femto cells are likely to have timing references that drift significantly over time, relative to the NodeBs of the more stable macro network. Accordingly, the timing difference values for a femto cell and an overlay macro cell are also likely to drift over time. Mapped timing difference data for femto cells may therefore need to be updated, in order to compensate for such drift.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">For example, as previously mentioned, observed timing data for femto cells and the macro cells may be received from wireless communication units, and used to determine observed timing difference values based (at least partly) on the observed timing data. Such observed timing difference values may then be compared with previously received mapped timing difference data. Such observed timing difference values may be then retained, for example stored, for subsequent use as reference timing difference information, to compensate for drift within the timing references of the femto cells.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The observed timing difference values for a macro cell obtained over a period of time may be arranged into one or more sets, or &#x2018;clusters&#x2019;, of values. This may be done in accordance with, say, their proximity to (current) mapped timing difference values for mapped femto cells, within the footprint of the macro cell. See once more femto cells <b>410</b>, <b>420</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">For example, assume that current mapped timing difference values for mapped femto cells comprise &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1000&#x201d;. This numerical example shows how two different femto cells can have very different, and thus defining, dTm values. Assume also that the observed timing difference values comprise the values:</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">&#x201c;0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2,1000,1001,1002,1000,1001,1002&#x201d;</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Then the observed timing difference values may be arranged into the following two sets of values:</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">&#x201c;0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">&#x201c;1000,1001,1002,1000,1001,1002&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">A central tendency timing difference value, for example an average or centroid value, for each set of observed timing difference values may then be determined, based on the observed timing difference values. For example, for the set of observed timing difference values comprising the values: &#x201c;0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2&#x201d;, a central tendency timing difference value might be, say, &#x201c;1&#x201d;. Similarly, for the set of observed timing difference values comprising the values: &#x201c;1000,1001,1002,1000,1001,1002&#x201d;, a central tendency timing difference values might be, say, &#x201c;1001&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The previous reference timing difference information based on the values &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1000&#x201d; for the femto cells may then be updated, with these newly determined central tendency difference values. Thus, for this example, the mapped timing difference values would be updated from &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1000&#x201d; to &#x201c;1&#x201d; and &#x201c;1001&#x201d; respectively. The values &#x2018;1&#x2019; and &#x2018;1001&#x2019; then become the current reference timing difference information for the femto cells, until such time as newly received data allows these values, in turn, to be updated.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Table 1 below shows some exemplary observed timing difference values, and how they may be both arranged and used. The timing values shown in columns 2-5 of Table 1 are all in units of &#x2018;chips&#x2019;. For a UMTS system, each chip corresponds to 260.4 nsec.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The first column of Table 1 shows the identifiers of two femto cells, such as those in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>. In the wireless communications system, these femto cells F<b>1</b> and F<b>2</b> would each be known by a unique identifier. The identifier held for each femto cell may, for example, be the IP address for the HNB of the femto cell. The second column of Table 1 shows the existing reference value for each femto cell. The values &#x2018;1&#x2019; and &#x2018;1001&#x2019; have been chosen, these being the results from the example explained above. The third column of Table 1 shows at least one set of observed timing difference values. These are values obtained since the timepoint when reference values of &#x2018;1&#x2019; and &#x2018;1001&#x2019; were set as reference values. The third column may show all the sets of values observed in, for example, a time interval of 15 minutes since the last update was performed.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Femto cell F<b>1</b> is shown with two sets of observed timing difference values in the third column. These may, for example, have been observed by two different wireless communication devices, which were within range of femto cell F<b>1</b> within the 15 minutes period covered by table 1. The lowest row in the third column shows a set of observed timing values for a femto cell that has not previously been identified. This might be a newly installed femto cell.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The fourth column of Table 1 shows the centroid value derived for the set of observed timing difference values shown in the same row.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The fifth column of Table 1 shows the new reference value for the timing offset for the femto cell in the same row. Clearly timing drift has lead to the reference value for femto cell F<b>1</b> needing to be changed from 1 chip to 4 chips. Normally such a change would be due to drift within the femto cell's timing reference circuitry.</p>

</tables>
</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">A set of timing difference values such as 3,4,3,4,4,4,4 in the second row of table 1 may in fact be obtained in one of a variety of ways. These include:</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">(i) All of the values 3,4,3,4,4,4,4 may have been obtained by one wireless communications device, during one call within the femto cell.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">(ii) Some of the values, such as 3,4,3 at the start of the sequence may have been obtained by one wireless communications device, and the remaining values 4,4,4,4 by a different mobile.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">(iii) Each of the values 3,4,3,4,4,4,4 may have been obtained by a different wireless communications device.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">The two sets of observed timing difference values 2,3,3,2,3,3,3 and 3,4,3,4,4,4,4 for femto cell F<b>1</b> may also be obtained in a variety of ways, for example:</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">(i) A wireless communications device may have obtained the first set early in the time interval covered by table 1. The wireless communications device, or another device, may then have obtained the second set later in the time interval, by which time the femto cell's timing had drifted further.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">(ii) A wireless communications device may have obtained the first set in one part of the femto cell F<b>1</b>, i.e. at one particular point within the geographical area of e.g. footprint <b>252</b> of the femto cell. The second set may have been obtained in a different part of the femto cell F<b>1</b>, i.e. at a different point within the geographical area of e.g. footprint <b>252</b> of the femto cell. If it is a large femto cell, then there may be a difference of up to 1-3 chips across the whole width of the femto cell, due to the difference in the time of travel of signals from the macro cell and femto cell.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">A new table, analogous to Table 1, could be compiled for sets of observed timing difference values obtained in the next time interval, e.g. the next 15 minutes. That table would start with the values &#x2018;4&#x2019; for femto cell F<b>1</b>, and &#x2018;1002&#x2019; for femto cell F<b>2</b>, in its second column.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">The values of observed timing difference in Table 1 may be obtained from a measurement report, received from a wireless communication unit. In many instances, the measurement report will provide timing values for communications between the wireless communication unit and the femto cell, and between the wireless communication unit and more than one macro cell. In this case, one wireless communication unit can provide reference information that relates to the femto cell and timing differences to more than one macro cell.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The reference timing information provided by the process summarised in table 1 can be obtaining for the femto cell during each of a plurality of time intervals. This information may then be used to calculate a rate of drift over time of the difference in timing offsets for the femto cell and one or more macro cells. This rate of drift is sometimes referred to as a &#x2018;clock slip rate&#x2019;. The rate of draft may itself be used, alone or in combination with other information, to identify a femto cell. If the rate of drift takes particular values, such as being above a threshold value or being erratic, it may be used to indicate a failing femto cell.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">The rate of drift may be used to extrapolate a known value of the difference in timing offsets for the femto cell. This can then provide a predicted value of difference in timing offsets. That predicted value may be of use for a future time interval in which no wireless communication unit observes or provides a report of data for the femto cell. Information about the rate of drift may be provided to the femto cell. The femto cell may use the information about the rate of drift to stabilise timing reference circuitry within the femto cell. Although table 1 shows two known femto cells and a third unknown femto cell in a macro cell, it is now commonplace for an urban macrocell to have five or even more femto cells within it.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a simplified flowchart <b>500</b> of an example of a method for mapping reference timing difference data for at least one femto cell within a footprint of a macro cell of a wireless communication network, in accordance with some embodiments of the present invention. Such a method may be implemented, for example, when initially mapping timing difference data and geographical location data for femto cells within the footprint of the macro cell. Additionally or alternatively, such a method may be implemented, for example, when updating reference mapped timing difference data, for femto cells within the footprint of the macro cell. This may be, for example, in order to compensate for drift of timing references for the femto cells.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The method starts at <b>510</b>, and moves on to step <b>520</b> where observed timing data is received. For example such observed timing data may be received from wireless communication units over a period of time. In the case of initially mapping timing difference data and geographical location data for femto cells within the macro cell, geographical location data corresponding to the observed timing data may also be received.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Next, at <b>530</b>, observed timing difference values are determined based on the received timing data. Such observed timing difference values may be determined upon receipt of the timing data over a period of time and retained, for example stored, for subsequent use in setting/updating of mapped time difference data. This determination may, for example, use equation [1] above.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The observed timing difference values are then arranged into sets of values at <b>540</b>. For example, in the case of initially mapping timing difference data and geographical location data, the observed timing difference values may be arranged into sets of values in accordance with the geographical location information corresponding to the observed timing difference values. Alternatively, for example in the case of updating mapped timing difference data, the observed timing difference values may be arranged into sets of values in accordance only with (current) reference timing difference values for the previously mapped femto cell(s).</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">At step <b>550</b>, having previous arranged the observed timing difference values into sets of values, a central tendency value, for example an average or centroid value, for each set of observed timing difference values is determined. This value is based on the observed timing difference values. In the case of initially mapping timing difference data and geographical location data, a central tendency geographical location value may also be determined, based on the corresponding geographical location information.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">At step <b>560</b>, mapped timing difference values for the femto cells within the footprint of the macro cell are then updated (or set), in accordance with the determined central tendency timing difference value(s). The method ends at <b>570</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and this description, &#x2018;mapping&#x2019; has the sense of correlating together measured values with those known for each femto cell. Essentially, a dTm timing difference that a wireless communication device observes, can be assigned to a femto cell, on the basis of it differing by only a small number of chips from a timing difference value previously know to be correct for that femto cell.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The rate of drift of dTm over time may also be used as a defining characteristic of the femto cell. For example, the rate of drift may remain broadly constant, for some femto cells. For these cells, evaluating the rate of drift over time of parameter dTm can be helpful in a variety of situations. One example is when the dTm values of two different femto cells are drifting into each other from opposite directions or from the same direction. The rate of change of dTm is generally preserved in these types of &#x201c;collisions&#x201d; so that there is an effective way to distinguish between the two femto cells even though they had similar dTm values at a particular point in time.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, there is illustrated a typical computing system <b>600</b> that may be employed to implement signal processing functionality in embodiments of the invention.

The invention may optionally be implemented, at least partly, as computer software running on one or more data processors and/or digital signal processors or configurable module components such as field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices. Thus, the elements and components of an embodiment of the invention may be physically, functionally and logically implemented in any suitable way. Indeed, the functionality may be implemented in a single unit, in a plurality of units or as part of other functional units.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Although the present invention has been described in connection with some embodiments, it is not intended to be limited to the specific form set forth herein. Rather, the scope of the present invention is limited only by the accompanying claims. Additionally, although a feature may appear to be described in connection with particular embodiments, one skilled in the art would recognize that various features of the described embodiments may be combined in accordance with the invention. In the claims, the term &#x2018;comprising&#x2019; does not exclude the presence of other elements or steps.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Furthermore, although individually listed, a plurality of means, elements or method steps may be implemented by, for example, a single unit or processor. Additionally, although individual features may be included in different claims, these may possibly be advantageously combined, and the inclusion in different claims does not imply that a combination of features is not feasible and/or advantageous. Also, the inclusion of a feature in one category of claims does not imply a limitation to this category, but rather indicates that the feature is equally applicable to other claim categories, as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">Furthermore, the order of features in the claims does not imply any specific order in which the features must be performed and in particular the order of individual steps in a method claim does not imply that the steps must be performed in this order. Rather, the steps may be performed in any suitable order. In addition, singular references do not exclude a plurality. Thus, references to &#x2018;a&#x2019;, &#x2018;an&#x2019;, &#x2018;first&#x2019;, &#x2018;second&#x2019;, etc. do not preclude a plurality.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Thus, an improved method and apparatus for deriving reference timing information for a femto cell of a cellular wireless communication system, and a corresponding method for updating currently held reference timing information for a femto cell of a cellular wireless communication system have been described, wherein the aforementioned disadvantages with prior art arrangements have been substantially alleviated.</p>
