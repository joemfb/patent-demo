<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This invention is related to the field of integrated circuits including integrated memories such as static random access memory (SRAM) and, more particularly, to supplying power to such integrated circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As the number of transistors included on a single integrated circuit &#x201c;chip&#x201d; has increased and as the operating frequency of the integrated circuits has increased, the management of power consumed by an integrated circuit has continued to increase in importance. If power consumption is not managed, meeting the thermal requirements of the integrated circuit (e.g. providing components required to adequately cool the integrated circuit during operation to remain within thermal limits of the integrated circuit) may be overly costly or even infeasible. Additionally, in some applications such as battery powered devices, managing power consumption in an integrated circuit may be key to providing acceptable battery life.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Power consumption in an integrated circuit is related to the supply voltage provided to the integrated circuit. For example, many digital logic circuits represent a binary one and a binary zero as the supply voltage and ground voltage, respectively (or vice versa). As digital logic evaluates during operation, signals frequently transition fully from one voltage to the other. Thus, the power consumed in an integrated circuit is dependent on the magnitude of the supply voltage relative to the ground voltage. Reducing the supply voltage generally leads to reduced power consumption. However, there are limits to the amount by which the supply voltage may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One limit to the reduction of supply voltage that is experienced in integrated circuits that integrate memories (such as SRAM) is related to the robustness of the memory. As supply voltage decreases below a certain voltage, the ability to reliably read and write the memory decreases. The reduced reliability may have several sources. The resistances of some devices in the memory (e.g. the pass gate transistors that couple bit lines to memory cells in an SRAM) may change as the supply voltage falls. The changed resistance may impact the ability to overdrive the memory cell for a write or to discharge the bit line for a read. Additionally, in some designs, the transistors in the memory are high threshold voltage (high V<sub>T</sub>) transistors. That is, the threshold voltage at which the transistors activate (or &#x201c;turn on&#x201d; . . . i.e. actively conduct current) is higher than other transistors in the integrated circuit. The threshold voltage of such transistors does not scale well with supply voltage. Accordingly, the &#x201c;trip point&#x201d; (the point at which a write to a memory cell occurs) as a percentage of the supply voltage worsens as the supply voltage is decreased. As an example, in one current integrated circuit manufacturing process, a supply voltage below about 0.9 volts results in reduced ability to write the memory reliably. Similarly, the ability to quickly and/or reliably read the memory decreases. Accordingly, the supply voltage at which the robustness of the memory begins to be impacted has served as a floor to reducing the supply voltage to an integrated circuit that includes memory.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In one embodiment, an integrated circuit comprises at least one logic circuit supplied by a first supply voltage and at least one memory circuit coupled to the logic circuit and supplied by a second supply voltage. The memory circuit is configured to be read and written responsive to the logic circuit even if the first supply voltage is less than the second supply voltage during use.</p>

<p id="p-0019" num="0018">While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, specific embodiments thereof are shown by way of example in the drawings and will herein be described in detail. It should be understood, however, that the drawings and detailed description thereto are not intended to limit the invention to the particular form disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram of one embodiment of an integrated circuit <b>10</b> is shown. In the illustrated embodiment, the integrated circuit includes a plurality of logic circuits <b>12</b> and a plurality of memory circuits <b>14</b>. The logic circuits <b>12</b> are coupled to the memory circuits <b>14</b>. The logic circuits <b>12</b> are powered by a first supply voltage provided to the integrated circuit <b>10</b> (labeled V<sub>L </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The memory circuits <b>14</b> are powered by a second power supply voltage provided to the integrated circuit <b>10</b> (labeled V<sub>M </sub>in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In the illustrated embodiment, the memory circuits <b>14</b> are also powered by the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage, as will be explained in more detail for certain embodiments below. The integrated circuit <b>10</b> may generally comprise the logic circuits <b>12</b> and the memory circuits <b>14</b> integrated onto a single semiconductor substrate (or chip).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The logic circuits <b>12</b> may generally implement the operation for which the integrated circuit is designed. The logic circuits <b>12</b> may generate various values during operation, which the logic circuits <b>12</b> may store in the memory circuits <b>14</b>. Additionally, the logic circuits <b>12</b> may read various values from the memory circuits <b>14</b> on which to operate. For example, in various embodiments, the memory circuits <b>14</b> may include memory used for caches, register files, integrated-circuit-specific data structures, etc. The memory circuits <b>14</b> may implement any type of readable/writeable memory. In an example below, an SRAM memory will be used. It is noted that, while the illustrated embodiment includes a plurality of logic circuits <b>12</b> and a plurality of memory circuits <b>14</b>, various embodiments may include at least one logic circuit <b>12</b> and at least one memory circuit <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Generally, if a logic circuit <b>12</b> is to access a memory circuit <b>14</b>, the logic circuit <b>12</b> may generate various control signals to the memory circuit <b>14</b>. For example, the control signals may include an address identifying the memory location in the memory circuit <b>14</b> that is to be accessed, a read enable signal which may be asserted to perform a read, and a write enable signal which may be asserted to perform a write. For a read, the memory circuit <b>14</b> may output data to the logic circuit <b>12</b>. For a write, the logic circuit <b>12</b> may supply data to the memory circuit <b>14</b> for storage.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">By separating the supply voltage for the logic circuits <b>12</b> and the memory circuits <b>14</b>, the supply voltage for the logic circuits <b>12</b> (V<sub>L</sub>) may be reduced below the level at which the memory circuits <b>14</b> may operate robustly. The supply voltage for the memory circuits <b>14</b> (V<sub>M</sub>) may be maintained at the minimum supply voltage that provides for robust memory operation (or greater, if desired). Thus, the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage may be less than the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage during use. At other times, the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage may exceed the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage during use (e.g. at times when higher performance is desired and higher power consumption is acceptable to achieve the higher performance). Alternatively, the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage may be increased to match the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage if the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage would otherwise exceed the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Generally, a supply voltage may be a voltage provided to a circuit to power the circuit, providing the electrical energy to permit the circuit to generate one or more outputs responsive to one or more inputs. At various points herein, supply voltages may be referred to as being greater than or less than other supply voltages. That is, the magnitude of the voltage may be greater than (or less than) the magnitude of the other voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a block diagram of one embodiment of a memory circuit <b>14</b>A is shown. The memory circuit <b>14</b>A may be one of the memory circuits <b>14</b>. Other memory circuits <b>14</b> may be similar. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the memory circuit <b>14</b>A includes a level shifter circuit <b>20</b>, a set of word line driver circuits <b>22</b>, a memory array <b>24</b>, a clock gater circuit <b>26</b>, and a control signal generator circuit <b>28</b>. The level shifter <b>20</b> and the word line drivers <b>22</b> are supplied by the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage. The memory array <b>24</b> and the control signal generator <b>28</b> are supplied by both the V<sub>M </sub>and the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltages. The clock gater <b>26</b> is supplied by the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage. The level shifter <b>20</b> and the clock gater <b>26</b> are coupled to receive a clock input (gclk) and one or more enable inputs (En) from the logic circuits <b>12</b>. The clock gater <b>26</b> is configured to generate a clock output (clk) to the word line drivers <b>22</b> and the level shifter <b>20</b> is also configured to generate a clock output (clk_e) to the word line drivers <b>22</b>. The word line drivers <b>22</b> are further coupled to receive one or more address inputs (Addr inputs) from the logic circuits <b>12</b>. The word line drivers <b>22</b> are configured to generate a set of word lines to the memory array <b>24</b> (WL<b>0</b> . . . WLN). The memory array <b>24</b> is further coupled to receive data (Din) and provide data (Dout) to/from the logic circuits <b>12</b>. Additionally, the memory array <b>24</b> is coupled to receive various control signals from the control signal generator <b>28</b>. For example, the control signals may include a write enable (WE) signal and a read enable (RE) signal. The control signal may also include a precharge (PChg) signal, and any other desired control signals. The control signal generator <b>28</b> may generate the control signals for the memory array <b>24</b> from corresponding control inputs from the logic circuits <b>12</b>, and may level shift control signals, in some embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The memory array <b>24</b> may comprise a plurality of memory cells that are supplied by the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage. However, the memory circuit <b>14</b>A is designed to provide for access to the memory array <b>24</b> by the logic circuits <b>12</b>, even if the logic circuits <b>12</b> are supplied with a V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage that is less than the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage. Each memory cell is activated for access (read or write) by one of the word lines WL<b>0</b> . . . WLN coupled to that memory cell. One or more memory cells coupled to the same word line form a &#x201c;word&#x201d; for access in the memory array <b>24</b>. That is, the bits of the word may be read/written as a group. The width of the word may thus be the width of the Din and Dout signals from the memory array <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Since the memory cells are supplied by the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage, the word lines may also be supplied by the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage. That is, when a word line is asserted high, the word line may be at approximately a V<sub>M </sub>voltage. Thus, the word line drivers <b>22</b> are supplied with the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The word line drivers <b>22</b> activate a given word line based on address inputs from the logic circuits <b>12</b>. The address identifies the word in the memory array <b>24</b> to be accessed for a given access generated by the logic circuits <b>12</b>. In some embodiments, the logic circuits <b>12</b> may include circuits that partially or fully decode the address, and the address inputs may be the partially or fully decoded address. Alternatively, the word line drivers <b>22</b> may implement the full decode function and the address inputs may encode the address. Generally, each different address causes a different word line WL<b>0</b> to WLN to be asserted.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Since the word line drivers <b>22</b> are supplied with the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage, inputs to the word line drivers <b>22</b> that are coupled to the gates of p-type metal oxide semiconductor (PMOS) transistors in the word line drivers <b>22</b> may be driven to a V<sub>M </sub>voltage when driven high (to ensure that the PMOS transistors, which are supplied with a V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage, are fully turned off when the gate is driven high). That is, if the gate of the PMOS transistor is driven to a voltage less than the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage on its source, the gate to source voltage of the PMOS transistor is still negative and thus the PMOS transistor may still be active even though it is logically intended to be inactive. If the word line drivers <b>22</b> were designed with static complementary MOS (CMOS) circuits, each input would be coupled to the gate of a PMOS transistor and would be driven to a V<sub>M </sub>voltage when driven high. In one embodiment, the word line drivers <b>22</b> may be implemented with dynamic logic gates. Thus, the clock signal that precharges the circuit (clk_e) is coupled to the gate of a PMOS transistor and may be driven to a V<sub>M </sub>voltage. Other signals, coupled to the gates of n-type MOS (NMOS) transistors, may be driven with the V<sub>L </sub>voltage. Thus, the address inputs from the logic circuits <b>12</b> may be provided directly to the word line drivers <b>22</b> (without level shifting). Additionally, the clk signal from the clock gater <b>26</b> (supplied with the V<sub>L </sub>voltage and thus driven to the V<sub>L </sub>voltage when driven high) may be provided directly to the word line drivers <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The level shifter <b>20</b> is configured to generate the clk_e signal responsive to the gclk signal and the En signal. If the En signal (or signals) indicate that the clock is enabled for the current clock cycle, the level shifter <b>20</b> may generate the clk_e signal by level shifting the gclk signal such that the high assertion of the clk_e signal is at a V<sub>M </sub>voltage. If the En signal (or signals) indicate that the clock is disabled, the level shifter <b>20</b> may hold the clk_e signal steady at a low level (ground). In other implementations, the level shifter <b>20</b> may hold the clk_e signal steady at a high level (V<sub>M</sub>) if the En signal (or signals) indicate that the clock is disabled. The gclk signal, provided from the logic circuits <b>12</b>, may be at a V<sub>L </sub>voltage when asserted high.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Generally, a level shifter circuit may be a circuit configured to level shift an input signal to produce an output signal. Level shifting a signal may refer to changing the high assertion of the signal from one voltage to another. Level shifting may be performed in either direction (e.g. the voltage after level shifting may be higher or lower than the voltage before level shifting). In some embodiments, the low assertion may remain the ground voltage supplied to the integrated circuit <b>10</b> (not shown in the figures, often referred to as V<sub>ss</sub>). A signal that is driven to a high assertion equal to a given supply voltage may be referred to as in the &#x201c;domain&#x201d; of that supply voltage or &#x201c;referenced to&#x201d; that supply voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">While the present embodiment provides enable signals and the level shifter <b>20</b> has a clock gating function in addition to a level shifting function, other embodiments may not include the enable signals and may unconditionally generate the output signal from the input signals. Furthermore, in other embodiments, a level shifter <b>20</b> that does not integrate the enable/disable function may be used with a clock gater similar to clock gater <b>26</b>. The output of a clock gater may be level shifted by such a level shifter, for example. Furthermore, a level shifter <b>20</b> that does not implement the enable/disable function may be used without a clock gater <b>26</b> (e.g. for control signal generation in the control signal generator <b>28</b>). Additionally, other embodiments may employ other constructions of the word line drivers <b>22</b> and additional signals input to the word line drivers <b>22</b> may be level shifted.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The clock gater <b>26</b> generates the clk signal responsive to the En signal (or signals) and the gclk signal (similar to the discussion above for the level shifter). If the En signal (or signals) indicate that the clock is enabled for the current clock cycle, the clock gater <b>26</b> may generate the clk signal responsive to the gclk signal. If the En signal (or signals) indicate that the clock is disabled, the clock gater <b>26</b> may hold the clk signal steady at a low level (ground). In other implementations, the clock gater <b>26</b> may hold the clk signal steady at a high level (V<sub>L</sub>) if the En signal (or signals) indicate that the clock is disabled. In other embodiments, the clock gater <b>26</b> may be eliminated and the clk_e signal may be used in place of the clk signal in the word line drivers <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In some embodiments, the delay through the level shifter <b>20</b> may be approximately the same as the delay through the clock gater <b>26</b>. In such embodiments, the impact of the level shifter <b>20</b> on the critical timing path of the integrated circuit <b>10</b> (if any) may be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As mentioned above, the memory circuit <b>14</b>A is designed to provide read/write access to the memory array <b>24</b> even if the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage is higher than the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage. The level shifter <b>20</b> level-shifting input signals and the word line drivers <b>22</b> operating at the V<sub>M </sub>voltage provide the start of an access. The Din and Dout signals provide the data in (for a write) or the data out (for a read), and thus are in the V<sub>L </sub>domain used by the logic circuits <b>12</b> in this embodiment. The memory array <b>24</b> may also be supplied with the V<sub>L </sub>voltage, and may be configured to operate with the Din and Dout signals in the V<sub>L </sub>domain. In other embodiments, the Din and Dout signals may be level shifted between the V<sub>L </sub>and V<sub>M </sub>domains, or only the Din signals may be level shifted and the Dout signals may be in the V<sub>M </sub>domain.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In one embodiment, at least the sense amplifier (senseamp) circuits in the memory array <b>24</b> that sense the bits read from the memory cells are supplied with the V<sub>L </sub>voltage.

In another embodiment, the senseamp circuits may be supplied with the V<sub>M </sub>voltage and the Dout signals may be in the V<sub>M </sub>domain. In another implementation, the bit lines coupled to the memory cells to communicate the bits into and out of the memory cells may be in the V<sub>L </sub>domain and thus other circuitry that is coupled to the bit lines may be supplied with the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage (except for the memory cells themselves).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As mentioned previously, signals in the V<sub>L </sub>domain that are coupled to the gates of PMOS transistors that are supplied by the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage may be level shifted.

The control signal generator <b>28</b> may provide the level shifting, as needed, in various embodiments. If a given control signal is not level shifted, the control signal generator <b>28</b> may generate the control signal using circuitry supplied by the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a circuit diagram of a portion of one embodiment of the memory array <b>24</b> is shown. The portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may correspond to bit <b>0</b> of the Din and Dout signals (shown as Din<b>0</b> and Dout<b>0</b>, respectively, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Other portions similar to the portion shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may be implemented for other bits in the Din/Dout word. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the memory array <b>24</b> includes bit line driver circuits <b>30</b>, memory cells <b>32</b>A-<b>32</b>N, a bit line precharge circuit <b>34</b>, a bit line hold circuit <b>36</b>, and a senseamp <b>38</b>. The memory cells <b>32</b>A-<b>32</b>N are supplied with the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage. The bit line drivers <b>30</b>, the bit line precharge circuit <b>34</b>, the bit line hold circuit <b>36</b>, and the senseamp <b>38</b> are supplied by the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage. The bit line drivers <b>30</b>, the memory cells <b>32</b>A-<b>32</b>N, the bit line precharge circuit <b>34</b>, the bit line hold circuit <b>36</b>, and the senseamp <b>38</b> are coupled to a pair of bit lines (BL and BL bar, the latter labeled as BL with a bar over it in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). The memory cell <b>32</b>A is coupled to word line WL<b>0</b>, and the memory cell <b>32</b>N is coupled to the word line WLN. Other memory cells, not explicitly shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> but indicated by the ellipses between the memory cells <b>32</b>A and <b>32</b>N, are coupled to other word lines. The bit line precharge circuit <b>34</b> is coupled to a precharge input signal (PChg in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) that is in the V<sub>L </sub>domain in the present embodiment. The bit line drivers <b>30</b> are coupled to receive the Din<b>0</b> signal and the write enable (WE) signal. The senseamp <b>38</b> is coupled to the Dout<b>0</b> signal and the read enable (RE) signal.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The memory cell <b>32</b>A is shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and the other memory cells such as memory cell <b>32</b>N may be similar. The memory cell <b>32</b>A in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes a typical CMOS SRAM cell comprising cross-coupled inverters <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>B coupled to the bit lines through NMOS transistors T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2</sub>. In some embodiments, the transistors in the memory cells <b>32</b>A-<b>32</b>N may be high V<sub>T </sub>transistors. The gates of the transistors T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2 </sub>are coupled to the word line WL<b>0</b>. Accordingly, when the word line WL<b>0</b> is asserted high, the transistors T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2 </sub>provide a conductive path between the inverters <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>B and the bit lines. Since the word lines are in the V<sub>M </sub>domain, the transistors T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2 </sub>may have a resistance, when activated, as designed for the memory array <b>24</b>. The resistance is related to the gate to source voltage of the transistors T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2</sub>. The resistance of the transistors T<sub>1 </sub>and T<sub>2</sub>, as compared to transistors in the inverters <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>B which are also powered with the V<sub>M </sub>voltage, may scale with the V<sub>M </sub>voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Generally, the bit lines may be used to transfer a bit into and out of a memory cell <b>32</b>A-<b>32</b>N that is activated using the corresponding word line. The bit lines represent the bit differentially, with BL being the true value of the bit and BL bar being the complement of the bit.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">To perform a write operation, the bit line drivers <b>30</b> may be activated by asserting the WE signal. The bit line drivers <b>30</b> drive the Din<b>0</b> bit on the BL line, and the complement of the Din<b>0</b> bit on the BL bar line. The write of the memory cell <b>32</b>A-<b>32</b>N may primarily be accomplished by the bit line that is driven low, and thus driving the bit lines in the V<sub>L </sub>domain may be sufficient to reliably write the memory cell. For example, if the memory cell <b>32</b>A is currently storing a binary 1 and is being written to a zero, the bit line drivers <b>30</b> drive the BL line low and the BL bar line to V<sub>L</sub>. The PMOS transistor in the inverter <b>40</b>B is attempting to hold the output of the inverter <b>40</b>B at a logical one (V<sub>M </sub>voltage). The bit line drivers <b>30</b> are designed to overdrive the transistors in the inverters <b>40</b>A-<b>40</b>B, and thus the output of the inverter <b>40</b>B (input of the inverter <b>40</b>A) is driven toward zero. The output of the inverter <b>40</b>A switches to a binary one as well, disabling the PMOS transistor in the inverter <b>40</b>B and completing the flip of the memory cell <b>32</b>A. Thus, in the illustrated embodiment, the WE signal and the Din<b>0</b> signal may not be level shifted to the V<sub>M </sub>domain.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In other embodiments, the bit lines may be in the V<sub>M </sub>domain. The bit line drivers <b>30</b> may be dynamic, or may receive level-shifted Din<b>0</b> and WE signals in such embodiments. The bit line drivers <b>30</b> may further be supplied by the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage in such embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For read operations, the bit lines may be precharged prior to activating a memory cell <b>32</b>A-<b>32</b>N via a corresponding word line. The activated memory cell <b>32</b>A-<b>32</b>N discharges one of the bit lines based on the stored value of the memory cell, and the senseamp <b>38</b> detects the differential between the bit lines and amplifies the differential to produce the output bit Dout<b>0</b>. Since a differential is being sensed, as long as the bit lines are balanced at about the same voltage prior to the start of the read, the correct value may be read. Accordingly, operating the bit lines in the V<sub>L </sub>domain may also be sufficient for read operations. In other embodiments, if the bit lines are in the V<sub>M </sub>domain (e.g. if the bit line precharge circuit <b>34</b> and the bit line hold circuit <b>36</b> are supplied with the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage), the senseamp <b>38</b> may provide the level shifting of the signals back to the Dout<b>0</b> signal in the V<sub>L </sub>domain. In still other embodiments, the Dout<b>0</b> signal may be in the V<sub>M </sub>domain and the senseamp <b>38</b> may also be powered by the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The senseamp <b>38</b> may comprise any sense amplifier circuit that is coupled to receive a pair of bit lines and sense a differential between the pair to drive an output bit. In other embodiments, the senseamp <b>38</b> may output a differential pair of bits with full signal swing, amplified from the sensed differential on the bit lines. For example, a differential of about 100 millivolts on the bit lines may be sufficient for the senseamp <b>38</b> to detect the difference. The senseamp <b>38</b> in the illustrated embodiment is controlled by the RE signal. In the illustrated embodiment, the RE signal is not level shifted to the V<sub>M </sub>domain. In other embodiments in which the senseamp <b>38</b> is supplied with the V<sub>M </sub>voltage, the RE signal may be level shifted to the V<sub>M </sub>domain if it is coupled to one or more PMOS transistors in the senseamp <b>38</b> that are also coupled to the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The bit line precharge circuit <b>34</b> is supplied by the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage, and may precharge the bit lines responsive to the assertion (low) of the PChg signal to prepare the bit lines for a read. In the illustrated embodiment, the bit line precharge circuit <b>34</b> may comprise PMOS transistors having their gates coupled to the precharge signal. The PMOS transistors shown vertically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> may precharge the bit lines, and the horizontal PMOS transistor may provide balancing of the voltage on the bit lines. In other embodiments, two bit line precharge circuits may be used. One bit line precharge circuit may be used if the previous operation was a read, since the bit lines are not fully discharged in a read operation. Both precharge circuits may be used if the previous operation was a write, to precharge the bit line that was fully (or almost fully) discharged to a voltage near ground. As mentioned previously, in other embodiments the bit line precharge circuit <b>34</b> may be supplied by the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage and the PChg signal may be level shifted to the V<sub>M </sub>domain in such embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The bit line hold circuit <b>36</b> may be provided to hold the precharge on one of the bit lines during a read or write operation responsive to the other bit line falling.

In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the level shifter <b>20</b><i>a </i>includes a shifting stage comprising transistors T<sub>3</sub>-T<sub>9 </sub>and an output inverter comprising transistors T<sub>10</sub>-T<sub>13</sub>. T<sub>3 </sub>has a source coupled to the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage, a gate coupled to a node N<b>1</b>, and a drain coupled to the source of T<sub>4</sub>. The gates of T<sub>4 </sub>and T<sub>5 </sub>are coupled to the gclk signal, and the drains of T<sub>4</sub>, T<sub>5</sub>, and T<sub>6 </sub>are coupled to the node N<b>2</b>. The sources of T<sub>5 </sub>and T<sub>6 </sub>are coupled to ground. The gate of T<sub>6 </sub>is coupled to an inversion of the En signal, output from the inverter <b>50</b>. The output of the inverter <b>50</b> and the gclk signal are inputs to a NOR gate <b>52</b>, which has its output coupled to the gates of T<sub>8 </sub>and T<sub>9</sub>. The source of T<sub>9 </sub>is coupled to ground. The drains of T<sub>8 </sub>and T<sub>9 </sub>are coupled to the node N<b>1</b>. The source of T<sub>8 </sub>is coupled to the drain of T<sub>7</sub>, which has its source coupled to the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage. The gate of the transistor T<sub>7 </sub>is coupled to the node N<b>2</b>. The node N<b>1</b> is the output of the shift stage and supplies the input to the output inverter. The gates of T<sub>11 </sub>and T<sub>12 </sub>are coupled to the node N<b>1</b>, and the drains of T<sub>11 </sub>and T<sub>12 </sub>are coupled to the clk_e signal. The source of T<sub>11 </sub>is coupled to the drain of T<sub>10</sub>, which has its source coupled to the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage and its gate coupled to the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage. The source of T<sub>12 </sub>is coupled to the drain of T<sub>13</sub>, which has its source coupled to ground. The gate of T<sub>13 </sub>is coupled to the V<sub>L </sub>supply voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Operation of the shift stage will first be described. For simplicity, the En signal will be assumed asserted to indicate enabled (and thus T<sub>6 </sub>is disabled and the NOR gate <b>52</b> passes the inversion of the gclk signal). When gclk transitions from low to high, T<sub>5 </sub>is activated and begins discharging node N<b>2</b>. T<sub>4 </sub>is also deactivated by the gclk transition, isolating the node N<b>2</b> from T<sub>3</sub>. As the node N<b>2</b> discharges, T<sub>7 </sub>activates and begins charging node N<b>1</b> to the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage (T<sub>8 </sub>is also activated, and T<sub>9 </sub>is deactivated, by the transition to low on the output of the NOR gate <b>52</b> due to the transition high of the gclk signal). Accordingly, N<b>1</b> results in the same logical state as the gclk signal, at the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage. When gclk transitions from high to low, the output of the NOR gate transitions from low to high and T<sub>9 </sub>is activated. T<sub>9 </sub>begins discharging the node N<b>1</b>. T<sub>8 </sub>is also deactivated by the gclk transition, isolating the node N<b>1</b> from T<sub>7</sub>. Thus, the node N<b>1</b> is discharged to ground. As the node N<b>1</b> discharges, T<sub>3 </sub>activates and begins charging node N<b>2</b> to the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage (T<sub>4 </sub>is also activated by the transition to low of gclk), thus deactivating T<sub>7</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">T<sub>4 </sub>and T<sub>8 </sub>may limit power dissipation during transition, by isolating the nodes N<b>2</b> and N<b>1</b>, respectively, from T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>7</sub>, respectively. T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>7 </sub>may be delayed in deactivating with respect to the activation of T<sub>5 </sub>and T<sub>9</sub>, respectively, since T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>7 </sub>are deactivated through the charging of nodes N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b>, respectively. By isolating T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>7 </sub>from their respective nodes N<b>2</b> and N<b>1</b> when T<sub>5 </sub>and T<sub>9 </sub>are activated, T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>7 </sub>may be prevented from fighting the discharge of their respective nodes N<b>2</b> and N<b>1</b>. T<sub>4 </sub>and T<sub>8 </sub>are optional and may be deleted in other embodiments. In such embodiments, the drains of T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>7 </sub>may be coupled to the drains of T<sub>5 </sub>and T<sub>9</sub>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In this embodiment, the level shifter <b>20</b><i>a </i>also provides clock gating functionality via the enable signal. If the enable signal is deasserted (low), T<sub>6 </sub>is activated via the output of the inverter <b>50</b> and T<sub>8 </sub>is activated via the output of the NOR gate <b>52</b>. T<sub>6 </sub>discharges node N<b>2</b> (which activates T<sub>7</sub>). T<sub>7 </sub>and T<sub>8 </sub>in series charge node N<b>1</b>. T<sub>3 </sub>is deactivated as the node N<b>1</b> is charged. Thus, the output node N<b>1</b> may be held steady at the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage if the enable signal is deasserted, independent of the state of the gclk signal. In other embodiments, the level shifter <b>20</b><i>a </i>may not implement clock gating. In such embodiments, T<sub>6 </sub>and the inverter <b>50</b> may be eliminated, and the NOR gate <b>52</b> may be replaced by an inverter having the gclk signal as an input.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The output inverter provides output buffering, which may permit the transistors T<sub>3</sub>-T<sub>9 </sub>to be smaller.

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> provides an inversion of the gclk to the clk_e signals. That is, the gclk and clk_e signals may be approximately 180 degrees out of phase (where the delay through the level shifter <b>20</b><i>a </i>may account for the signals being somewhat less than 180 degrees out of phase). The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an example of a second embodiment of the level shifter <b>20</b> (level shifter <b>20</b><i>b</i>) that provides a clk_e approximately in phase with the gclk signal (but lagging due to the delay of the level shifter <b>20</b><i>b</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes a shift stage comprising T<sub>3</sub>-T<sub>5 </sub>and T<sub>7</sub>-T<sub>9 </sub>and an output inverter comprising T<sub>10</sub>-T<sub>13</sub>. T<sub>3</sub>-T<sub>5</sub>, T<sub>7</sub>-T<sub>9</sub>, and T<sub>10</sub>-T<sub>13 </sub>are coupled to each other and to the nodes N<b>1</b> and N<b>2</b> in a manner similar to the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.

Comments regarding portions that are optional may be similar to the description of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> as well. However, the gates of T<sub>4 </sub>and T<sub>5 </sub>are coupled to receive an inversion of the gclk signal, instead of the gclk signal, when the En signal is asserted (through a NAND gate <b>54</b>). The output of the NAND gate <b>54</b> is inverted via the inverter <b>56</b>, the output of which is coupled to the gates of T<sub>8 </sub>and T<sub>9</sub>. Accordingly, the node N<b>1</b> transitions low if the gclk signal transitions high and the node N<b>1</b> transitions high if the gclk transitions low. The output clk_e is the inversion of the node N<b>1</b>, and thus is approximately in phase with the gclk signal (lagging by the delay of the level shifter <b>20</b><i>b</i>). If the enable signal is deasserted, the output of the NAND gate <b>54</b> is high and the output of the inverter <b>56</b> is low, thus holding the node N<b>1</b> steady at the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage (and the clk_e at the ground voltage) independent of the gclk signal. Embodiments of the level shifter <b>20</b><i>b </i>that do not implement clock gating may replace the NAND gate <b>54</b> with an inverter (or may eliminate the NAND gate <b>54</b> and may couple the node N<b>2</b> to the output inverter stage).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a circuit diagram of one embodiment of a word line driver <b>22</b>A, which may be one of the word line drivers <b>22</b>.

The word line driver <b>22</b>A illustrates one embodiment of a dynamic circuit for driving the word line WL<b>0</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, the word line driver <b>22</b>A includes transistors T<sub>14</sub>-T<sub>18 </sub>and an inverter <b>60</b> supplied by the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage. T<sub>14 </sub>has a source coupled to the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage, a gate coupled to the clk_e clock signal from the level shifter <b>20</b>, and a drain coupled to the node N<b>3</b>. T<sub>15</sub>-T<sub>17 </sub>are coupled in series, with T<sub>15 </sub>having its drain coupled to the node N<b>3</b> and T<sub>17 </sub>having its source coupled to ground. The gates of T<sub>15 </sub>and T<sub>16 </sub>are coupled to receive address inputs A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>, and the gate of T<sub>17 </sub>is coupled to the clk clock signal from the clock gater <b>26</b>.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The word line driver <b>22</b>A is a dynamic NAND gate in this embodiment. Thus, T<sub>14 </sub>precharges the node N<b>3</b> in response to a deassertion of clk_e, and is deactivated in response to an assertion of clk_e. Since clk_e has been level shifted to the V<sub>M </sub>domain, the assertion of clk_e is to the V<sub>M </sub>voltage and thus T<b>14</b> may be fully deactivated while clk_e is asserted.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">While clk_e is asserted, clk may be asserted to cause an evaluation of the dynamic NAND gate. If both of the A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> inputs are asserted, the transistors T<sub>15</sub>-T<sub>17 </sub>discharge the node N<b>3</b> and the word line WL<b>0</b> is asserted (driven to the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage by the inverter <b>60</b>). If one or both of A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> inputs are deasserted, the node N<b>3</b> is not discharged and the word line WL<b>0</b> is not asserted. T<sub>18 </sub>may serve as a keeper if the node N<b>3</b> is not discharged, preventing the node N<b>3</b> from floating.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Since the clk clock signal and the inputs A<b>1</b>-A<b>2</b> are not coupled to PMOS transistors (and thus do not require V<sub>M </sub>voltage level to ensure that a PMOS is deactivated when the PMOS's source is coupled to the V<sub>M </sub>supply voltage), the clk clock signal and the A<b>1</b>-A<b>2</b> inputs may be in the V<sub>L </sub>domain.</p>
