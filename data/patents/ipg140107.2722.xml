<heading id="h-0003" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to methods of using an endothelin<sub>B </sub>(ET<sub>B</sub>) receptor agonist, such as IRL-1620, for the treatment of stroke and cerebrovascular accidents caused, for example, by thrombosis; embolism, or hemorrhage. The ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist can be used alone or in combination with a thrombolytic agent, like tissue plasminogen activator, or an ET<sub>A </sub>antagonist, or an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, like erythropoietin, darbepoetin, and epoetin alfa, or an oxygen carrier, like a hemoglobin-based blood substitute and a perfluorocarbon-based blood substitute. Other neuroprotective agents that can be used in combination with the ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist include argatroban, alfimeprase, tenecteplase, ancrod, sildenafil, insulin and its growth factor, magnesium sulfate, human serum albumin, caffeinol (combination of caffeine and alcohol), microplasmin, statins, eptifibatide, tinzaparin, enecadin, citicoline, edaravone, cilostazol, or hypothermia. Using an ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist, alone or in combination with an existing neuroprotective agent, provides blood supply, oxygenation, and reduces damage to brain cells.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The discovery of endothelin-1 (ET-1), a 21-amino acid peptide, has helped improve knowledge of local regulation of vascular tone by blood vessels (M. Yanagisawa et al. (1988) <i>Nature </i>332(6163):411-5). ET-1 is generated in endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells via conversion of proET-1 to ET-1 in the presence of endothelin converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1). This conversion from proET-1 to ET-1 is essential for optimal vasoconstrictor activity of ET-1 (M. Yanagisawa et al. (1988) <i>Nature </i>332(6163):411-5 and G. D. Johnson et al. (1999) <i>J Biol Chem </i>274(7):4053-8).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">ET-1 is released from cultured endothelial cells at a slow basal rate. Due to a high vasoconstrictor potency and long lasting action, the continuous release of small amounts of ET-1 from endothelial cells towards the underlying smooth muscle cells may contribute to the maintenance of vascular tone and blood pressure (T. Miyauchi et al. (1999) <i>Annu Rev Physiol </i>61:391-415). Under physiological conditions, the basal tone maintained by ET-1 is balanced by the release of endothelium derived relaxing factor (EDRF or nitric oxide and prostacyclin) and vasoconstrictor substances (thromboxane) (E. L. Schiffrin (1994) <i>Clin Invest Med </i>17(6):602-20 and P. B. Persson (1996) <i>Physiol Rev </i>76(1):193-244).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">ET and its axis (ET-1, ET-2, ET-3, ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B </sub>receptors) have triggered considerable efforts to develop ET receptor antagonists having therapeutic potential in treating diseases like hypertension, heart failure, renal diseases, and cancer (A. Gulati et al. (1992) <i>Drug Develop Res </i>26:361-387; A. Gulati et al. (1997) <i>Neuropeptides </i>31(4) 301-9; G. Remuzzi et al. (2002) <i>Nat Rev Drug Discov </i>1(12):986-1001; J. Nelson et al. (2003) <i>Nat Rev Cancer </i>3(2):110-6; and A. Gulati et al. (2004) <i>J Cardiovasc Pharmacol </i>44:S483-S486). Several ET<sub>A </sub>receptor antagonists, e.g., atrasentan, avosentan, clazosentan, darusentan, sitaxsentan, and ZD4054, are in mid to late stage clinical trial. Bosentan, a non-specific ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B </sub>receptor antagonist, has been marketed for a few years, and ambrisentan (ET<sub>A </sub>receptor antagonist) recently was approved for sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a once-daily treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Intense efforts are devoted to develop ET<sub>A </sub>receptor antagonists. However, virtually no effort has been expended to develop ET agonists as therapeutic agents. The first proposed therapeutic use of an ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist resulted from a discovery that IRL-1620, a potent ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist, selectively enhanced breast tumor perfusion in rats (A. Rai et al. (2003) <i>Cancer Chemother Pharmacol </i>51(1):21-8; A. Gulati (2003) U.S. Patent Publication 2004/0138121; and A. Gulati (2006) U.S. Patent Publication 2006/0211617). Administration of BQ788, a highly selective ET<sub>B </sub>receptor antagonist, blocked the tumor perfusion induced by IRL-1620 and confirmed the involvement of ET<sub>B </sub>receptors in tumor vasodilation (A. Rai et al. (2005) <i>J Pharm Pharmacol </i>57(7):869-76 and N. V. Rajeshkumar et al. (2005) <i>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment </i>94(3):237-247). The selective enhancement of tumor blood flow resulted in a greater percentage of infused paclitaxel reaching the tumor as compared to the normal tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In a study conducted in breast tumor rats, IRL-1620 administration prior to paclitaxel resulted in a significant reduction of tumor volume, as well as a 20% complete remission of tumors, compared to paclitaxel treated rats (A. Rai et al. (2005) <i>J Pharm Pharmacol </i>57(7):869-76. and N. V. Rajeshkumar et al. (2005) <i>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment </i>94(3):237-247). See United States Patent Publication Nos. 2004/0138121, 2006/0211617, 2006/0257362, and 2007/0032422.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention is directed to a new use for ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonists, including IRL-1620, in the treatment of stroke and other cerebrovascular accidents. In particular, it now has been found that an ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist significantly increases cerebral blood perfusion, which is a novel and unexpected finding.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">ETs are widely distributed throughout the body and are involved in a variety of physiological functions (A. Gulati et al. (1992) <i>Drug Develop Res </i>26:361-387 and J. Nelson et al. (2003) <i>Nat Rev Cancer </i>3(2):110-6). ETs exert their effects by binding to two distinct types of cell surface receptors, ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B </sub>ET<sub>A </sub>receptors have equal affinity for ET-1 and ET-2, and low affinity for ET-3. ET<sub>B </sub>receptors have equal affinity for ET-1, ET-2, and ET-3. Pharmacological evidence suggests that ET<sub>B </sub>receptors can be divided into two subtypes, i.e., ET<sub>B1 </sub>receptors present on endothelial cells and ET<sub>B2 </sub>receptors present on smooth muscle cells (D. P. Brooks et al. (1995) <i>J Cardiovasc Pharmacol </i>26 Suppl 3:S322-5 and A. Leite-Moreira et al. (2004) <i>Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol </i>287(3):H1194-9). Both ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B </sub>receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family (J. Nelson et al. (2003) <i>Nat Rev Cancer </i>3(2):110-6). ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B </sub>receptors located on vascular smooth muscle cells, produce vasoconstriction, whereas ET<sub>B </sub>receptors present on endothelial cells are mainly vasodilatory (G.

<p id="p-0012" num="0011">IRL-1620 (N-Succinyl-[Glu<sup>9</sup>, Ala<sup>11,15</sup>] Endothelin 1) is a synthetic analogue of ET-1, i.e., a fragment of ET-1 having amino acids 8-21 of ET-1. IRL-1620 is a highly selective endothelin B receptor agonist, being 120,000 times more selective to ET<sub>B </sub>receptors than to ET<sub>A </sub>receptors (M. Takai et al. (1992) <i>Biochem Biophys Res Commun </i>184(2):953-9). IRL-1620 has a molecular formula of C<sub>86</sub>H<sub>117</sub>N<sub>17</sub>O<sub>27 </sub>and a molecular weight of 1820.95. The molecular structure of IRL-1620, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is an amino acid sequence of Suc-Asp-Glu-Glu-Ala-Val-Tyr-Phe-Ala-His-Leu-Asp-Ile-Ile-Trp (SEQ ID NO:1).</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Pharmacological Effects of IRL-1620</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">IRL-1620, like endothelins, can produce both vasodilation and vasoconstriction. Interaction of IRL-1620 with ET<sub>B </sub>receptors on endothelial cells leads to vasodilation, whereas an interaction with ET<sub>B </sub>receptors on smooth muscle cells leads to vasoconstriction. Furthermore, primary activation of ET<sub>B </sub>receptors by IRL-1620 can lead to autocrine/paracrine ET-1 release that subsequently activates both ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B </sub>receptors (S. Noguchi, et al. (1996) <i>Br J Pharmacol </i>118(6):1397-402). Thus, the net effect of IRL-1620 is related to a number of factors, including the type of tissue, the species, and the physiological conditions. There have been a number of studies on pharmacological effects of IRL-1620 because it is a highly selective agonist of ET<sub>B </sub>receptors and often is used to delineate the role of ET<sub>B </sub>receptors in a given physiological situation. Some of these studies summarized below show that the vasoconstrictive effects of IRL-1620 are much less pronounced than those of ET-1. Other ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonists known to persons skilled in the art produce pharmacological effects similar to those of IRL-1620, with the net effect also being related to the ability of a specific compound to selectively agonize ET<sub>B </sub>receptors.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Systemic Hemodynamic Effects</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">IRL-1620 exhibits systemic hemodynamic effects, including transient vasodilation and sustained vasoconstriction, in anesthetized rats (B. Palacios et al. (1997) <i>Br Pharmacol </i>122(6):993-8 and S. W. Leung et al. (2002) <i>J Cardiovasc Pharmacol </i>39(4):533-43), in an open-chest rat model (M. E. Beyer et al. (1995) <i>J Cardiovasc Pharmacol </i>26 Suppl 3:S150-2), and in normal and cardiomyopathic hamsters (J. C. Honore et al. (2002) <i>Clin Sci </i>(<i>Lond</i>) 103 Suppl 48:280 S-283S). The vasoconstrictive effects of IRL-1620 are less pronounced compared to those of ET-1 (Palacios et al. (1997) <i>Br J Pharmacol </i>122(6):993-8; J. C. Honore et al. (2002) <i>Clin Sci </i>(<i>Lond</i>) 103 Suppl 48:280 S-283S; and S. W. Leung et al. (2002) <i>J Cardiovasc Pharmacol </i>39(4):533-43) and IRL-1620 had a positive inotropic effect (M. E. Beyer et al. (1995) <i>J Cardiovasc Pharmacol </i>26 Suppl 3:S150-2).</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Regional Hemodynamic Effects</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">IRL-1620 causes renal vasodilation in anesthetized dogs upon intrarenal arterial perfusion (T. Yukimura et al. (1994) <i>Eur J Pharmacol </i>264(3):399-405) and pulmonary vasodilation in neonatal lambs upon intrapulmonary arterial injection (J. Wong et al. (1995) <i>J Cardiovasc Pharmacol </i>25(2):207-15). A pulmonary vasodilatory effect of IRL-1620 also is observed in isolated perfused rat lungs (M. Muramatsu et al. (1999) <i>Am J Physiol </i>276(2 Pt 1):L358-64). Injection of IRL-1620 into the circumflex coronary artery of anesthetized goats does not cause coronary vasoconstriction, whereas ET-1 administered similarly caused coronary vasoconstriction (J. L. Garcia et al. (1996) <i>Eur J Pharmacol </i>315(2):179-86).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Effect on Respiratory Airway Smooth Muscles</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Intravenous administration of IRL-1620 to anesthetized, artificially-ventilated guinea pigs resulted in bronchoconstriction in a biphasic manner (S. Noguchi et al. (1996) <i>Br. J Pharmacol </i>118(6):1397-402). The second phase of bronchoconstriction probably is due to the activation of ET<sub>B </sub>receptors by IRL-1620 leading to autocrine/paracrine release of ET-1 that subsequently activated both ET<sub>A </sub>and ET<sub>B </sub>receptors (S. Noguchi et al. (1996) <i>Br J Pharmacol </i>118(6):1397-402).</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Experimental Studies on Human Tissues</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In vitro, IRL-1620 causes contraction of human internal mammary arterial segments, but not human radial arterial segments (J. J. Liu et al. (1996) <i>Clin Sci </i>(<i>Lond</i>) 90(2):91-6). The contractile effect of IRL-1620 on internal mammary arteries reached a maximum of 20% of that obtained with ET-1 or noradrenaline. Further increases in concentration of IRL-1620 caused relaxation of the contracted arteries. IRL-1620 also had a contractile effect on human bronchial rings in a biphasic manner (T. Takahashi et al. (1997) <i>Eur J Pharmacol </i>324(2-3):219-22).</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Clinical Studies</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">To date, IRL-1620 has not been administered to humans. However, a phase I, open label, ascending dose study of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of IRL-1620 in patients with recurrent or progressive carcinoma (NCT00613691) is ongoing. Furthermore, a number of human studies have been conducted with ET-1, a much more potent vasoconstrictive agent than IRL-1620, as demonstrated in animal studies (B. Palacios et al. (1997) <i>Br J Pharmacol </i>122(6):993-8 and S. W. Leung et al. (2002) <i>J Cardiovasc Pharmacol </i>39(4):533-43). Administration of ET-1 to human subjects by perfusion at doses ranging from 1 to 20 ng/kg/min caused dose-dependent systemic vasoconstriction and consequential changes in hemodynamic parameters (D. Kiely et al. (1997) <i>Cardiovasc Res </i>33(2):378-86; A. Franco-Cereceda et al. (1999) <i>Scand Cardiovasc J </i>33(3):151-6; and F. Kiefer et al. (2000) <i>Exp Clin Endocrinol Diabetes </i>108(5):378-81), but did not produce any serious adverse events.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Intravenous administration of ET-1 also causes coronary vasoconstriction (J. Pernow et al. (1996) <i>Circulation </i>94(9):2077-82). However, coronary vasoconstriction may not be expected with IRL-1620 in humans. It has been shown that, in human coronary arteries, ET<sub>B </sub>receptors are absent or present at very low levels, and therefore, would make minimal contribution toward coronary vasoconstriction (W. A. Bax et al. (1994) <i>Br J Pharmacol </i>113(4):1471-9; A. P. Davenport et al. (1995) <i>J Cardiovasc Pharmacol </i>26 Suppl 3:S265-7; A. P. Davenport et al. (1994) <i>Br J Pharmacol </i>111(1):4-6; W. A. Bax et al. (1993) <i>Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol </i>348(4):403-10; A. P. Davenport et al. (1995) <i>J Cardiovasc Pharmacol </i>22 Suppl 8:522-5; and O. Saetrum Opgaard et al. (1996) <i>Regul Pept </i>63(2-3):149-56).</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Human studies also were conducted with an endothelin agonist, sarafotoxin S6c, which is less selective for ET<sub>B </sub>receptors than IRL-1620. On infusion into brachial artery, sarafotoxin S6c showed less reduction in forearm blood flow compared to ET-1 (W. G Haynes et al. (1995) <i>Circulation </i>92(3): 357-63). Thus, any vasoconstrictive effects of IRL-1620 in humans are expected to be less than those observed with ET-1 and other endothelin agonists administered to humans to date.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Effect on Cerebral Blood Vessels</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Endothelin has been implicated in a number of cerebrovascular disorders, including subarachnoid hemorrhage (R. Suzuki et al. (1992) <i>J Neurosurg </i>77(1):96-100) and ischemic stroke (I. Ziv et al. (1992) <i>Stroke </i>23(7):1014-6). It has been found that ET<sub>A </sub>receptor antagonists relieve chronic cerebral vasospasm (M. Clozel et al. (1993) <i>Life Sci </i>52(9):825-34; S. Itoh et al. (1993) <i>Biochem Biophys Res Commun </i>195(2):969-75; H. Nirei et al. (1993) <i>Life Sci </i>52(23):1869-74; and R. N. Willette et al. (1994) <i>Stroke </i>25(12):2450-5; discussion 2456). Studies have been performed to characterize endothelin receptors in the cerebral blood vessels. ET<sub>A </sub>receptors were found to mediate contraction in human cerebral, meningeal, and temporal arteries (M. Adner et al. (1994) <i>J Auton Nerv Syst </i>49 Suppl:S117-24 and a marked ET<sub>B </sub>receptor-mediated relaxation was obtained with ET-3 when ET<sub>A </sub>receptor activity was blocked using FR139317 (IUPAC Name: (2R)-2-[[(2R)-2-[[(2S)-2-(azepane-1-carbonylamino)-4-methylpentanoyl]amino]-3-(1-methylindol-3-yl)propanoyl]amino]-3-pyridin-2-ylpropanoic acid) in precontracted human temporal arteries (G. A. Lucas, et al. (1996). <i>Peptides </i>17(7): 1139-44).</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Overall, a need still exists in the art to identify agents, or combinations of agents, that effectively treat strokes and other cerebrovascular accidents. To date, no report exists on the effect of IRL-1620 on cerebral circulation, and the present disclosure is the first reporting that IRL-1620 increases cerebral blood perfusion, as measured with laser-Doppler perfusion method.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">It has been estimated 40 million Americans will be age 65 or older in 2010. An aging population undoubtedly will result in an increased number of cases of chronic diseases, including coronary artery disease, heart failure, and stroke. In addition, an explosive increase in the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes has occurred, and related complications, like hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and atherosclerotic vascular disease, also are expected to increase.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Each year, about 700,000 people experience a new or recurrent stroke. About 500,000 are first attacks and about 200,000 are recurrent attacks. On average, someone in the United States has a stroke every 45 seconds. Also on average, every 3 to 4 minutes someone dies of a stroke. Of all strokes, 87% are ischemic. Intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage strokes account for the remainder. When considered separately from other cardiovascular diseases, stroke ranks third among all causes of death, behind diseases of the heart and cancer. From 1979 to 2004; the number of inpatient discharges from short-stay hospitals with stroke as the first listed diagnosis increased 21% to 906,000. The estimated direct and indirect cost of stroke for 2007 was $62.7 billion.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Each year, about 46,000 more women than men have a stroke. Male stroke incidence rates are greater than female rates at younger ages, but not at older ages. The male/female incidence was 1.25 in those 55 to 64 years of age, 1.50 in those 65 to 74 years of age, 1.07 in those 75 to 84 years of age, and 0.76 in those above 85 years of age. Among American Indians/Alaska natives age 18 and older, 5.1% have had a stroke. Among blacks or African Americans the rate was 3.2%, among whites the rate was 2.5%, and among Asians the rate was 2.4%.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the clot-dissolving drug tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) to treat strokes caused by blood clots, which cause about 80 percent of all strokes. tPA dissolves the clot and restores blood flow to the brain. tPA carries a risk of bleeding in the brain, but its benefits outweigh the risks when prescribed and administered properly.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">It now has been discovered that administration of an ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist, like IRL-1620, together with an optional, neuroprotective agent, like tissue plasminogen activator, can greatly reduce the neurological deficit in patients suffering from stroke by increasing blood perfusion and reducing damage to the brain.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The methods described herein benefit from the use of an ET<sub>B </sub>agonist and an optional neuroprotective agent useful in the treatment and management of strokes and other cerebrovascular accidents. The ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist and optional neuroprotective agent can be administered simultaneously or sequentially to achieve the desired effect.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The present invention therefore is directed to compositions and methods of treating strokes and other cerebrovascular accidents. The present invention also is directed to pharmaceutical compositions comprising an ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist and a second therapeutic agent useful in the treatment of strokes and other cerebrovascular accidents, e.g., a neuroprotective agent. Further provided are kits comprising an ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist and, optionally, a second therapeutic agent useful in the treatment of strokes and other cerebrovascular accidents, packaged separately or together, and an insert having instructions for using these active agents.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As demonstrated below, IRL-1620 increases cerebral blood perfusion and can be used to increase blood perfusion in patients suffering from stroke. IRL-1620 and other ET<sub>B </sub>agonists can be particularly useful in treating conditions, like cerebral ischemia, where an increase in cerebral blood flow can help in reducing the penumbra and can greatly reduce the neurological deficits due to stroke.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In accordance with the present invention, it has been found that a selective ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist, as exemplified by IRL-1620, can be used for the treatment of stroke and other cerebrovasuclar accidents. An ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist utilized in the present invention is not limited, and can be any ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist known in the art. Preferably, the ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist is selective for the ET<sub>B </sub>receptor, i.e., is more selective to ET<sub>B </sub>receptors than ET<sub>A </sub>receptors by a factor of at least 10<sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Specific examples of ET<sub>B </sub>agonists useful in the present invention include, but are not limited to, IRL-1620, ET-3, sarafotoxin 6c, BQ3020, Ala(1, 3, 11, 15)ET-1, and mixtures thereof. In particular, sarafotoxin 6c (i.e., SFT6C) has an amino acid sequence:</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Thus, in one embodiment, the present invention discloses a method of preventing or treating an individual suffering from a stroke or other cerebrovascular accident comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an ET<sub>B </sub>agonist to the individual. The stroke or cerebrovascular accident can be caused, for example, by thrombosis, embolism, or hemorrhage. In a preferred embodiment, the ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist comprises N-Succinyl-[Glu<sup>9</sup>, Ala<sup>11,15</sup>] Endothelin 1 (IRL-1620).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Pharmaceutical compositions containing the ET<sub>B </sub>agonist are suitable for administration to humans. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions are sterile, and contain no toxic, carcinogenic, or mutagenic compounds that would cause an adverse reaction when administered.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The method of the present invention can be accomplished using an ET<sub>B </sub>agonist. The ET<sub>B </sub>agonist can be administered as the neat compound, or as a pharmaceutical composition. Administration of the pharmaceutical composition, or neat ET<sub>B </sub>agonist, can be performed during or after the onset of stroke or other cerebrovascular accident.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The ET<sub>B </sub>agonists also can be administered in conjunction with one or more second therapeutic agent useful in the treatment of stroke or other cerebrovascular accident. The second therapeutic agent is different from an ET<sub>B </sub>agonist. The ET<sub>B </sub>agonist and second therapeutic agent can be administered simultaneously or sequentially. In addition, the ET<sub>B </sub>agonist and second therapeutic agent can be administered from a single composition or two separate compositions. Preferred second therapeutic agents comprise a neuroprotective agent.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Nonlimiting examples of second therapeutic agents include, neuroprotective agents like, but are not limited to, a thrombolytic agent (such as, but not limited to, tissue plasminogen activator), an ET<sub>A </sub>antagonist (such as, but not limited to, sulfosoxazole, clazosentan, atrasentan, tezosentan, bosentan, sitaxsentan, enrasentan, BMS 207940, BMS 193884, BMS 182874, J 104132, VML 588/Ro 61 1790, T-0115, TAK 044, BQ 788, TBC2576, TBC3214, PD180988, ABT 546, SB247083, RPR118031A, and BQ123), an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (such as erythropoietin, darbepoetin, and epoetin alfa), or an oxygen carrier (such as, a hemoglobin-based blood substitute or a perfluorocarbon based blood substitute). Other neuroprotective agents that can be administered in combination with the ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist include, but are not limited to, argatroban, alfimeprase, tenecteplase, ancrod, sildenafil, insulin and its growth factor, magnesium sulfate, human serum albumin, caffeinol (combination of caffeine and alcohol), microplasmin, statins, eptifibatide, tinzaparin, enecadin, citicoline, edaravone, cilostazol, hypothermia, or mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The neuroprotective agent is administered in an amount to provide its desired therapeutic effect. The effective dosage range for each neuroprotective agent is known in the art, and the neuroprotective agent is administered to an individual in need thereof within such established ranges.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist and the neuroprotective agent can be administered together as a single-unit dose or separately as multi-unit doses, wherein the ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist is administered before the neuroprotective agent or vice versa. One or more dose of the ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist and/or one or more dose of the neuroprotective agent can be administered. It is further contemplated that administration of the agents occurs within 30 minutes up to about one day (24 hours).</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">An ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist used in a method present invention can be administered in an amount of about 0.005 to about 500 micrograms per dose, about 0.05 to about 250 micrograms per dose, or about 0.5 to about 50 micrograms per dose. For example; the ET<sub>B </sub>agonist can be administered, per dose, in an amount of about 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5, 50, or 500 micrograms, including all doses between 0.005 and 500 micrograms.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Alternatively, the ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist can be administered in an amount of about 0.005 to about 50 micrograms per kilogram per min infusion, or from about 0.05 to about 5 micrograms per kilogram per min infusion. For example, the ET<sub>B </sub>agonist can be administered in an amount of about 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, 5, or 50 in micrograms per kilogram per min infusion.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The ET<sub>B </sub>agonist can be formulated in suitable excipients for oral administration or for parenteral administration. Such excipients are well known in the art. The ET<sub>B </sub>agonists typically are present in such a composition in an amount of about 0.1% to about 75% by weight of the composition.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The ET<sub>B </sub>agonists can be administered by any suitable route, for example by oral, buccal, inhalation, sublingual, rectal, vaginal, intracisternal or intrathecal through lumbar puncture, transurethral, nasal, percutaneous, i.e., transdermal, or parenteral (including intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intracoronary, intradermal, intramammary, intraperitoneal, intraarticular, intrathecal, retrobulbar, intrapulmonary injection and/or surgical implantation at a particular site) administration. Parenteral administration can be accomplished using a needle and syringe or using a high pressure technique.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The pharmaceutical compositions include those wherein the ET<sub>B </sub>agonist is administered in an effective amount to achieve its intended purpose. Determination of a therapeutically effective amount is well within the capability of those skilled in the art, especially in light of the detailed disclosure provided herein.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The exact formulation, route of administration, and dosage is determined by an individual physician in view of the patient's condition. Dosage amount and interval can be adjusted individually to provide levels of the ET<sub>B </sub>agonist that is sufficient to maintain therapeutic or prophylactic effects. The amount of pharmaceutical composition administered is dependent on the subject being treated, on the subject's weight, the severity of the affliction, the manner of administration, and the judgment of the prescribing physician.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Specifically, for administration to a human in the treatment of stroke or other cerebrovascular accident, oral dosages of an ET<sub>B </sub>agonist, individually generally are about 0.005 to about 500 micrograms daily for an average adult patient (70 kg), typically one dose per day or divided into two to three doses per day. Thus, for a typical adult patient, individual doses contain about 0.005 to about 500 micrograms ET<sub>B </sub>agonist, in a suitable pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle or carrier, for administration in single or multiple doses, once or several times per day. Dosages for intravenous, buccal, or sublingual administration typically are about 0.005 to about 250 micrograms/kg per single dose as required. In practice, the physician determines the actual dosing regimen that is most suitable for an individual patient, and the dosage varies with the age, weight, and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case, but there can be individual instances in which higher or lower dosages are merited, and such are within the scope of this invention.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The ET<sub>B </sub>agonists can be administered alone, or in admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice. Pharmaceutical compositions for use in accordance with the present invention thus can be formulated in a conventional manner using one or more physiologically acceptable carriers comprising excipients and auxiliaries that facilitate processing of the ET<sub>B </sub>agonists into preparations that can be used pharmaceutically.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">These pharmaceutical compositions can be manufactured in a conventional manner, e.g., by conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating, dragee-making, emulsifying, encapsulating, entrapping, or lyophilizing processes. Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of administration chosen. When a therapeutically effective amount of the ET<sub>B </sub>agonists are administered orally, the composition typically is in the form of a tablet, capsule, powder, solution, or elixir. When administered in tablet form, the composition additionally can contain a solid carrier, such as a gelatin or an adjuvant. The tablet, capsule, and powder contain about 1% to about 95% of an ET<sub>B </sub>agonist, and preferably from about 1% to about 50% ET<sub>B </sub>agonist. When administered in liquid form, a liquid carrier, such as water, petroleum, or oils of animal or plant origin, can be added. The liquid form of the composition can further contain physiological saline solution, dextrose or other saccharide solutions, or glycols. When administered in liquid form, the composition contains about 0.1% to about 90% by weight of ET<sub>B </sub>agonists, and preferably about 1% to about 50% of ET<sub>B </sub>agonists.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">When a therapeutically effective amount of the ET<sub>B </sub>agonist is administered by intravenous, cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection, the composition is in the form of a pyrogen-free, parenterally acceptable aqueous solution. The preparation of such parenterally acceptable solutions, having due regard to pH, isotonicity, stability, and the like, is within the skill in the art. A preferred composition for intravenous, cutaneous, or subcutaneous injection typically contains, an isotonic vehicle. Preferably, the ET<sub>B </sub>agonist or composition containing the ET<sub>B </sub>agonist is administered by intravenous or bolus injection, or infusion with other fluids over a 10-30 minute span or over several hours.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Suitable ET<sub>B </sub>agonists can be readily combined with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers well-known in the art. Such carriers enable the active agents to be formulated as tablets, pills, dragees, capsules, liquids, gels, syrups, slurries, suspensions and the like, for oral ingestion by a patient to be treated. Pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by adding the ET<sub>B </sub>agonist to a solid excipient, optionally grinding the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture of granules, after adding suitable auxiliaries, if desired, to obtain tablets or dragee cores. Suitable excipients include, for example, fillers and cellulose preparations. If desired, disintegrating agents can be added.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The ET<sub>B </sub>agonists can be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or continuous infusion. Formulations for injection can be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampules or in multidose containers, with an added preservative. The compositions can take such forms as suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and can contain formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing, and/or dispersing agents.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral administration include aqueous solutions of the active agent in water-soluble form. Additionally, suspensions of the ET<sub>B </sub>agonists can be prepared as appropriate oily injection suspensions. Suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles include fatty oils or synthetic fatty acid esters. Aqueous injection suspensions can contain substances which increase the viscosity of the suspension. Optionally, the suspension also can contain suitable stabilizers or agents that increase the solubility of the compounds and allow for the preparation of highly concentrated solutions. Alternatively, a present composition can be in powder form for constitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g., sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The ET<sub>B </sub>agonists also can be formulated in rectal compositions, such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g., containing conventional suppository bases. In addition to the formulations described previously, the ET<sub>B </sub>agonists also can be formulated as a depot preparation. Such long-acting formulations can be administered by implantation (for example, subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the ET<sub>B </sub>agonists can be formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example, as an emulsion in an acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In particular, the ET<sub>B </sub>agonists can be administered orally, buccally, or sublingually in the form of tablets containing excipients, such as starch or lactose, or in capsules or ovules, either alone or in admixture with excipients, or in the form of elixirs or suspensions containing flavoring or coloring agents. Such liquid preparations can be prepared with pharmaceutically acceptable additives, such as suspending agents. The ET<sub>B </sub>agonists also can be injected parenterally, for example, intravenously, intramuscularly, subcutaneously, or intracoronarily. For parenteral administration, the endothelin agonists are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which can contain other substances, for example, salts or monosaccharides, such as mannitol or glucose, to make the solution isotonic with blood.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">As an additional embodiment, the invention includes kits which comprise one or more compounds or compositions packaged in a manner that facilitates their use to practice methods of the invention. In one embodiment, the kit includes a compound or composition described herein as useful for practice of a method (e.g., a composition comprising an ET<sub>B </sub>agonist and an optional neuroprotective agent), packaged in a container, such as a sealed bottle or vessel, with a label affixed to the container or included in the kit that describes use of the compound or composition to practice the method of the invention. Preferably, the compound or composition is packaged in a unit dosage form. The kit further can include a device suitable for administering the composition according to the intended route of administration.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">It has been found that an ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist, like IRL-1620, can treat stroke and other cerebrovascular accidents. Tests and data herein show that ET<sub>B </sub>agonists are useful agents to treat stroke and other cerebrovascular accidents.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Experimental Procedures and Results</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">IRL-1620, a highly selective ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist, transiently increases tumor blood flow and has been shown to enhance tumor delivery and efficacy of anticancer drugs. A phase 1 clinical trial has recently begun for the use of IRL-1620 in patients with recurrent or progressive carcinoma.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Although known to increase tumor blood flow due to the unique structure of tumor vasculature, the effect of administration of IRL-1620 on other areas of the body that display distinctive vascular structures, specifically the cerebral blood vessels, has not been studied. The present studies were conducted to determine the alteration in cerebral blood flow caused by intravenous administration of the ET<sub>B </sub>receptor agonist IRL-1620.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Methods</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 323&#xb1;4 grams (g) were anesthetized with urethane (ethyl carbamate, Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.) dissolved in isotonic saline (0.9% NaCl, Hospira, Inc., Lake Forest, Ill.). The rats were administered a dose of 0.15 g per 100 g body weight via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Blood Pressure and Heart Rate: The femoral vein and artery were cannulated. The arterial cannula was connected to a Gould P23 ID pressure transducer for recording the blood pressure on a Grass P7D polygraph through a 7PI preamplifier. The heart rate was recorded through a 7P4B Grass tachograph, triggered from blood pressure signals. Drugs were administered via the venous cannula.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Cerebral Perfusion: A burr hole was drilled into the rat skull about 2 millimeters (mm) to the left of midline. Cerebrovascular perfusion was measured via a fiber optic probe (PF407) applied to the surface of the rat brain. The probe was connected to a Periflux PF2b 4000 Laser Doppler Flowmetry unit (Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Renal Perfusion: The right kidney was dissected retroperitoneally. Renal perfusion was measured via a fiber optic probe (PF408) applied to the surface of the rat kidney. The probe was connected to a Periflux PF2b 4000 Laser Doppler Flowmetry unit (Perimed, Stockholm, Sweden).</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Blood Gas Analysis: Arterial blood gases were monitored to determine the effects on pH, pCO2, and pO2. Blood was drawn from the arteriole cannula and analyzed using a GEM Premier 3000 unit (Instrument Laboratory, Lexington, Mass.).</p>
