<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present invention relates to a compressor and a refrigerating machine.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">Conventionally, there has been known a compressor which is used in a refrigerating machine and adapted for compressing refrigerant gas evaporated in an evaporator to convey the compressed refrigerant gas to a condenser (see, for example, Patent Document 1).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows a configuration of the compressor disclosed in Patent Document 1. The compressor disclosed in Patent Document 1 is a two-step-type screw compressor operable to compress the refrigerant gas including a chlorofluorocarbon or the like, in two steps. The compressor includes a pair of a first step screw rotors <b>101</b>, <b>102</b>, and a pair of second step screw rotors <b>103</b>, <b>104</b>. The respective screw rotors <b>101</b> to <b>104</b> are accommodated in a casing <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">The first screw rotors <b>101</b> and <b>102</b> are so arranged as to engage with each other in a first compression chamber <b>106</b><i>a </i>in the casing <b>106</b>. The second screw rotors <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> are so arranged as to engage with each other in a second compression chamber <b>106</b><i>b </i>in the casing <b>106</b>. A rotor shaft of the each screw rotors <b>101</b> to <b>104</b> is supported by a corresponding bearing <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">In the first compression chamber <b>106</b><i>a</i>, the first step screw rotors <b>101</b>, <b>102</b> rotate with engaging with each other, and thereby perform a first compression of the refrigerant gas. The compressed refrigerant gas is introduced in the second compression chamber <b>106</b><i>b</i>. In the compression chamber <b>106</b><i>b</i>, the second screw rotors <b>103</b> and <b>104</b> rotate with engaging with each other, and thereby perform a second compression of the refrigerant gas. The refrigerant gas to which the second compression is applied is discharged from the compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">A lubricating oil is supplied to the respective bearings <b>108</b>. A part of the supplied lubricating oil is included in the refrigerant gas and flows in the compressor, and is discharged from the compressor together with the refrigerant gas. The refrigerant gas and the lubricating oil discharged together are conveyed to an oil separator <b>110</b>. The oil separator <b>110</b> separates the refrigerant gas from the lubricating oil. The separated refrigerant gas is conveyed to the condenser, while the separated lubricating oil is cooled by an oil cooler <b>111</b>. The lubricating oil is then processed in an oil filter <b>112</b> which removes impurities in the separated lubricating oil, followed by being returned to the compressor to be again supplied to the respective bearings <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">The above compressor requires the oil separator <b>110</b> for separating the refrigerant gas from the lubricating oil discharged from the compressor together with the refrigerant gas. Therefore, there is a problem that the configuration of the compressor becomes complex. In addition, in the above compressor, chlorofluorocarbon is used as the refrigerant gas. This raises a concern that a harmful effect, such as a global warming, is given to the natural environment on its disposal. Further, in the above compressor, the respective bearings <b>108</b> are lubricated with the lubricating oil. This results in a problem that a troublesome waste oil treatment is required upon the disposal of the waste oil.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present invention will be described below referring to the drawings.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">First Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">First, a whole configuration of the refrigerating machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The refrigerating machine <b>1</b> of the first embodiment is used, for example, in a cooling device, such as an air conditioner. Here, water is used as a refrigerant in the refrigerating machine <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Specifically, the refrigerant machine <b>1</b> according to the first embodiment includes an evaporator <b>2</b>, a compressor <b>4</b>, a condenser <b>6</b>, a refrigerant introducing line <b>8</b>, a refrigerant deriving line <b>9</b>, a refrigerant supplying line <b>10</b>, a coolant supplying line <b>12</b>, a coolant returning line <b>14</b>, a cooling tower <b>16</b>, and a coolant pump <b>18</b>. The refrigerant is circulated in a refrigerant cycle comprised of the evaporator <b>2</b>, the compressor <b>4</b>, the condenser <b>6</b>, the refrigerant introducing line <b>8</b>, the refrigerant deriving line <b>9</b>, and the refrigerant supplying line <b>10</b>. Meanwhile, coolant water is circulated in a coolant cycle comprised of the condenser <b>6</b>, the coolant supplying line <b>12</b>, the coolant returning line <b>14</b>, the cooling tower <b>16</b>, and the coolant pump <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The evaporator <b>2</b> is adapted to evaporate water serving as the refrigerant (hereinafter, &#x201c;water refrigerant&#x201d;).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The compressor <b>4</b> is arranged between the evaporator <b>2</b> and the condenser <b>6</b>. Specifically, the compressor <b>4</b> is connected to the evaporator <b>2</b> through the refrigerant introducing line <b>8</b>, while being connected to the condenser <b>6</b> through the refrigerant deriving line <b>9</b>. The compressor <b>4</b> is adapted to compress water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas, which is evaporated in the evaporator <b>2</b> and conveyed from the evaporator <b>2</b> through the refrigerant introducing line <b>8</b>, to convey the compressed water vapor to the condenser <b>6</b> through the refrigerant deriving line <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The condenser <b>6</b> is adapted to cool the water vapor as the refrigerant gas conveyed from the compressor <b>4</b> with coolant water so as to condense the water vapor. The condenser <b>6</b> has a coolant introducing opening <b>6</b><i>a </i>and a coolant discharge opening <b>6</b><i>b</i>. The condenser <b>6</b> performs a direct heat exchange. Specifically, the condenser <b>6</b> makes the water vapor as the refrigerant gas introduced in the condenser <b>6</b> contact to the coolant water so as to cool the water vapor, thereby causing the cooled water vapor to be condensed. The condensed water made by this condensation is discharged from the condenser <b>6</b> along with coolant water. Accordingly, the coolant water flowing in the coolant cycle contacts with the refrigerant flowing in the refrigerant cycle, in the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The condenser <b>6</b> and the evaporator <b>2</b> are connected to each other by the refrigerant supplying line <b>10</b>. An internal pressure of the compressor <b>6</b> is higher than an internal pressure of the evaporator <b>2</b>. The difference between the pressure in the condenser <b>6</b> and the pressure in the evaporator <b>2</b> causes a part of water discharged from the condenser <b>6</b> to be conveyed to the evaporator <b>2</b> through the refrigerant supplying line <b>10</b> as the water refrigerant.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The coolant supplying line <b>12</b> is used for supplying the coolant water to the condenser <b>6</b>. The coolant returning line <b>14</b> is used for returning a part of the water discharged from the condenser <b>6</b> to the coolant supplying line <b>12</b>. One end of the coolant supplying line <b>12</b> connects to the coolant introducing opening <b>6</b><i>a </i>of the condenser <b>6</b>, and one end of the coolant returning line <b>14</b> connects to the coolant discharge opening <b>6</b><i>b </i>of the condenser <b>6</b>. Another end of the coolant returning line <b>14</b> connects to another end of the coolant supplying line <b>12</b> through the cooing tower <b>16</b>. This arrangement allows coolant water to be supplied from the cooling tower <b>16</b> through the coolant supplying line <b>12</b> to the condenser <b>6</b>. Subsequently, the coolant water discharged from the condenser <b>6</b> is returned to the cooling tower <b>16</b> through the coolant returning line <b>14</b>. The coolant cycle for circulating the coolant water is thus comprised.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The cooling tower <b>16</b> is an open-type cooling tower. Specifically, the cooling tower <b>16</b> is provided with an opening and a fan <b>16</b><i>a </i>in an upper portion thereof. The opening is used for taking external air into the cooling tower <b>16</b>. The fan <b>16</b><i>a </i>is used for conveying external air to an inside of the cooling tower <b>16</b> through the opening. The cooling tower <b>16</b> is adapted to cool, inside thereof, coolant water conveyed through the coolant returning line <b>14</b> by showering coolant water from the upper portion of the cooling tower and blowing coolant water with the fan <b>16</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The coolant pump <b>18</b> is disposed in the coolant returning line <b>14</b>. The coolant pump <b>18</b> is adapted to put pressure on coolant water discharged to the coolant returning line <b>14</b> from the condenser <b>6</b> to convey the coolant water to the cooling tower <b>16</b> and to the coolant supplying line <b>12</b> arranged ahead the cooling tower <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Next, a detailed configuration of the compressor <b>4</b> according to the first embodiment is described, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As mentioned above, the compressor <b>4</b> according to the first embodiment is adapted to compress, in a compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>in a housing <b>22</b> thereof, the water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas evaporated in the evaporator <b>2</b> to convey the compressed water vapor to the condenser <b>6</b>. In the compressor <b>4</b>, water is supplied as the lubricant to bearings <b>26</b> arranged in the housing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Specifically, the compressor <b>4</b> includes the housing <b>22</b>, a rotary member <b>24</b>, a plurality of bearings <b>26</b>, a motor <b>28</b>, sealing members <b>30</b>, a lubricant supplying line <b>32</b>, and a lubricant discharging line <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The housing <b>22</b> is so formed as to be hollow, and include inside thereof the rotary member <b>24</b>, the plurality of bearings <b>26</b>, and the sealing member <b>30</b>. The housing <b>22</b> includes inside thereof the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>for compressing refrigerant gas. The refrigerant introducing line <b>8</b> and the refrigerant deriving line <b>9</b> connect to the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a</i>. The refrigerant introducing line <b>8</b> introduces the water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas from the evaporator <b>2</b> into the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a</i>. The refrigerant deriving line <b>9</b> allows the compressed refrigerant gas to flow from the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>to the condenser <b>6</b>. A pressure at an inlet portion of the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>is set at, for example, a saturated vapor pressure of water at about 7 degrees C. so as to prevent the water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas introduced into the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>from being condensed.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The rotary member <b>24</b> is rotated by a driving force of the motor <b>28</b> so as to compress the water vapor as the refrigerant gas in the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a</i>. The rotary member <b>24</b> has a plurality of impellers <b>24</b><i>a </i>and a rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The plural impellers <b>24</b><i>a </i>are arranged inside the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>and mounted to the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b</i>. The refrigerating gas, that is the water vapor, in the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>is compressed by being rotated the impellers <b>24</b><i>a </i>together with the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b </i>is arranged so as to extend in an axial direction of the housing <b>22</b> in the housing <b>22</b>. The rotating shaft <b>25</b><i>b </i>has one end portion connected to a driving shaft <b>28</b><i>a </i>of the motor <b>28</b>. The rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b </i>is rotatably supported by the plurality of bearings <b>26</b>. The rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b </i>is rotated by the driving force of the motor <b>28</b> transmitted through the driving shaft <b>28</b><i>a</i>, and the entire rotary member <b>24</b> is rotated accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The plurality of bearings <b>26</b> are so arranged to have spaces therebetween along the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the rotary member <b>24</b> in the housing <b>22</b>. One bearing <b>26</b> of the plurality of bearings <b>26</b> is arranged at a position in the vicinity of the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>between the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the motor <b>28</b>. This bearing <b>26</b> supports the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b </i>with respect to an inner surface of the housing <b>22</b> at the position. Another bearing <b>26</b> is arranged in a position opposite to the motor <b>28</b> relative to the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a</i>. This bearing <b>26</b> supports the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b </i>with respect to the inner surface of the housing <b>22</b> at the position. Each of the bearings <b>26</b> is a sliding bearing. To each of the bearings <b>26</b>, water serving as a lubricant (hereinafter, &#x201c;lubricant water&#x201d;) is supplied through the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a slight clearance is formed between an inner surface of the bearing <b>26</b> and an outer surface of the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b</i>. The lubricant water supplied to the bearing <b>26</b> is drawn into the clearance to form a water film, followed by flowing out toward both sides of the each bearing <b>26</b> in the axial direction thereof from the clearance. The flown lubricant water remains around the bearing <b>26</b> in the housing <b>22</b> and is discharged through the lubricant discharging line <b>34</b>. Further, pressures in spaces where the bearings <b>26</b> are arranged in the housing <b>22</b> are set to about equal to or more than 1 atm.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The sealing member <b>30</b> is fixed to the inner surface of the housing <b>22</b> at a position between the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>and the bearing <b>26</b> adjacent to the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a</i>. The sealing member <b>30</b> separates the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>from the space in the housing <b>22</b> where the bearing <b>26</b> is arranged. The sealing member <b>30</b> is a non-contact type sealing having a ring-shape, and surrounds the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b </i>with a space relative to the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b</i>. A pressure in the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>is lower than a pressure in the space where the bearing <b>26</b> is arranged. This causes a part of the lubricant water in the space where the bearing <b>26</b> is arranged to be drawn into the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>through the clearance between the sealing member <b>30</b> and the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b</i>. At this time, the sealing member <b>30</b> suppresses an immediate flow of a large amount of the lubricant water into the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> connects the respective bearings <b>26</b> with the coolant supplying line <b>12</b>. The lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> is adapted to supply the lubricant water to the respective bearings <b>26</b>. A part of the coolant water supplied from the cooling tower <b>16</b> to the condenser <b>6</b> through the coolant supplying line <b>12</b> by a discharge pressure of the coolant pump <b>18</b> is supplied as the lubricant water to the respective bearings <b>26</b> through the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b>. The lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> is embraced in a concept of the lubricant supplier of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The lubricant discharging line <b>34</b> is adapted to discharge, out of the housing <b>22</b>, the lubricant water flowing out from the respective bearings <b>26</b> and remaining around the bearings <b>26</b> in the housing <b>22</b>. The lubricant discharging line <b>34</b> has one end connected to an outlet opening around the respective bearings <b>26</b> in the housing <b>22</b> and another end connected to the coolant returning line <b>14</b>. This arrangement allows the lubricant water discharged from the housing <b>22</b> to join with the coolant water which is discharged from the condenser <b>6</b> and flow through the coolant returning line <b>14</b>. That is, in the first embodiment, the lubricant water is supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b> of the compressor <b>4</b> from a coolant cycle system in which the coolant water is supplied to the condenser <b>6</b>, whereafter the used lubricant water is returned to the coolant cycle system.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Next, operations of the refrigerating machine <b>1</b> and the compressor <b>4</b> according to the first embodiment are described.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">First, the water refrigerant is evaporated in the evaporator <b>2</b>. This causes the water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas to be introduced from the evaporator <b>2</b> through the refrigerant introducing line <b>8</b> to the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the compressor <b>4</b>. The water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas introduced in the compressor chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>is compressed by the impellers <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the rotary member <b>24</b> rotated by the driving force of the motor <b>28</b>. The compressed water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas is derived from the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>and conveyed to the condenser <b>6</b> through the refrigerant deriving line <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">To the condenser <b>6</b>, the coolant water is supplied through the coolant supplying line <b>12</b> from the cooling tower <b>16</b> by the discharge pressure of the coolant pump <b>18</b>. In the condenser <b>6</b>, the water vapor serving as refrigerant gas contacts to the coolant water to be cooled, thereby causing the water vapor to be condensed. The condensed water made by the condensation is discharged along with the coolant water from the condenser <b>6</b>. A part of the discharged water is conveyed as the water refrigerant through the refrigerant supplying line <b>10</b> to the evaporator <b>2</b>, caused by the internal pressure of the condenser <b>6</b> higher than the internal pressure of the evaporator <b>2</b>. Meanwhile, remaining water is conveyed as the coolant water through the coolant returning line <b>14</b> to a side of the coolant supplying line <b>12</b> by the coolant pump <b>18</b>. The coolant water conveyed by the coolant pump <b>18</b> is cooled in the cooling tower <b>16</b>, followed by being again supplied through the coolant supplying line <b>12</b> to the condenser <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the compressor <b>4</b>, the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the rotary member <b>24</b> rotated as mentioned above is supported by the plurality of bearings <b>26</b>. The rotation of the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b </i>causes to generate a heat in the respective bearings <b>26</b>, and thereby the temperature of the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b </i>rises. A part of the coolant water is supplied as the lubricant water to the respective bearings <b>26</b> from the cooling tower <b>16</b> through the coolant supplying line <b>12</b> and the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b>. The supplied lubricant water is used for lubrication between the respective bearings <b>26</b> and the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the rotary member <b>24</b> and cooling the bearings <b>26</b>. The lubricant water supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b> flows from the clearance between the each bearing <b>26</b> and the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b </i>toward both sides of the each bearing <b>26</b> in the axial direction thereof, and remains around the respective bearings <b>26</b> in the housing <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A part of the lubricant water flown out from the respective bearings <b>26</b> may be drawn into the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>through the clearance between an inner surface of the non-contact-type sealing member <b>30</b> and the outer surface of the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b</i>, caused by the pressure in the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>which is lower than that in the space where the bearings <b>26</b> are arranged. However, a pressure in an area having the lower pressure in the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>is set at the saturated vapor pressure, causing the lubricant water drawn into the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>to be immediately evaporated. Therefore, it is prevented that the impellers <b>24</b><i>a </i>of the rotary member <b>24</b> are damaged due to a collision of droplets of the lubricant water. The lubricant water evaporated in the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>is discharged from the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>together with the water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas to be compressed in the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a</i>, and is conveyed to the condenser <b>6</b>. On the other hand, the lubricant water remaining around the bearings <b>26</b> in the housing <b>22</b> is discharged through the lubricant discharging line <b>34</b> and joins the coolant water flowing through the coolant returning line <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The refrigerating machine <b>1</b> and the compressor <b>4</b> according to the first embodiment are thus operated.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As mentioned above, the compressor <b>4</b> according to the first embodiment compresses the water vapor as the refrigerant gas evaporated in the evaporator <b>2</b> to convey the compressed water vapor to the condenser <b>6</b>, therefore, in the refrigerant machine <b>1</b> to which the compressor <b>4</b> is applied, water can be used as the refrigerant. Since water originally exists in the nature, water affects on the natural environment on its disposal much less than a refrigerant including a chemical material, such as chlorofluorocarbon does. Further, the lubricant water is supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b> in the first embodiment. Even if the lubricant water supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b> is mingled with the water vapor serving as the refrigerating gas in the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the compressor <b>4</b>, it is not necessary to separate the lubricant water from the refrigerant gas after discharged from the compressor <b>4</b>, since the lubricant water and the refrigerating gas are both water. Accordingly, the refrigerating machine is not required to mount therein a separator for separating the refrigerant gas from the lubricant water, unlike a conventional technique in which a refrigerant gas and a lubricating oil discharged together from a compressor are separated from each other by an oil separator. This simplifies the configurations of the compressor <b>4</b> and the refrigerating machine <b>1</b>. Further, in the first embodiment, water is supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b> as the lubricant. Thus, unlike a conventional technique in which bearings are lubricated with lubricating oil, water serving as the lubricant can be thrown away without troublesome treatment upon the disposal thereof. Therefore, according to the first embodiment, it is possible to obtain the compressor <b>4</b> and the refrigerating machine <b>1</b> which are capable of an easy disposal of the lubricant, are friendly to the nature environment with simple configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Further, according to the first embodiment, the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> connects the respective bearings <b>26</b> with the coolant supplying line <b>12</b> through which the coolant water is supplied to the condenser <b>6</b>. This arrangement allows a part of the coolant water to be supplied to the condenser <b>6</b> to also be supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b> as the lubricant water. Accordingly, a water-storage equipment is not required, unlike a configuration in which the lubricant water is supplied from a water-storage equipment to a bearing <b>26</b>. As a consequent, the configurations of the compressor <b>4</b> and the refrigerating machine <b>1</b> can be prevented from being complicated. In addition, according to the first embodiment, a part of the low-temperature coolant water to be supplied to the condenser <b>6</b> is also supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b>. Therefore, the bearings <b>26</b> can be cooled. In other words, according to the first embodiment, the respective bearings <b>26</b> can be cooled by using a part of the low-temperature coolant water, eliminating a necessity of cooling of the lubricant to be supplied to the bearings <b>26</b> for cooling the bearings <b>26</b> by using a cooling equipment or the like separately provided. With this arrangement, the respective bearings <b>26</b> can be cooled without complicating the configurations of the compressor <b>4</b> and the refrigerating machine <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Further, according to the first embodiment, the condenser <b>6</b> performs the direct heat exchange, and the coolant water discharged from the condenser <b>6</b> is returned through the coolant returning line <b>14</b> to the coolant supplying line <b>12</b>. Accordingly, a part of the coolant water discharged from the condenser <b>6</b> performing direct heat exchange can be supplied from the coolant supplying line <b>12</b> through the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> to the respective bearings <b>26</b>. The coolant water and the condensed water which is obtained by the condensation of the water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas are discharged together from the condenser <b>6</b> performing the direct heat exchange, allowing relatively fine water to be discharged. The fine water is supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b> as the lubricant water, and thus, impurities are hardly to be separated out. Therefore, a processing equipment for, for example, performing a removal of mineral and a filter for removing separated impurities are unnecessary. Consequently, the configuration of the refrigerating machine <b>1</b> can be prevented from being complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Further, according to the first embodiment, the coolant pump <b>18</b> for conveying the coolant water discharged from the condenser <b>6</b> toward the coolant supplying line <b>12</b> is provided in the coolant returning line <b>14</b>, allowing a part of the coolant water to be conveyed from the coolant supplying line <b>12</b> through the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> to the respective bearings <b>26</b> by using the discharge pressure of the coolant pump <b>18</b>. Accordingly, the lubricant water can be smoothly supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b> without providing otherwise pump for conveying the lubricant water to the bearings <b>26</b> in the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b>. Therefore, the lubricant water can be smoothly supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b> without complicating the configuration of the refrigerant machine <b>1</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Second Embodiment</heading>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Next, the respective configurations of the compressor <b>4</b> and the refrigerating machine <b>41</b> according to the second embodiment are described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the second embodiment, a condenser <b>46</b> is an indirect heat exchange type condenser, unlike the first embodiment. Thus, in the condenser <b>46</b>, coolant water flowing through the coolant cycle does not contact to a refrigerant flowing through a refrigerant cycle. Further, the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> connects the respective bearings <b>26</b> with a condensed water supplying line <b>50</b> through which condensed water is conveyed from the condenser <b>46</b> to the evaporator <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Specifically, the condenser <b>46</b> has a coolant introducing opening <b>46</b><i>a </i>and a coolant discharge opening <b>46</b><i>b</i>. The coolant introducing opening <b>46</b><i>a </i>of the condenser <b>46</b> is connected to the coolant supplying line <b>12</b>, and the coolant discharge opening <b>46</b><i>b </i>of the condenser <b>46</b> is connected to the coolant returning line <b>14</b>. Another end of the condensed water supplying line <b>50</b> connects to the evaporator <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the condenser <b>46</b> performing the indirect heat exchange, the coolant water and the water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas flows in separate cycles, and the water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas is cooled by the coolant water to be condensed. Accordingly, the coolant water and the condensed water never join in the condenser <b>46</b>. The used coolant water is discharged from the coolant discharge opening <b>46</b><i>b </i>to the coolant returning line <b>14</b>, while the condensed water is discharged from the refrigerant discharge opening <b>46</b><i>d </i>to the condensed water supplying line <b>50</b>. The condensed water discharged to the condensed water supplying line <b>50</b> is conveyed to the evaporator <b>2</b> by the difference in the internal pressures between the condenser <b>6</b> and the evaporator <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the second embodiment, the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> connects the respective bearings <b>26</b> of the compressor <b>4</b> with the condensed water supplying line <b>50</b>. A lubricant supplying pump <b>11</b> is disposed in the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b>. The lubricant discharging line <b>34</b> connects to the refrigerant deriving line <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the second embodiment, the water vapor which serves as the refrigerant gas and is discharged from the compression chamber <b>22</b><i>a </i>of the compressor <b>4</b> is supplied through the refrigerant deriving line <b>9</b> to the condenser <b>46</b>. In the condenser <b>46</b>, the water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas is cooled by the coolant water to be condensed. The condensed water obtained by the condensation is discharged from the condenser <b>46</b> to the condensed water supplying line <b>50</b>, and conveyed as the water refrigerant to the evaporator <b>2</b>, while a part of the condensed water is supplied from the condensed water supplying line <b>50</b> through the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> to the respective bearings <b>26</b> of the compressor <b>4</b> by the drive of the lubricant supplying pump <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A construction and an operation according to the second embodiment except for the above are same as a construction and an operation according to the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As mentioned above, in the second embodiment, the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> connects the respective bearings <b>26</b> with the condensed water supplying line <b>50</b> for conveying the condensed water from the condenser <b>46</b> to the evaporator <b>2</b>, while the lubricant supplying pump <b>11</b> is disposed in the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b>. This arrangement allows a part of the condensed water conveyed from the condenser <b>46</b> to the evaporator <b>2</b> to be also used as the lubricant water to be supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b>. Accordingly, a water-storage equipment for the lubricant is unnecessary, as in the first embodiment, therefore the configurations of the compressor <b>4</b> and the refrigerating machine <b>41</b> are prevented from being complicated. Further, a purity degree of the condensed water is high, therefore, impurities are hardly separated out even if the condensed water is used as the lubricant water without any modification added thereto. Accordingly, it is not necessary to provide a processing equipment for, for example, removing minerals and a filter for removing separated impurities, thereby preventing the configurations of the compressor <b>4</b> and the refrigerating machine <b>41</b> from being complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Effects obtained by the second embodiment except for the above are the same as effects obtained by the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The above described embodiments should be considered as being illustrative and not restrictive in all aspects. The scope of the invention is defined by the claims rather than by the description of the embodiments as described above, and includes all changes within the metes and bounds equivalent to claims.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For example, as a first modified example in the first embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> may connect the respective bearings <b>26</b> with the coolant returning line <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Specifically, in the first modified example, the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> is connected to the coolant returning line <b>14</b> at a downstream of a position where the coolant pump <b>18</b> is disposed. In the first modified example, the drive of the coolant pump <b>18</b> causes the coolant water discharged from the condenser <b>6</b> to be conveyed through the coolant returning line <b>14</b> to the coolant tower <b>16</b> and to the coolant supplying line <b>12</b>, while a part of the coolant water is conveyed to the respective bearings <b>26</b> from the coolant returning line <b>14</b> through the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the first modified example, a part of the coolant water discharged from the condenser <b>6</b> may also be used as the lubricant, and supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b>. Therefore, a water-storage equipment for the lubricant is unnecessary, thereby preventing the configurations of the compressor <b>4</b> and the refrigerating machine <b>1</b> from being complicated, similarly as the above-mentioned first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Other effects than the above obtained by the first modified example are same as effects obtained by the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">As a second modified example in the first embodiment, which is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> may directly connect the condenser <b>6</b> with the respective bearings <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Specifically, in the second modified example, the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> is connected to a portion of the condenser <b>6</b> where the coolant water and the condensed water are retained. In the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b>, the lubricant supplying pump <b>11</b> is disposed. The drive of the lubricant supplying pump <b>11</b> causes a part of water in the condenser <b>6</b> to be supplied through the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> to the respective bearings <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In the second modified example, a part of water in the condenser <b>6</b> can also be used as the lubricant to be supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b>. Therefore, a water-storage equipment for the lubricant is unnecessary, thereby preventing the configurations of the compressor <b>4</b> and the refrigerating machine <b>1</b> from being complicated, similarly as the above-mentioned first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Other effects than the above obtained by the second modified example are similar as effects obtained by the first embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Further, in the first embodiment, the first modified example and the second modified example, the condenser <b>6</b> may be an indirect heat exchange type condenser. In the second modified example, in a case when the condenser <b>6</b> performs the indirect heat exchange, it is preferable that the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b> is connected to the portion of the condenser <b>6</b>, where the condensed water flows, so as to supply a part of the condensed water to the respective bearings <b>26</b> through the lubricant supplying line <b>32</b>. In this case, it is possible to use the condensed water having the high degree of purity as the lubricant without any change. Accordingly, it is not necessary to provide a processing equipment for, for example, removing mineral in the lubricant water, and a filter for removing the separated impurities, thereby preventing the configurations of the compressor <b>4</b> and the refrigerating machine <b>1</b> from being complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Further, in the above second embodiment, the condenser <b>46</b> may be a direct heat exchange type condenser.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As the cooling tower <b>16</b>, a sealed-type cooling tower may be used in which coolant water is cooled inside thereof without making coolant water contact to external air. This arrangement prevents foreign material from getting into coolant water in the cooling tower <b>16</b> from exterior.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Further, the present invention may be applied to a compressor using a screw rotor, and a compressor including other configuration in a similar manner as above.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Further, the lubricant water to be supplied to the respective bearings <b>26</b> of the compressor <b>4</b> may be supplied from a supplying equipment provided separately from the coolant cycle of the coolant water including the condenser <b>6</b> and a condensed water supplying system of the condensed water flowing toward the evaporator <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, as the sealing member <b>30</b>, a contact-type sealing member may be used which has an inner surface contacting to the outer surface of the rotating shaft <b>24</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively, the seal member <b>30</b> may be omitted.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Summary of Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The above-described embodiments are summarized below.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The compressor according to the embodiments is a compressor which is used in a refrigerating machine including an evaporator and a condenser and adapted for compressing refrigerant gas evaporated in the evaporator to convey the compressed refrigerant gas to the condenser, includes: a motor; a housing having a compression chamber inside; a rotary member which has a rotating shaft and is rotated by a driving force of the motor so as to compress water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas in the compression chamber; a bearing for supporting the rotating shaft of the rotary member in the housing; and a lubricant supplier for supplying water serving as a lubricant to the bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the compressor, the water vapor serving as the refrigerant gas evaporated in the evaporator is compressed to be conveyed to the condenser, therefore the refrigerating machine to which the compressor is applied can employ water as a refrigerant. Since water is originally exists in the nature, water affects on the natural environment on its disposal much less than the refrigerant including a chemical material, such as a chlorofluorocarbon, does. Further, water is supplied as the lubricant to the bearing by the lubricant supplier in the compressor. With this arrangement, even if water serving as the lubricant supplied to the bearing is mixed with water serving as the refrigerant in the compression chamber of the housing, it is not necessary to separate water serving as the lubricant from the refrigerant gas after discharged from the compressor, since both are water. Therefore, unlike a conventional technique in which the refrigerant gas and the lubricating oil discharged together from the compressor are necessary to be separated from each other by an oil separator, no separator is necessary to be provided for separating the refrigerant gas from the lubricant, thereby allowing a configuration of the compressor to be simplified. In addition, in the inventive compressor, water is supplied to the bearing as the lubricant, thereby the water serving as the lubricant may be disposed as is, without troublesome treatment at the time of disposal. Accordingly, this arrangement enables to obtain the compressor which enables the easy disposal of the lubricant, and is friendly to the natural environment, with a simple configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In the compressor, it is preferable that the refrigerating machine is provided with a coolant supplying line for supplying coolant water to the condenser; the lubricant supplier includes a lubricant supplying line connecting the bearing with the coolant supplying line.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">With this arrangement, a part of the coolant water supplied to the condenser can also be used as the lubricant to be supplied to the bearing. Accordingly, unlike a configuration in which water to be used for the lubricant is supplied to the bearing from a water-storage equipment, such as a tank, no water-storage equipment is necessary to be provided, thereby preventing the configuration of the compressor from being complicated. In addition, the rotation of the rotary member generates a heat in the bearing, causing the temperature of the bearing to be raised. However, with this arrangement, a part of the low-temperature coolant water to be supplied to the condenser is also supplied to the bearing, thereby cooling the bearing. In other words, with this arrangement, a part of the low-temperature coolant water can also be used to cool the bearing. This eliminates a necessity of cooling of the lubricant to be supplied to the bearing for cooling the bearing, by a cooler and the like separately provided. Consequently, the bearing can be cooled without complicating the configuration of the compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The refrigerating machine according to the embodiments includes the compressor having the lubricant supplying line connecting the bearing with the coolant supplying line; an evaporator; a condenser; a coolant supplying line for supplying coolant water to the condenser; a coolant returning line for returning coolant water discharged from the condenser to the coolant supplying line; and a cooling tower disposed between the coolant returning line and the coolant supplying line, for cooling the coolant water.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">With this arrangement, the refrigerating machine includes the aforementioned compressor. Therefore, water can be used as both the refrigerant and the lubricant, and the configuration of the compressor can be simplified. Accordingly, with this arrangement, the refrigerating machine with a simple configuration can be obtained which enables easy disposal of the lubricant, and is friendly to the natural environment.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Here, it is preferable that the refrigerating machine further includes a coolant pump disposed in the coolant returning line, for conveying the coolant water discharged from the condenser to the coolant supplying line.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">With this arrangement, a part of the coolant water can be conveyed to the bearing from the coolant supplying line through the lubricant supplying line by using a discharge pressure of the coolant pump. Accordingly, the lubricant can be smoothly supplied to the bearing without separately providing in the lubricant supplying line a pump for conveying water as the lubricant to the bearing. Consequently, this arrangement allows water serving as the lubricant to be smoothly conveyed to the bearing without complicating the configuration of the refrigerant machine.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In the above compressor, it is preferable that the refrigerating machine is provided with a condensed water supplying line for conveying a condensed water from the condenser to the evaporator; and the lubricant supplier includes a lubricant supplying line connecting the bearing with the condensed water supplying line, and a lubricant supplying pump disposed in the lubricant supplying line, for conveying a part of the condensed water to the bearing.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">With this arrangement, a part of the condensed water conveyed from the condenser to the evaporator can also used as the lubricant to be supplied to the bearing. Therefore, a water-storage equipment for the lubricant is not necessary to be arranged, similarly as the above, thereby preventing the configuration of the compressor from being complicated. Further, the condensed water has a high degree of purity. Thus, impurities are hard to be separated out even if the condensed water is used as the lubricant without modification. Accordingly, it is not necessary to provide a processing equipment for, for example, removing mineral or a filter for removing the separated impurities. This also prevents the configuration of the compressor from being complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The refrigerating machine according to the embodiments includes the compressor having the lubricant supplying line connecting the bearing with the condensed water supplying line; an evaporator; a condenser; and a condensed water supplying line for conveying a condensed water from the condenser to the evaporator.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">With this arrangement, caused by being provided with the compressor, the refrigerating machine with a simple configuration can be obtained which is capable of the easy disposal of the lubricant, and is friendly to the natural environment, similarly as the above configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In the above compressor, it is preferable that the refrigerating machine is provided with a coolant supplying line for supplying coolant water to the condenser and a coolant returning line for returning coolant water discharged from the condenser to the coolant supplying line; and the lubricant supplier includes a lubricant supplying line connecting the bearing with the coolant returning line.</p>

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">With this arrangement, caused by being provided with the compressor, the refrigerating machine with a simple configuration can be obtained which is capable of the easy disposal of the lubricant, and is friendly to the natural environment, similarly as the above configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Here, it is preferable that the refrigerant machine further includes a coolant pump disposed in the coolant returning line, for conveying the coolant water discharged from the condenser to the coolant supplying line.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">With this arrangement, by a drive of the coolant pump, the coolant water discharged from the condenser can be returned to the coolant supplying line through the coolant returning line, and a part of the coolant water can also be conveyed to the bearing from the coolant returning line through the lubricant supplying line. Accordingly, the lubricant can be smoothly supplied to the bearing without providing a pump for conveying water serving as the lubricant to the bearing in the lubricant supplying line. Therefore, water serving as the lubricant can be smoothly supplied to the bearing without complicating the configuration of the refrigerant machine.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In the compressor, it is preferable that the lubricant supplier includes a lubricant supplying line connecting the condenser with the bearing, for supplying a part of water in the condenser to the bearing; and a lubricant supplying pump disposed in the lubricant supplying line, for conveying a part of water in the condenser to the bearing.</p>
