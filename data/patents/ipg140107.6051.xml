<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The present invention will now be described by way of preferred, but non-limiting, embodiments of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">For ease of understanding and to avoid redundancy, like reference numbers refer to the same or similar elements throughout the drawings. Also, while the drawings contain a number of circuit elements, it will be understood from the nature of electrical circuits that when an element is described as being connected to another element, it can be directly connected the other element or one or more intervening elements may be present. In contrast, if an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; another element, then no intervening elements are present. Other words used to describe the relationship between elements should be interpreted in a like fashion (e.g., &#x201c;between&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly between,&#x201d; &#x201c;adjacent&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly adjacent,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected&#x201d; versus &#x201c;directly connected,&#x201d; etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">As is traditional in the field of the present invention, embodiments of the invention are described in terms of functional blocks or units. It will be readily understood that the functional blocks or units denote electronic circuits which are configured (e.g., by dedicated and/or programmable circuitry) to execute the signaling and/or computational operations described herein. Also, it will be readily understood that one or more functional blocks may be physically combined into complex circuitry without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the embodiments that follow, examples are presented in which a high speed memory system is equipped with parallel type error correction control in which error correction data is transmitted on a separate channel in parallel with data of the memory system. Both the error correction data and the memory system data may be transmitted in the form of data packets.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The memory system itself is not limited, and examples include dynamic random access memories (DRAM), such as the main DRAM and/or graphic DRAM of a computer system, and memory controllers, such DRAM and graphics controllers. Other examples include flash memories (e.g., NOR flash and NAND flash), phase-change random access memories (PRAM), ferroelectric random access memories (FRAM), multi-media random access memories (MMRAM), resistance random access memories (RRAM), and others. Further, the memory system may be contained, for example, in one of a computer system, a graphics card, a gaming system, or an interactive video system.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Herein, error correction control broadly refers to any type of error correction coding scheme in which error bits are transmitted on one or more separate channels to check for errors in memory data (i.e., &#x201c;real&#x201d; data) transmitted on parallel channels. In a packet based transmission system, examples include ECC/EDC and/or CRC coding schemes, where ECC denotes &#x201c;error correction code&#x201d;, EDC denotes &#x201c;error detection code&#x201d;, and CRC denotes &#x201c;cyclic redundancy code&#x201d;. In the embodiments that follow, packet type ECC/EDC schemes are described by way of example, and the correction data is referred to as ECC data and/or ECC/EDC. The invention is not limited in this respect, and the term error correction (EC) control is utilized when referencing error correction and decoding in a generic sense.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a memory system according to an embodiment of the present invention, which includes a latency control circuit <b>110</b> and a drive circuit <b>160</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the memory system is either a semiconductor memory (e.g., a DRAM), or a memory controller which communicates with an external semiconductor memory.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring first to the drive circuit <b>160</b>, included therein is a data driver <b>170</b> and an ECC/EDC driver <b>180</b>. The data driver <b>170</b> generates real data DATA of the memory system on parallel data channels CH_DATA, and the ECC/EDC driver <b>180</b> generates error correction codes ECCCODE on one or more error correction code channels (CH_ECC). In particular, the ECC/EDC driver <b>180</b> utilizes a part of the data generated by the data driver <b>170</b> to calculate and generate the error correction codes ECCCODE. In the examples that follow herein, the error correction codes ECCCODE are transmitted on a single channel. However, the invention is not limited in this respect.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is characterized by latency control of the data driver <b>170</b> and the ECC/EDC driver <b>180</b>. This is represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> by the provision of an ECC/EDC latency controller <b>130</b> which generates a latency control signal CTRL_ECC that is applied to the ECC/EDC driver <b>180</b>, and by the provision of a data latency controller <b>120</b> which generates a latency control signal CTRL_DATA that is applied to the data driver <b>170</b>. More detailed examples of latency control functionality will be described later herein. Briefly, however, the latency of the data driver <b>170</b> is controlled by the latency control signal CTRL_DATA, and the latency of the ECC/EDC driver is controlled by the latency control signal CTRL_ECC.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Parallel type error correction control schemes are characterized by both data latency and error correction latency. Data latency refers to the number of clock cycles that elapse between the time at which a read command (RD) or write command (WR) is generated, and the time at which the data driver <b>170</b> actually begins transmitting real data. Error correction latency refers to the additional number of clock cycles required for error correction code calculations and generation to take after receipt of data generated by the data driver <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The operation of the memory system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> according to an embodiment of the present invention will now be described with reference to the timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a single packet of data is transmitted on plural channels, and corresponding error corrections codes ECC are transmitted on a single channel.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring now collectively to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, when the memory device is operating at a relatively low transmission frequency, each unit interval (UI) of the data transmitted on the parallel data channels CH_DATA is relatively long (time-wise). In contrast, when operating at a relatively high transmission frequency, each unit interval (UI) of the data transmitted on the parallel data channels CH_DATA is relatively short. Thus, the number of unit intervals (UI's) required for the error correction code calculations and generation may be different during a low transmission frequency operation than at a high transmission frequency operations.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, during a low transmission frequency, the ECC/EDC latency controller <b>130</b> controls the ECC/EDC driver <b>180</b> to set the error correction code latency LAT_ECC1 at one (1) unit interval (UI). On the other hand, during a high transmission frequency, the ECC/EDC latency controller <b>130</b> controls the ECC/EDC driver <b>180</b> to set the error correction code latency LAT_ECC2 at two unit intervals (UI's). In this manner, the user can adapt the ECC/EDC latency to transmission frequency. In other words, for example, if the maximum transmission frequency of the memory system requires an ECC/EDC latency of two (2) unit intervals (UI's), it may not necessary to also provide two (2) unit intervals (UI's) of ECC/EDC latency during a lower transmission frequency. That is, overall latency during the low transmission frequency domain by selectively controlling the latency of the ECC/EDC driver <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, both an ECC/EDC latency controller <b>130</b> and a data latency controller <b>120</b> are illustrated. It is pointed out, however, that the invention also encompasses systems in which only one of data latency or error correction latency is controlled. An example of this has already been shown, i.e., in the timing diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, only ECC/EDC latency is controlled according to the frequency of transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a timing diagram illustrating an example in which only data latency is controlled. In this example, the data latency controller <b>120</b> increases the data latency of the data driver <b>170</b> by an amount equal to the ECC/EDC latency. That is, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the inherent or real data latency is denoted as LAT_DATA<b>1</b>, and the ECC/EDC latency is equal to a latency denoted as LAT_DATA<b>2</b>. In this embodiment, the data latency controller <b>120</b> controls the data driver <b>170</b> to add the additional latency LAT_DATA<b>2</b>, for both the low transmission frequency and high transmission frequency domains. Thus, the data and corresponding error correction codes (ECC) are simultaneous transmitted, which may allow for reduced circuit complexity at the receiving end of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the timing diagrams of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> above, the data latency and error correction latency is the same for both read (RD) and write (WR) operations. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates another embodiment in which different latency control is executed for read and write operations. In particular, in the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> no latency control is executed during a read (RD) operation. Thus, the actual data latency is the same as the inherent data latency LAT_DATA, and the actual error correction code ECC latency is the same as the inherent ECC latency LAT_ECC. (The overall latency of the error correction codes from the generation of the read command RD is LAT_DATA+LAT_ECC.) On the other hand, during a write operation, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates additional latency being added to the actual error correction code ECC latency. In this example, the amount of latency added is equal to the number of clock cycles of one packet of data. Thus, the overall error correction code latency from issuance of the write command WR is the inherent data latency, plus the number of clock cycles of one packet, plus the inherent ECC latency. Again, by manipulating the arrival time of the error correction codes (ECC) relative to the corresponding data, it may be possible to increase circuit efficiency at the receiving end of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram of a memory system according to another embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the memory system includes a memory cell array <b>132</b>, an internal bi-directional data path <b>134</b>, a data input/output circuit <b>170</b>, an ECC/EDC circuit <b>140</b>, an ECC/EDC input/output circuit <b>180</b>, a latency controller <b>190</b>, a data latency controller <b>120</b>, and an ECC/EDC latency controller <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The memory cell array <b>132</b> stores internal data which may be written from and read to the internal data path <b>134</b> (which includes a plurality of parallel data paths), and the data input/output circuit <b>170</b> transmits data back and forth between the internal data path <b>134</b> and external data channels CH_DATA.

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the data input/output circuit <b>170</b> includes a data buffer <b>172</b> and a data driver <b>174</b>.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The ECC/EDC circuit <b>140</b> includes an ECC/EDC generator <b>142</b> and an ECC/EDC comparator <b>144</b>.

The ECC/EDC comparator <b>144</b> compares received error correction codes from the ECC/EDC buffer <b>182</b> with error correction codes generated by the ECC/EDC generator <b>142</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The data latency controller <b>120</b> is responsive to the latency controller <b>190</b> to generate a data latency control signal CTRL_DATA which controls a storage time (or FIFO delay time) of the data buffer <b>172</b>.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The latency controller <b>130</b> itself may, for example, take the form of user generated external signals derived from one or more pin terminals of the memory device. Alternately, for example, the latency controller <b>130</b> may be a mode register set (MRS) which contains preset data for controlling latencies of the memory device.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a write operation, real data DATA is received from the data channels CH_DATA and passes FIFO through the data buffer <b>172</b>, and is transferred to the ECC/EDC generator <b>142</b>.

The ECC/EDC comparator <b>144</b> compares the error check bits of the received error correction code ECCCODE with error check bits generated by the ECC/EDC generator <b>142</b>, and generates an error flag upon detecting a mismatch.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the present embodiment, the delay between receipt of the data DATA and the corresponding error correction codes is programmable as described above, for example, in connection <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a read operation, data selected from the memory cell array <b>132</b> is applied to the internal data path <b>134</b> and passes FIFO through the data buffer <b>172</b>, and is then transferred to the data channels CH_DATA through the data driver <b>174</b>.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an example of the ECC/EDC latency controller <b>130</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a timing diagram for use in describing the operation of thereof. The data latency controller <b>120</b> may, for example, be similarly configured.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the ECC/EDC latency controller <b>130</b> includes &#x201c;n&#x201d; cascade connected shift registers <b>310</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>310</b>-<i>n, </i>and a multiplexer circuit MUX <b>320</b>. The clock terminal of each shift register &#x3c;<b>310</b>-<b>1</b>:<b>310</b>-<i>n</i>&#x3e; receives an internal clock signal, whereas a data clock signal is applied to the input of the first shift register <b>310</b>-<b>1</b> and as an input to the multiplexer MUX <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring collectively to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the data clock signal is synchronized with the internal reference clock, and is delayed by a time corresponding to the inherent data latency. Generally, the internal clock signal is an internally generated PLL or DLL clock that is utilized to control various functional blocks of the memory device. It is also possible, however, to utilize an externally supplied clock in place of the internal reference clock.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The data clock is applied to the MUX <b>320</b> without delay via line <b>351</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Further, assuming the shift registers &#x3c;<b>310</b>-<b>1</b>:<b>310</b>-<i>n</i>&#x3e; are all enabled, an ECC/EDC clock with +1 latency is applied to the MUX <b>320</b> via line <b>352</b>, an ECC/EDC clock with +2 latency is applied to the MUX <b>320</b> via line <b>353</b>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, latency information signals (<b>1</b>) are utilized to control the <b>320</b> to select one of the input clocks applied to the MUX <b>320</b>. The output of the MUX <b>320</b> is applied as an ECC/EDC clock which controls delay time of the ECC/EDC buffer <b>182</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). For example, when the user (or MRS) selects a +1 ECC/EDC clock, the MUX <b>320</b> generates the clock of line <b>352</b> as the ECC/EDC clock output therefrom.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The latency information signals (<b>2</b>) (Lat <b>1</b> through Lat n) may be utilized to selectively disable the operation of any unneeded shift registers <b>310</b>-<b>1</b> through <b>310</b>-<i>n. </i>For example, if the MUX <b>320</b> generates the clock of line <b>352</b> as the ECC/EDC clock output therefrom, the shift registers <b>310</b>-<b>2</b> through <b>310</b>-<i>n </i>become operationally unnecessary.
