<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention provides a method and apparatus for producing radiant heat used in a synthesis gas production process or other catalytic reactor process, and more particularly for use in producing synthetic gas for a methanol production process or synthetic fuel production process. More specifically, the present method and apparatus utilize a plurality of tubular oxygen transport membrane elements disposed in proximate to or surrounding catalytic reforming reactor wherein permeated oxygen is combusted with a hydrogen containing synthesis gas stream contacting the permeate side of the tubular oxygen transport membrane elements thereby generating radiant heat sufficient to promote the desired catalytic reaction to produce synthetic gas.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Synthesis gas containing hydrogen and carbon monoxide is produced for a variety of industrial applications, for example, the production of hydrogen, chemicals and synthetic fuel production. Conventionally, the synthesis gas is produced in a fired reformer in which natural gas and steam is reformed to the synthesis gas in catalyst filled reformer tubes. The endothermic heating requirements for steam methane reforming reactions occurring within the reformer tubes are provided by burners firing into the furnace that are fueled by part of the natural gas. In order to increase the hydrogen content of the synthesis gas, the synthesis gas can be subjected to water-gas shift reactions to react residual steam in the synthesis gas with the carbon monoxide.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Such steam methane reformers are optimized for hydrogen production and typically are fed with a reactant stream containing hydrocarbons and steam at a steam-to-carbon ratio of 1.5 to 3.5, depending on the quantity of carbon dioxide in the reactant stream, to thereby produce the synthesis gas at a hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio of 3 or higher. This is not optimal for the production of synthesis gas for synthetic fuel production such as in Fisher-Tropsch or methanol synthesis where the hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio of 1.8 to 2.0 within the synthesis gas is more desirable. Consequently, where synthetic fuel production is a desired use of the synthesis gas, an autothermal reformer is typically used in which the steam-to-carbon ratio of the reactant is typically between 0.5 and 0.6. In such a reactor, oxygen is used to combust part of the feed to create additional steam and heat to reform the hydrocarbons contained in the feed to the synthesis gas. As such, for a large scale installation, an air separation plant may be required to supply the oxygen.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">As can be appreciated, conventional methods of producing a synthesis gas such as have been discussed above are expensive and involve complex installations. In order to overcome the complexity and expense of such installations it has been proposed to generate the synthesis gas within reactors that utilize an oxygen transport membrane to supply oxygen and thereby generate the heat necessary to support endothermic heating requirements of the steam methane reforming reactions. A typical oxygen transport membrane has a dense layer that, while being impervious to air or other oxygen containing gas, will transport oxygen ions when subjected to an elevated operational temperature and a difference in oxygen partial pressure across the membrane. This difference in oxygen partial pressure can be produced by compressing the supplied air or from the combustion of hydrocarbons fed to a permeate side of the membrane and supported by permeated oxygen or a combination of the two methods.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">For example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,048,472 and 6,110,979; a reactant gas feed is combined with steam. The reactant gas feed can be natural gas, naptha or other hydrocarbon containing gas. This combined feed stream is then heated and introduced into an adiabatic pre-reformer to produce an intermediate stream that contains carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, steam, hydrogen, and methane. The intermediate stream can be combined with carbon dioxide and steam. The resulting reactant stream is then introduced with air into reactant and oxidant sides, respectively, of an oxygen transport membrane reformer. The oxygen transport membrane reformer has an oxygen transport membrane separating the reactant and oxidant sides of the reformer. The reactant gas reacts with oxygen that has permeated through the oxygen transport membrane to produce a synthesis gas. Preferably a reforming catalyst is applied to at least a portion of the reactant side surface of oxygen transport membrane or packed into the reactant side to promote the reforming reactions.</p>

Further heat is supplied to the reforming reaction by either combusting a fuel with retentate or a fuel with a second permeate produced by another oxygen transport membrane or within a combustion passage. Alternatively, an oxygen transport membrane can be situated between an air passage and a combustion passage and a barrier is located between the combustion passage and the reaction passage. In such case, the oxygen transport membrane supplies oxygen permeate to support combustion of a fuel in a combustion passage to generate heat that is transferred to the reaction passage.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">US Patent Application Serial No. 2008/0302013 discloses a staged reactor system having a sequential arrangement of reactor stages to produce a synthesis gas product. Each of the reactor stages has an oxidant side separated from a reactant side by an oxygen transport membrane. The reactant sides are linked together so that a reactant stream containing methane and steam is introduced into the system and sequentially reacted with oxygen permeating through the membrane to produce a synthesis gas product for use in a downstream reactor such as a Fischer-Tropsch reactor. Catalyst beds can be located within the reactant side of the reactor stages or can be positioned between the reactor stages. Both steam and a reactant gas from a downstream process utilizing the synthesis gas can be introduced into the feed between stages. The presence of the multiple stages allows the temperature within each of the reaction stages to be controlled to prevent the oxygen transport membrane from being degraded and to control the deposition of soot throughout the membrane system.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">US Patent Application Serial No. 2006/0029539 discloses other examples of staged reactor systems that can employ oxygen transport membranes in which the air or other oxygen containing stream fed to each of the stages can be controlled to control the temperatures and conversation that can be obtained in producing a synthesis gas.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The problem with all of the above-identified prior art systems is that an oxygen transport membrane will operate at high temperatures of about 900&#xb0; C. to 1100&#xb0; C. Where hydrocarbons such as methane and other higher order hydrocarbons are subjected to such temperatures carbon formation will occur. Additionally, where oxygen is supplied by an oxygen transport membrane directly to the reactor, the surface area of the membrane is distributed throughout the reactor. As such, the distribution of oxygen is non-uniform throughout the reactor. In other words, sufficient quantity of oxygen is not generally available at or near the entrance to the reactor. This also results in an aggravated carbon formation problem at the entrance that is especially the case at low steam-to-carbon ratios. In any case, a reactant containing methane and steam will produce a relatively low oxygen flux across the membrane resulting in the membrane area required for such a reactor to be larger and it will add to the expense and complexity in such a reactor or system. Additionally, a steam methane reforming catalyst must be periodically replaced. In prior art reactor designs where the catalyst is employed adjacent to the oxygen transport membrane, catalyst replacement becomes an expensive if not impractical exercise.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention, in one or more aspects, provides a method and apparatus in which the oxygen transport membrane is not directly used to react the steam and methane components of the reactant feed, but rather, to generate the heat required to support endothermic heating requirements of steam methane reforming reactions within a separate reactor, thus overcoming the above-identified problems.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The present invention may be characterized as an oxygen transport membrane module for producing heat used in a synthesis gas production process. The module comprises a plurality of tubular oxygen transport membrane elements each having a permeate side and a retentate side. The tubular oxygen transport membrane elements is configured or adapted to separate oxygen from an oxygen containing stream contacting the retentate side of the membrane elements and produce the oxygen on the permeate side of the membrane elements. The permeated oxygen is combusted with a hydrogen containing synthesis gas stream contacting the permeate side of the tubular oxygen transport membrane elements thereby generating radiant heat, a reaction product stream and a retentate stream. The present module also includes at least one catalytic reactor disposed proximate the plurality of tubular oxygen transport membrane elements. Preferably, the central reactor comprises at least one reactor tube containing a catalyst to promote the steam methane reforming reaction and the central reactor tube is surrounded by the plurality of tubular oxygen transport membrane elements. The catalytic reactor or reactor tubes are configured or adapted to receive the reaction product stream, a hydrocarbon containing reactant stream and the radiant heat and to react the reaction product stream with the hydrocarbon containing reactant stream in the presence of the radiant heat to produce a synthesis gas stream. The view factor between the catalytic reactor and the plurality of tubular oxygen transport membrane elements radiating heat to the catalytic reactor is greater than or equal to 0.5.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment of the invention, the module further comprises: at least one inlet manifold connected to one or more of the plurality of the tubular oxygen transport membrane elements, at least one outlet manifold connected to one or more of the plurality of the tubular oxygen transport membrane elements. The inlet manifolds are configured or adapted to introduce the hydrogen containing synthesis gas stream to the permeate side of the tubular oxygen transport membrane elements and the oxygen containing stream to the retentate side of the tubular oxygen transport membrane elements whereas the outlet manifolds are configured to receive the steam containing reaction product stream; and wherein the outlet manifolds are connected to the inlet of the at least one reactor tube to deliver the reaction product stream to the reactor tube. In this embodiment, the outlet manifolds are further fluidically coupled with the hydrocarbon containing stream to mix with the reaction product stream, and optionally steam to form a combined stream that is delivered to the reactor tube to undergo the steam methane reforming reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In another aspect, the present invention may be characterized as a method for producing a synthesis gas comprising the steps of: (i) separating oxygen from an oxygen containing stream with a plurality of tubular oxygen transport membrane elements each having a permeate side located on an outer surfaces and a retentate side located on an inner surfaces of the tubular oxygen transport membrane element, the oxygen containing stream contacting the retentate side of the membrane elements and produce the separated oxygen on the permeate side; (ii) combusting the permeated oxygen with a hydrogen containing synthesis gas stream contacting the permeate side of the tubular oxygen transport membrane elements to generate radiant heat, a reaction product stream and a retentate stream; (iii) combining the reaction product stream with a hydrocarbon containing reactant steam and adding steam to the hydrogen containing synthesis gas stream, the reaction product stream, or the combined stream to form a steam containing combined stream; (iv) reacting the steam containing combined stream in at least one catalytic reactor in the presence of the radiant heat to produce a synthesis gas stream, preferably wherein the radiant heat maintains the temperature of the reaction in the catalytic reactor between about 900&#xb0; C. and about 1100&#xb0; C.; and (v) recycling a portion of the produced synthesis gas to form the hydrogen containing synthesis gas stream. The catalytic reactor is disposed proximate the plurality of tubular oxygen transport membrane elements such that the view factor between the catalytic reactor and the plurality of tubular oxygen transport membrane elements radiating heat to the catalytic reactor is greater than or equal to 0.5. Optionally, the present method may also include the step of adding a carbon dioxide input to the reactant stream or the steam containing combined stream.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In one embodiment of the disclosed method, the synthesis gas is used in a methanol production process wherein the combined stream has a steam-to-carbon ratio of between about 0.5 and 0.6 and the synthesis gas has a hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio of between about 1.8 to 2.0. Alternatively, the synthesis gas is used in a synthetic fuel production process (e.g. Fischer-Tropsch process) wherein the combined stream has a steam-to-carbon ratio of between about 0.5 and 0.6 and the synthesis gas has a hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio of between about 1.8 to 2.0. Controlling the steam-to-carbon ratio of the combined stream and the hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio of the synthesis gas is preferably accomplished by adjusting the addition of steam and/or carbon dioxide to the various streams, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">For example, a supplemental steam stream can be introduced into at least one of the hydrogen containing stream and the reactant stream. Similarly, a carbon dioxide stream can be introduced into at least one of the heated reaction product stream, the reactant stream, the hydrogen containing stream and the combined stream to obtain some dry-reforming within the catalytic reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The step of recycling a portion of the produced synthesis gas to form the hydrogen containing synthesis gas stream can be accomplished by dividing the synthesis gas product into a first portion to be used in downstream processes such as a methanol production or synthetic fuel production and a second portion of the synthesis gas stream that is recycled to the permeate side of the oxygen transport membrane elements. Alternatively, as the present invention contemplates multiple catalytic reactors, different catalytic reactors can be used to produce the first portion of synthesis gas to be used in downstream processes and the second portion of the synthetic gas to be recycled to the permeate side of the oxygen transport membrane elements.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An important feature of the present inventions is that the retentate stream is heated from the combustion of the permeated oxygen with the hydrogen containing synthesis gas stream and heat from the heated retentate stream is indirectly transferred to the at least one catalytic reactor and more preferably used to preheat the incoming oxygen containing stream. For example, to indirectly heat the incoming oxygen containing stream, a heat exchanger can be configured such that the oxygen containing stream is preheated through indirect heat exchange with the heated retentate stream prior to being introduced to the retentate side of the at least one oxygen transport membrane element.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Unlike the prior art, the oxygen transport membrane is used to generate heat and potentially steam for the steam methane reforming and such heat is transferred to a separate catalytic reactor. A major advantage in such an arrangement is that the combustion of synthesis gas with permeated oxygen is a far more rapid reaction than methane or methane and higher order hydrocarbons. In the prior art, generally a pre-reformed stream that would be mostly methane and steam is combusted at the permeate side of an oxygen transport membrane that also contains a catalyst to promote steam methane reforming reactions. Consequently, a reactive system in accordance with the present invention may use far less oxygen transport membrane area than a prior art reactor. This translates into a reactive system in accordance with the present invention that is less complex and expensive than prior art systems and further, is less susceptible to failure. Additionally, since the catalytic reactor is a separate component within the system or module, the catalyst can more easily be replaced than in prior art systems in which the catalyst is incorporated directly into an oxygen transport membrane element.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an apparatus <b>1</b> is illustrated that is designed to produce a synthesis gas product through the steam methane reforming of hydrocarbons. Apparatus <b>1</b> includes one or more oxygen transport membrane elements of which oxygen transport membrane element <b>2</b> is illustrated. Oxygen transport membrane element <b>2</b> supplies heat by radiation and convective heat transfer to supply the endothermic heating requirements of a catalytic reactor <b>3</b> within which the hydrocarbons and steam are reacted to produce a synthesis gas. As well known in the art, at high temperatures, from 700 to 1100&#xb0; C., steam will react with methane to yield a synthesis gas that contains hydrogen and carbon monoxide. Catalytic reactor <b>3</b>, as would be known in the art, contains a catalyst, typically nickel, to promote such steam methane reforming reaction. Additionally, water-gas shift reactions occur in which the carbon monoxide will react with the steam to produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen. Although the water-gas shift reaction is exothermic, the steam methane reforming reaction is endothermic and requires heat to be supplied to the catalytic reactor. Carbon dioxide will also react with methane in so-called dry reforming reactions to also produce the synthesis gas. In this regard, carbon dioxide can be added for such purpose. The resulting synthesis gas is a mixture of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and water and other known constituents such as unreacted methane known in the art as methane slip. The synthesis gas is optionally cooled and compressed within a convective section <b>4</b> to produce the synthesis gas product and a recycle stream that is fed back to the oxygen transport membrane device <b>2</b> for combustion with permeated oxygen to generate the necessary heat.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As is apparent from the above discussion, apparatus <b>1</b> functions in an analogous manner to an autothermal reformer in which oxygen is added to the reactant to partially oxidize some of the hydrocarbons contained in the reactant to generate the heat to support the overall endothermic heating requirements for the steam methane reformer. This being said, the combustion occurring within the oxygen transport membrane device <b>2</b> will typically be at least 50 percent complete so that there is virtually no molecular oxygen that will be left over to react with the hydrocarbons because otherwise sufficient heat will not be generated by the oxygen transport membrane device <b>2</b> to support endothermic heating requirements required for the steam methane reforming reactions occurring within the catalytic reactor <b>3</b>. A further point to be mentioned, is that if an operation were attempted within apparatus <b>1</b> in which the hydrocarbons contained within reactant were combusted within the oxygen transport membrane device <b>2</b>, such a reaction will typically be so slow that it is impractical if not impossible to generate the heat required for subsequent endothermic steam methane reforming because the hydrocarbons will not react to an appreciable extent within an oxygen transport membrane. The present invention takes advantage of the fact that oxidation of hydrogen and carbon monoxide is a particularly rapid reaction that part of the synthesis gas generated from the catalytic reactor can be used to generate heat while still allowing for a reasonable production rate of the synthesis gas product from apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">More specifically, an oxygen containing stream <b>10</b> can be introduced by means of a blower <b>14</b> into a heat exchanger <b>12</b> for purposes of preheating the oxygen containing stream <b>10</b>. Heat exchanger <b>12</b> could be a convective type heat exchanger or a high efficiency, cyclic regenerative type heat exchanger. Oxygen containing stream <b>10</b> can be ambient air or possibly a stream bled from a compressor section of a gas turbine. In the latter case, blower <b>14</b> and heat exchanger <b>12</b> might not be necessary. It is to be noted that no compression of the oxygen containing stream <b>10</b> is required or even desired. The blower <b>14</b> is provided to simply motivate the oxygen containing stream <b>10</b> through apparatus <b>1</b> against pressure drops produced by piping and the like. The heated oxygen containing stream <b>10</b> is then contacted with the retentate side <b>16</b> of oxygen transport membrane element <b>18</b> incorporated into the oxygen transport membrane device <b>2</b>. Although one such oxygen transport membrane element <b>18</b> is illustrated, as would occur to those skilled in the art, there could be many of such elements in an industrial application of the present invention and the oxygen transport membrane device <b>2</b> could be oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b> incorporated into a module <b>120</b> to be discussed hereinafter. As will also be discussed, the oxygen transport membrane element <b>18</b> is formed of a ceramic capable of conducting oxygen ions at an elevated operational temperature. The oxygen ions permeate through the oxygen transport membrane element <b>18</b> in the direction of arrowhead <b>20</b> to the permeate side <b>22</b> of the oxygen transport membrane element <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As a result of the separation of the oxygen and combustion occurring at the permeate side <b>22</b> of oxygen transport membrane element <b>18</b>, a heated retentate stream <b>24</b> is formed that, after transferring heat to catalytic reactor <b>3</b>, can optionally can be introduced into a duct burner <b>26</b> and used to support combustion of a fuel stream <b>28</b> to produce a heated flue gas stream <b>30</b> that is introduced into the heat exchanger <b>12</b> for purposes of preheating the oxygen containing stream <b>10</b> through indirect heat exchange. The resulting cooled flue gas stream <b>32</b> is discharged from heat exchanger <b>12</b>. Although not illustrated, if necessary, supplemental air can be injected into duct burner <b>26</b> to support combustion. It is to be noted that embodiments are possible in which duct burner <b>26</b> is not used and the retentate stream is directly introduced into the heat exchanger <b>12</b> for purposes of pre-heating the oxygen containing stream <b>10</b>. In this regard, oxygen containing stream <b>10</b> could contact retentate side <b>16</b> of oxygen transport membrane <b>18</b> at ambient temperature and without preheating. However, this would not be thermally efficient.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b> is introduced into the permeate side <b>22</b> of the oxygen transport membrane element <b>18</b> that is oxidized though combustion of permeated oxygen to produce a heated combustion product stream <b>36</b>. The heated combustion product stream <b>36</b> is combined with a reactant stream <b>38</b> to produce a combined stream <b>40</b> that contains steam and hydrocarbons that is introduced into the catalytic reactor <b>3</b> where such stream is subjected to steam methane reforming reactions to produce a synthesis gas stream <b>42</b>. It is to be noted that embodiments of the present invention are possible in which the reactant stream only contains hydrocarbons such as methane and lower order alkanes and the steam is contributed solely by the heat combustion product stream. As will be discussed, however, it is preferable, however, that steam be added to both the reactant stream <b>38</b>, the heated combustion product stream <b>42</b> and the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b>. Further, as illustrated, a carbon dioxide stream <b>39</b> may optionally be added to the reactant stream <b>38</b> or the combined stream <b>40</b> or the heated combustion product stream <b>36</b> or possibly the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b> as a stream <b>81</b>, upstream of heat exchanger <b>46</b> for purposes of enhancing dry reforming occurring within catalytic reactor <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The combustion of the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b> produces heat that through radiation as generally indicted by arrowheads <b>41</b> which together with the convective heat transfer provided by heated retentate stream <b>24</b> contacting the catalytic reactor <b>3</b>, heats the catalytic reactor <b>3</b> to at least assist in supplying endothermic heating requirements of the steam methane reforming reactions occurring in catalytic reactor <b>3</b>. If necessary, endothermic heating requirements can also be supplied through indirect heating with the use of auxiliary burners combusting part of the reactant stream <b>38</b> and firing at the catalytic reactor <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Synthesis gas stream <b>42</b> contains hydrogen, carbon monoxide, steam and carbon dioxide and as discussed above, other components such as possible methane slip. Convective section <b>4</b> is designed to cool the synthesis gas stream <b>42</b> and recycle part of the synthesis gas stream to form the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b>. Practically, it is necessary to cool the synthesis gas stream <b>42</b> before recycling such stream in a recycle blower <b>78</b>. Convective section <b>4</b> is also designed such that in cooling the synthesis gas stream, various feed streams are preheated and process steam is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the cooling of synthesis gas stream <b>42</b>, a steam stream <b>43</b> is combined within the synthesis gas stream <b>42</b> to produce a quenched synthesis gas stream <b>44</b>. Alternatively, water could also be added to synthesis gas stream <b>42</b> to add steam to the process and also increase the temperature reduction due to the latent heat of vaporization for the added water. This step is important not only to cool the synthesis gas stream <b>42</b>, but also to prevent coking of the synthesis gas upon cool down.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The quenched synthesis gas stream <b>44</b> is successively further cooled in a convective heat exchange network that includes heat exchangers <b>46</b>, <b>48</b>, <b>50</b>, <b>52</b>, <b>54</b> and <b>56</b> and water cooled heat exchangers <b>58</b> and <b>64</b>. The quenched synthesis gas stream <b>44</b> after having been cooled in water cooled heat exchanger <b>58</b> by a cooling water stream <b>59</b>, is divided into a first part <b>60</b> and a second part <b>62</b>. First part <b>60</b> is further cooled within the water cooled heat exchanger <b>64</b> by cooling water stream <b>66</b> and the resulting stream is introduced into a knock-out drum <b>68</b> from which a condensate stream <b>70</b> is drained to produce a cooled synthesis gas stream <b>72</b>. Cooled synthesis gas stream <b>72</b> is optionally compressed in a compressor <b>74</b> to produce a synthesis gas product stream <b>76</b> that forms the synthesis gas product. The second part <b>62</b> is recirculated back to the permeate side <b>22</b> of the oxygen transport membrane element <b>18</b> by means of a recirculation blower <b>78</b>. Optionally, a first supplementary steam stream <b>80</b> is added to the second part <b>62</b> to form the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b> that is preheated within heat exchanger <b>46</b> through indirect heat exchange with the quenched synthesis gas stream <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A hydrocarbon containing stream <b>82</b>, that can be natural gas and more preferably, natural gas that has been pre-reformed in an adiabatic pre-reformer, is compressed in a feed compressor <b>84</b> and then preheated in heat exchanger <b>50</b> that serves as a fuel preheater. It is to be mentioned that where natural gas is used, it will typically contain unacceptably high level of sulfur species. While there are sulfur tolerant catalysts that can be used in catalytic reactor <b>3</b>, in most cases the natural gas would have to be hydro-treated to remove the sulfur content. Further, since natural gas contains alkenes that will break down at high temperature to form carbon that can deactivate the catalyst, the steam to carbon ratio of the stream entering catalytic reactor <b>3</b> would have to be carefully controlled to prevent coking of the catalyst. In this regard, other possible hydrocarbon containing feeds include associated gas, LPG, naptha. The resulting heated stream can be combined with a second supplementary steam stream <b>86</b> to form the reactant stream <b>38</b> that is further heated in heat exchanger <b>48</b> through indirect heat exchange with the quenched synthesis gas stream <b>44</b> after having passed through heat exchanger <b>46</b>. The first and second supplementary steam streams <b>80</b> and <b>86</b> are formed by pumping a boiler feed water stream <b>88</b> in a feed water pump <b>90</b> and then passing the pressurized stream through heat exchanger <b>56</b> that acts as a boiler feed water heater and then through heat exchanger <b>54</b> that serves as a boiler to create saturated steam and finally through a heat exchanger <b>52</b> that serves as a super heater to produce a superheated steam stream. One portion of the saturated steam stream <b>92</b> forms steam stream <b>43</b> and the other portion passes through heat exchanger <b>52</b> and is superheated and then, subsequently divided into the first and second supplementary steams streams <b>80</b> and <b>86</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As can be appreciated, in possible applications of the present invention, convective section <b>4</b> may not be present where the synthesis gas is desired at high temperature. Further, convective section <b>4</b> could be simplified by providing appropriate means to cool the synthesis gas before recycling part of the same back to the permeate side <b>22</b> of the oxygen transport membrane. For example, the use of water cooled heat exchangers alone or preferably in combination with steam stream <b>43</b> or other quench stream.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an alternative embodiment of the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is indicated as apparatus <b>1</b>&#x2032;. In apparatus <b>1</b>&#x2032;, a hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b>&#x2032; is produced by reacting a subsidiary reactant stream <b>100</b> in a reactor <b>3</b>&#x2032;. Subsidiary reactant stream could be a stream containing steam and fuel in a higher net steam-to-carbon ratio than the reactant stream <b>38</b> fed into catalytic reactor <b>3</b>. Reactor <b>3</b>&#x2032; would be a catalytic reactor designed to react the hydrocarbons and steam to a sufficient extent that the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b>&#x2032; is a synthesis gas that contains methane present in an amount of no greater than 20 percent by volume. For example, the fuel could be pre-reformed natural gas having a methane content of 80% or greater, that is reacted with steam to reduce the methane content to below 20 percent by volume.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Reactor <b>3</b>&#x2032; could be thermally integrated with the oxygen transport membrane element <b>2</b> and as such, heat is radiated from the oxygen transport membrane element <b>2</b> to both the reactor <b>3</b> and the reactor <b>3</b>&#x2032; as indicated by arrowheads <b>41</b><i>a </i>and <b>41</b><i>b</i>, respectively. Further, convective heat transfer occurs through indirect heat transfer produced by contact of the heated retentate stream <b>24</b> with both the catalytic reactor <b>3</b> and <b>3</b>&#x2032;. However, embodiments of the present invention are possible in which reactor <b>3</b>&#x2032; are not be thermally integrated with reactor <b>3</b>. Synthesis gas stream <b>42</b> can then be further processed in convective system <b>4</b> or potentially could be used in a process that required the synthesis gas stream <b>42</b> at high temperature. In most cases, however, a water stream or steam stream <b>43</b> would be introduced into synthesis gas stream <b>42</b> for purposes of lowering the temperature of such stream. Additionally, it is also possible to integrate the apparatus <b>1</b>&#x2032; with recirculation of part of the synthesis gas produced by reactor <b>3</b> by the use, for example, of a convective system such as convective system <b>4</b>. It is also to be noted that where there exists a suitable hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b>&#x2032;, such as a hydrogen product stream from a conventional steam methane reformer, the same could be introduced into the permeate side <b>22</b> of an oxygen transport membrane element <b>2</b> without the use of reactor <b>3</b>&#x2032; and subsidiary reactant stream <b>3</b>&#x2032;. However, as indicated above, the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b> or <b>34</b>&#x2032; or any hydrogen containing stream used for such purpose is a synthesis gas that has been sufficiently processed so as to contain no more than 20 percent methane by volume. Any increase in methane beyond this point is disadvantageous because it does not react at high rates relative to hydrogen and carbon-monoxide, and this will generally result in reduced overall oxygen transport. Additionally, issues with coking may be present.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As has been discussed above, the hydrogen to carbon ratio of the synthesis gas product produced by apparatus <b>1</b> or apparatus <b>1</b>&#x2032; for that matter, is the central object of the control for of such apparatus. For instance, a hydrogen to carbon ratio of about 2.0 in the synthesis gas product is required for direct integration with a Fisher-Tropsch gas to liquid plant. There are 3 control handles that will affect the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of the process and apparatus as has been discussed above. Assuming fixed carbon input and hydrogen input from fuel, input steam, input oxygen, and input carbon (not in fuel) can be adjusted to in turn control the hydrogen-to-carbon ratio in the synthesis gas product. Steam may be added anywhere in either apparatus <b>1</b> or <b>1</b>&#x2032;. This steam provides additional hydrogen to the process and thus, minimizing steam reduces hydrogen to carbon ratio of the synthesis gas product. Oxygen is input through steam, carbon dioxide and as molecules transferred across the oxygen transport membrane <b>18</b>. Oxygen input from these sources, excepting steam, will generally reduce hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide ratio of the synthesis gas product. Hydrogen input is from steam and hydrogen contained in the reactant stream <b>38</b>. Decreasing steam and decreasing hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of the fuel (increasing carbon content) will reduce hydrogen-to carbon monoxide ratio of the synthesis gas product.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The process design incorporated into apparatus <b>1</b> or <b>1</b>&#x2032; allows the steam input to be reduced while maintaining margin on coke formation within the process. If carbon content can be increased in the reactant stream <b>38</b>, then hydrogen-to-carbon monoxide may be reduced further. The reactant stream <b>38</b>, as discussed above, is generally comprised of steam and pre-reformed natural gas. A carbon containing gas stream, for instance, stream <b>39</b>, may be combined with the reactant stream <b>38</b> to reduce hydrogen-to-carbon ratio of the reactant stream <b>38</b>. Carbon dioxide input at the reactant stream is particularly valuable in reducing the hydrogen to carbon ratio in the synthesis gas product. Stream <b>39</b> may be a carbon dioxide rich tail gas generated from the process, or can be recycled, or a carbon-dioxide rich gas imported from a nearby process. Having said this, however, the present invention is equally applicable where hydrogen is the desired product and therefore, the hydrogen to carbon ratio is optimized for such purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and with additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the thermal integration of oxygen transport membrane element <b>2</b> and reactor <b>3</b> can be accomplished in an elongated insulated reactor housing <b>110</b> that is provided with opposed openings <b>112</b> and <b>114</b> provided within opposite ends thereof. Elongated insulated reactor housing <b>110</b> houses the oxygen transport membrane element <b>2</b> and the catalytic reactor <b>3</b> so that they face one another for purposes of radiation heat transfer and also to allow the heated retentate stream <b>24</b> to contact the catalytic reactor <b>3</b>. A manifold <b>116</b> is provided for introduction of hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b> into the permeate sides <b>22</b> of the oxygen transport membrane elements <b>2</b>. A manifold <b>118</b> is provided for combining the heated combustion product stream <b>36</b> from the permeate side <b>22</b> with the reactant stream <b>38</b> and thereby form the combined stream <b>40</b> for introduction into the catalytic reactors <b>3</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, although three such oxygen transport membrane elements <b>2</b> and reactors <b>3</b> are illustrated, as mentioned above, there could be many more of such elements and reactors depending upon the industrial need. However, preferably, the oxygen transport membrane elements <b>2</b> are all in the form of a tube in which the permeate side <b>22</b> is located inside the tube and the retentate side <b>16</b> is the outer surface of the tube. As will be discussed, such tubes can be of cylindrical form, although hollow plate-like elements are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Although it is possible to conduct a process in accordance with the present invention in which the retentate and permeate sides of the oxygen transport membrane elements are reversed, this would be disadvantageous in that it would be very difficult to completely combust the synthesis gas and would require that the elongated insulated reactor housing <b>110</b> to be a pressure vessel. Further, it is also possible to conduct a process of the present invention in which the oxygen containing stream <b>10</b> was compressed to provide part of the driving force for the oxygen separation. This would not be desirable because it would also require the elongated insulated reactor housing <b>110</b> to be a pressure vessel. In this regard, the illustrated elongated insulated reactor housing <b>110</b> is designed to operate at atmospheric pressure and as such, is not a pressure vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In this illustrated embodiment, the oxygen containing stream <b>10</b> is introduced into opening <b>112</b> and the heated retentate stream is discharged from opening <b>114</b>. In operation, the oxygen containing stream <b>10</b> contacts the retentate side <b>16</b> of the oxygen transport membrane elements <b>2</b> and becomes successively lean in oxygen as oxygen permeates to the permeate side <b>22</b> of such elements. As the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b> reacts with the permeated oxygen, the resulting retentate stream becomes successively heated to indirectly transfer the heat generated by the oxygen transport membrane elements to the catalytic reactors <b>3</b>. At the same time, the oxygen transport membrane elements <b>2</b> also radiate heat to also supply heat to the catalytic reactors <b>3</b>. In fact, such radiation preferably constitutes approximately 80 percent of the heat transferred. Thus, the heat transferred as indicated by arrowheads <b>41</b> from the oxygen transport membrane elements <b>2</b> to the catalytic reactors <b>3</b> is accomplished by both radiation and convection. While, there is also some heat transferred directly, through the mixing of the heated combustion product stream <b>36</b> with reactant stream <b>38</b>, this heat transfer is much less than the radiation and convective heat transfer discussed above. In fact, its importance will be negligible in the illustrated embodiment given the preheating of the reactant stream <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">With reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and with additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the integration of catalytic reactors <b>3</b> and <b>3</b>&#x2032; and oxygen transport membrane elements <b>2</b> is illustrated in an elongated insulated reactor housing <b>110</b>&#x2032; that functions in much the same manner as elongated insulted reactor housing <b>110</b>. The major difference is that at least one of the catalytic reactors <b>3</b> has been replaced by a catalytic reactor <b>3</b>&#x2032; that is connected to the oxygen transport membrane elements <b>2</b> by an manifold <b>116</b>&#x2032; for introduction of the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b>&#x2032; into the permeate side <b>22</b> thereof. The catalytic reactor <b>3</b>&#x2032; is positioned so as also to be heated by radiation heat transfer as shown by arrowhead <b>42</b><i>b </i>from at least one of the oxygen transport membrane elements <b>16</b> and also, to be heated through indirect heat transfer from the heated retentate after the heated retentate has heated the catalytic reactors <b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an elongated insulated reactor housing <b>110</b>&#x2033; is illustrated that is connected to a duct burner housing <b>112</b> by means of an insulated transfer section <b>114</b>. Elongated, insulated reactor housing <b>110</b>&#x2033; functions in the same manner as elongated insulated reactor housing <b>110</b>. In this regard, the oxygen transport membrane elements <b>2</b> transfer heat by radiation and conduction to catalytic reactors <b>3</b>&#x2032;. As is apparent, however, catalytic reactors <b>3</b>&#x2032; are longer than catalytic reactors <b>3</b> and the lengthened sections of such reactors extend into duct burner housing <b>112</b> and serve as polishing sections to subject methane slip occurring within the catalytic reactors <b>3</b>&#x2032; to steam methane reforming In this regard, the duct burner housing <b>112</b> has an inlet <b>116</b> and an outlet <b>118</b> situated opposite to the inlet <b>116</b>. The heated retentate stream <b>24</b>, by means of transfer section <b>114</b>, is introduced into inlet <b>116</b> to support combustion of fuel stream <b>28</b> introduced into duct burners <b>26</b> that are situated within duct burner housing <b>112</b>. Fuel stream <b>28</b> may, as necessary, contain supplementary air to the extent necessary to support combustion. The resultant heat produced by such combustion will support endothermic heating requirements of the steam methane reforming reactions of the methane slip within the extended sections of catalytic reactors <b>3</b>&#x2032; projecting into duct burner housing <b>112</b>. The resulting heated flue gas stream <b>30</b>&#x2032; is discharged from the outlet <b>118</b> and the same may be introduced into heat exchanger <b>12</b> for purposes of preheating the oxygen containing stream <b>10</b> as has been described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The resulting synthesis gas stream <b>42</b>&#x2032; will contain hydrogen, carbon monoxide, steam and carbon dioxide, but will have a lower concentration of methane than synthesis gas stream <b>42</b>. Synthesis gas stream <b>42</b>&#x2032; can be quenched to produce quenched synthesis gas stream <b>44</b> and the same can be processed within convective system <b>4</b> in a manner as has been described above.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the embodiments of the present invention illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b> and <b>5</b> the oxygen transport membrane elements alternate with the catalytic reactors <b>3</b> or <b>3</b>&#x2032;. As can be appreciated, there could be many of such elements depending on the required output of the synthesis gas to be produced by apparatus <b>1</b>. This being said, it is important that the positioning of the oxygen transport membrane elements <b>2</b> with respect to the catalytic reactors <b>3</b> be optimized for radiation heat transfer purposes. In other words, from a radiation heat transfer aspect, the catalytic reactors <b>3</b> must be in &#x201c;view&#x201d; of the oxygen transport membrane elements <b>2</b>. At the same time, practically, for purposes of reliability and construction costs, it is also necessary to minimize the number of oxygen transport membrane elements <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, such optimization, as has been discussed above, can be effectuated by arranging the oxygen transport membrane element <b>2</b> and the catalytic reactors <b>3</b> in modules such as the illustrated reactor module <b>120</b>. In reactor module <b>120</b>, the oxygen transport membrane element <b>2</b> is formed by a plurality of oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b> that surround a central reactor tube <b>124</b> that contains a catalyst to promote the steam methane reforming reaction and thus forms the catalytic reactor <b>3</b>. A feed assembly <b>126</b> has an inlet <b>128</b> for the heated reactant stream <b>38</b>; and as will be discussed, is designed to mix such stream with the heated combustion product stream produced by oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b> and thereby form the combined stream <b>40</b>. If several of such reactor modules <b>120</b> were used, the manifold <b>118</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, for example, would in part be incorporated into such structure with an additional manifold to distribute reactant stream <b>38</b> to the inlet <b>128</b> of each feed assembly <b>126</b>. Additionally, an inlet <b>130</b> is provided for introducing the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b> into the permeate side of the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b>. Again, in case of several reactor modules <b>120</b>, the manifold <b>116</b> would be connected to each inlet <b>130</b> of each of the reactor modules <b>120</b>. Further, the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b> have the permeate side <b>22</b> within the tubes and the exterior of such tubes serve as the retentate side <b>16</b>. The synthesis gas stream <b>42</b> is discharged from an outlet <b>132</b> to the reactor tube <b>124</b>. As illustrated inlet <b>128</b> and inlet <b>130</b> can be formed of conventional gas-tight couplings that are attached to an outer feed tube <b>160</b> and an inner feed tube <b>162</b> to be discussed hereinafter, in a gas-tight threaded engagement known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b> preferably incorporates a composite structure that incorporates a dense layer, a porous support and an intermediate porous layer located between the dense layer and the porous support. Each of the dense layer and the intermediate porous layer are capable of conducting oxygen ions and electrons at an elevated operational temperature to separate the oxygen. The porous support layer would thus form the permeate side <b>22</b>. The dense layer and the intermediate porous layer comprise a mixture of an ionic conductive material and an electrically conductive material to conduct oxygen ions and electrons, respectively. The ionic conductive material is composed of a fluorite. The intermediate porous layer has a lower permeability and a smaller average pore size than the porous support layer to distribute the oxygen separated by the dense layer towards the porous support layer. For example, in one embodiment, the oxygen transport membrane element is a mixed phase oxygen ion conducting dense ceramic separation layer comprising a mixture of a zirconia based oxygen ion conducting phase and a predominantly electronic conducting perovskite phase. This thin, dense separation layer is implemented on a thicker inert, porous support.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In a specific embodiment, the intermediate porous layer can have a thickness of between about 10 microns and about 40 microns, a porosity of between about 25 percent and about 40 percent and an average pore diameter of between about 0.5 microns and about 3 microns. The dense layer can have a thickness of between about 10 microns and about 30 microns. The porous surface exchange layer can be provided with a thickness of between about 10 microns and about 40 microns, a porosity of between about 30 percent and about 60 percent and a pore diameter of between about 1 microns and about 4 microns and the support layer can have a thickness of between about 0.5 mm and about 10.0 mm, but preferably 0.9 mm and a pore size no greater than 50 microns. The intermediate porous layer can contain a mixture of about 60 percent by weight of (La<sub>0.825</sub>Sr<sub>0.175</sub>)<sub>0.96</sub>Cr<sub>0.76</sub>Fe<sub>0.225</sub>V<sub>0.015</sub>O<sub>3-&#x3b4;</sub>, remainder 10Sc1YSZ, the dense layer can be formed of a mixture of about 40 percent by weight of (La<sub>0.825</sub>Sr<sub>0.175</sub>)<sub>0.94</sub>Cr<sub>0.72</sub>Mn<sub>0.26</sub>V<sub>0.02</sub>O<sub>3-x</sub>, remainder 10Sc1YSZ and the porous surface exchange layer can be formed by a mixture of about 50 percent by weight of (La<sub>0.8</sub>Sr<sub>0.2</sub>)<sub>0.98</sub>Mn<sub>3-&#x3b4;</sub>, remainder 10Sc1CeSZ.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Catalyst particles or a solution containing precursors of the catalyst particles are optionally located in the intermediate porous layer and in the thicker inert, porous support adjacent to the intermediate porous layer. The catalyst particles contain a catalyst selected to promote oxidation of the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b> in the presence of the oxygen when introduced into the pores of the porous support, on a side thereof opposite to the intermediate porous layer. The catalyst can be gadolinium doped ceria. Further, a porous surface exchange layer can be provided in contact with the dense layer opposite to the intermediate porous layer. In such case, the porous surface exchange layer would form the retentate side <b>16</b>. The support layer is preferably formed from a fluorite, for example 3 mol % yttria stabilized zirconia, or 3YSZ.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, each of the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b> consists of an inlet section <b>134</b> into which the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b> is introduced and an outlet section <b>136</b> from which the heated combustion product stream is discharged. It is understood that reaction with the permeated oxygen and the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b> occurs within both the inlet section <b>134</b> and the outlet section <b>136</b>. The inlet and outlet sections <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> are parallel to one another and the central reactor tube <b>124</b> and are connected to one another by &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped pipe-like bends <b>137</b> that are formed from dense ceramic material like YSZ or MgO&#x2014;MgAl2O4. The oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b> are connected to a plate-like element <b>138</b> that, in a manner that will be discussed, serves as an inlet manifold to introduce the hydrogen containing stream into the inlet section <b>134</b> and an outlet manifold to collect the heat combustion product stream <b>36</b> and introduce such stream along with the reactant stream <b>38</b> into the central reactor tube <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>, the plate-like element <b>138</b> consists of two sections formed of first and second plates <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> that are connected to one another in a juxtaposed relationship. The first plate <b>140</b> has raised bosses <b>143</b>, each having circular grooves <b>144</b> to receive the ends of the inlet and outlet sections <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> of the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b>. The ends of the inlet and outlet sections <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> are connected to the bosses <b>143</b> by glass or glass-ceramic seals such as baria-alumina-silcate glass seals. In this regard, both first and second plates <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> are fabricated from a ceramic having similar thermal expansion characteristics to the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b>, for instance, 3YSZ or Mgo-MgAl2O4.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Pairs of axial bores <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> form inlet and outlet passages, respectively, to the inlet and outlet sections <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> of the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b>. A radial arrangement of grooves <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> defined in the surface the first plate <b>140</b> form the inlet passages and the outlet passages, respectively. The grooves <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> are in communication with the bores <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> that form the inlet passages and the outlet passages to the inlet and outlet sections <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> of the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b>. These elements act as inlet and outlet manifolds to the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b>. When the second plate <b>142</b> is affixed to the first plate <b>140</b>, the grooves <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> are covered by such plate and thereby form the inlet and outlet passages. The first and second plates <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> could be connected with a glass-ceramic seal of the type set forth above or co-fired with fugitive pore formers to form the grooves <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> or other internal manifold-like passages. Alternatively the manifold plates <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> could be formed from one monolithic block of ceramic. In a manner that will be discussed, the first plate <b>140</b> is provided with outlet openings <b>154</b> to the grooves <b>152</b> from which the heated combustion product stream is discharged to the central reactor tube <b>124</b>. With brief reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and in a manner that also will be further discussed hereinafter, the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b> is fed to the inlet passages <b>146</b> through inlet openings <b>156</b> defined in the second plate <b>142</b>. The inlet openings <b>156</b> are in registry within the grooves <b>150</b> when the first plate <b>140</b> is affixed to the second plate <b>142</b>. It is to be noted that although grooves <b>150</b> and <b>152</b> are provided with a chevron-like configuration, the segment making up such grooves could be segments that were not so connected. The disadvantage of this would be that there would have to be provided more inlet openings <b>156</b> and outlet openings <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the inlet assembly <b>126</b> has an inlet plenum <b>158</b> connected to the second plate <b>142</b> in a manner that will be discussed. An outer feed tube <b>160</b> is connected to the inlet plenum and the inlet <b>130</b> to feed the hydrogen containing stream <b>34</b> into the inlet plenum <b>158</b>. The inlet plenum <b>158</b> is in communication with the inlet openings <b>156</b> in the second plate <b>142</b> to feed the hydrogen containing stream into the grooves <b>150</b> and therefore, into the inlet sections <b>134</b> of the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b>. An inner feed tube <b>162</b> is coaxially positioned within the outer feed tube <b>160</b> and extends through the inlet plenum <b>158</b> to an inlet region <b>164</b> of the central reactor tube <b>124</b>. The outlet openings <b>154</b> are in communication with an inlet region <b>164</b> of the central reactor tube <b>124</b> where the heated combustion product stream <b>36</b> from the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b> mixes with the reactant stream <b>38</b> to form the combined stream <b>40</b> that is fed to steam methane reforming catalyst <b>168</b> contained within the central reactor tube <b>124</b> to react and form the synthesis gas stream <b>42</b> that is discharged from the central reactor tube <b>162</b>. Reforming catalyst <b>168</b> can be in the form of beads or honeycomb-like monoliths known in the art that are situated within a tubular portion <b>179</b> of the central reactor tube <b>124</b>.Preferably, a restriction <b>170</b> in an internal plate <b>172</b> is positioned below the end of the inner feed tube <b>162</b> and a perforated plate <b>174</b> is located directly below the internal plate <b>172</b> to ensure mixing of the reactant stream <b>38</b> and the heated combustion product stream <b>36</b>. Internal plate <b>172</b> is connected to perforated plate <b>174</b> by posts <b>175</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Central reactor tube <b>124</b> is provided with a flange <b>176</b> having threaded studs <b>178</b> that is connected to the tubular portion <b>179</b> of the central reactor tube <b>124</b> that contains the catalyst <b>168</b>. The studs <b>178</b> pass through openings <b>180</b> within the first plate <b>140</b>, the second plate <b>142</b> and a circular flange <b>182</b> connected to the plenum <b>158</b>. Nuts <b>184</b> threaded onto the studs <b>178</b> hold the assembly in place. The inner feed tube <b>162</b> is connected to a nozzle <b>186</b> by a press fit and the nozzle <b>186</b> is in turn press fit through central openings <b>188</b> and <b>190</b> defined in first plate <b>140</b> and second plate <b>142</b>, respectively. Nozzle <b>186</b> is provided with a shoulder <b>187</b> that compresses a washer-like seal <b>192</b> between shoulder <b>187</b> and first plate <b>140</b>. Seal <b>192</b> can be formed of a ceramic felt that can be a blend of vermiculate and alumina This arrangement of nozzle <b>186</b> and seal <b>192</b> thereby connects the inner feed tube <b>162</b> to the central reactor tube <b>124</b> in a gas-tight manner. Additionally, the flange <b>182</b> of the inlet plenum <b>158</b> is sealed to the second plate <b>142</b> in a gas tight manner by provision of a gas filled, ring-type seal <b>194</b> that is compressed between flange <b>182</b> and second plate <b>142</b>. A similar gas filled, ring-type seal <b>196</b> is compressed between flange <b>178</b> of the central reactor tube <b>124</b> and the first plate <b>140</b> to seal the central reactor tube <b>124</b> to the first plate <b>140</b> in a gas tight manner.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is to be noted that the outer feed tube <b>160</b>, the inner feed tube <b>163</b> and the plenum <b>158</b> can all be formed from a chromium-containing metal, for instance, stainless steel or a nickel-based superalloy.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The tubular portion <b>179</b> of central reactor tube <b>124</b> is also preferably formed of a chromium-containing metal, for instance, stainless steel or nickel-based superalloy. In such case, a coating can be applied that serves as a barrier layer to prevent chromia migration and subsequent volatilization at the metal surface. These volatilized species will react with oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b> and degrade performance. Such a coating could be a coating of a dense aluminum-oxide layer or spinel ((Mn<sub>0.5</sub>Co<sub>0.5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) provides both oxidation resistance and a chromia barrier at the surface. Alternatively, a high aluminum content alloy having more than 3 percent aluminum will form an aluminum oxide layer in a high-temperature atmosphere containing oxygen. Another possibility is to apply such a barrier coating in a known high temperature, gas phase diffusion process of nickel-aluminide (Ni3Al). This creates a uniform, dense, and permanently metallically bonded layer on the surface of the metal. When in an oxidizing atmosphere at high temperature, a protective layer of aluminum oxide will form on the surface of the metal.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As mentioned above, the central reformer tube <b>124</b> is thermally coupled to the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b> through radiation heat exchange as a dominant mode. The emissivity of the reformer tube surface is an important factor in the efficiency of this coupling. Base metal, or aluminum-oxide coatings have a surface emissivity that are too low. Generally, coatings can be used to enhance emissivity at a surface. Therefore, in addition to the barrier layer coating, a stable, high temperature coating, preferably a cerium-oxide coating can also be applied to the tubular portion <b>179</b> of central reformer tube <b>124</b> that will provide high emissivity at the surface and also not react with the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, an arrangement of modules <b>120</b> is shown that could be positioned within elongated, insulated reactor housing <b>110</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Where catalytic reactors <b>3</b>&#x2032; are used, such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, such catalytic reactor <b>3</b>&#x2032; could be in the form of tubes incorporating the coating discussed above and positioned between the reactor modules <b>120</b>. The modules in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> are arranged in such a way that the radiant heat transfer between the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b> and the central reformer tubes <b>124</b> is sufficient to provide the heat flux required by the endothermic reforming reactions occurring within the central reformer tube <b>124</b> accounting for the small amount of convective heat transfer that is occurring as well. In the configuration shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the view factor between each of the central reformer tubes <b>124</b> and all of the oxygen transport membrane tubes <b>122</b> that face each particular central reformer tube <b>124</b> and radiate heat thereto is preferably greater than or equal to 0.5.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In addition to the preferred view factors, as described above and graphically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, another key system design parameter is the area ratio. The area ratio, expressed as the area of the load (e.g. central reformer tube) to the area of the radiating oxygen transport membrane elements should preferably be equal to or greater than about 0.60 and more preferably equal to or greater than about 0.75 and most preferably about 1.0 (See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">It is to be noted that even where modules are not employed and there exists an arrangement of oxygen transport membrane elements and catalytic reactors, the arrangement should preferably incorporate such view factor and area ratio in order to employ the present invention in an industrial setting. If such view factor and area ratio are not employed, then a resulting reactor in accordance with the present invention, while being able to manufacture a synthesis gas will, in all likelihood, not be able to provide the desired radiant heat sufficient to operate the steam reforming reaction at the targeted temperatures so as to produce the synthesis gas with a hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio and methane slip suitable for a specific downstream process.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It is to be noted that the term &#x201c;view factor&#x201d; is the quantity known in the art that defines the fraction of the total energy leaving a surface that reaches another surface.
