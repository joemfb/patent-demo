<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present inventions generally relate to compositions and methods for providing agricultural chemicals comprising active ingredients (A.I.s) combined with a top dressing for application to cultivated areas of turfgrass. Specifically, the compositions are in the form of moist formulations for providing top dressings comprising active ingredients. Further, the inventions relate to compositions and methods for delivering active ingredients simultaneously with a top dressing composition to golf course turf.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Numerous types of pathogens, in particular fungi, infect turfgrass plants on golf course greens causing a loss of revenue from reduced playability. Agricultural active chemicals for controlling pathogens, such as fungicides and insecticides, are typically applied as needed depending on extent of disease pressure, pathogen population, weather, and the like. However application is highly controlled by course budget, availability of appropriate equipment, and availability of qualified personnel for applying agricultural active chemicals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One example of a common problem for golf course managers is a dollar spot infection caused by a fungal pathogen (<i>Sclerotinia homoeocarpa</i>) on many turf grass plants found on golf courses, including Kentucky bluegrass, perennial ryegrass, buffalo grass, bermudagrass, bentgrass, and zoysiagrass plants. Dollar spot blights leaf tissues but typically does not affect turfgrass roots or crowns, resulting in the formation of small, roughly circular, brown patches in grass growing areas. Most spots are merely a few inches in diameter. However, under favorable environmental conditions, individual spots may exceed 6 inches in diameter. Affected plants within the diseased spots wilt, eventually turning tan or brown. During outbreaks of the disease, numerous spots on the turfgrass coalesce into large irregular dead areas. Several types of approaches are used to control dollar spot infections, including individual applications of nonchemical, biological and chemical compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Nonchemical control is attempted by a balanced nitrogen fertility program in which adequate nitrogen nutrition is believed to result in plants that are less prone to disease. Another method of nonchemical control is to cultivate resistant varieties of turf grass, such as a L-93 cultivar of bentgrass. Further, irrigation scheduling may contribute to dollar spot control since the duration of the dew period is proportional to the extent of infection. As such, any irrigation practice that lessens the dew period may contribute to less serious disease outbreaks. Biological control of dollar spot is attempted by fertilization with composted turkey litter, bovine wastes, organic amendments and compositions comprising <i>Bacillus licheniformis</i>. Chemicals considered active ingredients used for dollar spot control include chlorothalonil, fenarimol, iprodione, thiophanate-methyl, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, in addition to being highly labor intensive, the effectiveness of these individual applications is variable, requiring multiple applications for each purpose Such applications are also expensive, requiring dedicated equipment for each type of application.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there exists a need for improved methods of pathogen control on cultivated turf grass that ideally are economically feasible for management programs.</p>

<p id="p-0165" num="0164">The present inventions also generally relate to compositions and methods for providing agricultural chemicals comprising active ingredients (A.I.s) combined with a top dressing for application to cultivated areas of turfgrass. Further, the inventions relate to compositions and methods for delivering active ingredients simultaneously with a top dressing composition to golf course turf.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">The present inventions further relate to top dressing vehicles for coating, mixing, and dispensing compositions of top dressing materials comprising agriculturally active ingredients (A.I.s). More particularly, these inventions relate to apparatus for spraying liquid formulations comprising active ingredients (A.I.s) onto top dressing materials prior to and during top dressing applications. Further, these inventions relate to applying liquids comprising A.I.s to top dressing materials at point-of-application. Even further, these inventions relate to delivering treated top dressing, specifically, to broadcast spreading of top dressing comprising sand and agriculturally active ingredients as moist and dry compositions.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">The present inventions generally relate to compositions and methods for providing agricultural chemicals comprising active ingredients (A.I.s) combined with a top dressing for application to cultivated areas of turfgrass. Specifically, the compositions are in the Rum of moist formulations for providing top dressings comprising active ingredients. Further, the inventions relate to compositions and methods for delivering active ingredients simultaneously with a top dressing composition to golf course turf.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">The coated top dressing materials of the present inventions are contemplated for use in several types of applications to turfgrass for increasing the viability of the plants and improving overall turfgrass quality.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">Since the early 1900s, golf course superintendents recognized the importance of top dressing in maintaining putting green turf. Proven benefits of a sound top dressing program include providing a smoother putting surface, finer-textured turf, reduced grain, enhanced thatch control, and similar benefits.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">When a properly chosen mixture is used, top dressing can also provide a root zone that resists compaction. A sound top dressing program used gradually, over time, modifies a poor root zone mixture and improves water infiltration. In most cases, optimum results may be obtained by using top dressing sand closely adhering to United States Golf Association (USGA) recommendations for root zone construction, see, Tables 1 and 2. This requires that at least 60% of the particles should be medium and coarse sand (0.25-1.0 mm diameter). A mixture made up mainly of medium and coarse sand will ensure that the green contains a good balance between macropores and micropores. Macropores (large pore spaces) are important for providing rapid drainage following heavy rains, and micropores (small pore spaces) help to hold moisture and prevent an excessively droughty soil. The USGA recommended range for top dressing sand is 1.0-0.15 mm. The USGA has recognized for many years that a medium sand fraction is the best sand fraction for top dressing sand. Water permeability rates for top dressing sands are rates unacceptable (&#x3c;15 in/hr.), low (15-20 in/hr.), good (20-40 in/hr.), and high (&#x3e;40 in/hr.).</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Another example of a frequent top dressing was sand in the 0.05 to 1.0 mm range with at least 75% being fine and medium sand. Sand containing no organic matter was applied about every three weeks at a rate of three cubic feet per 1,000 square feet. About 15 applications at 1/28&#x2033; per application were made during the season (Particle Size Distribution of USGA Root Zone Mix, Cooper, et al., 2004, North Carolina Turfgrass, July/August 2004. See www.ncturfgrass.org).</p>

<p id="p-0174" num="0173">Regular and repeated application of sand as a &#x201c;top dressing&#x201d; to golf course putting greens and tees is standard practice for increasing the quality of the playing greens and the preservation of putting quality. Sand top dressing increases playability by increasing surface firmness and smoothness, decreasing thatch, and decreasing grain. Insufficient sand top dressing may result in excessive organic matter accumulation in the upper soil profile. Excessive organic matter, or thatch, results in greater pest damage, shallow rooting, poor soil air exchange, and may cause the turf to be more prone to scalping.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0174">Plants grown in excess sand frequently exhibit nutrient deficiencies and rapidly changing nutrient levels due to the low nutrient-holding capacity of this medium. Sand use may also alter soil pH. For example, calcareous sands used for putting greens in the Midwest are known to have a high pH, while a fungus known as &#x201c;take-all patch&#x201d; caused by <i>Gaeumannomyces graminis </i>f. sp. avenae, is favored by alkaline soils. Bent grass greens constructed with high sand content or to USGA specifications are especially prone to this disease. Further, turf grass plants, such as bent grass plants growing on sand mixtures, often appear more succulent and more susceptible to brown patch and <i>Pythium </i>blight.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0175">Agricultural chemicals, such as pesticides, fertilizer, plant growth regulators, wetting agents, etc, are routinely and repeatedly applied to golf course turfs as part of a normal maintenance program. Rapid grow-in of golf greens is essential for quickly generating revenue at both newly constructed golf courses and those undergoing renovation. This is particularly important when using sand top dressing with their inherent deficiencies.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0176">Repeated applications of a sand based top dressing for increasing playability and frequent applications of agricultural chemicals disrupts golf course operation, increases application efforts, and itself adds physical stress to the vegetation.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0177">Golf turf grass requires extensive cultivation to maintain optimal play quality. Normal machine operations such as top dressing and pesticide or fertilizer applications are disruptive to play and produce soil compaction and turf wear, which reduces overall turf quality. Because these separate operations generally must be performed during the day when golfers are present, equipment which makes it possible to combine two or three maintenance tasks into one operation should reduce the disruption of play, reduce turf wear and compaction, save time and labor expense, and allow for more rounds of golf to be played each day.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">Current top dressing spreaders are a drop-type with finished brushes and a spinner-type. These types are used to apply wet or dry sand, and other materials, including other types of top dressing materials onto turf on golf courses, lawns, athletic fields, parks, and other recreational areas as part of a normal maintenance program. Both types of machines, especially the drop-type, are capable of applying wet or dry top dressing materials (generally sand) at fairly uniform thickness to turfs. However, these machines are heavy and produce undesirable turf compaction. The drop-type topdresser machines (topdressers) are slow and apply bands of sand merely as wide as the conveying belt that carries the sand to the dispenser. These types of machines in general range from 3 up to at least 6 feet in width. Thus the use of drop-type topdressers requires many passes over a large area in order to provide desired coverage with a top dressing material (top dressed area). The spinner-type topdressers spread material over much wider swaths (in general up to at least 40 feet in width), but spinner type machines are much heavier than the smaller topdressers. In general, the extra weight produces even greater turf damage and less uniform applications than drop-type top dressing machines.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Sprayer units are used for applying turf products to recreational turf (turf areas primarily used for recreation), especially golf course turf, and is part of a normal maintenance program. This practice generally occurs on a 14-day schedule throughout the growing season when disease, insect and weed pests are active. Sprayer units may be self-propelled or carried on other vehicles, and capable of spraying swaths up to 18 feet wide with the desired fungicides, insecticides, herbicides, soluble fertilizer, soil wetting agents, plant growth regulators and hormones, et cetera. However, the weight of sprayer units produce turf compaction and interfere with play. Further, they produce a large amount of spray drift to non-target areas in addition to providing a health hazard by exposing the people applying the spray and the golfers to wet spray residues through inhalation, skin and clothing contact.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">Agricultural formulations comprising active ingredients, A.I.s, currently used for turf grass maintenance, such as fungicides, pesticides, etc., are applied as a single operation. These applications of A.I.s are separate operations from other types of turf operations, such as applications of topdressing. Further, these A.I.s are provided and used as either a spray or a dry formulation. Generally, the dry formulations are typically more desirable to use, since the A.I. is more concentrated than a comparable spray and is easier to apply. However, both types of formulations have numerous limitations, such as allowing A.I.s to be highly susceptible to loss of efficacy both during and after application due to numerous factors. In particular, spray applications render A.I.s susceptible to factors such as spray drift, runoff from wind erosion, traffic, photodegradation, precipitation or irrigation, thereby losing efficacy, especially in the soil. Dry formulations increase the incorporation of the A.I. into the soil matrix. However, efficacy is lost when the A.I. moves into surrounding areas. Dry formulations are subject to removal from point-of-application by wind, runoff from precipitation and irrigation, traffic, and the like. Moreover, both types of formulations allow the A.I. to undergo further losses in efficacy due to environmental factors such as photo-degradation, volatilization, oxidation, and mere mechanical removal by operations such as mowing the turf grass plants.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">The inventors contemplate that by formulating and using A.I.s as described herein, specifically by adding A.I.s directly to top dressing materials, such as sand, prior to or simultaneously in a single application, these types of losses would be significantly reduced. As such, formulations and methods of the present inventions are contemplated to protect A.I.s and increase their efficacy by providing A.I.s as part of a protective layer of topdressing, which provides a greater solid volume and mass of the A.I. formulation than the usual methods of A. I. applications. Further, the formulations of the present inventions are contemplated to allow a greater incorporation and stability of the A.I. into desired parts of the soil matrix, which should overcome many of the limitations of current types of A.I. applications. For example, fungicides and pesticides are highly inefficient when applied directly onto turf grass plants due to factors such as a lack of proper placement and retention of A. I. at the most opportune site of action, i.e., where the pests are active on the foliar surface, in the upper layers of sod and in the soil. Because the majority of pest problems in turf (e.g. fungus, weeds, pathogens, insects, etc.) originate in the soil, the soil surface and the space immediately above represent a preferred area of placement for many active ingredients. It is contemplated that current application methods are not capable of providing an effective amount of an A.I. where the pathogens reside. Therefore, the capability of the solid matrix of an A. I. coated sand layer of the present inventions to retain the A.I. within its structure seems to be one key to explain why the inventors observed improved or equivalent efficacy with the use of formulations of the present inventions, as compared with conventional approaches, i.e., formulations and methods of application currently in widespread use on turf areas. This observation occurred, in particular, when the formulations were combined with the new methods of application of the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">Even further, there is a need to discover greater cost effective and simpler ways, i.e., reduced manpower for treating turf, and, in particular, maintaining high maintenance golf course turfgrass. Primarily, there is the cost and difficulty in hiring and retaining the skilled highly trained applicator personnel for first determining when and how much A.I. should be applied. Secondly, there is the cost and difficulty associated with the process of handling and applying or delivering toxic chemicals, including many active ingredients. Additionally, any one of the following is burdensome to personnel and expensive to golf courses: cost of machinery, cost of fuel, pollution from burning fuel, cost of other energy required for separate uses of powered applicator equipment, etc. For many turf maintenance operations, the cost of custom application of A.I.s due to outbreaks of pathogens and diseases is very burdensome to golf course managers.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">Previous attempts were made by others with the goal of reducing maintenance of turf grass areas by combining fertilizers with fungicides in one composition that was then applied onto turf grass. As one example, fungicides, specifically imidazolyl structurally based fungicides, were described as several types of combinations, such as combinations of imidazolyls with a wetting agent, fungicides in combination with a carrier, such as water, water and silicas, and fungicides in combination with surface active agents, such as emulsifying agents, dispersing agents, and wetting agents, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,853,400, herein incorporated by reference. However, there is no indication that any of these combinations, other than an imidazolyl in combination with an unnamed wetting agent that was sprayed onto an unnamed plant, were actually made and used. Another example of described combinations of fertilizer with plant growth regulators, including a plant growth regulator that functioned as a fungicide, i.e. paclobutrazol, is discussed in a family of applications including U.S. Pat. No. 4,704,160, herein incorporated by reference, and &#x201c;[a]fertilizer-fungicide combination product&#x201d; Lebanon TurfProScape 14-2-14 comprising PCNB (Terraclor, 1,2,3,4, 5-pentachloro-6-niro-benzene) at 12.5%, that provides &#x201c;control of many turf damaging diseases including . . . Dollar Spot&#x201d; was described in publications posted by &#x201c;Horizon Fertilizers&#x201d; at www.horizoneonline.com. In yet another example, a nematicide was disclosed specifically thiadiazole based compounds, where mixtures of the disclosed nematicide were described with a long list of materials including granulated non-adsorptive carriers, such as sand, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,861,787, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In even further published examples, sand was mixed with peat, as described in a publication by Harford TD 1000 Top Dressing Material (www.harfordminerals.net/topdressing.html), herein incorporated by reference. This reference discloses the combination of quartz with an organic (humus or sphagnum peat) and silica sand with peat for use in top dressing applications. The authors state that the material meets USGA specifications as &#x201c;Construction Blends&#x201d; comprising &#x201c;Harford Mineral's multi-washed silica sand, pre-sized to USGA specifications and blended with humus or sphagnum peat, where top dressing is available in various proportions of sand to peat: 80/20, 90110 as well as straight sand top dressing&#x201d; and &#x201c;Divot &#x26; Tee Mix-50/50 Divot Mix, replace those divots with Harford's blend of 50% USGA silica sand and 50% peat. The mix is not dried and its dark color and high moisture content enable heat to be retained for faster seed germination.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">In contrast, another publication indicated that spraying fungicide on turf grass plants growing in pots of sand would not protect these plants from fungal diseases. Specifically, turfgrass plants growing in sand were sprayed with imidacloprid, as Merit 75 WP (Bayer), and fertilized, in separate applications for successful control of <i>curvularia </i>fungus on Kentucky bluegrass plants, but not on several other grasses, such as bent grass plants or Bermuda grass plants; nor were these treatments successful in preventing or controlling other diseases that broke out on these plants. See PCT Publication No. WO 2006/023899 and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2007/0287720, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">During the course of development of the present inventions, the inventors observed that recommended frequency range (weekly to monthly) of top dressing applications is parallel to the typical application intervals for A.I.s, such as pesticides and fertilizers. Further, newer varieties of turf grass plants benefit from applications of 14-day intervals of sand topdressing, which is similar to recommended applications of a fungicide or other chemical treatments for control of pathogen outbreaks. Thus the inventors contemplated and provided formulations of the present inventions comprising A.I.s and topdressing for use as part of an ongoing maintenance practice of top dressing. In a preferred embodiment, the top dressing of the present inventions would be applied on 14-day intervals during the period of infestation or for preventative maintenance. However, single applications of topdressings of the present inventions are contemplated on an as needed basis. Further, the inventors contemplate delivering top dressings of the present inventions on an interval basis as needed for the particular application of A.I. with top dressing. This combined application of top dressings of the present inventions would remove the need for separate applications of active ingredients. The inventors contemplate that even further; the combination of operations would significantly reduce the cost of turf maintenance and improve the quality of turf grass plants. This reduction of cost is supported in part by a publication comparing the cost of separate applications of sand and fungicide, Alexander et al. (2004) &#x201c;Increasing Dollar Value for Compost Products,&#x201d; BioCycle 45, 48-51, herein incorporated by reference, including the separate applications of fertilizer and fungicide for the treatment of turf.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187">Therefore, the inventors contemplated and tested the composition and use of a variety of types of top dressing compositions comprising a sand particle carrier, as described herein. These formulations include moist top dressing formulations (i.e., liquid chemical (A.I.) coated moist sand, liquid chemical (A.I.) coated dry sand, dry sand sprayed with liquid chemicals at point-of-application, and, in particular, providing this type of composition using topdressing vehicles of the present inventions, liquid chemical coated sand that was subsequently dried prior to use, and the like) and dry top dressing formulations (i.e., A.I. chemicals provided within granules blended with dry sand, A.I. chemicals provided within granules blended with moist sand, and the like), and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">In one preferred embodiment, the top dressing material is local sand for matching the soil type and composition of root zone materials. In another preferred embodiment, the sand used is kiln-dried sand, which is then sprayed while on the conveying means prior to entering the drop or spinner units. In another embodiment, the sand is moist sand, which is then sprayed while on the conveying means prior to entering the drop or spinner units. In general, the methods comprising topdressing vehicles of the present inventions provided herein in the Examples, were conducted with moist sand, i.e. &#x2153; kiln dried sand and &#x2154; moist greenhouse sand, yielding approximately 1-10% weight per volume water prior to application. The inventors contemplate the exemplary use of a topdressing material for blending or coating in the range of 1-10% weight per volume water prior to application.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">Therefore, in one embodiment, the inventions provide a moist top dressing formulation comprising an A.I. and sand. In one embodiment, the formulation is a liquid formulation that is used to coat a sand particle. In one embodiment, the formulation is a liquid formulation that is used to form a solution with a sand particle. In a further embodiment, the inventions provide a moist topdressing formulation, which is subsequently dried prior to application. The inventors contemplate drying compositions by air-drying, drying with an on-site kiln, drying with a kiln located on the golf course premises, or near the golf course, or in the vicinity of the area of turf targeted for topdressing applications, or any manner of drying a composition of moist topdressing prior to application.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190">The inventors contemplate various types of formulations for specific applications. In particular, embodiments comprising solutions intended for spray applications are contemplated. Specifically in a preferred embodiment, a spray is prepared as a liquid solution comprising an active ingredient and a solvent. The type of solvent used to prepare solutions will depend upon the use of the formulation. For example, in agricultural applications, such as applications to turfgrass, water is a preferred solvent. In some embodiments, ethanol is used as a solvent for spraying an A.I. onto a top dressing material. In some embodiments, sprays are targeted for foliage applications. In other embodiments sprays are targeted for soil applications. In yet other embodiments, sprays are targeted for both foliage and soil.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">According to the present invention an agricultural chemical is applied to a top dressing component and preferably at least a portion of the sand component of a top dressing. The agricultural chemical optionally is itself a liquid that coats a sand particle or other top dressing particle. Alternatively, the agricultural chemical is part of a solution or emulsion that coats a sand particle or other top dressing particle. The agricultural chemical optionally is a wettable powder that is used to form a suspension with a sand particle or other top dressing particle. In another embodiment, wettable powders which are soluble or dispersible in water may be formed by mixing the chemical in particulate form with a particulate carrier or spraying the chemical compound onto the particulate carrier and grinding the whole powder mixture into a granule or particle. In another embodiment, the composition of a wettable powder of the present inventions further comprises a wetting agent and a dispersing agent.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0192">Further, embodiments comprising granules for blending with topdressing are also contemplated. Therefore, in another embodiment, the inventions provide a dry top dressing composition comprising an A.I. and sand. In one embodiment, the formulation is a solid formulation, such as a particle, i.e. dust, granule, and the like which is used to mix with a top dressing material such as a sand particle.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0193">In a preferred embodiment for a dry formulation, the agricultural chemical, A.I., is provided as a solid composition, such as a dust, or granule, which is used to mix with a sand particle or other top dressing particle. The present inventions further provide methods of application of mixed granular material, such that conventional topdresser machines would broadcast premixed compositions. However, pre-mixed material transported over long distances is known to undergo transport settling. Furthermore, transporting large volumes of sand, especially moist sand, over long distances is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, in a preferred application, mixing of granular materials of A.I. with top dressing material would occur at point-of-application. Several exemplary blender-type top dressing vehicles are provided herein for use at point-of application. However, these examples are not meant to limit the methods of the present inventions. In a preferred embodiment, blending dry granule formulations would be done using a commercially available blender, such as a Dakota 440 Turftender (Dakota Peat and Equipment, Grand Forks, N. Dak.) with an attached blending unit. This machine is designed to blend two types of granular materials for subsequent spreading (See www.dakotapeat.com/news/equipment with a blender option, and U.S. Patent Publication No. 20060006256 and related portfolio, all of which are herein incorporated by reference). In another preferred embodiment, a combination blender/topdresser machine is contemplated to be particularly well suited for blending and delivering compositions of the present inventions at point-of application. In particular, a combination blender/topdresser machine takes the separate top dressing feedstock components and mixes the components as the mixture is broadcast distributed, for example, with a Dakota 440 Turftender (Dakota Peat and Equipment, Grand Forks, N. Dak.) with an attached blending unit.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">A second exemplary machine is a TURFCO blender (See www.turfco.com, herein incorporated by reference). In these embodiments, distribution in concert with mixing has the added advantage of precluding transport settling and eliminates the need to transport large volumes of heavy material of relatively low value to the turf site. The advantages gained over current practices would include a distribution of top dressing and A.I.s with a high degree of uniformity.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">The inventors contemplate a range of active ingredients for including in compositions of the present inventions for delivering as a single application as part of routine turf grass management. In particular as part of routine top dressing applications for reducing personal time and cost of managing turf, such as found on golf courses, playing fields, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">Exemplary compositions comprise top dressing materials in combination with at least one A.I. for application to turf grass. In further exemplary methods, mixing, blending or spraying is used for combining top dressing with an A.I. In even further embodiments, methods comprising mixing, blending and spraying include the use of top dressing vehicles of the present inventions. In yet further embodiments, application of compositions of the present inventions include the use of top dressing vehicles of the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In a preferred embodiment, the topdressing/A.I. composition comprises a fungicide. In other embodiments, the topdressing/A.I. composition further comprises a fertilizer. In another embodiment, the topdressing/A.I. composition further comprises a plant growth regulator (PGR), which is often applied to highly managed, cool-season turf grasses every few weeks throughout the growing season to reduce clipping production, increase sward density, reduce seed head formation and enhance sward color (Lickfeldt et al., 2001, Agron J. 93:1164-1168, herein incorporated by reference). In other embodiments, the topdressing/A.I. composition further comprises an active ingredient as described herein as exemplary compounds. However, the inventors do not intend for these examples to limit the types of A.I.s that would find use in compositions and methods of the present inventions. Indeed, as the field of agricultural chemicals advances, numerous types of A.I.s are continually being developed and used. Therefore, the inventors contemplate including and using future chemicals as they are available for use in the compositions of the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">In general, exemplary fungicides for use in compositions of the present inventions include phenylamides, morpholines, phosphorothiolates, orathiins, hydropyrimidines, Anilinopyrimidines, N-Phenyl Carbamates, Melanin Biosynthesis Inhibitors, Hydroxyanalides, Phenylureas, Benzimides, Phosphonates, and any type of plant host defense inducer/activator that would protect a turf grass plant from infections and death. For example, an exemplary plant defense activator is acibenzolar-5-methyl (ASM, Actigard, Syngenta Corp., Basel, Switzerland). Acibenzolar-5-methyl is reported to induce systemic acquired resistance in plants, and has been shown to have antifungal, antibacterial, and antiviral activity (Cole, 1999. Crop Prot. 18:267-273, herein incorporated by reference). This chemical has no known direct antifungal properties (Lawton, et al., 1996. Plant J. 10:71-82 in office, herein incorporated by reference). However, when ASM was applied to bent grass, the number of <i>S. homoeocarpa </i>infection centers in a blend of Cato:Crenshaw (50:50) was reduced by 38%, although disease pressure was high, and turf quality was unacceptable through much of the study period (Lee, et al., NHortScience). Lee, et al., Plant Management Network. Published 26 Jun. 2003. www.plantmanagementnetwork.org/pub/php/research/2003/dollar/, herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The inventors contemplate formulations comprising sand with an active compound, such as fungicides listed herein, and further for example, those fungicides described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,853,400, herein incorporated by reference, such as benzoyl phenyl urea derivatives having insecticidal activities, for example, and those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,013,717, herein incorporated by reference, nematicidal compositions, for example, those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,861,787, herein incorporated by reference, and herbicides comprising benzoylcyclohexanediones and safeners, for example, those described in U.S. Pat.

<p id="p-0201" num="0200">Additional representative fungicidal active ingredients and representative microbiocidal active agents, for treating and preventing pathogen infections and infestations are provided. These chemicals and chemical classes are provided to illustratively include plant and general disease control agents including but not limited to fungicides, fungistats, antibiotics and bacteriocides of the following chemical families and functional groupings; imidazole heterocyclic derivative, triazole heterocyclic derivative, demethylation inhibitor (DMI), strobilurins, triadimefon, trifloxystrobin, propiconazole, azoxystrobin, various acetamides; sterol inhibitors or demethylase inhibitors; dicarboximides (such as iprodione); phthalides; phthalmic acids; triadiazoles; isophthalates; triazines; triconazoles; strobilurins; Stobin (e.g., azoxystrobin, dimoxystrobin, fluoxastrobin, kresoxim-methyl, metominostrobin, orysastrobin, picoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, trifloxystrobin, etc.); benzimidazoles; benzithiazoles; dithiocarbamates, such as polymeric dithiocarbamate fungicide is mancopper, mancozeb, maneb, metiram, polycarbamate, propineb, zineb, etc.; carboxamides; carboxides; anilides, such as phenylanilide, benalaxyl, benalaxyl-M, boscalid, furalaxyl, metalaxyl, metalaxyl-M, etc.; chlorphenyls; indolecarboxylic acids; isoxazoles; imidazoles; oxazolinediones; guanidines; diguanidines; piperidines; pyridines; sulfenamides; sulfonamides; quinolines; cyanoimidazoles; pyrazoles; pyrrolecarbonitriles; spiroketalamines; thiazoles; various chemical families of oomycete (pythium) fungicides; nitriles; chlorinated hydrocarbons; phenylpyrroles; polyoxins; pyridazinones; mycotoxins (e.g. penicillin) or other antibiotics (e.g. streptomycin, kasugamycin, blasticidin, polyoxins, validamycin, mildiomycin, and oxytetracyline); morpholines; other organic compounds such as piperalin, piperazine derivatives and tolylfluanid, bronopol, organic compound mixtures (e.g. bacticin and harpin protein), organic acids such as trinexapac ethyl, cinnamic acid and its derivatives, bacteria such as <i>Agrobacterium radiobacter, Bacillus, Erwinia carotovora, Pseudomonas flourescens </i>and <i>P. chlorophis</i>, and any varieties or strains thereof, fungi such as <i>Candida oleophila, Fusarium, Tricoderma, Gliocladium, Polyversum, Streptomyces</i>, and <i>Ampelomyces </i>and any species, varieties or strains thereof, and viruses such as tomovax.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The inventors further contemplate preferred embodiments using an herbicide as an A.I. for reducing weeds. For purposes of this invention, herbicide active agents illustratively include, but are not limited to, dintroanilines such as benefin, trifluralin, pendimethalin, and prodiamine, oxadiazoles such as oxadiazon, triazines such as atrazine and simazine, triazolinones such as carfentrazone and sulfentrazone, Aryloxyphenoxy propionates, Arylaminopropionic acid, Cineole (such as cinmethylin), Cyclohexanediones, Sulfonylureas such as trifloxysulfuron and metsulfuron-methyl, Imidazolinones, Pyrimidinylthio-benzoate, Triazolopyrimidine, Pyridazine, Phenoxys (or Phenoxies), Benzoic acids, Carboxylic acids (such as DCPA, clopyralid, trichloroacetic acid, and fluoroxypyr), Quinoline carboxylic acid, Semicarbazone, Triazinones, Uracils, Pyridazinone, Phenyl-carbamates, Nitriles, Benzothiadiazoles, Organoarsenicals, Phenylpyridazine, Triketones such as mesotrione, Ureas and substituted ureas (such as diuron, linuron, siduron, tebuthiuron, dymron etc.), Amide (such as propanil and bromobutide), Thiocarbamates, Pyrazolium (such as difenzoquat), Phosphoric acid compounds (such as glufosinate-ammonium and glyphosate, Triazole, Pyridazinone, Nicotinanilide, Pyridinone (such as fluridone), Isoxazolidinone, Diphenylethers, N-phenylphthalimides, Oxadiazole, Triazolinone, Chloroacetamides, Oxyacetamides, Phthalamate, Phthalamate Semicarbazone, Nitrile, N-phenylphthalimides, Oxadiazole, Triazolinone, Acetamides, Benzoylisoxazole, Isoxazole, Pyrazole, Pyrazolium, Triketone, and Benzofuran, various ALS inhibitors, and plant extract herbicides such as the allelopathic exudates of various plants.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">For purposes of this invention, insecticides include but are not limited to pyrethroids such as bifenthrin, permethrin, deltamethrin, lambda cyhalothrin, cyfluthrin, or betacyfluthrin; organophosphates such as chlorpyrifos; limonoids such as azadirachtin or meliartenin; phenyl pyrazoles or oxadiazines such as indoxacarb; phthalic acid diamides such as flubendiamide and anthranilic diamides, carbamates such as carbaryl (1-naphthyl N-methylcarbamate), neonicotinoids or nitroguanidines such imidacloprid, thiomethoxam, clothianidin or dinotefuran; diacylhydrazines such as halofenozide; neonicotines such as floconamid; organophosphates such as trichlorfon and pyrazoles such as fipronil. It is appreciated that multiple active pesticide agents are readily formulated within a pesticide powder operative herein.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">The inventors further contemplate compositions of the present inventions comprising a nematicide, for example, substituted 2-mercapto-5-furyl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles, substituted 2-mercapto-5-furyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives, 2-mercapto-5-thienyl-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives, 2-mercapto-5-thienyl-1,3,4-thadiazole derivatives and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The inventors further contemplate compositions of the present inventions comprising a fertilizer. There are numerous types of fertilizers that would find use in the present inventions, including but not limited to slow release, soluble, and water insoluble formulations, and synthetic fertilizers.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">It is appreciated that the amount of top dressing applied, as well as the component mixture of conventional top dressing varies with factors illustratively including soil drainage, root zone water holding capacity, water percolation rate, air circulation ability, pore space, compaction, pH level, thatch, black layer, or hydrophobia. In addition, A.I.s formulated in high concentrate granules for some treatments would remain at too high of a concentration even after blending with a top dressing material.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">As a result, the inventors contemplate providing a &#x201c;pre-blend&#x201d; for use in the present inventions for providing even greater flexibility and economy for making and using the present inventions. In one embodiment, the pre-blend mixture would allow an intermediate mix for lowing the concentration of A.I. prior to the mixing with a top dressing material at a point-of-application.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">Therefore, in one embodiment, the inventors contemplate making a &#x201c;pre-blend&#x201d; or &#x201c;pre-blended top dressing material&#x201d; for use as a concentrated form of an A.I. prior to subsequent spraying or further blending of mixtures of the present inventions. For example, a first top dressing component is added to or blended with a concentrated formulation of an active ingredient such that the pre-blend is at a higher volume or weight than the original granules and at a lower weight or volume than the intended final mixture for delivering onto an area of turf. Therefore in one embodiment, the first top dressing component is contemplated as a light weight or adsorbent material, such as ground corncobs, peanut hulls, coconut fibers, vermiculite, and the like. In other embodiments, the top dressing component is sand, peat, soil, and the like. In a preferred embodiment, the pre-blend concentrate is dry.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">As an example, the inventors contemplate a recommended range of using pre-blended sand topdressing amounts, in rates ranging from 0.025 cubic yd./1000 sq. ft./14 days between treatments on quality greens (with minimal thatch) to 0.2 cubic yd./1000 sq. ft./14 days for lower quality greens, such as bermudagrass greens with heavy thatch (Beard, J. B. 1982. Turf Management for Golf Courses p. 144, Burgess Publishing Co, Minneapolis; Beard, J. B. (and The United States Golf Association) 2002. Turf Management for Golf Courses, second Ed, Ann Arbor Press. p. 159 and Table 3.1, Ann Arbor Press, Chelsea, Mich., herein incorporated by reference). However, for last top dressing treatments of the season in northern regions, even higher sand rates are sometimes used to help protect the turf crowns from desiccation, low temperature kill, etc., during the winter. Therefore, the inventors further contemplate an amount of A.I. in granular product used in a pre-blend to range from 46%, to 50% or higher for the final pre-blend amount.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">However it would depend upon the type of A.I., for example, in the case of a product such as a urea fertilizer or a very efficacious granular systemic fungicide like Andersons Compass G then the amount is contemplate to be 0.157%, or less of the pre-blend.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">The inventors further contemplate using the pre-blend at a point-of-application by mixing the pre-blend concentrate with varying amounts of top dressing components or varied types of top dress materials to customize a treatment to serve as both a top dressing function as well as to simultaneously deliver an agricultural chemical. By way of one example, a 50 pound bag of sand having individual sand particles coated with a fungicide, is contemplated for loading into the small hopper <b>15</b>, of a Dakota Top dresser comprising a Blender unit <b>9</b>, along with a pre-blend of 1500 pounds sand, 300 pounds of loam, and 200 pounds of peat loaded into the primary hopper <b>14</b>, see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. The fungicide formulation would be simultaneously blended into the pre-blend mixture to form a composition of the present inventions as it is applied to turf in a preselected amount per unit area of turf, in a quantity sufficient to improve turf quality through top dress and to apply the fungicide at a preselected amount per unit area of turf for controlling or prevention a fungal infection of the turfgrass plants, see, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Contemplated ranges of A.I.:top dressing (sand) ratios for compositions of the present inventions depend on the type of chemical (fungicide, herbicide, insecticide, plant growth regulators, etc.) being applied to sand. The A.I. can range from 0.01 oz/1000 sq. ft. to 8-oz/1000 sq. ft. or more. Some fertilizers, soil wetting agents and conditioners, etc., would generally be applied at even higher A.I. rates, measured in pounds of A.I./1000 sq. feet. Thus the inventors contemplate an attribute of the inventive compositions of the present inventions where turf treatment of a liquid agricultural chemical component would be at a lower amount of the total weight percentage of the composition than conventional spray distribution compositions or solid applications for that agricultural chemical.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Concentrations of fertilizers would depend upon the type of fertilizer and application goal. In general, the inventors contemplate using fertilizer concentrations comprising amounts of nitrogen ranging from a half pound per thousand square feet to two pounds per thousand square feet. Such fertilizers include nitrogen:oxygen:phosphorous (N&#x2014;O&#x2014;K) ratios as described herein in the examples, and further exemplified by ratios such as 36-6-6, 18-3-12, 13-12-0, 18-4-12, 3-1-12, and the like, in general ranging as nitrogen:oxygen:phosphorous ratios of 36-18:6-3:6-12. In particular, as new varieties of turf grass plants are being developed, and as older varieties adapt to various growing conditions, the inventors recognize that fertilizer requirements are likely to also change. Thus any concentration of fertilizer that would support and further encourage growth of turf grass plants is contemplated to find use in compositions of the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">As further exemplary descriptions, active ingredients as provided herein comprising herbicidal, pesticidal, nematicidal, insecticidal, etc. activity typically would be present from 0.01 to 0.4 total weight percent of an inventive top dressing composition; a synthetic fertilizer agricultural chemical would typically present from 0.05 to 2 total weight percent of an inventive top dressing composition; and a growth regulator would typically represent from 0.0001 to 0.05 total weight percent of an inventive top dressing composition. These amounts are significantly lower than currently applied sprays and granules. These low concentrations of active ingredients in an inventive composition relative to conventional applications are further contemplated to prevent turf injury from concentrated chemicals due to misapplication or spills. While the mechanism of action is not fully understood, the properties of top dressing also promote efficient usage of the agricultural chemical and allow for less overall usage of the agricultural chemical to achieve a desired result.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">However, certain applications require higher concentrations of A. I. for effective applications. Therefore, when higher levels of A.I. are required for effective treatments of turf, the inventors contemplate a preferred embodiment of a dry formulation comprising blends of A.I. granules and topdressing, i.e., sand. Therefore, in additional embodiments, A.I.s would be applied to sand in amounts ranging from 0.025 cubic yard/1000 sq. ft. to 1 cubic yard/1000 sq. foot. Alternatively, the inventors contemplate using concentrated spray solutions for achieving similar results. For any contemplated concentration of A.I. treatment, the final concentration used will depend upon the interval between applications, and the type of grass being top dressed, and the like. Thus for higher concentrations of A. I., in one preferred embodiment, a concentrate of the agricultural chemical mixed with at least one top dressing component is provided that has the agricultural chemical present from 10 to 300 times that of a broadcast application concentration of the agricultural chemical alone. More preferably, the agricultural chemical is applied to a single top dressing component or a combination of components at a density matched to within 30% so as to lessen settling that would necessitate added mixing time upon addition to a larger volume of top dressing material. Most preferably, an agricultural chemical is applied to a volume of sand that is then intermixed with a larger volume of conventional top dressing sand and optional loam and peat. See examples described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">The inventors further contemplate embodiments comprising a variety of types of formulations for use in compositions of the present inventions. In one embodiment, the formulation is a solution, such as a spray prepared as a solution comprising an agricultural chemical and a solvent. The type of solvent used to prepare solutions will depend upon the use of the composition. For example, agricultural applications, such as applications to turfgrass, would use water as a solvent. However in one embodiment, the formulation is a wettable powder formulation that is used to form a suspension with a sand particle. A &#x201c;wettable powder&#x201d; or &#x201c;WP&#x201d; in general refers to a dry chemical formulation that does not dissolve in water but remains suspended in it. A wettable powder may also be referred to as a flowable, for example, a flowable powder, such as Cypermethrin products (Demon WP, CynoffWP). When a wettable powder is mixed with water or other liquids, a suspension spray is formed. Wettable powders in general extend the efficacy period of the active ingredient. In some embodiments, a liquid flowable (LF) contains insoluble, finely ground solid active ingredients mixed with a liquid (and inert ingredient) to form a suspension. In some embodiments, a dry flowable (DF) active ingredient is prepared as dry, granular-sized A. I. particles such that when the granules are mixed with water, the granules break into fine particles and form a suspension for application, such that advantages of using DFs include easier to measure and mix than wettable powders with less inhalation hazard to mixers.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">Furthermore, in some embodiments, &#x201c;WSP&#x201d; or &#x201c;water soluble pouches&#x201d; for example, MERIT&#xae;SOLUPAK&#xae; INSECTICIDE, Solupak 50% Wettable Powder in Water Soluble Packets, and the like, are contemplated for use in coating and spraying top dressing formulations of the present inventions. Water-soluble pouches in general contain an A.I. formulation in a pre-measured amount, such that when water comes into contact with the pouch, the pouch material dissolves and releases the pre-measured A.I. formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Thus in another embodiment, the formulation is an emulsifiable concentrate for coating or mixing with a sand particle. These compositions are prepared by dissolving the agricultural chemical and an emulsifying agent in a solvent, such that solvents may be inorganic or organic. Inorganic solvents are usually not soluble in water; therefore, an emulsifier may be used so that the three or more chemicals will produce an emulsion spray when mixed with water.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">In some embodiments, the inventors contemplate the use of microencapsulated concentrates in compositions of the present inventions. For example, microencapsulated pesticide or fungicide particles comprising an active ingredient (liquid or dry) would be surrounded in a plastic coating for mixing with water or ethanol and applied as spray or liquid for coating a sand particle or mixing with a topdressing material. The encapsulated A.I. would be released, quickly or slowly depending upon the type of encapsulation, following application. Advantages of using microencapsulated A.I.s would be to further increase safety to the human applicator, to provide ease of mixing, handling and applying, and to allow for controlled release of an active ingredient.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">In some embodiments, the inventors contemplate the use of dusts in the compositions of the present inventions as ready-to-use dry formulations that contains a low percentage of the active ingredient plus a dry, inert carrier (talc, chalk, clay, ash, etc.). Advantages of using dusts include low concentrations of toxic A.I. amounts, usually ranging from 0.12 to 20% of weight within a diluent. Diluents or dust carriers are typically talcs, clays or diatomaceous earth. Sometimes wheat flour or powdered nut hulls are used as diluents for special purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">In another embodiment, the formulation is a granular composition (GR). In some embodiments, the inventors contemplate the use of granule or pellet ready-to-use dry formulations of A.I.s in the compositions of the present inventions. In general, pellets are larger and more uniform in shape than granules. Granular compositions in general are primarily soil treatments and may be applied either directly to the soil or over plants. When applied over plants, granules tend to fall through the foliage to the soil. Some granules are applied to water either directly or over foliage. Since the granules do not adhere to the foliage of most plants, phytotoxicity and residue problems are reduced. However, new types of granular compositions are contemplated comprising foliage efficient concentrations for sticking to foliage and delivering an A.I. prior to when the granule falls onto the soil. Since granules are typically prepared in advance prior to application, the active ingredient as a smaller granule, i.e., dust and the like, is contemplated to be attached to a carrier by spraying the granules onto the carrier, i.e., sand, and then drying the composition, binding the granule to the carrier with a binding or adhesive material, and the like. In treating granules with an active ingredient, a rotating drum-type blender may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">For purposes of this invention, further exemplary embodiments of compositions of the present inventions comprising additional protectants and beneficial ingredients including but not limited to attractants, baits, herbicide safeners, antidessicants, antitranspirants, frost prevention aids, inoculants, dyes, brighteners, markers, synergists, pigments, UV protectants, antioxidants, leaf polish, pigmentation stimulants and inhibitors, surfactants, moisture retention aids, molluscicides (e.g., slugs and snails), nematicides, rodenticides, defoliants, desiccants, sticky traps, and IPM (integrated pest management) lures. In some embodiments, multiple active agents are readily formulated within a given formulation, for example, multiple active agents may include two or more of any of the following, fungicides, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and any type of active ingredient or class of active ingredient, present and future.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The inventors also contemplate compositions of the present inventions comprising, pesticides including animal and bird repellants, attractants, baits, herbicide safeners, antidessicants, antitranspirants, frost prevention aids, inoculants, dyes, brighteners, markers, synergists, pigments, UV protectants, antioxidants, leaf polish, pigmentation stimulants and inhibitors, surfactants, moisture retention aids, humic acids and humates, lignins and lignates, bitter flavors, irritants, and malodorous ingredients, molluscicides (e.g., slugs and snails), nematicides, rodenticides, defoliants, desiccants, sticky traps, and IPM lures, chemosterilants, plant defense boosters (harpin protein and chitosan) desiccants (may also be used as a harvest aid), and other beneficial or detrimental agents applied to plant or other surfaces. Additional exemplary active ingredients include phosphites, and related plant stress reduction compounds and biostimulants, many of which are absorbed through foliage of grass plants.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The inventors further contemplate compositions of the present inventions comprising active ingredients such as dew control compounds for reducing the amount of moisture on foliage. Reducing the moisture on foliage should also reduce fungal growth and reduce other types of pathogens. The use of dew control compounds include surfactants comprising monoethanolaminedodecylbenzene sulfonate and nonylphenoxypoly-(Ethyleneoxy) ethanol, siloxane copolymer, etc. compositions of the present inventions comprising active fertilizers, as described herein and in the Examples.</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">The inventors also contemplate compositions comprising sand and plant growth regulators (PGRs), which are often applied to highly managed, cool-season turfgrasses every few weeks throughout the growing season to reduce clipping production, increase sward density, reduce seed head formation and enhance sward color (Lickfeldt et al., 2001, Agron J. 93:1164-1168, herein incorporated by reference). In additional embodiments, the inventors contemplate compositions of the present inventions further comprising plant growth regulators such as trinexepac-ethyl, maleic hydrazide, gibberellic acid, gibberellins, cytokinins, benzyladenine, glycines, quinolenes, phosphoric acid compounds, organic carbamates, quaternary ammonium compounds, acetamides, ethychlozate, azoles, paclobutrazol, anilides, pyradazidine, pyrimidines, napthaleneacetamide, phthalmides, phenoxies, pyrimidines, hybridizing agent, biostimulants, seaweed extracts and herbicides (typically at low use rates), phthalmides, phenoxies, and organic or carboxylic acids (e.g. gamma amino butyric acid and L-glutamic acid, naphthalene acetic acid, clofencoet, sintofen, nicotinic acids).</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">In additional embodiments, the inventors contemplate compositions of the present inventions further comprising mulches. Mulches in general are layered on to the soil surface to suppress weeds, conserve moisture, improve its visual appearance and minimize erosion. Alternative mulches include organic materials such as animal manure, compost, leaf mould, bark chippings, shredded prunings, and compost. Additionally, the inventors contemplate using a &#x201c;peat alternative&#x201d; in addition to or to replace mulch, for example, cocoa-shell, and the crushed shells of cocoa beans (<i>Theobroma cacao</i>) that are a by-product of the chocolate industry. Inorganic mulches contemplated for use include but are not limited to pebbles, sand, gravel, blanket mulches, polythene sheets, carpet, newspapers and even cardboard.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">In additional embodiments, the inventors contemplate compositions of the present inventions further comprising compost. The inventors further contemplate the use of soir as an alternative to peat or in combination with peat.</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">Areas of turf lacking live plants or comprising dying plants may have hydrophobic soil where additional benefits of delivering compositions of the present inventions, including wetting agents, can be realized. For example, localized dry spots or patches formed by dollar spot fungal infections in turf are likely to become a serious turf management problem during the summer months, especially during periods of drought. Despite frequent irrigation, the soil in these spots resists wetting, resulting in even larger patches of dead or severely wilted turf. The applied water wets the dying and dead turf, but does not adequately penetrate the soil surface to reach the root zone. So, although soils in general absorb water, certain soils may be water repellent. In such instances, a soil wetting agent would be added to the spray solution. Certain soils, in particular sandy soils, soils high in organic matter, and potting mixes, are the most likely to become hydrophobic, resulting in excluding the liquid A.I. from entering the soil. When these types of soils are watered, such as with a sprinkler or hose, the water merely rolls off and is poorly absorbed where it is needed. Exemplary soil wetting agents are designed to overcome water repellence for allowing the A.I. to enter the soil. Soil wetting agents are granular products and liquid products. Granular products tend to be easier to use than liquid products, especially in greenhouses, because they can be readily incorporated into potting mixes. With granular products, the soil wetting agent is incorporated into granules of either clay or organic material such as coir. The wetting agent is then leached out gradually whenever the granules are watered or when it rains. Soil wetters help to overcome the effects of waxy organic coatings on the surface of the soil and the surface of organic matter, allowing the water to penetrate and be absorbed. Therefore, the inventors further contemplate preferred embodiments comprising a wetting agent. For purposes of this invention, soil wetting agents (including water absorbents) include ionic and nonionic surfactants. Active ingredients include alkoxylated polyols, poloxalene, 2 butoxyethanol, gleucoethers, propoxylated polyethylene glycols, polyoxyethylene ester of cyclic acid, polyoxyethylene ether of alkylated phenols, tri-ethanolaminedodecyl benzene sulfonate, C9-C10-C11 alcohol 6 EO ethoxylate, acrylamide potassium acrylate copolymer, polydimethylsiloxane, kelp extract, dehydrooxyrane, epihydrin, polyhydroxyethyl alkoxy alkene oxides, propylene oxide, ethylene oxide, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">In additional embodiments, the inventors contemplate compositions of the present inventions further comprising gypsum and the use of &#x201c;clay-breaking&#x201d; products that affect the chemical composition of the soil so that particles clump together and create pore spaces through which water and air can move. These substances may be added individually or together.</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">In additional embodiments, the inventors contemplate compositions of the present inventions further comprising extenders, that is, liquid solvents, liquefied gases under pressure, and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surface-active agents, that is emulsifying agents and/or dispersing agents, and/or foam-forming agents. When using water as an extender, organic solvents can, for example, also be used as auxiliary solvents. Suitable liquid solvents include aromatics, such as xylene, toluene, or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes, or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydro carbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example, mineral oil fractions, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol as well as their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulfoxide, as well as water. Suitable liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers include liquids that are gaseous at ambient temperature and under atmospheric pressure, for example, aerosol propellants, such as halogenated hydrocarbons, as well as butane, propane, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. Suitable solid carriers for extenders include ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite, or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as highly disperse silica, alumina and silicates. Suitable solid carriers for granules include crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite, and dolomite, as well as synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs, and tobacco stalks. Suitable emulsifying and/or foam-forming agents include non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxy-ethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulfonates, alkyl sulfates, arylsulfonates, as well as albumen hydrolysis products. Suitable dispersing agents include lignin-sulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">In general, adhesives contemplated for use in the present inventions refer to such compounds as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations.</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">In additional embodiments, the inventors contemplate compositions of the present inventions further comprising mineral oils and vegetable oils.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The inventors further contemplate compositions of the present inventions comprising thatch reducers. Examples of thatch reducers include combinations of sea plant extracts, meals, microorganisms, etc., that purport to reduce thatch without cultivation.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">In additional embodiments, the inventors contemplate compositions of the present inventions further comprising colorants such as inorganic pigments, such as iron oxide, titanium oxide, and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs and azo dyestuffs, and trace nutrients, such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum, and zinc.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">The inventors contemplate the use of compositions and topdressing vehicles of the present inventions for use with any type of turfgrass plant and areas of turf. In particular, the compositions of the present inventions may be applied to turfgrass plants such as Bermuda grass, creeping bent grass, perennial ryegrass, tall fescue, fine-leaf fescue, zoysia grass, et cetera. These turf grass plants include warm season grasses and cool season grass plants. These examples are not meant to limit the type of grass plant that would benefit from the formulations of the present inventions. Exemplary species and cultivars of turfgrass plants include but are not limited to Kentucky bluegrass, exemplary cultivars Adelphi, Bono, Enmundi, Midnight, Rugby, Admiral, Bristol, Estate, Mona, Sydsport, America, Brunswick, Freedom, Monopoly, Touchdown, Argyle, Challenger, Georgetown, Mystic, Trenton, Aspen, Chem, Glade, Nassau, Victa, Banff, Columbia, Holiday, Nugget, Welcome, Barblue, Coventry, Majestic, Parade, Baron, Dormie, Merion, Plush, Bensun (A-34), Eclipse, Merit, Ram I, creeping bentgrass, exemplary cultivars CBentgrass, Mackenzie, Declaration, Authority, Shark, 007, Independence, Tyee, 13-M, Benchmark DSR, Bengal, zoysiagrass, exemplary cultivar Meyer, et cetera.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">Further, areas of application include but are not limited to fairways, tees, putting greens, athletic fields, and lawns.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">The inventors contemplate making and using compositions of the present inventions for preventing, reducing and eliminating pathogen infestations, including fungal infections, insect infestations, microbial infections, in addition to eliminating weeds and any type of treatment for improving the health of a turfgrass plant and use of an area of turf, such as increasing the playability of golf course turf treated with compositions and methods of the present inventions. Therefore, the inventors further contemplate preferred embodiments making and using compositions of the present inventions for reducing and eliminating dollar spot fungal infections of turf grass plants.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">The inventors contemplate delivering compositions of the present inventions as preventative and curative means of managing areas of turf. The inventors contemplate delivering compositions of the present inventions as preventive treatments, for example the first application of top dressing in the spring, after long periods of rain, and the like. In particular delivering such compositions as curative treatments along with regular top dressing applications when turf grass managers observe signs of fungal infections, such as drying, dying, moldy, browning, graying areas of turf, or dark spots on turf foliage, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">The fungus, <i>Magnaporthe poae</i>, causes summer patch disease. The disease begins as scattered light green patches 5 to 10 cm in diameter. These patches may grow as large as 1 meter in diameter as rings and circular patches of dead or dying turfgrass that turn dull-tan to reddish-brown, or yellow or tan areas up to 1 foot in diameter, consisting of dead and dying plants. The most diagnostic of these larger patches in turf may exhibit a &#x201c;frog-eye&#x201d; pattern. Distinct streaks, crescents, and circular patterns are found in the affected turf area. Roots, crowns, and stolons are affected by a dark brown rot. Young roots may appear healthy, although dark brown hyphae may be present on these tissues. Vascular discoloration and cortical rot occur in later stages of the disease. The fungus can survive as mycelia in plant debris or in host tissue. This disease was reported infecting red fescue, Chewing's fescue, hard fescue, perennial ryegrass, and creeping bent grass, but appears to be most destructive to annual bluegrass and Kentucky bluegrass plants. Therefore, the inventors further contemplate preferred embodiments making and using compositions of the present inventions for reducing and eliminating summer patch fungal infections of turf grass plants.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">In even further embodiments, the inventors contemplate preferred embodiments comprising making and using compositions of the present inventions for reducing and eliminating snow mold diseases. Snow mold diseases, including grey and pink-crusted areas of grass in which the blades are dead, bleached and matted together. These crusted areas range from several inches to several feet across.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">The inventors further contemplate preferred embodiments comprising fungicides for controlling and removing additional fungal infections including but not limited to <i>Fusarium </i>species, <i>Leptosphaeria korrae</i>, and Necrotic Ring Spot.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">The inventors further contemplate preferred embodiments using an herbicide as an A.I. for reducing weeds. The inventors further contemplate preferred embodiments comprising a wetting agent.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The inventors contemplate that top dressing compositions of the present inventions contain distribution of the agricultural chemical throughout the top dressing. While it is appreciated that an agricultural chemical is optionally added to a large quantity of conventional top dressing and, with sufficient mixing or agitation, a homogenous distribution of the agricultural chemical through the top dressing occurs, preparation of a quantity of inventive composition needed to treat an area of several acres with conventional mixing equipment is both time consuming and of questionable quality. Owing to the different density of sand and the optional top dressing components of loam and/or peat, segregation and compositional sieving can occur during transport of an inventive top dressing prior to broadcast distribution. Additionally, handling of concentrated quantities of agricultural chemical often requires special skills and safety equipment. Therefore, the inventors further contemplate topdressing vehicles of the present inventions for use in delivering the formulations of the present inventions, as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">Specifically, the inventors contemplate &#x201c;best mode&#x201d; apparatuses as top dressing vehicles for delivering compositions and formulations of the present inventions, in particular a formulation comprising an A.I. and a top dressing material. In particular, the inventors contemplate a top dressing vehicle of the present inventions that combines a sand top dressing operation and a chemical application operation normally practiced on golf courses into one procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">The application of any active ingredient, such as a fungicide, to an area of land with conventional spray equipment is prone to numerous problems. For example, the application of pesticides with conventional spray equipment for liquid applications is prone to numerous types of environmental problems due to spills, which contaminate land and ground water, particularly near wellheads where water is drawn for human and animal consumption, and used for dilution of tank mixes for a variety of chemical applications. In particular, when spraying liquids, liquids form aerosols and are prone to cause spray drift issues. Spray drift contaminates neighboring land, crops, waterways, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">For many embodiments of the present inventions, the inventors contemplate numerous advantages for spraying top dressing materials. In particular, applying a liquid formulation onto a top dressing composition of the present inventions would not present drift problems since top dressing particles settle out of the air quickly, unlike aerosols. Even further, in another embodiment, the inventors contemplate spraying particle formulations onto top dressing materials using top dressing vehicles of the present inventions. Further advantages of using and delivering solids as in the compositions and methods of the present inventions are to overcome problems with application of pesticides with conventional spray equipment. Conventional spraying is prone to worker safety problems due to skin exposure, inhalation, etc., which is not as severe with dry applications. These types of advantages are also provided by using granular top dressing compositions of the present inventions since they are heavier than a liquid spray alone.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">The inventors contemplate that &#x2018;on-the-go blending&#x2019; and simultaneous mixing and application technology as described herein would also solve the problem of leftover spray mix when using traditional spraying methods. Normally, such leftover &#x2018;tank mix&#x2019; is wasted, used improperly, disposed of improperly, and the like, which creates waste. Further, liquid left in the spray tank often leads to adverse changes in the chemical components due to salting out, corrosion, or chemical/microbial decomposition. In contrast, the inventors discovered the methods of the present inventions reduce left over spray.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">Further, there is a public relations concern associated with the sight of sprayers operating nearby to living spaces, recreation areas, schools, etc. whereas granule applications such as applications of sand do not raise as much concern.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">In summary, the application of pesticides with conventional spray equipment is prone to environmental problems due to spray drift, which contaminates neighboring land, crops, and spills, which contaminate land and ground water, waterways, particularly near wellheads where water is often drawn for dilution of tank mixes. etc., whereas the inventors contemplate that spray compositions of the present inventions and granular compositions do not present drift problems since particles quickly settle out of the air.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">Unrelated to the problems with traditional spray and granular A.I. applications, some of which are described herein, the inventors also discovered during the course of development of the present inventions, that the majority of commercially available top dressing vehicles were found in general to lack the capability to efficiently apply topdressings to golf course turfs. Thus not only do the inventors contemplate significantly modifying currently available top dressing vehicles for use with the present inventions, they further contemplate the design and use of top dressing vehicles for more efficient application of topdressing and topdressing formulations of the present inventions while minimizing damage to turf areas at point-of application and reducing the cost of maintaining turf grass areas, including but not limited to golf course turf.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">Previous attempts were described or made to solve some of the problems related to using conventional machines for the application of top dressing. In particular, although broadcast spreaders are known for spreading seed and fertilizers, broadcast spreaders did not widely penetrate the top dressing market until the introduction of the broadcast spreading top dresser of the type of U.S. Pat. No. 6,149,079, herein incorporated by reference. In particular, the majority of commercially available broadcast spreaders utilized mesh type conveyors having hinged links that are formed from metal or similar material. These hinged links form an array of cells open at the top and bottom. These hinges would allow materials such as sand to fall through the conveyors rather than be conveyed. Additionally, such previous broadcast spreaders were often driven by the power take off of the towing vehicle, with the spinners and conveyor being driven together. This increases the power demands on the towing vehicle. Further, with previous broadcast spreaders, material was often present on the spinners at initiation of spinner rotation. This material may initially be dispensed in a clump or, at a minimum, may initially be distributed at a rate greater than under normal operating conditions. Thus, previous commercially available broadcast spreaders required a towing vehicle of considerable power and including a power take off, dispensed material in an amount greater than desired in a top dressing application and unevenly at least at the start of spinner operation. These types of top dressing vehicles would be problematic for obtaining optimal applications of compositions of the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">Top dressers of the broadcast spreading type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,149,079, herein incorporated by reference, have penetrated significant portions of the top dressing market. In particular, considerable market success has been experienced by the top dressers of the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,149,079, herein incorporated by reference, because of their ability to spread top dressing over wide areas while avoiding the problems and deficiencies of previous commercially available broadcast spreaders.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">However, top dressers of the type described in of U.S. Pat. No. 6,149,079, herein incorporated by reference, were unable to dispense top dressing at heavy rates equivalent to that with top dressers of the drop type. Prior attempts to dispense top dressing with spinners at heavier rates utilized shrouds such as ef the type disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,032,074, herein incorporated by reference, which in some cases were moveable between operable and nonoperable positions. However, such shrouds basically stopped the kinetic energy of the top dressing material being propelled radially by the spinners and deflected the material downwardly in a controlled configuration, much like a drop-type topdresser. Thus, it should be immediately appreciated that the width of the dispersed material perpendicular to the operation direction is then a function of the angle of the sides of the shroud. As such, the beneficial effect of radial propulsion by the spinners is lost, and in the case of most powered spinners, did not result in even distribution. Therefore, turf managers who owned top dressers of the broadcast spreading type also were required to purchase top dressers of the drop type to perform both light and heavy applications of top dressing in order to compensate for the uneven applications of topdressing from the spinner-type machines.</p>
<p id="p-0254" num="0253">Particularly and specifically for heavy applications, the distribution pattern for materials distributed by one or more spinners of a broadcast spreader is often uneven. The distribution of material can be uneven along either or both the direction that the broadcast spreader is moving and the width perpendicular to the direction that the broadcast spreader is moving. Controlling the distribution of material along the direction that the broadcast spreader is moving is typically controlled by a combination of spinner configuration, broadcast spreader ground speed and spinner velocity. However, controlling the distribution of material from a powered broadcast spreader perpendicular to the direction that the spreader is moving has not been satisfactorily addressed by prior broadcast spreaders. Thus, prior broadcast spreaders have continued to generate an uneven depth of material perpendicular to the direction of the broadcast spreader's movement. Generally, the uneven depth is an artifact of loading the material at a particular location on the spinner. The placement of material at a particular position on the spinner will inherently concentrate the distribution of that material within a particular radial arc about the axis of rotation of the spinner. The particular radial arc is determined by the configuration of the spinner and the speed that the spinner is rotating. Providing multiple spinners typically merely changes the distribution profile across the perpendicular and, typically, results in an uneven distribution profile across the perpendicular. Thus spinner type machines that are capable of distributing even layers of top dressing material would be preferred for use in the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0254">Finally, none of these devices comprises compositions and methods for point-of-application liquid coating of top dressing materials.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0255">The inventors show a need for providing a top dressing vehicle capable of use in the present inventions. The inventors contemplate top dressing vehicles for combining individual chemical applications and top dressing applications (individual operations normally practiced on golf courses) into one procedure by providing a new type of top dressing vehicle comprising, a topdressing vehicle and a chemical spray unit, i.e. sprayer. This combination of operations was contemplated to be accomplished in its simplest embodiment, by attaching a chemical spray nozzle to a commercially available topdressing vehicle. Exemplary top dressing vehicles, in addition to those described herein, include, but are not limited to, those topdressers disclosed in exemplary U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,307,952, 4,438,873, 5,307,952, 5,287,999, 6,149,079, 6,932,286 and U.S. Published Patent Application Nos. 20030155453, 20030089805, 20030098373, and 20060006256, each of which is herein incorporated in its entirety. In a further embodiment, a sprayer unit comprising a tank, pump, valves, compressor unit, spray nozzles, in addition to any component compatible with the function of a sprayer unit, are mounted onto top dressing vehicles, such as exemplary finishing brush drop-type topdressers and spinner-type topdressers, both of which are currently commercially available. Commercially available topdressing vehicles do not have any type of attachment for spraying a substance, such as a liquid or solid, onto a top dressing material. Even further, none of the commercially available top dressers were designed for use in blending toxic chemicals with top dressing materials. Even further, none of the commercially available top dresser vehicles were designed for applying or delivering toxic chemicals. Thus the inventors further contemplate embodiments of top dressing vehicles that are specifically designed for use with solid and liquid forms of chemicals. In yet further embodiments, the inventors contemplate making dedicated top dressing vehicles of the present inventions comprising sprayer units for incorporating embodiments as described herein for new types of commercial top dressing vehicles.</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0256">The inventors further contemplate embodiments of top dressing vehicles that are specifically designed for optimal weight distribution over tire area to protect turf. In additional embodiments, the inventors contemplate a top dressing vehicle comprising flow adjustor units for automatically calculating and adjusting the flow rate from either the nozzles or directly released by a flow valve in between a tank and hose leading to the nozzles, i.e. the amount of sprayed formulation and volume of top dressing material vs. forward speed of the machine. Further contemplated is downsizing the sand bin of current vehicle designs, providing more area available for attaching a sprayer unit. See, for example, a Dakota 440. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Therefore, a top dressing vehicle of the present invention would have a similar size and weight of current top dressing machines while incorporating the weight of filled spray tanks and a sprayer unit with the additional function for providing a sprayed material for delivering to an area of turf.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0257">The inventors contemplate in one embodiment, applying a concentrated spray solution to a top dressing material, in particular sand, through commercially available spray nozzles mounted just above a conveyor belt that carries sand from a bin to the finishing brush or to the spinners, depending on the type of top dressing vehicle. In either configuration, the sand would be treated just prior to being spread on the turf as a moist material. As the sand exits the machine, mixing of the treated sand with any remaining untreated sand would occur so that an active ingredient (A.I.) is applied evenly across the turf treated with the swath of sand. The inventors contemplate adjusting volume and spread width of sand, such as the adjusting capability of certain current topdressers, for example, a Dakota 440 with a control means for adjusting application parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0258">Further, in one preferred embodiment of the present inventions, the top dressing material is pre-coated by a top dressing vehicle comprising a conveying means for dispensing the top dressing material, and a means for spraying top dressing during dispensing. In one embodiment, the means for spraying is a sprayer, comprising a tank, pump, valves, hose, nozzle and means for moving the formulation from the tank, through the hose, optionally into a pipe and ending at a nozzle for evenly spraying the formulation onto the top dressing material. In a preferred embodiment, the top dressing vehicle is capable of spraying a top dressing material, such as sand, with formulation as the sand moves along the conveyer means, just before it drops onto the turf or is spun out/broadcast onto an area of turf. Examples of a means for moving the formulation include but are not limited to hydraulic and electrical units.</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0259">In one preferred embodiment of the present inventions, a top dressing vehicle of the present inventions provides a wet top dressing material coated with a formulation comprising an AI. In one further embodiment, the coated top dressing is conveyed, such as by an elevator unit, into a topdresser vehicle as moist material. Further, in one embodiment, the wet coated top dressing is applied by the topdresser vehicle as a moist material to an area of turf. In one preferred embodiment the wet material is dispensed using a spinner unit of a top dressing vehicle. In one preferred embodiment, the moist material is dispensed using a finishing brush unit of a topdresser vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0260">In another embodiment, the coated moist top dressing material undergoes drying prior to application to an area of turf. In another further embodiment, the coated top dressing is conveyed onto a surface for drying. Drying may be done in several ways, such as drying the coated material in an onsite kiln, spreading the material out on the ground or on a drying surface, such as concrete or plastic, for air drying, and by adding a drying ingredient for removing the moisture from the coated top dressing material.</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0261">Specifically, the inventors contemplate advantages of top dressing vehicles of the present inventions, in other words a two-in-one sprayer/topdresser design over the current practices and top dressing devices without spray attachments include: 1) less damage to golf course turfs as two trips over the turf (spraying and top dressing) with heavy equipment are reduced to one trip, 2) savings in time and labor costs, 3) less interruption of play, and 4) reduced golfer anxiety as the pesticide/fertilizer applications are concealed in a sand application.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0262">Further, the inventors contemplate advantages of top dressing vehicles of the present inventions as two-in-one sprayer/topdresser design over the recently developed and marketed granule/sand blending machine, including: 1) a greater number of A.I.-treated particles being distributed to the turf, 2) better distribution of A.I. over the spread swath because no particle mass (weight) differences exist between the heavier sand and the lighter chemical granules, 3) the ability to use moist/wet sand (cost savings) without fear of &#x201c;gumming up&#x201d; the equipment or sand due to dissolving particles, 4) time, equipment, and labor savings because the blended granule/sand material does not have to be loaded into a standard topdresser for application, 5) lower equipment costs because a separate topdresser is not required, 6) the ability to adjust sand application volumes at will without affecting the rate of chemical/fertilizer application, 7) no left-over treated sand product to store or dispose of, and 8) potentially greater selection of A.I.s that could be sprayed on the sand.</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0263">Even further contemplated advantages of making and using top dressing vehicles of the present inventions as two-in-one sprayer/topdresser designs and applications over the pre-treated and dried sand of conventional applications include: 1) time, labor, and equipment cost savings in the preparation of the treated sand, 2) less worker exposure during the preparation and application procedures, 3) the ability to use wet or dry sand of any type and in any application volume, 4) reduced equipment costs compared to treating and drying sand, 5) no shipping costs to get the treated sand to the end user, 6) time, labor, and equipment cost savings in the application.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0264">The inventors further contemplate a top dressing vehicle with an adjustable foam-marking boom to allow the operator to locate the edges of the throw pattern. This will prevent skips and over-laps, which result in either untreated or damaged turf. Spinners that require 100% overlap greatly reduce skips and overlaps. Additionally, as currently available on some commercial sprayers, spray volume could possibly be correlated with ground speed to increase/reduce spray volumes to the sand to adjust for increased/decreased ground speeds. This unit could be used to apply virtually any materials that can be sprayed on golf course turfs.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0265">The inventors contemplate methods of providing a top dressing vehicle of the present inventions by attaching sprayer units to currently commercially available topdresser machines. In further embodiments, the foam marking units would be supplied and attached to specially designed top dressing vehicles of the present inventions. The inventors contemplate devices for combining the chemical applications and sand top dressing applications normally practiced on golf courses into one procedure by mounting a chemical spray tank, pump, spray nozzles, etc., onto finishing brush drop-type topdressers and spinner-type topdressers, both of which are currently commercially available. As described herein, the inventors contemplate attaching sprayer units onto topdressing vehicles for providing and using formulations of the present inventions. In one embodiment, a topdresser vehicle is a brush drop-type topdresser machine. Exemplary finishing brush drop topdresser machines are also shown in the Figures and described herein in the Examples.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0266">In a preferred embodiment, a topdresser vehicle is a spin-type top dresser vehicle. An exemplary BTD-05 Bannerman Ultra Spin Topdresser has dual hydraulically driven disks that broadcast top dressing material to various widths. Maximum spread width is 12-feet, and the literature indicates a capability of spreading sand, peat, top dressing mix, rock salt and grit. With a holding capacity of 1.5 cu. Yds of material, the BTD-05 is listed with a capacity to be calibrated to achieve cost control of the materials to be spread prior to dispensing, is powered by tractor hydraulics or an optional engine drive hydraulic power pack, and has a &#x201c;Walking-beam axle&#x201d; such that tires never leave the turf surface. In particular, treadless turf tires provide a consistent pressure of only 10-12 p.s.i. on the surface, in addition to a variable-speed conveyor floor. See www.sportsturfmagic.com).</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">Another exemplary top dressing spinner machine as shown in the Figures is commercially available from Dakota Sand and Peat and contemplated for use in the present inventions. The inventors contemplate the use of a Dakota Peat &#x26; Equipment 440 that has an eight cubic foot blender option for the Dakota 440 Turf Tender that allows superintendents to blend materials on site. Thus, in one embodiment, the sprayer is mounted over the axle, on the left side of the Dakota 440 (opposite side of the side conveyor) and other spinner-type topdressers, with a nozzle(s) mounted over or beside the sand conveyor belt at the rear of the machine, just above, and in front of the spinners. The Dakota 440 has a long, open sand belt area just before the sand falls onto the spinners. If the nozzle was mounted directly above the belt, an even-pattern flat fan band spray nozzle with a capacity of 1 gallon/minute (Ex.: Tee Jet 8010E or 11010E) to 1.5 gallon/minute (Ex.&#x2014;TeeJet 8015E or TeeJet 11015E) would deliver sufficient spray volume to apply a 10-15 gallon/acre (GPA) spray volume to sand being applied to 4048+ sq. ft. in a 20 ft. swath traveling at 2.3 MPH in a 1 minute duration.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0268">In one embodiment, the nozzle(s) are mounted above and to the side of the sand belt at the rear of the machine (as an example, the Dakota 440 has 2 ideal locations for mounting nozzles, see, Figures). An off-center, directed band spray nozzle could possibly be used, with a TeeJet OC12 or OC16 nozzle delivering 1.0-1.5 gallons/minute to the sand on the conveyor belt. Off-center nozzle tips apply an even band of spray below, and off to the side of the nozzle itself. The number and size of nozzles used may depend on various factors such as travel speed, swath width; sand volume applied and desired GPA. Some flexibility could be achieved through the use of a rotating spray head, which might contain 3 or more individual nozzles of various capacities. The operator (or computer) would simply rotate the spray head to utilize the appropriate spray tip for the speed of travel, swath width, and desired sand volume. Rotating spray heads already in use on spray booms for agriculture uses are contemplated for use with top dressing vehicles of the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">In another embodiment, the inventors contemplate using a sprayer mounted onto a top dressing vehicle comprising a conveying means and a blending means. Therefore, in one example, a blending means is a mechanical blender capable of mixing a top dressing material, such as sand, with another solid material, such as peat, compost, and the like, prior to application of a spray formulation. An exemplary vehicle applicable to the present invention comprising a conveying means and further comprising a blending means, and even further comprising an elevator attachment, is a Dakota 440 Blender (Dakota Sand and Peat Company). The Dakota 440 Blender is a sand/granule blender trailer machine that deposits the blended product into a traditional topdresser, via the elevator, for application to the turf. These blended granules may be impregnated with pesticides, plant growth regulators, fertilizers, etc. However these machines do not have a spray attachment or a means for spraying a formulation onto a top dressing material. The inventors contemplate that any vehicle comprising a conveying means is applicable to the present invention. In another preferred embodiment, the inventors contemplate spraying a formulation onto a top dressing material and using a conveying means such as an elevator of an exemplary Dakota 440 Blender machine to convey coated top dressing material into a top dressing machine for distributing the moist material onto turf or for dropping the material onto the ground while the Dakota 440 Blender machine is stationary or moving.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">The inventors further contemplate that any type of compost blending machine is applicable for use in the present inventions for attaching a sprayer.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">In general, any type of sprayer unit capable of dispensing liquids or powders is contemplated for use in the present inventions. Basic components of sprayer units include but are not limited to desired combinations of tanks, valves, hoses, nozzles, pumps, compressors, strainers, couplings/fittings, wands, controllers, regulators, et cetera.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">In preferred embodiments, sprayer unit parts are contemplated for attachment to top dressing vehicles. Various means of attachment are contemplated, however, any means for attaching a sprayer unit, including, but not limited to, attaching any individual sprayer part, directly and indirectly, are included. Examples of means for direct attachment of a sprayer unit and/or parts include, but are not limited to, C-clamps, tape, clip-on parts, such as clip on spray nozzles (United States Plastic Corp., Lima Ohio), U-bolts, and the like. Examples of means for indirect attachment of a sprayer unit and/or parts include, but are not limited to, welding tank holders, tank clamps, pump clamps, hose clamps, nozzle clamps, bars, booms, etc., onto top dressing vehicles. Further means for indirect attachments include any means for bolting, screwing, etc., a sprayer unit onto a top dressing vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0273">Attachments may be permanent, such as built-in. For example, a nozzle spring clamp can be welded to a top dressing vehicle, tank holding clamps or straps, and hose clips can be bolted onto a top dressing vehicle, and the like. In other embodiments, attachment is temporary, for example, taping a sprayer part onto at top dressing vehicle, such as a nozzle, hose, and the like. In other embodiments, the sprayer unit is a detachable unit. For example, a sprayer unit comprising any of the sprayer parts, such as a tank and pump, may be readily detached from a top dressing vehicle. Alternatively, a detachable sprayer unit may be readily attached to a top dressing vehicle using indirect permanent attachments to the top dressing vehicle. Therefore, in another embodiment, the attached sprayer unit may be configured as a detachable unit.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0274">Therefore, in one embodiment, a sprayer unit is contemplated for attaching to either side or both sides of the top dressing hopper on the spinner-type machines and on the front hitch area for the drop-type topdressers. In another embodiment, the topdressing vehicle comprises permanently attached nozzle clips.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0275">However, for other embodiments, a sprayer unit is contemplated for use as an unattached unit, where the nozzle is attached to the top dressing vehicle. For example, a hand-held sprayer unit sprays through a nozzle attached to a top dressing vehicle. In some embodiments, the unattached unit is a hand-held sprayer. In other embodiments, the sprayer is used as an unattached unit for providing a composition of the present inventions. In some embodiments, the nozzle used with an unattached unit is a hand held wand. In other examples, the nozzle is attached to the top dressing machine. For example, in one embodiment, a sprayer unit is contemplated for use mounted on a flatbed for use in the present inventions. The flatbed may be mobile or immobile. A mobile flatbed would find use with smaller topdressing vehicles where the extra weight of the sprayer unit and liquid chemicals would harm the turf due to compaction. In another embodiment, the flatbed is mobile for moving along with the top dresser vehicle, wherein the nozzles are attached to the vehicle. In another embodiment, the flatbed is immobile, for use in coating a topdressing material prior to application. In a further embodiment, the immobile flatbed finds use for coating topdressing material provided by a blender type topdressing vehicle, such as a Dakota 440, wherein the nozzle(s) are attached to the topdressing vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0276">The inventors contemplate the use of any suitable chemical tank for use in the present inventions. Exemplary tanks are provided by the tank size, such as 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 80-gallon tanks. The optimal size of the tank is a small tank, such as a 5, 10, and 20 up to a 50-gallon tank. However the optimal tank size for the vehicle will depend on several variables including but not limited to the concentration of the spray formulations (gallons/acre) intended for use, the weight of the topdresser, and how much sand the superintendent intends to deliver as regular treatments.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0277">Tank sizes are contemplated to match certain factors as follows. On the spinner type machines, the spray area is typically a 10&#x2033;-12&#x2033; conveying means, i.e. belt, with a range of swath widths from 12&#x2032;-36&#x2032; such that a 1&#xd7;-3&#xd7; spray volume tank capability is contemplated to accommodate these ranges. By adding in variables such as various ground speeds, it becomes apparent that volume adjustments, such a flow adjusters, are necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">In the examples, the inventors are delivering the sand at the low end of the recommended amount, such as those quantities recommended by an acknowledged expert (Beard, J. B. 1982. Turf Management for Golf Courses p. 144, Burgess Publishing Co., Minneapolis; Beard, J. B. (and the United States Golf Association) 2002. Turf Management for Golf Courses, second ed., Ann Arbor Press. p. 159 and Table 3.1, Ann Arbor Press, Chelsea, Mich., herein incorporated by reference). However the inventors contemplate other amounts for delivering top dressing as recommended in the above references.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">Thus in the compositions of the present inventions, the amount of spray applied was 9 gallons/acre, on the low end of recommended amounts based upon the average concentration of commercially available chemicals. However, the inventors contemplate even further lowering of the amount of liquid necessary for a treatment, up to 50%, or greater, such that using a 9 GPA spray solution, a spray tank with a 50-gallon capacity, would be the minimum size contemplated for the smaller topdressers of 1 cubic yard sand capacity, such as the Dakota 410 top dresser. At 9 GPA and the exemplary 1.1 cu. yd. sand/applied in the examples, this would allow for an estimated 5 re-fills of the sand hopper (covering 5.5 acres) for every refill of the spray tank. Another exemplary tank size calculation provided for the Dakota 440 with a 5 cubic yard hopper capacity, the estimated necessary tank capacity would be at least a 150-gallon tank at recommended A.I. concentrations. This would allow for 3 re-fills (for 13 acres of coverage) of the larger hopper <b>14</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for every spray tank <b>3</b>, re-fill. For contemplated concentrated spray solutions, undiluted concentrates, the inventors estimate using a 5-gallon tank on small topdressers and a 15-gallon tank on the large units. In one embodiment, a tank is contemplated for mounting over the axle of a top dressing vehicle, for example on the left side of a Dakota 440 (opposite side of the side conveyor) and where appropriate on other spinner-type topdressers. However, the inventors contemplate the use of larger tanks for applying and delivering A.I.s at current application rates.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">However, on top dresser machines of the present inventions, where the sizes of the sand hoppers are contemplated for reduced sizes of sand hoppers in order to compensate for the extra weight of the spray unit, in order to avoid damaging weight compaction of turf, tanks on the smaller size, 50 gallons or less, are contemplated for use. The inventors contemplate reducing water volumes needed in the tanks for the spray solutions, as far as possible, while retaining efficacy, to provide an even coverage of A.I. to the topdressing, with no visible turf phytotoxicity after treatment of the grass plants, and without nozzle plugging during treatment. Tank size will also depend on what size the current topdresser designs will accommodate. Therefore, the inventors further contemplate using custom contoured tanks, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">The inventors further contemplate the use of valves, compressors, and pumps as additional components of a sprayer unit. The inventors contemplate using valves compatible with the sprayer systems of the present inventions. Various types of valves are contemplated, including regulator valves, regulated manually or automatically. Other types of valves include shut off valves, for example an emergency shut off valve, ball valve et cetera.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">The inventors contemplate using compressors compatible with the sprayer systems of the present inventions, such that the compressor provides sufficient pressure for combination of tank size, valves, hose diameters, hose lengths, etc., for providing a desired flow rate through the attached nozzles, for example providing a specific p.s.i. (pounds per sq. inch) of liquid ejected from the nozzle. In a preferred embodiment, the inventors contemplate a CO<sub>2 </sub>sprayer attached to the top dressing vehicle for blending, dropping and spinner applications. An exemplary CO<sub>2</sub>-powered sprayer, see, for example, www.masspray.com, is provided for use in the present inventions. The inventors contemplate the use of a larger capacity sprayer unit, i.e. larger in volume, than used for the Examples described herein. Specifically, the inventors contemplate a sprayer system capacity capable of treating a top dressing, i.e., sand moving onto an exemplary 40&#x2032; swath at 7 MPH (miles per hour) axle speed. In another embodiment, an exemplary speed of application is broadcasting a 12&#x2032;-20&#x2032;-swath at a 3-5 MPH axle speed. In particular, the inventors contemplate the use of an electric pump. In another embodiment, the inventors contemplate the use of a hydraulic pump as part of a tank sprayer unit. The inventors further contemplate the use of a CO<sub>2 </sub>compressor.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">Regarding the Dakota 440 and a sprayer attachment, the inventors contemplate a blender option, in one embodiment for commercial availability, where a sprayer unit is installed/attached to the machine location in place of the granule bin <b>15</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. This would provide a large area for the spray curtain to cover the conveyor belt, covered with topdressing material, before the top dressing drops onto the next conveyor, in addition to allowing greater operator access to the sprayer equipment. In other embodiments, where both granule blending and sprayed sand options are included in the same machine, the inventors contemplate design changes to house the spray tank, pump, etc., see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> for examples. Where multiple options are provided, the nozzles are contemplated to be attached in a location for applying a spray near the base of the elevator (after the sand has dropped onto the belt), using the elevator housing to support the nozzles, for example, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. Alternatively, the inventors contemplate attaching nozzles where the belt passes under the granule-blending unit for spraying the sand as it drops onto the belt. In other embodiments, the spray unit is attached at the rear of the Dakota 440 TurfTender for spraying the belt conveying means. In this embodiment, a nozzle would be attached where the spray coat sand being moved on top of the conveying means before the sand drops onto the spinners, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">These examples are not meant to limit the type of sprayer unit, nor types of components, such as valves, compressors, pumps, nozzles, hoses, etc., nor location of sprayer unit or components. Any sprayer unit capable of applying the formulations of the presenting inventions when attached to a topdresser vehicle finds use in the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">Nozzles contemplated for use in the present inventions include but are not limited to commercially available nozzles. Any nozzle capable of providing a uniform application across a topdressing material, including mixtures of top dressing materials, sand, and the like, are contemplated for use.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">In general, the nozzles would preferably be attached toward the rear of the top dressing machine (drop-type, and spinner-type). However other locations are contemplated depending upon the type of top dressing vehicle being used. The inventors contemplate attaching one or more nozzles mounted above or at the side of a sand conveyor belt at the rear of a top dressing machine, just above, and in front of the spinners. As one example, the Dakota 440 TurfTender has an accessible, long, open sand belt area just before the sand falls/drops onto the spinners. However, any location is contemplated where appropriate on other spinner-type topdressers and drop-type top dressing machines. Many brush-drop type topdressers have space in front of the sand bin for a sprayer unit and large areas of access to the conveyer belt where nozzles could be mounted behind the sand bin, just in front of the brushes.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">In a preferred embodiment for both types of top dressing vehicles, the attached nozzle is an even-pattern nozzle (also called band nozzles), such that, in one embodiment, an exemplary nozzle is directly mounted directly above a conveying means, such as a belt. See, for example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4D and 5B</figref>. In these examples, the inventors used an even pattern flat fan band spray nozzle with a capability of allowing a flow of 1 gallon/minute (for example, a Tee Jet 8010E, 11010E, and the like, TeeJet Technologies, Carol Stream, Ill.) for at least allowing a flow of 1.5 gallon/minute (for example, a TeeJet 8015E, TeeJet 11015E, and the like). These nozzles are contemplated to deliver a sufficient spray volume for applying an exemplary range of 10-15-gallon/acre spray volume to sand as the sand is being distributed/applied to a 4000+ sq. ft. area of turf as a 20 ft. swath, while the vehicle is traveling at 2.3 MPH in a 1 minute duration.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">In general, any nozzle that sprays a liquid in a preferable flat spray pattern is also contemplated for use. Nozzles contemplated for use in the present inventions are attached at an approximate 95-degree angle for spraying approximately 0.2 gallon/minute at 40 PSI. In a further embodiment, a TeeJet Flat Fan 9502E nozzle is contemplated for use.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">As used herein, the &#x201c;E&#x201d; of the nozzle number refers to the capability of the nozzles to spray the same volume across the entire pattern (band), see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>. E nozzles are not meant to be overlapped. However other types contemplated for use include flood jet nozzles, cone jet nozzles, twin jet nozzles, full jet nozzles, etc. These other types of nozzles would allow changing spray volumes to accommodate various swath widths, ground speeds, etc. on the top dressing machines.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">On the other hand, the inventors contemplate one nozzle type and size for attaching to top dressing vehicles for each of the applications, regardless of sand volume, travel speed, or swath width. The nozzle height above the sand belt would depend on the nozzle type finally selected. A 110 degree even band nozzle would likely be mounted 4&#x2033;-6&#x2033; above the sand belt, while an 80 or 95 degree even band nozzle would likely be mounted at 5&#x2033;-7&#x2033; above the sand belt. An off-center, directed spray nozzle would likely be mounted less than 9&#x2033; above and a few inches to the right or left side of the sand belt. The sand belt itself is about 1&#x2032; wide on the 440. The objective would be to apply an even band of spray to the entire width of the sand belt, whichever nozzle is selected. For using nozzles with the drop-type belt topdressers, a preferred embodiment is to attach more than one nozzle as close as possible to the sand to minimize wind interference and drift. A single nozzle was not found to be applicable to the drop-type top dressers because even a 110 degree even spray pattern nozzle would have to be mounted too high (above the machine) in order to cover a 5-6 ft swath. In a preferred embodiment, the topdressing vehicles have attached even-pattern nozzles each spraying approximately an 18&#x2033; band on the wide belt top dressers.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">For using nozzles with the spinner-type topdressers, a preferred embodiment is to attach at least one nozzle, as described for the drop-type top dressing vehicles. In even further embodiments, the inventors contemplate a top dressing vehicle with a flow rate adjustor. In a further embodiment the flow rate adjuster would control multiple types of nozzles in order to adjust the spray volume to match the application in addition to other variables such as the type and amount of top dressing material to be covered, the type of application, the ground speed of the vehicle, the terrain, hill vs. flat, etc. In yet a further embodiment, the attached nozzle would be a rotating nozzle assembly of different nozzle types and volumes, multiple nozzles mounted in series that can be shut off individually, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0292">Further, certain types of turf allow lower applications of sand per acre. For example, recent cultivars of turfgrass plants growing on golf course areas and other types of turf show similar benefits with lower amounts of applied sand than used in the example above. Lower volumes of sand would require lower amounts of spray. Even further, in another embodiment, the inventors contemplate formulations with higher percentages of A.I.s (concentrated sprays). In these applications the inventors contemplate using nozzles that are capable of dispensing even sprays with lower volumes of fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Contemplated vehicles of the present inventions have, in one embodiment, at least one nozzle mounted above and to the side of the conveying means, such as a belt <b>8</b> at the rear of the vehicle (for example, the Dakota 440 has two ideally located side mounted nozzles, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) for spraying a liquid onto the conveying means. Off-center nozzle tips apply an even band of spray below, and off to the side of the nozzle itself, for example, a TeeJet OC12, TeeJet OC16, and the like, nozzle delivering 1.0-1.5 gallons/minute. The number and size of nozzles used depend on various factors such as travel speed, swath width, and volume of sand moving under the spray. One additional advantage of using a side-mounted nozzle is physical, such that the nozzle is less likely to interfere with access to the rear areas of the vehicles where access to the rear gate is desired. Further, the inventors found that when they mounted and used a side mounted nozzle on a Dakota 440 with the blender unit attachment and with an elevator unit it did not interfere with the movement of these units whereas a top mounted nozzle was less compatible with vehicles shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">Additional flexibility is contemplated through the use of a rotating spray head, which might contain 3 or more individual nozzles of various capacities. The operator (or computer) would simply rotate the spray head to utilize the appropriate spray tip for the speed of travel, swath width, and sand volume he plans to apply. Similar rotating spray heads are already used on spray booms in agriculture. Currently, a sand volume of 0.025 cubic yard/1000 sq. ft., a spread width of 18&#x2032;, and a ground speed of 2.3 MPH are being used. On the other hand, research may eventually show that one nozzle type and size can fit all applications, regardless of sand volume, travel speed, or swath width, if spray volume and sand spray coverage turn out to not be important efficacy factors. The nozzle height above the sand belt would depend on the nozzle type finally selected. A 110-degree even band nozzle would likely be mounted 4&#x2033;-6&#x2033; above the sand belt, while an 80 or 95 degree even band nozzle would likely be mounted at 5&#x2033;-7&#x2033; above the sand belt. An off-center, directed spray nozzle would likely be mounted less than 9&#x2033; above and a few inches to the right or left side of the sand belt. The sand belt itself is about 1&#x2032; wide on the 440. The objective would be to apply an even band of spray to the entire width of the sand belt, whichever nozzle size or type is selected. It is appreciated that various other nozzle configurations operative herein will be apparent to one of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0295">The inventors further contemplate providing and using flow rate adjusters for adjusting spray volumes, user manuals, and markers for controlling the coverage of top dressing materials provided by vehicles of the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0296">During the course of developing vehicles of the present inventions, the inventors discovered that the Dakota 440 Turf Tender does not automatically compensate application rates for speed of the vehicle, nor gate height, nor conveyor speeds, nor blending speed, nor instructions specific to applying and delivering a top dressing material. However, the gate heights and belt (conveyor) speeds were manually adjustable for controlling blending operations and spreading operations. Currently, the vehicle operator has to calibrate each material separately for both the blending and spreading operations. For example, at any given gate setting or belt speed, drier sand comes out at a different speed than wetter sand, such as kiln dried sand compared to saturated sand. In addition, the inventors discovered that different types of sand blends of the present inventions had different rates of application despite using identical settings. For example, a 5% Daconil&#x2122;/sand blend moved and was applied at a different rate than Prophesy&#x2122;/sand blends, etc., see Examples. This variability in amounts between products was also found in the blending operation, in addition to the spreading operation. Therefore the opportunity for error potential without calibration tests provides at least a 2-fold difference in the amount of sand/blend applied between the different blends as compared with simply spraying sand as it left the topdresser. In other words, when spraying top dressing materials by hand or with vehicles of the present inventions, the spray rate is the principle variable, whereas dry formulations have compound variables, including blending rates and the spreading rates.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0297">Therefore the inventors further contemplate providing several types of calibration aids for use with compositions, vehicles, and methods of use of the present inventions. Calibration aids are contemplated in the form of written instructions and/or charts for providing suggested machine settings and operator instructions. This information should decrease the amount of time and increase the efficiency when using the compositions and vehicles of the present inventions, in particular with using different types of formulations and top dressing materials under a variety of terrain, turf grass plants, and disease applications. In particular, the inventors contemplate removing variability between specific types of applications, such as blending and applying blends of Prophesy&#x2122; (GR), Andersons 5% Daconil&#x2122; GR fungicide and the like. In particular, the inventors contemplate providing instructions, such as charts showing optimal settings, either specific or in ranges, for treating various types of top dressing materials of the present inventions for the use of the vehicles of the present inventions. Further, these instructions are contemplated to provide specific application instructions for types of turf grass plants and severity of disease out breaks or maintenance goals.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0298">The types of calibration aids are contemplated to include but are not limited to a user manual, such as a user guide, operating instructions, and the like. Calibration aids also include a label for attaching to the vehicle, a manual for attaching to a vehicle, such as an embossed metal label, a waterproof manual, wherein an example of an attachment includes a chain, bolt, rivet, glue and the like. A calibration aid of the present invention comprises providing recommended settings for blending and delivering a composition comprising any one or more of A.I.s in combination with at least one of the types of topdressing materials of the present inventions. In another embodiment, the calibration aid comprises recommended conveyor speeds, gate opening settings, etc., for use with commercially available A.I. formations, top dressings, type of turf grass cultivar, type of turf, i.e., golf course green. In a further embodiment, a chart comprising the setting recommended by the inventors for use with a top dressing vehicle is provided.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0299">Thus in one embodiment, the inventors contemplate a calibration label, for example, a label attached to a Dakota 440 for providing optimal settings for using a Dakota 440 Turflender as a top dressing vehicle of the present inventions. In another embodiment, the inventions contemplate providing a chart, for use with the Dakota 440 TurfTender or other commercially available blender, elevator, drop-type and spreader-type topdressing vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0300">In another embodiment, the inventions further provide a &#x201c;flow adjuster compensator unit&#x201d; comprising a flow compensator valve and software which alters the sprayer valve setting and, therefore, the spray rate based upon defined variables for preventing over application of an A.I. to an area of turf. Examples of defined variables include, but are not limited to, the speed of the topdressing vehicle. Therefore, in general, a slow moving vehicle has a slow spray rate in which the spray rate increases as the vehicle increases speed. However, other variables are contemplated to be calculated into adjusting the flow rate, such as sensing variables of axle speed, speed of the conveyor belt, height of the gate in the rear of the spinner machine which regulates the amount of released topdressing material, and type of topdressing material, sand, peat, soil and mixtures thereof, and type and concentration of active ingredient. In further embodiments, the inventors contemplate calibration aids as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0301">Many types of markers, including foam markers, are used for preventing overlapping of materials used to cover surface areas in order to provide an even coverage of materials. In particular, markers are used in the agricultural industry for preventing harmful overdoses of active materials. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,126,274, herein incorporated by reference, provides a device for making furrow markers in order to show where materials were spread over the ground. However, marking a furrow in turf areas, such as golf courses, damages the sod and renders the surface unplayable.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0302">In order to overcome such damage, in one embodiment, the inventors contemplate using 100% overlap spinners to prevent skips and harmful overlaps on spinner machines. In other embodiments, brush-drop-type spreaders are used to apply coated sand without skips or harmful overlaps because the swath edges are more sharply delineated than the tapered swath edge observed with spinner-type topdressers.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0303">Further contemplated is marking the edge of the throw pattern from spinner-type machines and drop-type topdresser applied swaths of applied coated top dressing material. Therefore, the inventors contemplate adding an adjustable foam-marking boom to the top dressing vehicle in order to allow the operator to locate the edge of the throw pattern. Even further, a marker composition is contemplated for use with the foam boom. Even further, a marker composition is contemplated for adding to the spray formulation for monitoring both the amount of sprayed material onto the top dressing material and for monitoring the swath of distributed top dressing material on the turf. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,369,122, herein incorporated by reference, discloses foam marker compositions for delineating treated from untreated areas. Other types of foam marking systems contemplated for use with vehicles of the representative inventions include Richway marking systems, such as a Richway Trac Master (www.richway.com/turftracker.pdf) herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0304">In one embodiment, the inventors contemplate a single line of foam. For example, a single line of foam provided by a foam unit mounted on the tractor pulling the vehicle is contemplated for use with Dakota top dressers. In other embodiments, two or more lines of foam are contemplated. In preferred embodiments, the inventors contemplate attaching a foam unit directly to the top dressing vehicle in order to provide a single line of foam centered with the spread swath. In other embodiments, the foam unit is provided with the injector mounted on a boom, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. In a further embodiment, the boom length is adjustable (as in telescoping) for various swath widths (12&#x2032;-20&#x2032; and others). In this case, the operator would center the tractor directly over a foam line to achieve 100% overlap, whatever swath width they are using. Boom-mounted ejector units may be necessary if the sand, when applied heavily, masks a swath-centered foam line. In another embodiment, the foam disappears in about 15 minutes, for example, DAWN detergent foam.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0305">Thus any type of marker is contemplated for use that will reveal the presence of and prevent skips and over-laps of coated material, which result in either untreated or damaged turf. It is anticipated that skips and unintentional overlaps will be minimized through the use of 100% overlap spinners, which are available for some spinner-type topdressers, such as the Dakota models. Additionally, spray volume is contemplated as adjustable for correlating with ground speed to increase/reduce spray volumes to the sand to adjust for increased/decreased ground speeds, respectively. The top dressing vehicles of the present inventions are contemplated for use in applying and delivering virtually any materials that can be sprayed on golf course turfs.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0306">In one embodiment, clear foam with rapidly degrading foam is contemplated. Colored foam might be useful in areas of turf, such as fairways, where the foam would fall into the canopy, or areas where swaths are wider, making a clear foam line harder to observe (See, for example, www.richway.com/buyersguide.pdf). Therefore, in some embodiments, the markers used for monitoring applications of coated top dressing materials would be colored in such a way as to reduce golfer anxiety, including, for example, using rapidly biodegradable markers, foam, and using neutral colors such as brown, yellow, blue, green, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0307">In summary, the present invention provides top dressing vehicles for combining the sand top dressing operation and the chemical application operation normally practiced on golf courses into one procedure by mounting a chemical spray tank pump; spray nozzles, etc., onto finishing brush drop-type topdressers, spinner-type topdressers, and blending top dressers. Further, the inventors contemplate, and provide herein, a range of embodiments of top dressing vehicles intended for particular applications of formulations of the present inventions. Additionally, any disclosed compositions, such as exemplary compositions referenced herein, may find use in methods providing such compositions using top dressing vehicles of the present inventions for applying liquid fungicides and other A.I.s onto top dressing materials and blending top dressing materials with A.I.s at a point-of-application, such that as the materials are blended as they are used. In other words, the compositions are simultaneously coated and dropped or broadcast onto areas of turf grass. Even further, the inventors contemplate, and provide herein, a range of embodiments of top dressing vehicles for use in methods of applying commercially available formulations available in the future and intended for application onto turfgrass plants.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">EXPERIMENTAL</heading>
<p id="p-0309" num="0308">The following examples serve to illustrate certain embodiments and aspects of the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting the scope thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0309">In the experimental disclosures which follow, the following abbreviations apply: g (grams); L and l (liters); ml (milliliters); m (meters); min (minute); s and sec (second); sq (square), ft (foot, feet), square foot (ft<sup>2</sup>); ha (hectare), ac (acre), lb (pound), gpa (gallons per acre), gph (gallons per hour), GR (granule), Liters per Hectare (L/ha), Liters per acre (L/ac), and LSD (Least Significant Difference Test).</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example I</heading>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Materials and Methods</heading>
<p id="p-0311" num="0310">The following is a description of exemplary materials and methods that were used in subsequent Examples II and III, with exemplary results shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, during the development of the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0311">Exemplary test compositions were provided and used as turfgrass treatments as shown in Tables below. Test treatments were applied to an established &#x201c;Providence&#x201d; creeping bentgrass putting green (0.15 inch cutting height) on the Hancock Turfgrass Research Center on the Michigan State University campus in East Lansing, Mich. Treatments were applied to four replicate 2&#x2032;&#xd7;6&#x2032; plots with 6&#x2033; alleys using a C02-powered backpack sprayer (foliar applications) and a Scotts&#x2122; 22&#x2033; drop spreader for delivering sand treatments and treatments comprising a granular formulation of A.I. hand blended with sand. Sand was supplied as local sand obtained in the Lansing, Mich. area of the United States.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0312">Combined sand (topdressing) and chemical (A.I.) compositions for treatments were created by applying Scotts Miracle Gro&#x2122; (36-6-6) soluble fertilizer and/or commercial turfgrass fungicides in an aqueous solution, onto dry topdressing sand (sand meeting USGA specifications), and re-drying the treated sand prior to application/delivery. For these examples, the liquid was applied to the top dressing by soaking the sand in the aqueous solutions contained by a bucket.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0313">Each treatment of a sand composition of the present inventions was then preweighed and applied to each plot individually, while the spray applications were applied at 50 GP A and allowed to dry on the grass plant foliage. The sand treatments were not brushed into the turf as would be customary, but irrigation was applied to wash the sand into the canopy, foliage and turfgrass plant, and activate the fertilizer or chemicals. The sand application rate of 138-lbs/1000 ft<sup>2 </sup>approximates the highest application rate within the recommended range of 45-135 lbs/1000 ft<sup>2 </sup>(See Beard and Turf Management for Golf Courses, supra. Treated plots that did not receive Miracle Gro&#x2122; fertilizer were fertilized with Lebanon Country Club&#x2122; (greens grade) fertilizer (18-3-12) at the same rate of actual nitrogen/1000 ft<sup>2 </sup>that the Miracle Gro&#x2122; treated plots received.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0314">Treatment application was initiated on Jul. 15, 2007, and on subsequent dates through Sep. 18, 2007, as indicated in the data tables that follow. In each experiment, the fungicides/fertilizer treatments were reapplied on a 14-day schedule. Natural infections of dollar spot within the study area were uniform ranging from 10-15% of the surface area when the July 15 treatments were initially applied.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0315">Treatments initiated at later dates were placed on more heavily diseased plots because the disease intensity increased at least 60% in untreated and control plots over the duration of study.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example II</heading>
<p id="p-0317" num="0316">This example demonstrates the effectiveness of compositions of the present inventions to suppress dollar spot fungus, in an exemplary &#x201c;Suppressive dollar spot sand study.&#x201d; Field plots were treated with the compositions as described in Tables 3 and 4, with results demonstrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0317">Sand top dressing compositions of the present inventions were prepared and used as treatments as described in the Example 1, while liquid formulations were applied by spraying on field plots in order to determine whether agricultural chemicals would continue to be effective while using sand as a carrier. Spraying rates were described in Example 1 at rates per 1000 s.q. feet.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0318">The inventors found that formulations of the present inventions comprising sand coated with a liquid mixture of azoxystrobin and propiconazole in the form of Headway&#x2122; by Syngenta (Active Ingredients: Azoxystrobin: methyl (E)-2-{2-[6-(2-cyanophenoxy) pyrimidin-4-yloxy]phenyl}-3-methoxyacrylate as 5.73% and propiconazole: (CAS No. 60207-90-1) as 9.54%. In other words, 0.868 lb A.I. propiconazole and 0.521 lb A.I. (as azoxystrobin per gallon) was used in one embodiment as an exemplary fungicide in the strobilurin class of chemical compounds. Additional examples of compositions and methods of the present inventions were provided using a mixture of triadimefon and trifloxystrobins in a formulation of Tartan&#x2122; Bayer Environmental Science (Active Ingredients: triadimefon (CAS No. 141517-21 7) 4.17% and Trifloxystrobin (CAS No. 43121-43 3) 20.86%, equivalent to 2 pounds of triadimefon and 0.4 pounds of trifloxystrobin per gallon). In further embodiments, these fungicides were used with and without an All Purpose Miracle Gro&#x2122; fertilizer 24-8-16 (24-% nitrogen, 8% phosphorus, and 16% potassium by weight) (Scotts Miracle-Gro Company), provided dollar spot disease control comparable to the standard spray formulations of Headway&#x2122; and Tartan&#x2122; sprays alone on three successive rating dates. Exemplary data is shown in Tables 3, 4 and by arrows in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0319">In terms of turfgrass quality, the combination of Headway&#x2122; with Miracle Gro&#x2122; fertilizer applied to sand gave significantly better turf quality on the three rating dates, compared to the Headway&#x2122; spray alone and Headway&#x2122; spray in combination with homogeneous methylene urea Country Club&#x2122; (18-3-12; 18% nitrogen, 3% phosphorus, and 12% potassium) fertilizer (LebanonTurf). This improvement was consistent with the turf quality improvement often seen following sand topdressing applications. No phytotoxicity was observed during the study duration although turf greening/darkening was increasingly apparent with reapplication of Headway and Tartan treatments.</p>

<heading id="h-0011" level="1">Example III</heading>
<p id="p-0323" num="0322">This example demonstrates the effectiveness of compositions of the present inventions to suppress dollar spot fungus, in an exemplary &#x201c;curative study.&#x201d; The results of curative treatments shown in exemplary Tables 5-6 include treatments added to the study later in the growing season. The treated plots were in various stages of recovery from severe dollar spot infections (ranging from 50-60%) so conclusions in these later studies were not provided for treatment efficacy on a curative basis.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0323">The data indicated that turfgrass recovery using an A.I. comprising fungicides including chlorothalonil in a formulation comprising Daconil Ultrex&#x2122; (Active Ingredient:Chlorothalonil (tetrachloroisophthalonitrile) 82.5% as Water Dispersible Granules, Syngenta) and Chipco 26GT&#x2122; (Active Ingredient: Iprodione (3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-N-(1-methylethyl)-2,4-dioxo-1-imidazolidinecarboxamide)) 23.3% (contains 2 pounds of active ingredient iprodione per gallon as Sextant&#x2122; now called OHP&#xae; Chipco&#xae; 26GT-O, OHP, Inc. P.O. Box 230, Mainland, Pa., 19451)) may be slower when these fungicides are placed on sand compared to slightly better activity towards dollar spot when applied as foliar sprays. The delayed or reduced efficacy was especially apparent in contrast to highly successful control of dollar spot infections using formulations of sand comprising propiconazole as a Banner Maxx&#x2122; formulation. Banner Maxx&#x2122; formulations were equally successful with and without adding Miracle Gro&#x2122; fertilizer. A formulation of the present inventions was also provided as a plowable fungicide as an exemplary Daconil Weather Stik&#x2122; Fungicide (Active Ingredient:Chlorothalonil (tetrachloroisophthalonitrile) of 54.0% in other words, 6.0 pounds chlorothalonil per gallon (720 grams per liter) Syngenta Crop Protection, Inc. Greensboro, N.C. 27409).</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0324">In another embodiment of a granular formulation, the A.I. is Prophesy&#x2122;. In another embodiment of a granular formulation, the A.I. is contained within a formulation of AND6259 (Prophesy GR plus fertilizer). Both treatment formulations provided rapid turf recovery from heavy dollar spot infections, with the treated areas recovering by approximately 50% when observed four days after initial treatment applications.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0325">These treatments were included to investigate the efficacy of commercial fungicide and experimental fungicide granular products when they are applied to or blended with top dressings and distributed by hand. Thus the inventors contemplated that treated sand and a blend of granular fungicide and fertilizer products with top dressing sand is a viable option for disease control and turfgrass quality improvement.</p>

<p id="p-0334" num="0333">This example demonstrates the curative capability of delivering a moist composition of the present inventions at a point-of-application using a drop-type topdressing vehicle of the present inventions. Further, these results show superior results of delivering a moist top dressing composition consisting of sand and a granular/dry form of a fungicide, i.e. comprising propiconazole, as an Andersons Prophesy&#x2122; GR (propiconazole) formulation over delivering a blended formulation consisting of sand and Andersons 5% Daconil&#x2122; GR fungicide. See, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, arrows point to brown areas of fungal infected turf.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0334">The inventors tested a moist sand formulation of the present inventions on an area of turf as part of the Hancock Turfgrass Research Center on the Michigan State University campus in East Lansing, Mich. A vehicle of the present invention was provided as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, as described above, for distributing this moist formulation of the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0335">A moist formulation was provided by placing a topdressing sand material in the main hopper of a Meter-R-Matic&#x2122; Top Dresser, Turfco&#x2122;, and placing a fungicidal spray mixture in the tank for spraying the fungicide as a coating onto the sand just prior to application onto an area of turf at the Hancock Turfgrass Research Center on the Michigan State University campus in East Lansing, Mich. Rating Scale was provided as a percent recovery determined 11 days after the first application.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0336">The sand moisture level for earlier experiments ranged between 1%-8% water content by weight (based on air drying). Sand used during experiments later in the summer (Mete-R-Matic Study) had approximately 1%-2 percent water content. At saturation, the topdressing sand used for these experiments was approximately 16.5% water by weight. In general, water weight at saturation is a variable dependent upon the particular starting composition of sand. Sand processing practices and storage conditions prior to use as a topdressing material is a factor that determines the moisture level of any topdressing sand.</p>

<p id="p-0339" num="0338">This example shows several embodiments of sprayer units attached to spinner-type topdressing vehicles and blending-type topdressing vehicles of the present inventions. Some embodiments are demonstrated as schematics while other embodiments are provided showing actual components. These types of topdressing vehicles are contemplated for use in spraying a liquid fungicide or any other liquid agriculturally active ingredient onto a topdressing material, such as sand, peat, soil and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0339">In one embodiment, a schematic showing the placement of a sprayer unit attached to a topdressing vehicle of the present invention is provided, see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. In another embodiment, a schematic showing a contemplated placement of nozzles for spraying a liquid over sand during broadcast and a schematic of a spray curtain and attached foam marking system is provided, see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. In another embodiment, a schematic showing a contemplated placement of nozzles for spraying a liquid over sand prior to entering the spinner device is provided, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>. In particular, the schematic provides nozzles attached above the topdressing material providing a spray curtain directly above the topdressing material.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0340">Further, this example provides a spinner-type topdressing vehicle of the present inventions used for delivering a moist sand formulation of the present inventions. This exemplary spinner-type topdressing vehicle, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, comprises a sprayer unit attached to a Dakota 440 spinner topdressing vehicle <b>1</b> for coating a topdressing material at a point-of-application, where the nozzle is attached at the rear of the topdressing vehicle. In one embodiment, provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the nozzle is an off-center spray nozzle and attached to the vehicle at one side of the conveying means at the rear of the vehicle. In another embodiment, one off-center nozzle on each side is contemplated for attachment. In another embodiment, more than one nozzle per side of conveying means for spraying a liquid onto the conveying means is contemplated for attachment. The placement and number of the nozzles is for providing adequate coverage and even distribution of liquid onto the topdressing material being conveyed by the conveying means.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0341">In another embodiment, the inventions provide a blending-type topdressing vehicle of the present inventions <b>1</b>, wherein a sprayer unit is attached; see an exemplary topdressing vehicle in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. In this example, a blending unit <b>9</b> capable of blending at least one additional material with a topdressing material is provided, where the attached nozzles are placed at the side and/or above the conveying means where the nozzles do not interfere with the operation or movement of the blending device into a nonoperable position. The blending device of the exemplary vehicle is shown in an operable location in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, and an inoperable location in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. Further, the exemplary topdressing vehicle shows a blender/elevator unit <b>6</b> attached with a conveying means <b>8</b>. Thus in another embodiment, the nozzles are contemplated for attachment above the conveying means of the elevator for spraying a liquid onto the conveying means as shown schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. In another embodiment, a schematic showing a contemplated location for an attached sprayer unit, as represented by tank <b>3</b>, is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. A further embodiment contemplates locating a spraying unit outside of or behind a second hopper attached to a topdressing vehicle or in place of a second hopper, where a second hopper is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A</figref>, open, and <b>10</b>B, closed, located in the front of this exemplary blender-type topdressing vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0342">In a further embodiment, a topdressing vehicle of the present inventions is provided for coating a topdressing material. In this embodiment, the topdressing vehicle coats the topdressing without delivering it to an area of turf. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, a schematic shows an attached sprayer, where the placement of a nozzle is above the conveying means. In this embodiment, the contemplated coated topdressing is provided in a moist form for subsequent disbursement. In a further embodiment, the moist formulations of the present inventions are contemplated to undergo subsequent drying prior to distribution onto an area of turf. The inventors contemplate air-drying and kiln drying of the formulations of the present inventions provided by the topdressing vehicles of the present inventions. The inventors do not intend to limit this type of coating to methods using topdressing vehicles, such that methods for coating a topdressing material with an A.I. comprises any type of spray device capable of spraying an A.I., such as a table or rotating drum mixer comprising a conveying means and a sprayer unit attached in a manner capable of providing spray coated sand formulations of the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0343">Exemplary spray curtains/patterns are provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, wherein a schematic spray curtain formed by a single nozzle and two nozzles providing nonoverlapping spray curtains are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12A</figref>. A schematic of an overlapping spray curtain is shown included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12B</figref>, contemplated for attachment to topdressing vehicles of the present inventions and for use in spraying liquid formulations onto topdressing materials as provided herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0015" level="1">Example VII</heading>
<p id="p-0345" num="0344">This example demonstrates the curative capability of treatments comprising dry formulations of the present inventions using a commercially available spinner-type Topdressing vehicle. Further, these results show superior results of treatments comprising a blended formulation consisting of sand and a granular/dry form of a fungicide, wherein the A.I. was propiconazole, as an Andersons Prophesy&#x2122; GR formulation over treatment comprising a blended formulation consisting of sand and chlorothalonil in the form of an Andersons 5% Daconil&#x2122; GR fungicide granule. For comparison, the same AIs were provided in liquid form and used as sprays.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0345">The inventors tested dry formulations of the present inventions on an area of turf as part of the Forest Acres Golf Course, East Lansing, Mich. One dry formulation was provided by placing a topdressing sand material in the main hopper of a Dakota 440 TurfTender top dressing with a blending attachment <b>9</b> (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>) and placing the granular Andersons Prophesy&#x2122; GR in the smaller hopper leading to the blending unit. Another dry formulation was provided by placing Andersons 5% Daconil&#x2122; GR fungicide granule in the smaller hopper <b>15</b> for blending with sand as the sand was conveyed <b>8</b> to the spinner units <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0346">The Dakota 440&#x2122; blended sand/granule application was a 1:27 blend of Andersons Prophesy&#x2122; GR (propiconazole) fungicide: moist sand (2.5 lbs/1000 sq. ft.: 67.5 lbs/1000 sq. ft.) applied in 2 trips (100% overlap) over the plots. The estimated total was 34-lbs/1000 sq ft of topdressing applied per trip. In one embodiment, the dry formulation was pre-blended with sand with the Dakota 440&#x2122; where the blender is mounted on the front of the vehicle with the blended material conveyed forward into a drop pile. The blended material was re-loaded into the main hopper for spreading with the conveyor belt moving the blended material towards and into the rear spinner unit.</p>
<p id="p-0348" num="0347">For comparison, a spray solution being applied to sand on the Dakota 440 at a tank concentration of 3.8% Banner Maxx&#x2122; liquid comprising propiconazole, in other words 0.5 fl. oz. of tank solution was applied to 34 lbs topdressing sand/1000 sq. ft. with 2 trips over the plot with 100% overlap (1 fl. oz./1000 sq. ft. on 67.5 lbs sand). The spray was applied at 9 GPA. A foam marker unit was attached to the tractor towing the Dakota 440&#x2122; which provided a dotted line of foam, lasting approximately 15 minutes, which marked each trip allowing for an even distribution of the blended formulation.</p>
<p id="p-0349" num="0348">Treatments of a usual sand volume application blended with Andersons Prophesy&#x2122; GR just prior to spreading were applied on areas of turf naturally infected with dollar spot fungi with visible brown areas. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> shows the broadcast area and sand composition as an exemplary Dakota 440 spinner-type topdressing machine applied it. Arrows show the pattern of sand broadcast during application. Table 8 shows the curative capability of a dry formulation of blended sand comprising a propiconazole formulation application equivalent to a spray application of Banner Maxx&#x2122; (liquid propiconazole) spray and a Daconil&#x2122; Ultrex spray. In contrast, sand blended formulations of Andersons 5% Daconil&#x2122; GR fungicide did not appear to reduce fungal infection of the turf grass.</p>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">The inventors discovered during test runs that several parameters of the Dakota 440 TurfTender&#x2122; had to be altered for using the Dakota 440 TurfTender&#x2122; in methods of distributing formulations of the present inventions. In particular, the blender-metering gate on the Dakota 440 TurfTender&#x2122; allowed the Anderson Prophesy&#x2122; granules to leak over the top of the metering gate, resulting in a higher blend rate than desired for that product. The inventors placed tape over the opening at the top of the gate, which stopped the excess granule distribution. Additionally, when the blender/elevator unit was in the operable position, granules exiting the blender bin tended to escape the blender unit and fall to the ground. These leaks were sealed by the inventor prior to further treatments. Lastly, the rear-metering gate <b>12</b> on the Dakota 440 TurfTender machine <b>1</b> was insufficiently precise, under normal operation, to accurately apply pesticide granule/sand blends evenly across the spread swath. Therefore the inventors were required to begin providing specific calibration settings for use in the present inventions.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">Further, the inventors discovered that when using the white spinner blade option, requiring one pass, they were unable to obtain a sufficiently consistent distribution of sand blended or sprayed with fungicide across the swath of distributed material. Specifically, the white spinner blades distributed the material too heavily near the machine and too lightly on the fringes of the swath. Testing the black spinner option, which requires for providing an overlap spread pattern, gave an acceptable distribution in the overlap pattern following two passes (100% overlap) of the topdresser.</p>
