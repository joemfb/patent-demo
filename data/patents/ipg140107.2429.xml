<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a toner used for electrophotographic image formation, for example image formation with a copier, a printer, a facsimile, etc., electrostatic printing, or electrostatic recording.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, in an electrophotographic image forming apparatus, an electrostatic recording apparatus, etc., an electric or magnetic latent image is visualized using toner. For example, in an electrophotographic method, an electrostatic image (latent image) is formed on a photoconductor, then the latent image is developed using toner, and a toner image is thus formed. Then the toner image is generally transferred onto a recording medium such as paper and fixed by means of a process such as heating.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A toner used for developing an electrostatic image is generally in the form of colored particles including a binder resin which contains a colorant, a charge controlling agent, etc. Methods for producing the toner are broadly classified into the pulverization method and the polymerization method.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the pulverization method, a toner composition obtained by melt-mixing and uniformly dispersing a colorant, a charge controlling agent, an offset preventing agent, etc. into a thermoplastic resin is pulverized and classified so as to produce a toner. The pulverization method makes it possible to produce a toner with properties which are favorable to some extent. However, selection of materials is limited. For instance, a toner composition obtained by melt mixing should be able to be pulverized and classified with apparatuses which can be economically used. This requires the toner composition obtained by melt-mixing to be sufficiently brittle. When such a toner composition is pulverized, particles with a wide particle size distribution are likely to be formed. In this situation, if a copied image with favorable resolution and tone properties is to be obtained, it is necessary to remove fine powder of 5 &#x3bc;m or less in particle diameter and coarse powder of 20 &#x3bc;m or greater in particle diameter by classification. Hence there is a problem in that the yield is very low. Also in the pulverization method, it is difficult to disperse the colorant, the charge controlling agent, etc. uniformly into the thermoplastic resin, and thus there is a problem in that the obtained toner is adversely affected in terms of fluidity, developing capability, durability, image quality and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, a dissolved resin suspension method has been proposed in which a resin solution that dissolves a resin previously synthesized by polymerization reaction is dispersed into an aqueous medium in the presence of a dispersion (auxiliary) agent such as a water-soluble resin or a surfactant and a dispersion stabilizer such as fine inorganic particles or fine resin particles, the solvent is removed by heating, pressure reduction, etc., and a toner is thus obtained (refer to Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos. 09-319144 and 2002-284881). According to the dissolved resin suspension method in these proposals, a toner with uniform toner particles can be obtained without carrying out classification.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Regarding an electrophotographic image forming apparatus, separability of toner from a heating member (hereinafter referred to also as &#x201c;offset resistance&#x201d;) is required in a fixing step by a contact heating method performed using a heating member such as a heat roller. The offset resistance is achieved by using a modified polyester resin in the dissolved resin suspension method (refer to Japanese Patent No. 3640918).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Now, binder resins, which occupy 70% or more of the compositions of toners, contain oil resources as raw materials in most cases, so that there are concerns over depletion of oil resources, and global warming caused by consuming large quantities of oil resources and discharging carbon dioxide into the air. Accordingly, if resins derived from plants which grow by taking in carbon dioxide in the air are used for the binder resins, carbon dioxide is generated and consumed repeatedly within an environment, which means that there is a possibility that the global warming and the depletion of oil resources may be able to be solved at the same time. Accordingly, a variety of toners containing such plant-derived resins as binder resins have been proposed. For example, Japanese Patent No. 2909873 proposes use of polylactic acid as a binder resin. However, when polylactic acid is used without any change to it, the actions of a thermoplastic resin are lessened at the time of fixation because the polylactic acid has a higher concentration of ester bonds than a polyester resin. Also, the toner hardens to a great extent, which presents problems in that there is a lack of toner pulverization capability and a decrease in productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">JP-A No. 09-274335 proposes a toner for development of electrostatic images, which includes a colorant, and a polyester resin obtained by dehydration polycondensation between lactic acid and a composition containing a trifunctional or higher oxycarboxylic acid. In this proposal, however, the polyester resin (obtained by the dehydration polycondensation between the hydroxyl group of the lactic acid and the carboxyl group of the trifunctional or higher oxycarboxylic acid) is in a branched or network form and thus is less soluble in solvent than straight-chain polyester resins. Moreover, inferior in sharp melting capability, the toner is problematic in terms of its poor low-temperature fixation properties.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In an attempt to improve thermal properties of a toner, there has been proposed an electrophotographic toner including a polylactic acid-based biodegradable resin and a terpene phenol copolymer (refer to JP-A No. 2001-166537). However, this proposal does not satisfy favorable low-temperature fixation properties and hot offset resistance at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Since the toners described in these prior art documents are all obtained by pulverization, there are problems of toner loss (caused by classification) and resultant toner disposal. Also, since the amount of energy required for the pulverization is relatively large, further reduction in environmental load is required.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Polylactic acid, which is a general-purpose, easily-available plant-derived resin, is synthesized by dehydration condensation of lactic acid or ring-opening polymerization of a cyclic lactide (refer to JP-A Nos. 07-33861 and 59-96123). Therefore, when a toner is produced using polylactic acid, any of the dissolved resin suspension methods described in JP-A Nos. 09-319144 and 2002-284881 and Japanese Patent No. 3640918 may be used. However, regarding polylactic acid, when poly-L-lactic acid or poly-D-lactic acid is used alone, it has such high crystallinity that it is hardly soluble in organic solvent, which makes the use of a dissolved resin suspension method difficult. Meanwhile, JP-A No. 2008-262179 discloses that poly-L-lactic acid and poly-D-lactic acid are mixed together so as to decrease crystallinity and improve their solubility in organic solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">However, polylactic acid contains a large number of polar groups per unit molecule, so that in the case where a toner is produced using polylactic acid(s) with reduced crystallinity, the toner is affected by moisture to a greater extent than in the case of polylactic acid(s) with high crystallinity. This leads to degradation of the heat-resistant storage stability of the toner, variation in the fluidity of the toner (caused by moisture absorption) and difficulty in controlling the charge amount. It is particularly difficult to reduce variation in charge amount under a condition which can belong to anywhere between a low-temperature, low-humidity condition and a high-temperature, high-humidity condition, and thus there are problems of unstable charge amount and image density.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">To solve problems related to a toner's heat-resistant storage stability and charge amount variation, there is a known method of covering a toner's binder resin surface with fine powder of a styrene-acrylic copolymer.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For example, developers have been proposed in which the surfaces of particles of a styrene-acrylic resin as a binder resin of toner are covered with fine powder of an acrylic polymer or fine powder of a styrene-acrylic copolymer (refer to JP-A Nos. 60-186851, 60-186852 and 60-186854, and Japanese Patent Nos. 3789522 and 3289598).</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Also, developers have been proposed in which the surfaces of particles of a polyester resin as a binder resin of toner are covered with fine powder of an acrylic polymer or fine powder of a styrene-acrylic copolymer (refer to JP-A Nos. 58-205161, 58-205163 and 58-205164, 2005-77603 and 2007-93809).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">However, although the developers in these proposals are superior in heat-resistant storage stability, the surface of the binder resin of the toner is covered with fine resin particles, and thus sufficient low-temperature fixation properties may not be obtained. Also, there is a problem in that the fine resin particles on the surface may peel off owing to long-term agitation in a developing unit and thus the charge amount of the toner may change with time.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As described above, since there is generally a paradoxical relationship between low-temperature fixation properties and heat-resistant storage stability, it is difficult to achieve a favorable balance between them. Accordingly, for example, developers have been proposed in which surfaces of toner particles are covered with fine powder of two different types of acrylic polymers or fine powder of two different types of styrene-acrylic copolymers so as to divide functions, and thus a favorable balance between low-temperature fixation properties and heat-resistant storage stability is achieved (refer to Japanese Patent Nos. 4076716 and 4085942, and JP-A Nos. 08-262783 and 2005-55534).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Nowadays, energy saving in relation to electrophotographic copiers and printers is attracting much interest, and superior low-temperature fixation properties are being demanded. In the cases of Japanese Patent Nos. 4076716 and 4085942 and JP-A Nos. 08-262783 and 2005-55534, however, petroleum resins that are conventionally used in the field of toners, such as styrene-acrylic resins or polyester resins, are used as binder resins, and thus it is difficult to obtain sufficient low-temperature fixation properties.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As just described, in reality, a toner which is superior in low-temperature fixation properties, heat-resistant storage stability, hot offset resistance, fluidity, image density and haze value, and high in charge stability against changes of use conditions such as temperature and humidity, and which includes polylactic acid, and techniques related to the toner have not been obtained, and so further improvement and development are being demanded.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The present invention provides a toner which (even when polylactic acid is used in the toner) secures hot offset resistance and heat-resistant storage stability and is superior in low-temperature fixation properties, fluidity, image density, haze value, and charge stability against changes of use conditions such as temperature and humidity. The present invention also provides a developer, an image forming method and an image forming apparatus, each including the toner.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As a result of carrying out a series of earnest examinations in an attempt to solve the above-mentioned problems, the present inventors have found that the problems can be effectively solved by a toner including two resins which contain predetermined polymers and have mutually different glass transition temperatures, and also including a resin which has a polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton, wherein the two resins are attached to a surface of the resin having the polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton, and wherein the predetermined polymers are based upon styrene monomer(s) and/or acrylic monomer(s).</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A toner of the present invention includes a resin particle (C) which contains a first resin (a1), a second resin (a2), and a resin particle (B), wherein the first resin (a1) and the second resin (a2) have mutually different glass transition temperatures, and the resin particle (B) contains a third resin (b). If necessary, the toner may further include other component(s).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the present invention, each type of specific resin particle is mostly written in the singular for simplicity of explanation; note that each type of specific resin particle in the singular may refer to one particle or a plurality of particles. For example, &#x201c;a resin particle (B)&#x201d; may refer to one resin particle (B) or a plurality of resin particles (B).</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">&#x3c;Resin Particle (B) and Third Resin (b)&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The resin particle (B) contains a resin (b) as a third resin, and may, if necessary, contain other component(s).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The shape, structure and size of the resin particle (B) are not particularly limited as long as the resin particle (B) contains the third resin (b) and is in the form of a particle. The resin particle (B) preferably has a volume average particle diameter Dv of 0.1 &#x3bc;m to 15 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 0.5 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m, even more preferably 1 &#x3bc;m to 8 &#x3bc;m, since the intended ratio of the volume average particle diameter Dv of the after-mentioned resin particles (A1) and (A2) to the volume average particle diameter Dv of the resin particle (B) can be easily obtained.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">&#x2014;Third Resin (b)&#x2014;</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The third resin (b) is not particularly limited as long as it has a polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton. Examples of the third resin (b) include a resin obtained by polymerizing a hydroxycarboxylic acid in accordance with a method selected from a variety of methods, and a resin obtained by polymerizing a cyclic ester (as a starting material) capable of forming a resin having a polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">&#x2014;Hydroxycarboxylic Acid and Cyclic Ester&#x2014;</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Examples of the hydroxycarboxylic acid include aliphatic hydroxycarboxylic acids (such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and hydroxybutyric acid), aromatic hydroxycarboxylic acids (such as salicylic acid, creosotic acid, mandelic acid, vanillic acid and syringic acid), and mixtures thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The cyclic ester capable of forming a resin having a polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton is not particularly limited as long as it can produce a polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton by means of ring-opening polymerization, and the cyclic ester may be suitably selected according to the intended purpose. Examples thereof include L-lactide, D-lactide, DL-lactide, racemic lactide, glycolide, &#x3b3;-butyrolactone, &#x3b4;-valerolactone, 6-valerolactone and &#x3b5;-caprolactone. These may be used individually or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In terms of the transparency and thermal properties of the resin particle (C), preferable among these (as monomers which are each capable of forming a polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton) are aliphatic hydroxycarboxylic acids, more preferably C3-C6 hydroxycarboxylic acids, even more preferably glycolic acid, lactic acid, glycolide and lactide, particularly glycolic acid, lactic acid and lactide. When the number of carbon atoms contained in a hydroxycarboxylic acid is less than three, it may be impossible for the obtained polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton to have optical activity. When one or fewer carbon atom is contained in a hydroxycarboxylic acid, formation of a polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton is virtually impossible. When the number of carbon atoms contained in a hydroxycarboxylic acid is more than six, there are many methylene chains contained therein, so that its glass transition temperature (Tg) lowers and thus use of the hydroxycarboxylic acid for a toner may possibly be difficult.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The method for synthesizing the third resin (b) is not particularly limited as long as a resin having a polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton can be obtained from the starting material, and the method may be suitably selected according to the intended purpose. Examples thereof include a method of directly subjecting a hydroxycarboxylic acid to dehydration condensation, and a method of subjecting a relevant cyclic ester to ring-opening polymerization. Among these polymerization methods, a method of subjecting a cyclic ester to ring-opening polymerization is preferable in that the molecular weight of the polyhydroxycarboxylic acid obtained by polymerization can be increased. In the case where the third resin (b) is synthesized by subjecting a cyclic ester of a hydroxycarboxylic acid (as a starting material) to ring-opening polymerization, the polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton of the resin (b) is a skeleton of a polymerized product of the hydroxycarboxylic acid constituting the cyclic ester. For example, the polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton of the resin (b) obtained using lactide is a skeleton of polymerized lactic acid. Additionally, by also using appropriate amounts of an L-monomer and a D-monomer, an amorphous resin of a racemic mixture can be obtained. In the case where lactide is used, L-lactide and D-lactide may be mixed together; alternatively, meso-lactide may be subjected to ring-opening polymerization or mixed with either L-lactide or D-lactide.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The monomer forming the polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton contained in the third resin (b) has optical activity. The resin (b) preferably has an optical purity X (%), represented by Equation (1) below, of 80% or less, more preferably 60% or less. When the optical purity X (%) is in this range, the solubility of the resin in solvent and the transparency of the resin improve.

Nevertheless, the method is preferably as follows. First of all, a measurement target (e.g. a toner or a polymer which has a polyester skeleton) is added to a mixed solvent of purified water, 1 N sodium hydroxide and isopropyl alcohol, then heating and stirring are carried out at 70&#xb0; C., and hydrolysis is carried out. Subsequently, the solution is filtered so as to remove the solid content present in the solution, then sulfuric acid is added for neutralization, and an aqueous solution containing L-lactic acid and/or D-lactic acid, into which a polyester resin has been decomposed, is thus obtained. Regarding this aqueous solution, the peak area S (L) corresponding to L-lactic acid and the peak area S (D) corresponding to the D-lactic acid were measured by means of a high-speed liquid chromatograph using the chiral ligand exchange column SUMICHIRAL OA-5000 (manufactured by Sumika Chemical Analysis Service, Ltd.). Based upon these peak areas, the optical purity X can be calculated as follows.

Thus, a polyurethane aqueous dispersion liquid is obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0137" num="0136">The properties of the resin particle (A1) and the resin particle (A2) are not particularly limited as long as the above-mentioned purpose can be achieved, and the properties may be suitably selected according to the intended purpose. It is preferred that the molecular weights, sp values (the sp values are calculated in accordance with Polymer Engineering and Science, February, 1974, VoL14, No. 2P, 147 to 154), crystallinity, molecular weights between cross-linking points, etc. of the resins (a1) and (a2) be appropriately adjusted to reduce the swelling and dissolution of the resin particle (A1) and the resin particle (A2) in a solvent (used at the time of dispersion) and water.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">The glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the resins (a1) and (a2) are not particularly limited. Nevertheless, the glass transition temperature (Tg (a1)) of the resin (a1) is preferably in the range of 30&#xb0; C. to 70&#xb0; C., more preferably 40&#xb0; C. to 60&#xb0; C. When the Tg (a1) is lower than 30&#xb0; C., the storage stability of the toner may degrade, blocking may be generated at the time of storage and in a developing device, and the charge stability of the toner against changes of use conditions such as temperature and humidity may degrade. When the Tg (a1) is higher than 70&#xb0; C., the resin particle which contains the resin (a1) may hinder adhesion of the toner to toner-fixing paper, and the fixation lower limit temperature may increase.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Also, the glass transition temperature (Tg (a2)) of the resin (a2) is preferably in the range of 55&#xb0; C. to 100&#xb0; C., more preferably 58&#xb0; C. to 75&#xb0; C. When the Tg (a2) is lower than 55&#xb0; C., the storage stability of the toner may degrade, blocking may be generated at the time of storage and in a developing device, and the charge stability of the toner against changes of use conditions such as temperature and humidity may degrade. When the Tg (a2) is higher than 100&#xb0; C., the resin particle which contains the resin (a2) may hinder adhesion of the toner to toner-fixing paper, and the fixation lower limit temperature may increase. Since the purpose of the provision of the resin particle (A1) is to give low-temperature fixation properties to the toner while the purpose of the provision of the resin particle (A2) is to give heat-resistant storage stability to the toner, the relationship Tg (a1)&#x3c;Tg (a2) is preferably satisfied. Also, when the Tg of the resin (a1) and the Tg of the resin (a2) are lower than the temperature at which the aqueous resin dispersion is produced, unification and division among the resin particle (C) may not be effectively prevented, the uniformity of the particle diameter may not be effectively enhanced, and the heat-resistant storage stability of the toner may degrade. Parenthetically, as described above, the Tg is calculated from DSC measurement, or measurement with a flow tester (in the case where DSC measurement is impossible).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The weight average molecular weights of the resins (a1) and (a2) are not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the intended purpose. Nevertheless, they are preferably in the range of 9,000 to 200,000. When the weight average molecular weights are less than 9,000, the storage stability of the toner may degrade, and blocking may be generated at the time of storage and in a developing device. When the weight average molecular weights are greater than 200,000, the resin particle containing the resins (a1) and (a2) may hinder adhesion of the toner to toner-fixing paper, and the fixation lower limit temperature may increase.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Adjustment of the glass transition temperatures (Tg) of the resins (a1) and (a2) can be facilitated by changing the molecular weight of the resin and/or changing the composition of the monomer(s) constituting the resin. The molecular weights (the higher the molecular weights are, the higher the temperatures of the resins are) of the resins (a1) and (a2) may be adjusted by a method known in the art. In the case where the resins are polymerized by consecutive reaction, for example, their molecular weights may be adjusted by adjusting the mixture ratio of monomer(s).</p>

<p id="p-0143" num="0142">The resin particle (C) may be produced by any method and any process, provided that the above conditions are satisfied. Examples of the method include Production Methods (I) and (II) below.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">(I) A method of mixing an aqueous dispersion liquid (W1) of the resin particle (A1) which contains the resin (a1) with [the resin (b), or a organic solvent solution or dispersion liquid thereof] (hereinafter referred to as (O1)) or with [the precursor (b0) of the resin (b), or a organic solvent solution or dispersion liquid thereof] (hereinafter referred to as (O2)), dispersing the (O1) or the (O2) in the aqueous dispersion liquid (W1), thereby (in the case of the precursor (b0)) reacting the precursor (b0) so as to form the resin (b2), and thus forming the resin particle (B) which contains the resin (b) in the aqueous dispersion liquid (W1). The resin (a1) (for example, the resin particle (A1) or the coating film (P1)) is attached to the surface of the resin (B) simultaneously with the formation of the resin particle (B). Further, an aqueous dispersion liquid (W2) of the resin particle (A2) which contains the resin (a2) is dispersed in a subsequent step, i.e. a constricting step, and attached to the surface of the resin particle (B) so as to form an aqueous dispersion (X) of the resin particle (C), then an aqueous medium is removed from this aqueous dispersion (X), and the resin particle (C) is thus produced.
<br/>
(II) A method in which the resin particle (B) which contains the previously produced resin (b) is coated with a coating agent (W&#x2032;) which contains the resins (a1) and (a2) so as to produce the resin particle (C). In this case, the coating agent (W&#x2032;) may be in liquid form, solid form, etc. The resin particle (B) which contains the previously produced resin (b) may be coated with a precursor (al') of the resin (a1) and a precursor (a2&#x2032;) of the resin (a2), and then these precursors may be reacted to yield the resins (a1) and (a2). Also, the resin particle (B) may be produced by any method and may, for example, be a resin particle produced by means of emulsion polymerization aggregation, etc. or a resin particle produced by means of pulverization. The method of the coating using the coating agent (W&#x2032;) is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include a method of dispersing the resin particle (B) or a dispersion of the resin particle (B), which has been previously produced, in an aqueous dispersion liquid (W) of the resin particles (A1) and (A2) which contain the resins (a1) and (a2), and a method of applying a solution of the resins (a1) and (a2) as a coating agent over the resin particle (B). Production Method (I) is particularly preferable in that the resin particles (A1) and (A2) can be attached to the surface of the resin particle (B) even more firmly. Also, in Production Method (I), by adsorbing the resin particle (A1) to the surface of the resin particle (B), unification among the resin particle (C) can be prevented, and the resin particle (C) can be made less dividable under high shearing conditions. This makes it possible to narrow the particle size distribution of the resin particle (C) and enhance the particle diameter uniformity, and thus to perform a function of forming uniform particles.

The charge controlling agent may be encapsulated in or externally added to the resin particle (B). In the case were the charge controlling agent is encapsulated in the resin particle (B), it is advisable to disperse the charge controlling agent in the solution of (O) along with the colorant, etc. In the case where the charge controlling agent is externally added to the resin particle (B), the charge controlling agent may be externally added after the formation of the resin (C).</p>

The organic solvent with the miscibility is not particularly limited as long as it does not cause aggregation of the resin particles (A1) and (A2), it does not dissolve the resin particles (A1) and (A2), or it does not hinder formation of the resin (C).

<p id="p-0197" num="0196">As described above, the toner of the present invention includes the resin particle (C) containing the first resin (a1) and the second resin (a2) which have mutually different glass transition temperatures, and also containing the resin particle (B) which contains the third resin (b); if necessary, the toner may further include other component(s). Examples of the other component(s) include a charge controlling agent, a deforming agent, a colorant, a release agent, an fine inorganic particle, a fluidity improver, a cleanability improver, a magnetic material, etc.</p>
<p id="h-0051" num="0000">&#x3c;&#x3c;Charge Controlling Agent&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">The toner of the present invention may include a charge controlling agent for the purpose of controlling its chargeability. The charge controlling agent is not particularly limited, and examples thereof include the following materials.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Examples of the charge controlling agent include C2-C16 alkyl group-containing azine dyes (Japanese Patent Application Publication (JP-B) No. 42-1627), basic dyes such as C.I. Basic Yellow 2 (C.I. 41000), C. I. Basic Yellow 3, C.I. Basic Red 1 (C.I. 45160), C.I. Basic Red 9 (C.I. 42500), C.I. Basic Violet 1 (C.I. 42535), C.I. Basic Violet 3 (C.I. 42555), C. I.

Basic Blue 9 (C.I. 52015), C.I. Basic Blue 24 (C.I. 52030), C.I. Basic Blue 25 (C.I. 52025), C.I. Basic Blue 26 (C.I. 44045), C.I. Basic Green 1 (C.I. 42040), C.I. Basic Green 4 (C.I. 42000), lake pigments of these basic dyes, C.I. Solvent Black 8 (C.I. 26150), quaternary ammonium salts such as benzoylmethylhexadecylammonium chloride and decyltrimethyl chloride, dialkyl (e.g. dibutyl, dioctyl, etc.) tin compounds, dialkyltin borate compounds, guanidine derivatives, polyamine resins such as amino group-containing vinyl polymers and amino group-containing condensation polymers, the metal complex salts of the monoazo dyes mentioned in JP-B Nos. 41-20153, 43-27596, 44-6397 and 45-26478, the metal (e.g. Zn, Al, Co, Cr, Fe, etc.) complexes of salicylic acid, dialkylsalicylic acids, naphthoic acid and dicarboxylic acids mentioned in JP-B Nos. 55-42752 and 59-7385, sulfonated copper phthalocyanine pigments, organic boron salts, fluorine-containing quaternary ammonium salts, and calixarene compounds. Regarding color toners, not black toners, it goes without saying that use of a charge controlling agent which impairs the intended colors should be avoided and, for example, metal salts such as salicylic acid derivatives, which are white in color, can be suitably used.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The amount of the charge controlling agent is preferably in the range of 0.01 parts by mass to 2 parts by mass, more preferably 0.02 parts by mass to 1 part by mass, with respect to 100 parts by mass of the binder resin (resin contained in the resin particle (B)). When the amount is 0.01 parts by mass or greater, charge controlling capability can be obtained. When the amount is 2 parts by mass or less, the chargeability of the toner does not become too great, effects of a main charge controlling agent are not attenuated, and decrease in fluidity and image density (which is due to increase in electrostatic suction between the toner and a developing roller) is not caused.</p>
<p id="h-0052" num="0000">&#x3c;&#x3c;Deforming Agent&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">The toner of the present invention may include a deforming agent for the purpose of deforming any color toner. The deforming agent may be suitably selected according to the intended purpose as long as the purpose can be achieved. Nevertheless, the deforming agent preferably contains a layered inorganic mineral in which at least some of interlayer ions have been modified with organic ions. In the present invention, the layered inorganic mineral in which at least some of interlayer ions have been modified with organic ions, which is usable as the deforming agent in the present invention, is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the intended purpose. Nevertheless, preference is given to a layered inorganic mineral having a smectite-based crystalline structure, modified with organic cations. Additionally, by replacing part of a divalent metal of the layered inorganic mineral with a trivalent metal, metal anions can be introduced. It should, however, be noted that the introduction of metal anions causes an increase in hydrophilicity, and so preference is given to a layered inorganic compound in which at least some of metal anions have been modified with organic anions.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">The organic cation modifier for use with the layered inorganic mineral in which at least some of ions are modified with organic ions is not particularly limited as long as it can induce the modification as mentioned above.

Here, the layered inorganic mineral partially modified with organic ions preferably occupies 0.05% by mass to 10% by mass, more preferably 0.05% by mass to 5% by mass, of the materials for the toner.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">The layered inorganic mineral partially modified with organic ions may be suitably selected, and examples thereof include montmorillonite, bentonite, hectorite, attapulgite, sepiolite, and mixtures thereof. Among these, organically modified montmorillonite or bentonite is preferable in that toner properties are not adversely affected, viscosity adjustment can be facilitated, and the amount thereof can be small.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">Examples of the layered inorganic mineral partially modified with organic ions, as commercially available products, include quaternium-18 bentonite, or more specifically, BENTONE 3, BENTONE 38 AND BENTONE 38V (manufactured by Rheox, Inc.), TIXOGEL VP (manufactured by United Catalyst Corporation), and CLAYTONE 34, CLAYTONE 40 and CLAYTONE XL (manufactured by Southern Clay Products, Inc.); stearalkonium bentonite, or more specifically, BENTONE 27 (manufactured by Rheox, Inc.), TIXOGEL LG (manufactured by United Catalyst Corporation) and CLAYTONE AF and CLAYTONE APA (manufactured by Southern Clay Products, Inc.); quaternium-18/benzalkonium bentonite, or more specifically, CLAYTONE HT and CLAYTONE PS (manufactured by Southern Clay Products, Inc.).

These may be used individually or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">The color of the colorant of the toner is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the purpose. The colorant may be at least one selected from a colorant of a black toner, a colorant of a cyan toner, a colorant of a magenta toner and a colorant of a yellow toner, and toners of each color can be obtained by appropriately selecting each type of colorant. It is preferred that the colorant be a colorant of a color toner.</p>

Acid Blue 45, copper phthalocyanine pigments each having as substituent(s) one to five phthalimidemethyl groups on the phthalocyanine skeleton, Green 7 and Green 36.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">Examples of color pigments for yellow include C.I. Pigment Yellow 0-16, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, 55, 65, 73, 74, 83, 97, 110, 151, 154 and 180; C.I. Vat Yellow 1, 3 and 20, and Orange 36.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">The amount of the colorant contained in the toner is preferably in the range of 1% by mass to 15% by mass, more preferably 3% by mass to 10% by mass. When the amount is less than 1% by mass, the coloring capability of the toner may decrease. When the amount is greater than 15% by mass, pigment(s) is/are poorly dispersed in the toner, possibly leading to a decrease in coloring capability and degradation of electrical properties of the toner.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">The colorant may be compounded with a resin to form a masterbatch. The resin is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected from resins known in the art, according to the purpose. Examples thereof include polyesters, styrene polymers, polymers of substituted styrene, styrene copolymers, polymethyl methacrylate, polybutyl methacrylate, polyvinyl chloride, polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene, polypropylene, epoxy resins, epoxy polyol resins, polyurethanes, polyamides, polyvinyl butyral, polyacrylic acid resins, rosins, modified rosins, terpene resins, aliphatic hydrocarbon resins, alicyclic hydrocarbon resins, aromatic petroleum resins, chlorinated paraffins and paraffin waxes. Examples thereof also include the polyester resin (b1) having a polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton, which is preferable in that compatibility between the resins improves and the plant matter content increases. These resins may be used individually or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">The masterbatch can be produced by mixing or kneading the colorant and the resin for use in a masterbatch, with the application of high shearing force. In doing so, an organic solvent is preferably added to enhance interaction between the colorant and the resin. Also, use of the so-called flushing method is suitable in that wet cake of the colorant can be used as it is, without requiring drying. The flushing method is a method in which an aqueous paste containing a colorant and water is mixed or kneaded with a resin and an organic solvent and then the colorant is transferred to the resin to remove water and the organic solvent. For this mixing or kneading, a high shearing dispersing device such as a triple roll mill may be used.</p>
<p id="h-0054" num="0000">&#x3c;&#x3c;Release Agent&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">The release agent usable in the toner of the present invention is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the intended purpose. Suitable example thereof include waxes. Examples of these waxes include non-free-fatty-acid type carnauba wax, polyethylene wax, montan wax and oxidized rice wax, which may be used individually or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">It is preferred that the carnauba wax be in fine crystalline form, have an acid value of 5 mgKOH/g or less, and have an particle diameter of 1 &#x3bc;m or less when dispersed in a toner binder.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">The montan wax is generally a montan-based wax obtained by refining a mineral. It is preferred that the montan wax be in fine crystalline form as in the case of the carnauba wax, and have an acid value of 5 mgKOH/g to 14 mgKOH/g.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The oxidized rice wax is rice bran wax oxidized with air. The oxidized rice wax preferably has an acid value of 10 mgKOH/g to 30 mgKOH/g.</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">Any of these waxes can finely disperse into the binder resin of the toner of the present invention, so that the toner can be easily made superior in offset preventability, transfer capability and durability as described later. These waxes may be used individually or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">Examples of other release agents include conventionally known release agents such as solid silicone waxes, higher fatty acid higher alcohols, montan-based ester waxes, polyethylene waxes and polypropylene waxes.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The glass transition temperature Tg of the release agent is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the intended purpose. Nevertheless, it is preferably in the range of 70&#xb0; C. to 90&#xb0; C. When the glass transition temperature is lower than 70&#xb0; C., the heat-resistant storage stability of the toner may degrade. When the glass transition temperature is higher than 90&#xb0; C., separability of the toner at low temperatures is not sufficiently exhibited, so that there may be degradation of cold offset resistance, and paper may be wound around a fixing device.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">The amount of the release agent is not particularly limited. Nevertheless, the amount of the release agent is preferably 1% by mass to 20% by mass, more preferably 3% by mass to 10% by mass, with respect to the resin components of the toner. When the amount is less than 1% by mass, offset may not be sufficiently prevented. When the amount is greater than 20% by mass, transfer capability and durability may degrade.</p>
<p id="h-0055" num="0000">&#x3c;&#x3c;Fine Inorganic Particle&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0225" num="0224">The toner of the present invention may include a fine inorganic particle as an external additive for giving fluidity, developing capability, chargeability, etc. to a toner particle.</p>
<p id="p-0226" num="0225">The fine inorganic particle is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the intended purpose. Examples thereof include silica, alumina, titanium oxide, barium titanate, magnesium titanate, calcium titanate, strontium titanate, zinc oxide, tin oxide, silica sand, clay, mica, wollastonite, diatomaceous earth, chromium oxide, cerium oxide, colcothar, antimony trioxide, magnesium oxide, zirconium oxide, barium sulfate, barium carbonate, calcium carbonate, silicon carbide and silicon nitride. These may be used individually or in combination. The fine inorganic particle preferably has a primary particle diameter of 5 nm to 2 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 5 nm to 500 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0227" num="0226">The fine inorganic particle preferably occupies 0.01% by mass to 5.0% by mass, more preferably 0.01% by mass to 2.0% by mass, of the toner. With this range, it is possible to improve the fluidity, developing capability and chargeability of the toner.</p>
<p id="h-0056" num="0000">&#x3c;&#x3c;Fluidity Improver&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0228" num="0227">The fluidity improver means a fluidity improver capable of performing surface treatment to improve hydrophobicity and preventing degradation of flow properties and charging properties even at high humidity. Examples thereof include silane coupling agents, silylation agents, silane coupling agents containing alkyl fluoride groups, organic titanate-based coupling agents, aluminum-based coupling agents, silicone oil and modified silicone oil. Silica and titanium oxide, in particular, are preferably surface-treated with such a fluidity improver and used as hydrophobic silica and hydrophobic titanium respectively.</p>
<p id="h-0057" num="0000">&#x3c;&#x3c;Cleanability Improver&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0229" num="0228">The cleanability improver is added to the toner to remove a developer remaining on a photoconductor and/or an primary transfer member after image transfer. Examples thereof include metal salts of fatty acids such as of stearic acid, e.g. zinc stearate and calcium stearate; and fine polymer particles produced by soap-free emulsion polymerization, e.g. fine particles of polymethyl methacrylate and polystyrene. As to the fine polymer particles, those which have a relatively narrow particle size distribution and which have a volume average particle diameter of 0.01 &#x3bc;m to 1 &#x3bc;m are favorable.</p>
<p id="h-0058" num="0000">&#x3c;Magnetic Material&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0230" num="0229">The magnetic material is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected from magnetic materials known in the art, according to the purpose. Examples thereof include iron powder, magnetite and ferrite. Among these, those which are white in color are preferable in terms of color tone.</p>
<p id="h-0059" num="0000">(Developer)</p>
<p id="p-0231" num="0230">A developer of the present invention includes the toner of the present invention, and suitably selected other component(s) such as a carrier. The developer of the present invention may be a one-component developer or a two-component developer. In the case where the developer is used, for example, in a high-speed printer, etc. adaptable to the present-day increase in information processing speed, it is preferred that the developer be a two-component developer in view of an increase in lifetime, etc.</p>
<p id="h-0060" num="0000">&#x3c;Carrier&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0232" num="0231">The carrier is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the purpose. Nevertheless, preference is given to a carrier including a core material, and a resin layer that covers the core material.</p>
<p id="p-0233" num="0232">The material for the core material is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected from materials known in the art. For example, manganese-strontium (Mn&#x2014;Sr) materials (50 emu/g to 90 emu/g) and manganese-magnesium (Mn&#x2014;Mg) materials (50 emu/g to 90 emu/g) are preferable. In terms of securing appropriate image density, highly magnetized materials such as iron powder (100 emu/g or greater) and magnetite (75 emu/g to 120 emu/g) are preferable. In terms of the fact that the contact force on a latent electrostatic image bearing member, where toner particles are disposed in an upright position, can be reduced and image quality can be advantageously improved, weakly magnetized materials such as copper-zinc (Cu&#x2014;Zn) materials (30 emu/g to 80 emu/g) are preferable. These may be used individually or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0233">The particle diameter of the core material as an average particle diameter (weight average particle diameter (D50)) is preferably in the range of 10 &#x3bc;m to 200 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 40 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m. When the average particle diameter (weight average particle diameter (D50)) is less than 10 &#x3bc;m, the amount of fine powder increases in the distribution of carrier particles, and this increase causes a decrease in magnetization per particle and thus possibly causes scattering of the carrier. When it is greater than 200 &#x3bc;m, the specific surface area of the carrier particles decreases, thereby possibly causing scattering of the toner, and possibly degrading reproduction of solid portions in the case of full-color images that contain plenty of solid portions.</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0234">The material for the resin layer is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected from resins known in the art, according to the purpose. Examples thereof include amino resins, polyvinyl resins, polystyrene resins, halogenated olefin resins, polyester resins, polycarbonate resins, polyethylene resins, polyvinyl fluoride resins, polyvinylidene fluoride resins, polytrifluoroethylene resins, polyhexafluoropropylene resins, copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and acrylic monomers, copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and vinyl fluoride, fluoroterpolymers (fluorinated triple (multiple) copolymers) such as a terpolymer composed of tetrafluoroethylene, vinylidene fluoride and a nonfluorinated monomer, and silicone resins. These may be used individually or in combination. Among these, silicone resins are particularly preferable in that filming of the toner to the carrier can be effectively prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0235">The silicone resins usable to form the resin layer are not particularly limited and may be suitably selected from generally known silicone resins according to the purpose. Examples thereof include straight silicone resins which contain organo-siloxane bonds only; and silicone resins modified with alkyd resins, polyester resins, epoxy resins, acrylic resins, urethane resins, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0236">The silicone resins may be commercially available products. Examples thereof as straight silicone resins include KR271, KR255 and KR152, manufactured by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.; and SR2400, SR2406 and SR2410, manufactured by Dow Corning Toray Silicone Co., Ltd.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0237">The modified silicone resins may be commercially available products. Examples thereof include KR206 (alkyd-modified resin), KR5208 (acrylic-modified resin), ES1001N (epoxy-modified resin) and KR305 (urethane-modified resin), manufactured by Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd.; and SR2115 (epoxy-modified resin) and SR2110 (alkyd-modified resin), manufactured by Dow Corning Toray Silicone Co., Ltd.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0238">These silicone resins may be used solely or in combination with components subject to cross-linking reaction, components for adjusting the charge amount, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">If necessary, the resin layer that covers the core material may contain conductive powder, etc. Examples of the conductive powder include metal powder, carbon blacks, titanium oxide, tin oxide and zinc oxide. The average particle diameter of any of these conductive powders is preferably 1 &#x3bc;m or less. When the average particle diameter is greater than 1 &#x3bc;m, it may be difficult to control electric resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0240">The resin layer that covers the core material can, for example, be formed by dissolving a silicone resin, etc. in an organic solvent so as to prepare a coating solution, then uniformly applying the coating solution over the surface of the core material by a coating method known in the art, which is followed by drying, and subsequently firing the dried coating solution. Examples of the coating method include immersion, spraying, and coating with the use of a brush.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0241">The organic solvent is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the purpose. Examples thereof include toluene, xylene, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, cellosolve and butyl acetate.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0242">The firing of the resin layer is not particularly limited and may be based upon external heating or internal heating. For example, the firing may be carried out in accordance with a method using a stationary electric furnace, a fluid-type electric furnace, a rotary electric furnace, a burner furnace, etc., or a method using a microwave.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0243">The amount of the resin layer contained in the carrier is preferably in the range of 0.01% by mass to 5.0% by mass. When the amount is less than 0.01% by mass, it may be impossible to uniformly form the resin layer over the surface of the core material. When the amount is greater than 5.0% by mass, the resin layer is so thick that granulation among carrier particles occurs, thereby possibly making it impossible to obtain uniform carrier particles.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">In the case where the developer is a two-component developer, the amount of the carrier contained in the two-component developer is not particularly limited and may be suitably selected according to the purpose.

<p id="p-0267" num="0266">Here, another embodiment of the image forming method of the present invention put into practice by the image forming apparatus is described referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.

This tandem image forming apparatus includes a copier main body <b>150</b>, a paper feed table <b>200</b>, a scanner <b>300</b> and an automatic document feeder (ADF) <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0267">The copier main body <b>150</b> has at its center an intermediate transfer member <b>50</b> in the form of an endless belt. The intermediate transfer member <b>50</b> is supported by support rollers <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> and enabled to rotate clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. An intermediate transfer member cleaning unit <b>17</b> for removing residual toner remaining on the intermediate transfer member <b>50</b> is placed in the vicinity of the support roller <b>15</b>.

<p id="p-0269" num="0268">Next, full-color image formation (color copying) using the tandem-type developing device <b>120</b> will be explained. First of all, a document is set on a document tray <b>130</b> of the automatic document feeder (ADF) <b>400</b>. Alternatively, the automatic document feeder <b>400</b> is opened, the document is placed on a contact glass <b>32</b> of the scanner <b>300</b>, and the automatic document feeder <b>400</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0269">When a start switch (not shown) is pushed, the scanner <b>300</b> is driven after the document is conveyed and moved onto the contact glass <b>32</b>, in the case where the document is set on the document tray of the automatic document feeder <b>400</b>, or the scanner <b>300</b> is immediately driven in the case where the document is set on the contact glass <b>32</b>. Thus, a first carriage <b>33</b> and a second carriage <b>34</b> move. Light coming from a light source is applied to the document by means of the first carriage <b>33</b>, and the light reflected from the document surface is further reflected by a mirror of the second carriage <b>34</b>. The reflected light passes through an image forming lens <b>35</b> and then is received by a reading sensor <b>36</b>, and a color document (color image) is read, thereby producing image information of black, yellow, magenta and cyan.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0270">Pieces of image information of black, yellow, magenta and cyan are transmitted to the image forming units <b>18</b> (the image forming unit for black, the image forming unit for yellow, the image forming unit for magenta and the image forming unit for cyan) in the tandem-type developing device <b>120</b>, and toner images of black, yellow, magenta and cyan are formed in the image forming units. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each of the image forming units <b>18</b> (the image forming unit for black, the image forming unit for yellow, the image forming unit for magenta and the image forming unit for cyan) in the tandem developing unit <b>120</b> includes: a photoconductor <b>10</b> (a black photoconductor <b>10</b>K, a yellow photoconductor <b>10</b>Y, a magenta photoconductor <b>10</b>M or a cyan photoconductor <b>10</b>C); a charging device <b>160</b> which uniformly charges the photoconductor <b>10</b>; an exposing device which exposes the photoconductor in an imagewise manner corresponding to each color image based on each piece of color image information (as shown by the arrow L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) so as to form on the photoconductor a latent electrostatic image corresponding to each color image; a developing device <b>61</b> which develops the latent electrostatic image with the use of each color toner (black toner, yellow toner, magenta toner and cyan toner) so as to form a toner image of each color; a transfer charger <b>62</b> for transferring the toner image onto the intermediate transfer member <b>50</b>; a cleaning device <b>63</b>; and a charge eliminating unit <b>64</b>. Thus, images of each single color (a black image, a yellow image, a magenta image and a cyan image) can be formed based on the pieces of image information of each color. The black image, the yellow image, the magenta image and the cyan image thus formed on the black photoconductor <b>10</b>K, the yellow photoconductor <b>10</b>Y, the magenta photoconductor <b>10</b>M and the cyan photoconductor <b>10</b>C respectively are sequentially transferred (primarily transferred) onto the intermediate transfer member <b>50</b> rotationally moved by the support rollers <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>16</b>. The black image, the yellow image, the magenta image and the cyan image are superimposed on the intermediate transfer member <b>50</b> to form a composite color image (color transfer image).</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0271">Meanwhile, in the paper feed table <b>200</b>, one of paper feed rollers <b>142</b> is selectively rotated, whereby sheets (recording paper) are ejected from one of multiple paper feed cassettes <b>144</b> in a paper bank <b>143</b>, then separated one by one by a separation roller <b>145</b> and sent to a paper feed path <b>146</b>. The sheets (recording paper) are then conveyed by a conveyance roller <b>147</b> to a paper feed path <b>148</b> inside the copier main body <b>150</b> and bumped against a resist roller <b>49</b> to stop. Alternatively, sheets (recording paper) placed on a manual feed tray <b>54</b> are ejected by rotating another one of the paper feed rollers <b>142</b>, separated one by one by the separation roller <b>145</b>, fed through a manual paper feed path <b>53</b>, and similarly, bumped against the resist roller <b>49</b> to stop. Noted that the resist roller <b>49</b> is generally grounded, and it may be used while a bias is applied so as to remove paper powder on the sheets. The resist roller <b>49</b> is rotated synchronously with the movement of the composite color image (color transfer image) on the intermediate transfer member <b>50</b> to send a sheet (recording paper) between the intermediate transfer member <b>50</b> and the secondary transfer device <b>22</b>, and the composite color image (color transfer image) is transferred (secondarily transferred) onto the sheet (recording paper) by the secondary transfer device <b>22</b>. By doing so, the color image is formed on the sheet (recording paper). Note that residual toner remaining on the intermediate transfer member <b>50</b> after the image transfer is cleaned by the cleaning unit <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0272">The sheet (recording paper) on which the transferred color image is formed is conveyed by the secondary transfer device <b>22</b> to the image fixing device <b>25</b>, where the composite color image (color transfer image) is fixed onto the sheet (recording paper) by means of heat and pressure. Thereafter, the sheet (recording paper) is changed in direction by the action of a switch claw <b>55</b>, discharged by a discharge roller <b>56</b> and laid over a discharge tray <b>57</b>. Alternatively, the sheet (recording paper) is changed in direction by the action of the switch claw <b>55</b>, turned over by the sheet reverser <b>28</b> and then transferred back to the image transfer position where an image is recorded on the opposite side of the sheet.

<p id="p-0320" num="0319">In an autoclave, a mixture composed of 1,163 parts by mass of terephthalic acid, 165 parts by mass of isophthalic acid, 25 parts by mass of phthalic acid, 216 parts by mass of adipic acid, 375 parts by mass of ethylene glycol and 730 parts by mass of neopentyl glycol was heated at 260&#xb0; C. for 2.5 hours and subjected to esterification reaction. Subsequently, 0.262 parts by mass of germanium dioxide as a catalyst was added, the temperature of the system was increased to 280&#xb0; C. in 30 minutes, and the pressure of the system was gradually lowered such that it became 0.1 Torr after 1 hour. Under these conditions, polycondensation reaction was further continued. After 1.5 hours, the pressure of the system was changed to normal pressure using nitrogen gas, the temperature of the system was lowered, and when it became 260&#xb0; C., 99 parts by mass of isophthalic acid was added. The ingredients were stirred at 255&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes and then taken out in the form of a sheet, and subsequently the sheet was cooled to room temperature, then pulverized with a crusher, and sieved so as to obtain a polyester resin corresponding to a sieve mesh size of 1 mm to 6 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0320">Further, into a 2 L glass container with a jacket, the following were poured: 200 parts by mass of the polyester resin synthesized; 45 parts by mass of ethylene glycol mono-n-butyl ether; 470 parts by mass of polyvinyl alcohol (&#x201c;UNITIKA POVAL&#x201d; 050G, manufactured by UNITIKA LTD.) 0.5% (by mass) aqueous solution (hereinafter referred to as &#x201c;PVA-1&#x201d;); and an amount of N,N-dimethylethanolamine (hereinafter referred to also as &#x201c;DMEA&#x201d;) equivalent to 1.2 times the amount of all carboxyl groups contained in the polyester resin. When these ingredients were stirred in an open system at 6,000 rpm using desktop HOMO DISPER (T.K. ROBOMIX, manufactured by Tokushu Kika Kogyo Co., Ltd.), it was confirmed that matter in the form of resin particles was not settling at the bottom of the container but was in a completely suspended state. This state was maintained, and 10 minutes after, hot water was passed into the jacket to carry out heating. When the temperature in the container reached 68&#xb0; C., the rotational speed at which the stirring was carried out was changed to 7,000 rpm. The temperature in the container was kept in the range of 6&#xb0; C. to 70&#xb0; C. and the stirring was carried out for a further 20 minutes to thereby obtain a uniform aqueous dispersion which was milky white in color. Then cold water was passed into the jacket, with stirring carried out at 3,500 rpm, to cool the aqueous dispersion to room temperature, then the aqueous dispersion was filtered using a stainless steel filter (635 mesh, plain weave), and a fine particle dispersion liquid (w-8) was thus obtained. Particles of the obtained fine particle dispersion liquid (w-8) had a volume average particle diameter (Dv) of 110 nm. The resin content of this fine particle dispersion liquid (w-8) had a weight average molecular weight (Mw) of 19,000 and a glass transition temperature (Tg) of 50&#xb0; C.</p>

To this prepolymer, 16 parts by mass of triethylamine was added so as to effect neutralization, and then 500 parts by mass of ion-exchange water was added. Subsequently, 12M parts by mass of adipic acid dihydrazide and 22.7 parts by mass of a dihydrazide compound (manufactured by AJINOMOTO CO., INC.) were added to the reaction system, stirring was continued at 50&#xb0; C. for 1 hour, then the ethyl acetate was distilled away at reduced pressure, and a by drazide-terminated polyurethane aqueous dispersion liquid was thus obtained.

From the dripping funnel, a mixture of 80 parts by mass of ethyl acrylate, 15 parts by mass of styrene, 5 parts by mass of diacetoneacrylamide, 2 parts by mass of hydrogen peroxide and 20 parts by mass of ion-exchange water was applied dropwise in 4 hours with stirring, and after the dropwise application of the mixture had finished, stirring was continued for 1 hour. Subsequently, 1 part by mass of hydrogen peroxide was added and stirring was continued at 80&#xb0; C. for 2 hours to thereby complete a graft polymerization reaction. In this manner, a fine particle dispersion liquid (w-9) was obtained. Particles of the obtained fine particle dispersion liquid (w-9) had a volume average particle diameter (Dv) of 170 nm.

ROBOMIX, manufactured by Tokushu Kika Kogyo Co., Ltd.), it was confirmed that matter in the form of resin particles was not settling at the bottom of the container but was in a completely suspended state. This state was maintained, and 10 minutes after, hot water was passed into the jacket to carry out heating. When the temperature in the container reached 68&#xb0; C., the rotational speed at which the stirring was carried out was changed to 7,000 rpm. The temperature in the container was kept in the range of 68&#xb0; C. to 70&#xb0; C. and the stirring was carried out for a further 20 minutes to thereby obtain a uniform aqueous dispersion which was milky white in color. Then cold water was passed into the jacket, with stirring carried out at 3,500 rpm, to cool the aqueous dispersion to room temperature, the aqueous dispersion was filtered using a stainless steel filter (635 mesh, plain weave), and a fine particle dispersion liquid (w-17) was thus obtained.

<p id="p-0349" num="0348">Next, 5 parts by mass of carnauba wax (molecular weight: 1,800, acid value: 2.7 mgKOH/g, penetration: 1.7 mm (at 40&#xb0; C.)) and 5 parts by mass of the masterbatch were placed in 400 parts by mass of each of the resin solutions (1) to (4) obtained in Production Examples 33 to 36. The mixture was passed three times through ULTRA VISCO MILL (a bead mill, manufactured by AIMEX Corporation) under the following conditions: the solution-sending speed was 1 kg/h, the disc circumferential speed was 6 m/sec, and zirconia beads (0.5 mm in particle diameter) were supplied so as to occupy 80% by volume. In this manner, oil phases (1) to (4) were obtained. Note that the oil phases (1) and (4) were each dissolved in 2.5 parts by mass of the ketimine compound so as to yield intended oil phases. The oil phases (1) to (4) correspond to the resin solutions (1) to (4).</p>

<heading id="h-0130" level="1">Preparation of Toner Base Material</heading>
<p id="p-0350" num="0349">Next, 150 parts by mass each of the aqueous medium phases (1) to (9) obtained in Production Examples 24 to 32 were poured into other respective containers. While stirring each aqueous medium phase at 12,000 rpm using T.K. HOMO MIXER (manufactured by Tokushu Kika Kogyo Co., Ltd.), 100 parts by mass of each of the oil phases (1) to (4) obtained in Production Examples 37 to 40 was added in accordance with Tables 8-1 to 8-4, which was followed by mixing for 10 minutes. Thereafter, while stirring the mixture at 300 rpm to 500 rpm using T.K. HOMO MIXER, 5 parts by mass of each of the fine particle dispersion liquids (w-10) to (w-18) obtained in Production Examples 17 to 23 was applied dropwise in accordance with Tables 8-1 to 8-4. Ten minutes after its dropwise application had finished, the mixture was diluted 1.4-fold with ion-exchange water so as to obtain an emulsified slurry. Further, 100 parts by mass of the emulsified slurry was placed in a flask equipped with a stirrer and a thermometer. While stirring the emulsified slurry at a stirring circumferential speed of 20 m/min, solvent removal was carried out at 30&#xb0; C. for 10 hours so as to obtain a dispersed slurry.</p>
<p id="p-0351" num="0350">Next, 100 parts by mass of the dispersed slurry was filtered at reduced pressure, then 100 parts by mass of ion-exchange water was added to the obtained filter cake, and these were mixed at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes using T.K. HOMO MIXER and then filtered. Three hundred parts by mass of ion-exchange water was added to the obtained filter cake, these were mixed at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes using T.K. HOMO MIXER and then filtered twice. Twenty parts by mass of 10% (by mass) sodium hydroxide aqueous solution was added to the obtained filter cake, these were mixed at 12,000 rpm for 30 minutes using T.K. HOMO MIXER and then filtered at reduced pressure. Three hundred parts by mass of ion-exchange water was added to the obtained filter cake, these were mixed at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes using T.K. HOMO MIXER and then filtered. Three hundred parts by mass of ion-exchange water was added to the obtained filter cake, these were mixed at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes using T.K. HOMO MIXER and then filtered twice. Twenty parts by mass of 10% (by mass) hydrochloric acid was added to the obtained filter cake, these were mixed at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes using T.K. HOMO MIXER, then FTERGENT F-310 (manufactured by NEOS COMPANY LIMITED) as a fluorine quaternary ammonium salt compound was added in a 5% (by mass) methanol solution to the mixture such that the amount of the fluorine quaternary ammonium salt was 0.1 parts by mass with respect to 100 parts by mass of the solid content of a toner. Stirring was carried out for 10 minutes, and then the mixture was filtered. Three hundred parts by mass of ion-exchange water was added to the obtained filter cake, these were mixed at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes using T.K. HOMO MIXER and then filtered twice, and a filter cake was thus obtained. The obtained filter cake was dried at 40&#xb0; C. for 36 hours using a circulation wind dryer and then sieved with a mesh whose sieve mesh size was 75 &#x3bc;m, and a toner base material was thus produced.</p>
<p id="p-0352" num="0351">Toner base materials 1 to 43 produced as described in Production Example 41 are shown together in Tables 8-1 to 8-4. Note that toner base materials 40 to 42 were produced in the same manner as in Production Example 41, except that the fine particle dispersion liquids (w-10) to (w-18) (5 parts by mass each) were not added.</p>

<p id="p-0364" num="0363">The particle size distributions of the toners (toner base particles) were measured using COULTER MULTISIZER. Specifically, COULTER MULTISIZER III (manufactured by Coulter Corporation) was used as a measuring apparatus, a personal computer and an interface (manufactured by Nikkaki Co., LTD.) for outputting a number distribution and a volume distribution were connected to the measuring apparatus, and a 1% (by mass) NaCl aqueous solution was prepared as an electrolytic solution, using primary sodium chloride. As for the measuring method, into 100 mL to 150 mL of this aqueous solution as an electrolytic solution, 0.1 mL to 5 mL of a surfactant (alkylbenzene sulfonate) as a dispersant was added, and also 2 mg to 20 mg of a measurement sample was added, then a dispersing process was carried out for 1 minute to 3 minutes using an ultrasonic dispersing device. Further, 100 mL to 200 mL of an electrolytic aqueous solution was poured into a beaker, then the dispersion liquid of the sample was added so as to have a predetermined concentration, and the volume average particle diameter (Dv) and the number average particle diameter (Dn) were calculated by averaging the particle diameters of 50,000 particles, using COULTER MULTISIZER III with an aperture of 100 &#x3bc;m. Based upon the volume average particle diameter (Dv) and the number average particle diameter (Dn) obtained, the ratio (Dv/Dn) was calculated.</p>

<p id="p-0365" num="0364">Using an apparatus made by modifying a fixing unit of an electrophotographic copier (MF-200, manufactured by Ricoh Company, Ltd.) with a TEFLON (registered trademark) roller as a fixing roller, solid images were formed on TYPE 6200, which is plain paper used as transfer paper, (manufactured by Ricoh Company, Ltd.) and on &#x3c;135&#x3e;, which is thick paper used as copying/printing paper, (manufactured by NBS Ricoh Co., Ltd.), with changes in the temperature of a fixing belt, such that the amount of the toner attached for each solid image was 0.85 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>&#xb1;0.1 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. Here, the upper limit temperature at which hot offset did not arise on the plain paper was defined as the fixation upper limit temperature. Also, the lower limit temperature at which the residual ratio of the image density, after a pad had been rubbed against each solid image, was 70% or more was defined as the fixation lower limit temperature. The fixation upper limit temperature and the fixation lower limit temperature thus obtained were evaluated in accordance with the following evaluation criteria.</p>

<p id="p-0375" num="0374">Using a tandem-type color image forming apparatus (IMAGIO NEO 450, manufactured by Ricoh Company, Ltd.), with the surface temperature of a fixing roller set at 160&#xb0; C.&#xb1;2&#xb0; C., a solid image was formed on TYPE 6000 &#x3c;70W&#x3e; (manufactured by Ricoh Company, Ltd.) such that the amount of the toner attached was 1.00 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>&#xb1;0.05 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>. The image density was measured at arbitrarily selected six places on the obtained solid image, using a spectrometer (938 SPECTRODENSITOMETER, manufactured by X-Rite, Inc.), then the image density (average value) was calculated, and the image density (average value) was evaluated in accordance with the following evaluation criteria.</p>
<p id="h-0143" num="0000">[Evaluation Criteria]</p>
<p id="p-0376" num="0375">A: The image density was 2.0 or greater.</p>

<p id="p-0378" num="0377">C: The image density was less than 1.70.</p>
<p id="h-0144" num="0000">&#x3c;&#x3c;Haze Value&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0379" num="0378">A single-color image sample (a solid image formed on an OHP sheet such that the amount of the toner attached was 0.85 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>&#xb1;0.01 mg/cm<sup>2</sup>) as an image sample used for evaluating fixation properties was developed on TYPE PPC-DX (manufactured by Ricoh Company, Ltd.) as an OHP sheet, with the temperature of a fixing belt set at 160&#xb0; C. The haze value of the sample on the sheet was measured using a direct-reading haze value computer (HGM-2DP, manufactured by Suga Test Instruments Co., Ltd.). The obtained haze value was evaluated in accordance with the following evaluation criteria. The haze value is a measure showing the transparency of the toner; the lower this value is, the higher the transparency is, and the better color-generating properties are when an OHP sheet is used.</p>
<p id="h-0145" num="0000">[Evaluation Criteria]</p>
<p id="p-0380" num="0379">A: The haze value was less than 20%.</p>

<p id="p-0382" num="0381">C: The haze value was 30% or more.</p>
<p id="h-0146" num="0000">&#x3c;&#x3c;Heat-Resistant Storage Stability (Penetration)&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0383" num="0382">Each toner was supplied into a 50 mL glass container, then the toner in the glass container was left to stand for 24 hours in a constant-temperature bath set at 50&#xb0; C. This toner was cooled to 24&#xb0; C., then the penetration (mm) thereof was measured in accordance with the penetration test (JIS K2235-1991), and the penetration was evaluated in accordance with the following criteria. Here, the greater the penetration is, the better the heat-resistant storage stability is. When the penetration is less than 5 mm, it is highly likely that problems will arise in practical use.</p>
<p id="h-0147" num="0000">[E valuation Criteria]</p>
<p id="p-0384" num="0383">A: The penetration was 25 mm or greater.</p>

<p id="h-0148" num="0000">&#x3c;&#x3c;Variation Depending Upon Environment&#x3e;&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0388" num="0387">In an environment in which the temperature was 23&#xb0; C. and the relative humidity was 50% (M/M environment), each developer was stirred for 5 minutes using a ball mill. Thereafter, 1.0 g of the developer was taken out and subjected to a nitrogen blow treatment for 1 minute using a blow-off charge amount measuring apparatus (TB-200, manufactured by KYOCERA Chemical Corporation), then the charge amount of the developer was measured, and the obtained charge amount was employed as the charge amount. Also, this measurement was carried out in two conditions, i.e. an environment in which the temperature was 40&#xb0; C. and the relative humidity was 90% (H/H environment) and an environment in which the temperature was 10&#xb0; C. and the relative humidity was 30% environment), and the charge amount of each developer was thus evaluated in the two conditions. The rate of variability depending upon environment was calculated by means of the following equation, using the charge amounts thus obtained. The rate of variability depending upon environment was evaluated in accordance with the following evaluation criteria. The lower the rate of variability depending upon environment is, the more stable chargeability the developer has.</p>

<p id="p-0398" num="0397">The results shown in Tables 9-1 and 9-2 demonstrate that each of the toners of Examples 1 to 39, formed by attaching the first resin (a1) and the second resin (a2), which have mutually different glass transition temperatures, to the surface of the resin having an amorphous polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton could secure a favorable balance between low-temperature fixation properties and heat-resistant storage stability and was favorable in image density, haze value, variation depending upon environment, and fluidity.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0398">Meanwhile, each of the toners of Comparative Examples 1 to 3, in which there is only one type of resin particle present on the resin surface, experienced degradation of heat-resistant storage stability, image density, and variation depending upon environment.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">The toner of Comparative Example 4, in which the binder resin did not have a polyhydroxycarboxylic acid skeleton, experienced degradation of low-temperature fixation properties, although there were two types of resin particles present on the resin surface.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">Since a toner of the present invention makes it possible to secure a favorable balance between fixation properties and storage stability and obtain favorable image quality, it can be suitably used for high-quality electrophotographic image formation. A developer including the toner of the present invention can be widely used in a full-color copier, a full-color laser printer, a full-color facsimile for plain paper, etc. which employs an electrophotographic multicolor image developing method.</p>
