<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a divisional application of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/518,275, filed Sep. 11, 2006, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,718,044.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to controlling the amount of taper that occurs during shaft coating processes, for example on spindle motor shafts, and more particularly to using a multi-step coating process to control the amount of coating taper during shaft coating processes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Groove regions, such as grooved pumping seal regions, have been used in fluid dynamic bearing (FDB) motors. Some FDB motors have a predominantly straight journal bearing formed by opposing inner and outer surfaces of relatively rotating components. For example, a journal bearing may be formed between an inner surface of a bearing sleeve and an outer surface of a shaft. Such journal bearings are designed to maintain a gap between the inner and outer surfaces. Lubricating liquid is commonly disposed in the gap.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Grooved regions, such as grooved pumping seal regions, are typically disposed at one or both ends of the relatively rotating components. The grooved regions may be for pumping lubricating liquid away from openings from which lubricating liquid may escape and/or evaporate. The grooved regions may also be for establishing a minimum flow of lubricating liquid within portions of the motor. Grooved regions may tend to evacuate lubricating liquid from a portion of the journal, and therefore there is some danger that the relatively rotating components may contact each other if jolted or jarred during operation. Such contact may cause wear in the components and may increase risk of premature drive failure.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Further, hydrodynamic fluid bearings used in FDB motors have tight radial gap tolerances. The dynamic performance of a FDB motor is a function of its gap tolerance. One way to maintain the gap tolerance is to have a suitable pair of relatively rotating components (e.g., shaft and sleeve) that ensures insignificant wear of the components if they contact each other upon being jolted or jarred during operation. This can be achieved by coating the surface of one of the components, and selecting a suitable countersurface for the other component. Sputtered carbon or diamond-like carbon (DLC) is a wear-resistant layer used on high performance spindle motor parts.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Coating a shaft using conventional sputtering processes is a challenge due to thickness variation along the length of the shaft. The thickness variation most commonly creates a taper in the shaft's diameter, with coating thickness being the greatest at a point along a surface that is closest to the sputtering target (source). Coating thickness gradually decreases at points of the surface that are farther from the target, creating the taper. In general, taper increases as the coating length (distance from target) increases and as the coating thickness increases.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary magnetic disc drive storage system <b>10</b>, including a housing base <b>12</b> to which is mounted a spindle motor <b>14</b> that rotatably carries storage discs <b>16</b>. An armature assembly <b>18</b> moves transducers <b>20</b> across the surface of the discs <b>16</b>. The environment in which discs <b>16</b> rotate may be sealed by seal <b>22</b> and cover <b>24</b>. In operation, discs <b>16</b> rotate at high speed while transducers <b>20</b> are positioned at any one of a radially differentiated track on the surface of the discs <b>16</b>. This allows transducers <b>20</b> to read and write magnetically encoded information on the surfaces of discs <b>16</b> at selected locations. Discs <b>16</b> may rotate at many thousands of RPM.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To rotate the discs <b>16</b>, spindle motor <b>14</b> typically includes at least one rotatable portion that is supported by one or more bearing surfaces providing a low friction interface with a relatively non-rotating surface. In some exemplary motors, a shaft may rotate within a journal of a fixed bearing sleeve while in others the shaft may be stationary and the bearing sleeve may rotate about the shaft. Aspects described herein may be used in a variety of motor types, even where described with reference to only one motor type.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a cross-section of an exemplary spindle motor <b>14</b>, including a bearing sleeve <b>205</b> with a journal <b>210</b> defined by its interior surface (not separately indicated). As illustrated, journal <b>210</b> extends from a top <b>206</b> of bearing sleeve <b>205</b> to a bottom <b>207</b> of the motor's cross section. Groove regions <b>215</b>, <b>216</b> are disposed within the journal <b>210</b>. Groove regions <b>215</b>, <b>216</b> may be asymmetrical and may function as pumping seals and/or to recirculate lubricating liquid through portions of motor <b>14</b>. A shaft <b>220</b> is disposed within journal <b>210</b>.

<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The following description is presented to enable a person of ordinary skill in the art to make and use various aspects of the inventions. Descriptions of specific materials, techniques, and applications are provided only as examples. Various modifications to the examples described herein will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the general principles defined herein may be applied to other examples and applications without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. For example, aspects and examples may be employed in a variety of motors, including motors for use in disc storage drives. Motors for disc storage drives may be designed and may operate in a number of ways. Exemplary subject matter provided herein is for illustrating various inventive aspects and is not intended to limit the range of motors and devices in which such subject matter may be applied.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary schematic vertical cross-section of shaft <b>220</b> that was coated in accordance with the method of the present invention. This exemplary cross-section is not drawn to scale, so that aspects may be better illustrated. As described above, shaft <b>220</b> includes first end <b>222</b> and second end <b>224</b>. Outer radial surface <b>221</b> extends from first end <b>222</b> to second end <b>224</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, first coating region <b>235</b> may be disposed on outer radial surface <b>221</b> proximate first end <b>222</b>. As illustrated, a portion <b>302</b> of outer radial surface <b>221</b> remains uncoated, and the coating region <b>235</b> is generally thicker near first end <b>222</b>, becoming thinner toward second end <b>224</b>. Thus, coating <b>235</b> may taper monotonically from near first end <b>222</b> towards second end <b>224</b>. The thickness of coating region <b>235</b> near a middle portion <b>309</b> of outer radial surface <b>221</b> may be negligible. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a mask M covers first end <b>222</b> to prevent a coating from being formed thereon. Additionally, middle portion <b>309</b> may be covered with a mask (not shown) to prevent a coating from being formed thereon. When a mask is used, coating region <b>235</b> may terminate abruptly near first end <b>222</b>, as illustrated by shoulder <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In accordance with the present invention, the middle portion <b>309</b> may have a negligible amount of coating, even when the coating portions <b>235</b>, <b>240</b> extend to meet each other in the central portion of the shaft. Each coating then covers about a half of the predetermined length of the shaft. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the entire length of the shaft (with the exception of the masked ends) is covered with some amount of coating.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">A second coating region <b>240</b> may be disposed on outer radial surface <b>221</b>, proximate second end <b>224</b>. A portion <b>303</b> of outer radial surface <b>221</b> remains uncoated (preferably by masking it before coating is applied), and the coating region <b>240</b> is generally thicker near second end <b>224</b>, becoming thinner toward first end <b>222</b>. Thus, coating <b>240</b> may taper monotonically from near second end <b>224</b> towards first end <b>222</b>. The thickness of coating region <b>240</b> near the middle portion <b>309</b> of outer radial surface <b>221</b> may be negligible. A predetermined length L from the shoulder <b>305</b> of coating region <b>235</b> to the shoulder <b>310</b> of coating region <b>240</b> is generally the same as the length L of the coating accomplished via conventional one-step coating processes as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with the present invention, coating the shaft in a two-step process allows coating taper to be controlled so that, for example, it can be reduced to improve radial gap tolerance. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a sputtering target would be placed adjacent the first end <b>222</b> and the second end <b>224</b> for coating, either simultaneously or sequentially. In the case of sequential placement, the same target could be used at both ends of the shaft. The ends would preferably be masked, and the middle portion can also be masked If desirable. In a preferred embodiment of the invention utilizing sequential coating, the process involves applying the first coating <b>235</b> in a first process while keeping the rest of the shaft masked so that it is not coated, and then coating the masked half of the shaft in a second process (second coating <b>240</b>) while making sure the first coating <b>235</b> is not coated again.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the prior art coating process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, coating from a single source must cover the entire predetermined length L of the shaft. Therefore, a sputtering target located at one end of the shaft must apply enough coating to successfully coat the entire predetermined length L of the shaft. This results in a thicker coating being applied on the unmasked portion of the shaft that is closest to the sputtering target. Thus, the taper increases as coating length increases (i.e., there is a larger difference between the thickness of the coating closest to the source and the thickness of the coating farthest from the source). The present invention allows taper to be reduced by having two shorter coating lengths rather than a single, longer coating length. It is to be understood that the present invention contemplates breaking up the predetermined length L to be coated into any number of coating lengths, which may be applied simultaneously or sequentially.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an exemplary schematic vertical cross-section of shaft <b>220</b> that was coated in accordance with another embodiment of the method of the present invention. In this embodiment, a three-step coating process is utilized. First coating region <b>235</b>&#x2032; and second coating region <b>240</b>&#x2032; are disposed on outer radial surface <b>221</b>&#x2032; proximate the first and second ends <b>222</b>&#x2032;, <b>224</b>&#x2032;, respectively. Additionally, at least one additional coating region <b>245</b> is located between the first coating region <b>235</b>&#x2032; and the second coating region <b>240</b>&#x2032;. As illustrated, portions <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> of outer radial surface <b>221</b>&#x2032; may have a negligible amount of coating applied, and may even have no coating, and the coating regions <b>235</b>&#x2032; <b>240</b>&#x2032;, <b>245</b> are generally thicker near the end at which their sputtering target was located. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, one or more masks (not shown) can be used to cover first end <b>222</b>&#x2032;, second end <b>224</b>&#x2032;, and even middle portions <b>312</b>, <b>314</b> to prevent a coating from being formed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In accordance with the present invention, coating the shaft in a three-step process allows taper to be reduced by providing three shorter coatings rather than one long coating. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a sputtering target would be placed adjacent the first end <b>222</b>&#x2032; and the second end <b>224</b>&#x2032;. The sputtering target adjacent the first end <b>222</b>&#x2032; would create the first coating region <b>235</b>&#x2032; and the additional coating region <b>245</b>, and the sputtering target adjacent the second end <b>224</b>&#x2032; would create the second coating region <b>240</b>&#x2032;. The present invention contemplates alternative placement of the sputtering targets. For example, a single target located at either the first end <b>222</b>&#x2032; or the second end <b>224</b>&#x2032; could be used to create all of the coating regions <b>235</b>&#x2032;, <b>240</b>&#x2032;, <b>245</b>. As stated above, the ends <b>222</b>&#x2032;, <b>224</b>&#x2032; would preferably be masked.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In a preferred embodiment of the invention utilizing sequential coating, as described above for the two-step process illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the process involves applying each coating while keeping the rest of the shaft masked. That way, areas that should not be coated will remain uncoated, and each coating region will only be coated a single time.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Exemplary cross-sections of the shaft <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with an applied coating are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>are not drawn to scale, but instead are drawn for illustrating various aspects discussed below. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a </i>illustrates a portion of shaft <b>220</b> proximate first end <b>222</b> and substantially without coating. The coating regions <b>235</b>, <b>240</b> may be disposed to make shaft <b>220</b> approximately symmetric about a center of the shaft; that is, thicknesses of each coating region may be approximately circumferentially equal at equivalent distances from respective ends of the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b </i>illustrates a thicker portion of coating region <b>235</b>, designated as shoulder <b>305</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The thicker portion of coating region <b>240</b>, at shoulder <b>310</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, preferably looks substantially the same. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, the approximately annular shape of the cross-section of coating region <b>235</b> is evident upon recognizing shaft <b>220</b>, about which coating region <b>235</b> is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>c </i>illustrates a central portion of coating region <b>235</b>, designated at <b>307</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. As illustrated, the coating thickness at <b>307</b> is thinner than the thickness at <b>305</b> (illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>d </i>illustrates a thinner portion of coating region <b>235</b> near the shaft middle <b>309</b> (approximately designated). As illustrated, a thickness of coating region <b>235</b> at <b>309</b> begins to be negligible compared with the diameter of shaft <b>220</b>. As discussed above, middle portion <b>309</b> may be shielded during coating to keep middle portion <b>309</b> substantially free from coating. Portions of coating region <b>240</b> preferably look substantially the same.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Coating region <b>235</b> and coating region <b>240</b> preferably comprise a suitable coating material deposited on the outer radial surface <b>221</b> of the shaft <b>220</b>. The present invention contemplates utilizing a physical vapor deposition (PVD) process (sputtering process), and other deposition processes, to coat the shaft.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Coating material may include any variety of suitable material, including diamond-like coating materials and ceramic-type materials. The present invention contemplates a single coating for each coating region, multiple coatings of the same material for each coating region, or multiple separate coatings for each coating region, where each separate coating includes a different material. By example, a first layer of a coating region may be designed to improve adhesion of a later disposed carbon-rich layer. Coating material may also be disposed in numerous coatings, depending on a desired coating thickness and devices used in forming the coating (e.g., some machines may be limited in growth rate per time, or the shaft <b>220</b> may be examined during coating deposition).</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In one exemplary embodiment of the invention, the coating regions are approximately 0.5-3.0 &#x3bc;m thick at their thickest points and taper uniformly toward a central portion of the shaft. In exemplary aspects, near shaft middle <b>309</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, coating region <b>235</b> and/or coating region <b>240</b> are of negligible thickness, for example, less than 0.5 &#x3bc;m. For other background relating to coatings, refer to U.S. Pat. No. 6,664,685, entitled, &#x201c;HIGH ADHESION, WEAR RESISTANT COATINGS FOR SPINDLE MOTORS IN DISK DRIVE/STORAGE APPLICATIONS,&#x201d; filed on Dec. 13, 2001, which is incorporated in its entirety by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As described briefly above, to establish coating region <b>235</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, coating material is preferably provided from near first end <b>222</b>, and to establish coating region <b>240</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, coating material is preferably provided from near second end <b>224</b>. By providing the coating material from near the shaft ends in the present invention, a differential in coating thickness may be established through diffusion along outer radial surface <b>221</b> from a source of coating material. Thus, in the present invention, the outer radial surface <b>221</b> lies substantially parallel to a source direction of coating material (e.g., the general direction of travel of the coating material from the target). Providing coating material from near the shaft ends more easily establishes a desirable taper shape for the coating regions.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The present invention also contemplates controlling coating taper by varying the thickness of the mask M placed over the ends <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> of the shaft <b>220</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a shaft <b>220</b> having a mask M placed over each end <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> prior to applying coatings <b>235</b>, <b>240</b>. The masks M have a thickness as indicated by the arrows. Various distances along the length of the shaft <b>220</b> are indicated. Measurement of coating thickness at these distances is discussed below. Studying the effect of two mask thicknesses (100 microns and 250 microns) on resulting coating thickness and taper has shown that a thinner mask applied to an end of the shaft achieves a desired coating thickness at a shorter distance from the mask (and therefore at a shorter distance from the shaft end). In addition, a thicker mask provides a reduced coating taper. Thus, varying the thickness of a mask applied at the ends of the shaft allow the thickness and taper of the adjacent coatings to be controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">For example, using a known sputtering target near the shaft end and a mask on each shaft end <b>222</b>, <b>224</b> with a 250 micron thickness, the first coating <b>235</b>&#x2033; has the following thicknesses and standard deviations:</p>

Further variations may include emitting matter for different amounts of time from each source to establish asymmetrical coatings. Still further variations may include measuring coating thickness during deposition and ceasing provision of matter when a desired thickness has been achieved (in addition to or in place of emitting coating material for the predetermined time). Deposition may also be conducted in numerous discrete time intervals, rather than a single predetermined time. Shaft <b>220</b> may be disposed on a stationary holder or a conveyor that moves parallel to the first and/or the second matter source. Other modifications and variations may be apparent to one of skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">To summarize certain aspects of the invention, a thickness gradient or taper of coating material may be established from first end <b>222</b> and extending towards middle portion <b>309</b>. A similar thickness gradient or taper may be established from second end <b>224</b> by either a separate source of coating material or by the same source after coating region <b>235</b> has been formed (or vice versa if coating region <b>240</b> were formed first). By applying the coating in more than one step, as described in detail above, a coating with substantially no taper over the predetermined length L of a workpiece is achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Other modifications and variations would also be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art from the exemplary aspects presented. For example, the method of the invention can be applied to coating other types of workpieces that require a controlled coating taper and have a length of surface requiring coating that would benefit from being coated in a two or more smaller lengths. In addition, various exemplary methods and systems described herein may be used alone or in combination with various fluid dynamic bearing and capillary seal systems and methods. Additionally, particular examples have been discussed and how these examples are thought to address certain disadvantages in related art. This discussion is not meant, however, to restrict the various examples to methods and/or systems that actually address or solve those disadvantages.</p>
