<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0013">While affluent consumers with mild hearing loss can readily obtain professionally fitted binaural hearing aids for a high cost, that high cost is out of the question for the 20-40% of those who may need hearing aids but cannot afford them. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates an exemplary high-cost custom-made hearing aid <b>10</b> that provides good performance during constant use. The conventional in-the-ear hearing aid <b>10</b> may comprise a battery drawer <b>14</b>, which swings out to accept a battery (not shown). The battery must be oriented properly before insertion to prevent wedging the battery in backwards or causing damage to the hearing aid. Microphone inlet <b>12</b> and volume control <b>16</b> are standard features on such hearing aids. Ear-tip <b>18</b> is custom molded to fit an individual's ear, so that the hearing aid must be oriented properly for insertion in the ear in order to avoid discomfort and obtain a good seal to the ear. When properly oriented and inserted, the snug fit of the ear-tip in the ear canal provides a good seal and prevents uncomfortable feedback of sounds.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0014">Low-cost mail-ordered or over-the-counter hearing aids (such as &#x201c;Hunter's aids&#x201d; at sporting-goods stores) are available for a low cost compared to the professionally fitted binaural hearing aids. However, these lower cost hearing aids have certain disadvantages. For example, some of the low-cost hearing aids utilize ear-tips that fit only a fraction of the population, causing feedback whistling or discomfort for many of those who try them. Other low-cost hearing aids utilize ear-tips that may seal well if the correct one of multiple sizes is chosen, but are not cleanable and thus must be replaced regularly. Most of these low-cost hearing aids have high distortion and generally poor sound quality. Additionally, most low-cost hearing aids lack automatic wide-dynamic-range-compression amplification such as that found in the high-quality hearing aids designed for constant use, automatically adjusting the gain and frequency response so that quiet sounds are made audible while loud sounds are not uncomfortably amplified.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0015"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> illustrates an exemplary low-cost hearing aid <b>20</b> available on the market. This hearing aid <b>20</b> has an advanced volume control. However, an uncomfortable feedback noise typically sets in before adequate gain is obtained, rendering this type of hearing aid of marginal or no benefit to the user. In this hearing aid <b>20</b>, the battery may be replaced by unscrewing battery cap <b>24</b> and inserting a new battery. For the hearing aid <b>20</b> to function, proper battery orientation must be maintained. Hearing aid <b>20</b> must be properly oriented to fit in the ear. Single-flange ear-tip <b>28</b> provides a seal to some ears, but internal feedback on many of these hearing aids results in a whistling noise at low volume control settings, which makes the seal to the ear irrelevant. The hearing aid <b>20</b> also comprises microphone inlet <b>22</b> and volume control <b>26</b>. This hearing aid is not designed to an individual's ear, but is instead intended to fit most users.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> illustrates another exemplary low-cost hearing aid <b>25</b> for people with mild to moderate hearing loss, available for purchase in non-medical environments. Hearing aid <b>25</b> may be worn as required, and not necessarily all the time. This hearing aid can be fitted at the time of purchase using a system such as, for example, Microsound's Eartuner interactive fitting system. This hearing aid is also not designed to an individual's ear, but is instead intended to fit most users. Hearing aid <b>20</b> must be properly oriented to fit in the ear.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates another exemplary low-cost hearing aid <b>30</b>, intended to fit most users. The hearing aid <b>30</b> is a sophisticated one-size-fits most hearing aid. This hearing aid may contain high-quality amplification. Hearing aid <b>30</b> may comprise a microphone inlet <b>32</b>, a battery drawer <b>34</b>, and volume control <b>36</b>. Ear-tip <b>38</b> has been statistically chosen to provide comfortable fit to a large number of persons when properly oriented in the ear. In this design, only low-gain amplification is usually possible because of a lack of custom fit of the ear-tip to the ear, which results in a lack of complete seal. As with the custom hearing aid <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the battery in hearing aid <b>30</b> must be properly oriented before insertion to prevent wedging the battery in backwards, which may result in damaging the hearing aid. Hearing aid <b>30</b> must also be properly oriented to fit properly in the ear canal. Variations on hearing aid <b>30</b> are now available in which a choice of several foam ear-tips may be snapped onto a molded tip of ear-tip <b>38</b>. When the proper size is chosen, hearing aid <b>30</b> can provide a good seal and good comfort for the user. Such foam ear-tips must be replaced at regular intervals, the battery must be properly oriented, and the hearing aid must still be properly oriented to fit in the ear.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0018">Existing hearing aids are designed in irregular shapes that may approximate the shape of the ear, but are difficult for many purchasers to insert because the hearing aid must be orientated properly to be inserted comfortably and to work properly. Furthermore, existing hearing aids have battery drawers that may be difficult for certain persons to manipulate, and that require the battery to be inserted with the proper polarity, which may be a daunting task for persons whose vision and possibly sense of feel have been impaired with age or illness.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0019">Another prior art alternative may be the Songbird disposable hearing aid, which is a low-cost hearing aid and has at least a few of the problems discussed hereinabove. The Songbird hearing aid has been compared favorably with a well-known high-performance two-channel analog hearing aid and two well-known digital hearing aids. However, the problem with the Songbird hearing aid is that because it is disposable, the annual cost of purchasing a pair of aids each month is substantially less than the cost of most professionally-dispensed hearing aids, but still out of reach of many persons in lower-income brackets.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0020">Simplified, mass-produced, in-the-canal hearing aids currently exist (U.S. Pat. No. 4,870,688, filed May 27, 1986) and may be produced in large quantities to fit most hearing aid users, thus eliminating a need for production of hearing aids produced to fit only the one individual's ear. There are at least several disadvantages associated with this device. For example, even though the hearing aids are mass-produced, thus requiring no need for producing an individualized fit for each patient and possibly lowering the cost of production and the cost of the device, the components are selected by the patient to fit their individual hearing needs. This requires the patient to visit a specialist, which may possible increase the over-all cost of getting the hearing aid device. In addition, the design of the hearing aid shell is such that it only fits in the ear canal if oriented in a certain direction.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0021">Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of skill in the art, through comparison of such systems with some aspects of the present invention as set forth in the remainder of the present application with reference to the drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0046">This invention relates to hearing aids and especially to a lower-cost/high-quality hearing aids intended for occasional use. An embodiment of the present invention is particularly directed to hearing aids that may be purchased either from a professional or over the counter at pharmacies and retail stores.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0047">The present invention relates generally to low-cost hearing aids, and specifically to hearing aids available for purchase over-the-counter in non-medical environments. Furthermore, the present invention relates to hearing aids designed such that they are one-size-fits-most hearing aids.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary one-size-fits-most hearing aid <b>100</b>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In an embodiment of the present invention, the hearing aid <b>100</b> may comprise a triple-flange ear-tip <b>180</b> attached to a cylindrical housing containing a replaceable battery, a microphone, an amplifier, a receiver to reproduce the amplified sound, and a switch.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0049">In an embodiment of the present invention, hearing aid <b>100</b> may have a generally cylindrical shape. A battery sleeve <b>140</b> and main body or housing <b>130</b> may also be cylindrical. Ear-tip <b>180</b> may have rotational symmetry around its axis and the axis of the hearing aid <b>100</b>. In particular, ear-tip flanges <b>184</b>, <b>185</b>, and <b>186</b> and ear-tip stem <b>182</b> may all be generally round. The use of the three ear-tip flanges <b>184</b>, <b>185</b>, and <b>186</b> may increase the percentage of persons who can obtain a good comfortable seal in the ear canal. The ear-tip flanges <b>184</b>, <b>185</b>, and <b>186</b> are in a decreasing size, whereas the smallest flange <b>186</b> is closest to the tip of the hearing aid <b>100</b>, and the largest flange <b>184</b> is farthest away from the tip of the hearing aid <b>100</b>. Consequentially, if the smallest flange <b>184</b> does not seal the ear canal well, the slightly larger flange <b>185</b> may do so, and if the flange <b>185</b> also does not completely seal the ear canal, the largest flange <b>186</b> may do so, thus ensuring a comfortable and good seal of the ear canal for a larger number of users than if one flange were used. In an embodiment of the present invention, the ear tip <b>180</b> may be similar to the ear tip available in high-fidelity earplugs such as, for example, the high-fidelity earplugs disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,852,683, filed Jan. 27, 1988, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,967, filed May 7, 1990, and high-fidelity insert earphones such as, for example, the high-fidelity insert earphones disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,887,070, filed Dec. 19, 1996. Accordingly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,852,683, filed Jan. 27, 1988, U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,967, filed May 7, 1990, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,887,070, filed Dec. 19, 1996, are hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0050">Ensuring a good seal to the ear canal for a hearing aid generally provides a good performance, because, for example, it prevents unwanted audio feedback of sounds, which may interfere with the sounds coming into the hearing aid.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates an exemplary view of the hearing aid <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with the battery sleeve <b>140</b> retracted, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In an embodiment of the present invention, when the battery sleeve <b>140</b> is retracted and the battery slot <b>142</b> is exposed, a battery <b>144</b> may be inserted from either side of the battery slot <b>142</b> and the battery may be inserted with either polarity. In an embodiment of the present invention, once the battery is inserted, the hearing aid <b>100</b> may become functional regardless of whether the battery sleeve <b>140</b> is in a closed or open position. Using a retractable battery sleeve <b>140</b> that accepts a battery <b>144</b> from either side with either polarity at insertion may require less dexterity from a user, which may provide an easier operation of the hearing aid <b>100</b>. The design of the retractable sleeve <b>140</b> may allow any user to be able to retract the sleeve for battery replacement regardless of, for example, motor ability, vision, etc. Additionally, the design of the retractable battery sleeve <b>140</b>, which may ensure that the hearing aid <b>100</b> operates upon insertion of a battery <b>144</b>, even if the retractable battery sleeve <b>140</b> remains retracted, ensures that a user may be capable of enjoying the functionality of the hearing aid <b>100</b> even if the user forgets to reposition the battery sleeve <b>140</b> to a closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0052">In an embodiment of the present invention, hearing aid <b>100</b> may also comprise a switch <b>204</b>, which may be a multi-position switch that functions as an on-off switch. In an embodiment of the present invention, the switch <b>204</b> may function as a volume control. In an embodiment of the present invention, the switch <b>204</b> may function as both an on-off switch and a volume control.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates an exemplary view of the hearing aid <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> with the ear-tip <b>180</b> removed, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In an embodiment of the present invention, the hearing aid <b>100</b> may comprise a stem <b>190</b> containing replaceable acoustic damper assembly <b>191</b>. The replaceable acoustic damper assembly <b>191</b> may comprise an acoustic damper <b>194</b> as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,666,295, filed Jan. 23, 2001. Accordingly, U.S. Pat. No. 6,666,295, filed Jan. 23, 2001, is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In an embodiment of the present invention, the hearing aid <b>100</b> may also comprise a wax guard <b>222</b>, which may be added to the ear-tip <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an exemplary exploded view of the hearing aid <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The hearing aid <b>100</b> may comprise an electro-acoustic subassembly or module <b>150</b>, which may contain a microphone <b>152</b>. Sounds may be received by the microphone <b>152</b>, through sound inlet <b>135</b>. Sound inlet <b>135</b> may be located on a side surface (e.g., surface <b>121</b>) of the main body or housing <b>130</b>, rather than on an end or faceplate type surface (e.g., surface <b>145</b>). The hearing aid <b>100</b> may have one or more sound inlet <b>135</b> to ensure that sounds may be received by the microphone regardless of the orientation by which the hearing aid is inserted in the ear. The microphone <b>152</b> may then provide an electrical signal to amplifier <b>156</b> mounted on flexible circuits <b>161</b> and <b>163</b>. In an embodiment of the present invention, the microphone <b>152</b> may be mounted near the ear-tip attachment so that it may pick up the naturally amplified sound of the ear and cochlea. In an embodiment of the present invention, the amplifier <b>156</b> may be a wide-dynamic-compression high-fidelity amplifier such as, for example, the K-AMP&#x2122; wide-dynamic-range compressor circuit described by U.S. Pat. No. 5,131,046, filed Nov. 3, 1989, incorporated into an integrated circuit that may include a new integrated circuit Class B amplifier. Accordingly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,131,046, filed Nov. 3, 1989, is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. A high-fidelity amplifier such as, for example, the K-AMP&#x2122; amplifier may provide no gain for high-level inputs, more gain for moderate-level inputs, and the greatest amount of gain for low-level inputs. The K-AMP&#x2122; amplifier may also include frequency-dependent compression, such that for low-level inputs, high frequency sounds may be amplified more than low-frequency sounds.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0055">Such an amplifier may eliminate the need for a separate amplifier, which may be otherwise required to maintain high sound quality and low distortion at high levels, and may provide acceptable battery drain. The electrical output of amplifier <b>156</b> may be connected to a receiver <b>154</b> through the circuit <b>161</b>. The receiver <b>154</b> may provide amplified sound through the stem <b>190</b> and the ear-tip <b>180</b> to the ear of the user. Plots illustrating the performance of a high-fidelity amplifier such as, for example, the K-AMP&#x2122; amplifier are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,170,720, filed Mar. 3, 1978, which is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> illustrates a plot of the frequency response simulation of an exemplary high-fidelity amplifier, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The plot of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the frequency response for inputs at 60 dB, 70 dB, and 90 dB, illustrating that as the input sound gets quieter, the output gain increases.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0056"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a plot of an actual frequency response of an exemplary high-fidelity amplifier, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The curves <b>401</b>, <b>403</b>, <b>405</b>, and <b>407</b> correspond to inputs at 60 dB, 70 dB, 80 dB, and 90 dB, respectively. The curves of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrate the same result as the simulated curve of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, that is, as the input sound gets quieter, the output gain increases.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates a plot of an actual composite input/output curve of an exemplary high-fidelity amplifier, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> illustrates, as illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the output gain increases as the input sound gets quieter. For example, an input at 50 dB may correspond to an output at or around 60 dB, whereas, an input at 90 dB may correspond to an output at or around 90 dB.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0058">In an embodiment of the present invention, the gain in the hearing aid <b>100</b> may take on one of three values corresponding to a selection made by the user of the hearing aid <b>100</b>. One selection may be for essentially an off position, which may be equivalent to turning the hearing aid device <b>100</b> off. A second selection may be a standard gain position where a wide-dynamic-compression high-fidelity amplifier such as, for example the K-AMP&#x2122; wide-dynamic-range compressor circuit may be used. At the standard gain position, there may be no gain and no loss when there are loud sounds and noises in the environment surrounding the user; hence, inputting the loud sounds and noises as is into the user's ear. Additionally, at the standard gain position, amplification may be provided when the sounds in the environment surrounding the user are soft. A third selection may be a high gain position, which may be selected to accommodate users with greater hearing loss. At the high gain position, all sounds may be amplified, thus have positive gain, even when they are initially loud. In an alternative embodiment of the present invention, the hearing aid device <b>100</b> may provide more or less gain selections to accommodate several level of hearing loss severity.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0059">In an embodiment of the present invention, the battery slot <b>142</b> may allow the battery to be inserted properly regardless of orientation. Battery contacts <b>146</b> and <b>148</b> may be connected to a flex-strip <b>165</b> and printed circuit disk <b>202</b> and to circuit <b>158</b>, which may automatically switch the polarity of the battery connections as necessitated by the circuitry of the hearing aid <b>100</b>. Circuit <b>158</b> may be an automatic polarity switching circuit such as, for example, the automatic polarity switching circuit of U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,550, filed Mar. 9, 1995. Accordingly, U.S. Pat. No. 5,623,550, filed Mar. 9, 1995 is hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. As a result, a user of the hearing aid <b>100</b> need not be concerned with battery polarity, since the circuit <b>158</b> provides proper polarity to circuit <b>156</b> in either case.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0060">In an embodiment of the present invention, the circuit <b>158</b> may not be utilized, and hence may not provide an automatic polarity switching circuitry. In such an embodiment, the battery slot <b>142</b> may have an irregular shape corresponding to the external shape of the battery such that the battery may fit into the battery slot <b>142</b> only when the battery is inserted with the correct orientation. As a result, the shape of the battery slot <b>142</b> may ensure correct polarity of the battery.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0061">In an embodiment of the present invention, the battery sleeve <b>140</b> may have an end or faceplate surface <b>145</b> having an opening <b>143</b> located at or on an end outer surface of the hearing aid <b>100</b>. Opening <b>143</b> may allow a lever <b>206</b> of the switch <b>204</b> to be activated when the battery sleeve <b>140</b> is in the normal closed position as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0062">In an embodiment of the present invention, the replaceable acoustic damper assembly <b>191</b> may include the acoustic damper <b>194</b>, and an acoustic damper housing <b>192</b>, which may be molded to be a snug press fit into the stem <b>190</b> of the hearing aid <b>100</b>. The acoustic damper <b>194</b> may provide a smoother frequency response in the hearing aid <b>100</b> and may also prevent wax from reaching the receiver <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0063">In an embodiment of the present invention, for ease of assembly, rectangular hole <b>138</b> and pawl <b>137</b> may be molded in halves <b>134</b> and <b>132</b>, respectively, of the main body <b>130</b>. Thus, during assembly, the housing halves <b>134</b> and <b>132</b> may snap together and enclose electro-acoustic subassembly or module <b>150</b>. The battery sleeve <b>140</b> may have a lip <b>141</b>, which may be molded to snap over sides <b>139</b> of portion <b>134</b> of the main body <b>130</b> of the hearing aid <b>100</b>. The sides <b>139</b> form the battery slot <b>142</b>, which may be designed to accept a battery equally well from either side.

The battery slot <b>142</b> may be defined by the sides <b>139</b>, which may be attached to the hearing aid main body or housing <b>130</b>. In embodiments of the present invention, an old battery <b>144</b> need not be removed, instead a new battery may replace the old battery by simply inserting the new battery into the battery slot in any of the four possible positions, and doing so forces the old battery to be disposed of automatically from the other side.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0071"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrate an exemplary exploded and side view, respectively, of the circuit subassembly or module <b>150</b> of the hearing aid <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In an embodiment of the present invention, the microphone <b>152</b> and the receiver <b>154</b> may be mounted on opposite sides of the circuit <b>161</b>. In such an embodiment the microphone <b>152</b> and the receiver <b>154</b> may be connected through the circuit <b>161</b>. In another embodiment of the present invention, the microphone <b>152</b> and the receiver <b>154</b> may be mounted on the same side of the circuit <b>161</b>. In such an embodiment the microphone <b>152</b> and the receiver <b>154</b> may be connected directly or through the circuit <b>161</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0072">The subassembly or module <b>150</b> with a battery inserted between battery contacts <b>146</b> and <b>148</b>, comprises a complete hearing aid and may provide a hearing aid functionality by itself, regardless of housing. In embodiments of the present invention, the subassembly or module <b>150</b> may be inserted, with a battery, into a housing to provide hearing aid functionality without requiring any additional wiring or other set up.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0073">In embodiments of the present invention, the hearing aid <b>100</b> may provide a smooth, high-fidelity frequency response. The hearing aid <b>100</b> may also provide a wide-dynamic-range compression amplification, in addition to a good seal to the ear that is adequately comfortable for occasional use. The battery insertion into the hearing aid <b>100</b> may not require too much dexterity since either orientation and either insertion direction of a battery into the battery slot will be acceptable. Thus, hearing aid <b>100</b> may require very little, if any, training to get proper functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0074">In embodiments of the present invention, the hearing aid <b>100</b> may provide a high-quality hearing aid for a user by having the frequency response and gain automatically adapted as a function of the level of the incoming signals. As a result, the hearing aid <b>100</b> may be adequate for occasional use for the majority of persons with mild-to-moderate hearing loss.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0075">The hearing aid <b>100</b> may also be cylindrical in shape such that insertion into the ear only requires that the orientation of the hearing aid <b>100</b> be such that the soft ear-tip <b>180</b> is inserted toward the ear. No other specific orientation by the user is required before insertion into the ear, because of, for example, the symmetrical shape of the housing of the hearing aid. This aspect of the present invention may be of particular benefit to users who may have difficulty with hand dexterity or poor vision, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0076">In embodiments of the present invention, the battery of the hearing aid <b>100</b> may be replaced by inserting a new battery into either opening of a battery slot, in either orientation, wherein the spent battery is automatically and simultaneously ejected from the opposite opening and discarded.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0077">In an embodiment of the present invention, the wide-dynamic-compression high-fidelity amplifier <b>156</b> may be incorporated into an integrated circuit that includes a new integrated circuit amplifier, which eliminates the need for a separate amplifier that would otherwise be required in order to maintain high sound quality and low distortion at high levels with acceptable battery drain.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0078">In an embodiment of the present invention, the circuitry of the hearing aid <b>100</b> may operate without high power consumption, thus elongating the lifecycle of a battery.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0079">In an embodiment of the present invention, the ear-tip of the hearing-aid device may be made with flexible material such that when inserted in the ear canal of a user of the hearing aid, the ear-tip may conform to the shape of the user's ear canal to provide the highest seal and minimize feedback of noises and hence minimize distortion.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0080">In an embodiment of the present invention, the hearing-aid device may be small in size, such that it may fit in the user's ear without being uncomfortable or visible, but such that the user may still easily access the device and remove it. In one embodiment of the present invention, the hearing aid, while completely assembled and the battery slot covered, may be approximately 1.25 inches in length, and with the battery sleeve open and the battery slot completely exposed the hearing aid may be approximately 1.5 inches in length. The cylindrical portion of the body of the hearing-aid device may be approximately less than 0.5 inches in diameter, and the largest flange of the ear-tip may be approximately 0.5 inches in diameter. It should be understood that these dimensions are representative of one embodiment of the present invention, and the hearing-aid device of the present invention may have dimensions slightly variable from the ones disclosed hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0081">While the present invention has been described with reference to certain embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted without departing from the scope of the present invention. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the present invention without departing from its scope. Therefore, it is intended that the present invention not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed, but that the present invention will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
