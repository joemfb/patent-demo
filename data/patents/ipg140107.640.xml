<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is based on, and claims priority from, British Application Number 0720702.0, filed Oct. 23, 2007, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to the assembly together of structural components and particularly where those structural components require shimming to take up small clearance fits.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Manufactured components are generally produced to a size with small variations within an acceptable tolerance limit. When fabricating such individual components together into a multi-part structural assembly, such as an aircraft wing, small clashes between the components (interference fits) or gaps (clearance fits) can occur. In the case of an interference fit, material has to be removed from one or both of the components whilst retaining sufficient structural integrity. For clearance fits, several options are available for filling the gap depending upon its magnitude. For small gaps a liquid spacer which hardens can be used. However, for gaps which are greater than the limits allowed for liquid shimming, it is necessary to insert a hard packer. If the packer merely fills the gap between the components and there is no fixing to either component then there is a limit to the thickness of the gap that can be filled before the presence of the thick packer begins to compromise the structural integrity of the joint. Fatigue cycling and material creep in service can compromise the integrity of the joint.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One shim is known from U.S. Pat. No. 5,815,992 which comprises two parts and which is adjustable in height.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another shim is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,230,446. That shim comprises a wedge shaped shim which is pre-scored to enable easy breaking off and which has a series of recesses on the underside thereof to resist sliding.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Neither arrangement determines the surface profile of the structural element or elements against which the shim is to be located.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A first aspect of the invention provides a method of making a shim for arrangement against a structural component comprising the steps of:</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">providing a first structural component having an assembly surface against which a shim is intended to be arranged, mapping the assembly surface of the first structural component, forming a shim having a shim surface which is provided with a feature which is shaped to conform with at least part of the mapped assembly surface.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In that way, by mapping the assembly surface and creating a shim having a shim surface with complementary features preserves the shear capability of the shim when arranged between the structural components and maintains the structural integrity of the joint between the components and the shim.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A second aspect of the invention provides a structural sub-assembly comprising a structural component having an assembly surface provided with a formation and a shim having a shim surface provided with a shim feature shaped to conform with the formation, the shim being arranged against the structural component so that the assembly surface and the shim surface are in contact with each other and a shim feature conforms with the formation.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A third aspect of the invention provides a shim for arrangement against a structural component, the shim having a shim surface which is provided with a first feature defining opposite ends spaced apart by first distance and a second feature spaced from the first feature defining opposite ends spaced apart by a second, different distance.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Further preferred features of the method, the sub-assembly and the shim are set out in the claims appended hereto.</p>

<?DETDESC description="Detailed Description" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a rib foot <b>10</b> of a rib for an aircraft wing assembly is shown. The rib foot <b>10</b> comprises a rectangular foot plate <b>12</b> mounted on a leg <b>14</b>. The foot plate <b>12</b> has an assembly face <b>16</b> which, in use, is assembled against another structural component. The assembly face <b>16</b> has a series of recesses <b>18</b> formed therein which may be circular or any other appropriate shape. In the embodiment shown, the recesses are circular. Each of the recesses has a diameter D<b>1</b> to D<b>4</b> which may be the same as each other or may differ. In the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> embodiment the recesses are deliberately formed during manufacturing of the rib foot <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The assembly surface <b>16</b> of the rib foot is scanned or mapped using a known scanning arrangement, for example a laser scanner typically used to reverse engineering applications. The position and size of the recesses <b>18</b> are determined and a shim <b>20</b> is formed. The shim <b>20</b> has a shim assembly surface <b>22</b> on which are formed a series of projections <b>24</b>. The projections <b>24</b> are shaped, sized and positioned on the shim so as to correspond with the recesses <b>18</b> on the rib foot <b>10</b>. Consequently, the projection <b>24</b> which corresponds with the recess <b>18</b> having a diameter D<b>1</b> has a diameter D<b>1</b><sup>1</sup>, D<b>1</b><sup>1 </sup>being a clearance fit for the diameter D<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Thus, by scanning the surface of the rib foot <b>10</b> against which the shim <b>20</b> is intended to be located and forming the shim with formations that are complementary to the formations on the rib foot, when the shim is located against the rib foot a positive mechanical engagement occurs between the shim and the rib foot so as to provide the shim to rib foot interface with improved shear characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Alternatively or in addition to the projections <b>24</b>, the shim <b>20</b> may be provided with a peripheral lipped part <b>26</b> which is arranged to have a tight clearance fit around the edge of the assembly surface <b>16</b> of the rib foot <b>10</b>. Again, the peripheral lipped part <b>26</b> of the shim <b>20</b> is formed as a result of mapping of the assembly surface <b>16</b> of the rib foot <b>10</b> and forming the lipped part <b>26</b> so as to complement that mapped surface.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the method according to the invention is illustrated. Firstly, the rib foot <b>10</b> and more particularly the assembly surface <b>16</b> of the rib foot <b>10</b> is scanned using appropriate scanning equipment. Alternatively, or additionally, a surface of another structural component <b>28</b> against which the rib foot <b>10</b> is to be secured is also scanned. Generally, in aircraft wing design, the rib feet are secured to the inner surface of the aircraft wing skin. Whilst the outer surface of the aircraft wing skin is tightly dimensionally controlled, the inner wing skin is not so controlled and substantial variations in surface profile can exist.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The scanned surface profile data of the rib foot <b>10</b> and, optionally, the assembly surface of the other structural component <b>28</b> are processed in a CPU to enable a shim <b>20</b> to be manufactured with the features complementary to one or both surfaces. The shim <b>20</b> can then be interposed between the rib foot <b>10</b> and the further component <b>28</b>. As stated above, in aircraft manufacture, the other component <b>28</b> is an aircraft wing skin.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a further rib foot <b>10</b> is shown and parts corresponding to parts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> carry the same reference numerals. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the assembly surface <b>16</b> of the rib foot <b>10</b> has not been finished by machine and does not include the deliberately formed recesses <b>18</b>. Instead, the surface profile of the assembly <b>16</b> is the profile obtained when machined initially from billets.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the present invention, the surface profile <b>16</b> is scanned by appropriate scanning equipment as mentioned above and the surface profile data generated by the scanner is passed to a CPU which facilitates the manufacture of a shim, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. A shim <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is substantially similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> and parts corresponding to parts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> carry the same reference numerals. The shim <b>20</b> has a shim assembly surface <b>22</b> which is provided with formations <b>30</b> intended to complement the formations on the surface profile of the assembly surface <b>16</b> of the rib foot <b>10</b>. Consequently, this arrangement differs from the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> arrangement in that the natural imperfections in the surface of the rib foot are used to create the shim and thus to create a positive engagement between the assembly surface <b>16</b> of the rib foot <b>10</b> and the shim assembly surface <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a rib foot <b>10</b> similar to that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is shown. Parts corresponding to parts in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> carry the same reference numbers. It will be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the recesses <b>18</b> are in two spaced pairs. The first pair <b>18</b><i>a</i>, <b>18</b><i>b </i>have their centreline spaced apart by a distance L<b>1</b> whereas the recesses <b>18</b><i>c</i>, <b>18</b><i>d </i>have a centreline spaced apart by a smaller distance L<b>2</b>. By providing an asymmetrical arrangement of recesses <b>18</b><i>a, b, c, d</i>, the corresponding shim which is made according to the mapped assembly surface <b>16</b> of the rib foot <b>10</b> is provided with a specific orientation relative to the rib foot <b>10</b>. The orientation is guaranteed by the asymmetric arrangement of recesses and corresponding projections. Other mechanisms for providing an orientation might include predetermined shapes of recess and projection and/or predetermined varying sizes, as well as the spacing arrangement envisaged above. Other mechanisms for ensuring orientation of the shim relative to the rib foot <b>10</b> are within the ambit of the skilled person.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The shim is manufactured using material sintering technology to produce the shim in a structural material such as aluminium, titanium or another suitable structural material, whether metallic or non-metallic. The process is advantageous because the shim is tailor-made for the joint which it is arranged to fill and is designed to complement the surface against which it will lie during service life. Because the surface of the rib foot has been scanned using an appropriate scanning technology and the profile has been used to form a 3-dimensional image of the rib foot, the present technique can be coupled with rapid prototyping to test the fit of the shim prior to manufacturing the final product if such a step is deemed necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">By creating complementary features on the interface surfaces of the shim and the structural component, the shear capability of the joint is improved even in the event of a joint relaxation during service.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although the invention has been described above with reference to one or more of the preferred embodiments, it will be appreciated that various changes or modifications may be made without departing from the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.</p>
