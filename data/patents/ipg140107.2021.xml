<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A stormwater gully comprises a chamber in which an outlet assembly is installed. The outlet assembly comprises filter units connected to an outlet housing. In use, stormwater can flow from the chamber in an upwards direction through filter units into the outlet housing. The outlet housing has an outlet, which extends from the gully. At high rates of flow, the water level in the chamber will rise until water can flow into the outlet housing through bypass inlets. The bypass inlets are connected to the interior of the housing by siphons defined by arched regions of a top cover. The siphons allow rapid discharge of water until the water level returns below the level of the bypass inlets. A slow drain down feature is provided which enables the chamber and outlet assembly to be drained below the level of the primary inlet.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This U.S. patent application is a divisional application of U.S. Ser. No. 12/991,669 filed on Jan. 31, 2011. The disclosure of which is considered part of the disclosure of this application and is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a stormwater gully and to a drain-down outlet for a vessel, which may be a component of a stormwater gully or stormwater retention and treatment systems.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Stormwater gullies are used to collect surface water run off, usually from non-porous ground surfaces such as roadways, pavements and other paved areas. Water from the ground surface flows into the gully through an opening at the surface, usually covered by a grating. The gully may also receive flow from underground drains. The gully has an outlet, which is usually connected to a main sewer or outfall.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The gully outlet is usually above the bottom of the gully, so that the lower region of the gully serves as a sump in which solid contaminants of the flow are retained for periodic extraction, so that the water passing to the main sewer is free of at least some of the original contaminants. Also, in periods of heavy flow when the inflow is greater than the maximum capacity of the gully outlet, water will build up in the gully to be discharged later when the incoming flow rate subsides. Such a gully is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,005,060. In that gully, water flowing from the gully chamber to the outlet passes through an up-flow filter and into an outlet housing, from which the gully outlet extends. Because flow through the filter is upwards, solid contaminants are caught on the underside of the filter and so can fall from the filter into the sump at the bottom of the gully when incoming flow rates subside. The filter restricts the rate of flow towards the gully outlet, and consequently, under periods of heavy incoming flow, the water level in the gully will rise above the filter. A bypass is provided which comprises a weir over which water can flow directly into the outlet housing, and thence to the gully outlet without passing through the filter.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A problem with such gullies is that the flow rate over the weir under conditions of high flow may be inadequate to avoid flooding of the overlying surface. Also, when flow into the gully eases so that the level drops below that of the weir, discharge from the gully then takes place only through the filter. Consequently, the level of water in the gully falls only slowly, leaving little safety margin if one period of heavy rainfall is closely followed by another.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the present invention there is provided a stormwater gully comprising a chamber in which an outlet assembly is disposed, the outlet assembly comprising an outlet housing having a primary inlet, provided with a filter unit, for admitting stormwater from the chamber into the outlet housing through the filter unit, and a bypass unit comprising a weir situated at a higher level than the primary inlet for enabling flow of stormwater from the chamber into the outlet housing over the weir, thereby bypassing the filter unit, the outlet housing having an outlet extending from the chamber, the weir being enclosed by a top cover of the outlet housing so as to define a siphon through which liquid may flow from the chamber into the outlet housing.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The provision of a siphon means that, once the water level in the gully chamber has risen to a sufficient extent to prime the siphon, the discharge of water through the bypass inlet will take place rapidly under the siphon effect. Furthermore, the entrance to the bypass inlet can be positioned below the level of the weir so that rapid water discharge will continue even after the water level has dropped below that of the weir.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The top cover may have an arched region which extends over the weir so as to define up-flow and down-flow legs of the siphon, which legs communicate with each other over the weir.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The weir may be one of two weirs of the outlet assembly, which may be situated generally opposite each other on the outlet assembly, each weir having a respective arched region of the top cover to define respective siphons.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The arched regions of the two weirs may be connected to each other at a valley region of the top cover. The valley region may extend downwardly generally to the level of the top edges of the weirs. Beneath the valley region, the down-flow legs of the siphons merge to form a single duct extending to the outlet.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The outlet housing is preferably disposed adjacent a wall of the gully chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The wall may be cylindrical, and the outlet housing may have an arcuate housing wall configured to conform to the inner surface of the cylindrical wall. In addition, the weirs, and the lower edge regions of the arched regions of the top cover, may lie in planes which extend radially with respect to the cylindrical wall. The weirs may be disposed approximately mid-way between the lower edge regions of the respective arched regions.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a stormwater gully comprising a chamber in which is disposed a vessel comprising a primary inlet from the chamber, having a lower edge at a first level, and a secondary inlet from the chamber, having a lower edge at a second level higher than the first level, the vessel also comprising a drain-down outlet comprising a duct in the form of a siphon, the duct having a first portion which extends upwardly within the vessel from a first end of the duct to a crest of the siphon and a second portion which extends downwardly from the crest of the siphon to a second end of the duct disposed within the chamber outside the vessel, the crest of the siphon being disposed at a level below the lower edge of the secondary inlet.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the gully comprises a chamber <b>2</b> defined by a cylindrical wall <b>4</b> and a base <b>6</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> only part of the cylindrical wall <b>4</b> is shown for the sake of clarity. In reality the wall <b>4</b> extends entirely around the base <b>6</b>. Within the chamber <b>2</b> there is an outlet assembly <b>8</b>, which in the illustrated embodiment is supported by the wall <b>4</b> of the chamber <b>2</b>. The outlet assembly shown in this embodiment comprises two filter units <b>12</b> mounted on brackets <b>10</b> and an outlet housing <b>14</b>, which is supported by the filter units <b>12</b>. It will be appreciated from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> that the filter units <b>12</b> and the outlet housing <b>14</b> have arcuate walls <b>16</b>, <b>18</b> respectively which having the same radius as the internal surface of the cylindrical wall <b>4</b>, so that the outlet assembly <b>8</b> fits snugly against the wall <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An outlet <b>20</b> extends from the outlet housing <b>14</b> through an opening in the wall <b>4</b>, for connection to downstream pipe-work such as a main sewer.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, each filter unit <b>12</b> comprises a casing <b>22</b> provided with a lid <b>24</b>. In normal operation the lid <b>24</b> is retained on the casing <b>22</b> by rotatable retainers <b>26</b>. The lid <b>24</b> has a handle <b>28</b>, and depending support structure <b>30</b>. The casing <b>22</b> has a rectangular opening <b>32</b> and the support structure <b>30</b> terminates at a support panel <b>34</b> formed with large apertures <b>36</b>. The panel <b>34</b> is situated just below the bottom edge of the opening <b>32</b>. The base of the casing <b>22</b> is constituted by a panel <b>38</b>, which, although not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is provided with large apertures corresponding to the apertures <b>36</b>. The panels <b>34</b> and <b>38</b> define between them a compartment <b>40</b> which contains filter media. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the filter media comprises two blocks <b>42</b> of a semi-rigid, slightly buoyant, permeable filtration material. A suitable material for this purpose is available under the name MATALA&#xae; from MATALA Water Technology Co Ltd of Taichung, Taiwan.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Each bracket <b>10</b> includes a screen <b>44</b> in the form of a perforated plate. The lateral ends of the bracket <b>10</b> are closed, so that all flow entering the casing <b>22</b> through the apertures in the panel <b>38</b> must pass through the screen <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Each filter unit <b>12</b> is connected to the outlet housing <b>14</b> at the respective openings <b>32</b>, which are aligned with corresponding openings <b>46</b> in the outlet housing <b>14</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Consequently, the interior of each casing <b>22</b> communicates with the interior of the outlet housing <b>14</b> through the aligned openings <b>32</b> and <b>46</b>, which constitute primary inlets of the outlet housing <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The outlet housing <b>14</b> is generally in the form of a vertically extending duct having bypass inlets <b>48</b> in its upper region, primary inlets constituted by the aligned openings <b>32</b>, <b>46</b> in its central region, and the outlet <b>20</b> at its lower region. The outlet housing <b>14</b> also has a series of drain-down outlet openings <b>50</b>, described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 4</figref>, each bypass inlet <b>48</b> comprises a weir <b>52</b> which extends along the top edge of a wall <b>54</b> of the outlet housing <b>14</b> which extends generally radially of the rear wall <b>18</b> and consequently of the cylindrical wall <b>4</b> of the gully. At the top of the outlet housing <b>14</b> there is a top cover <b>56</b> which is configured to have two arched regions <b>58</b> each of which extends over the weir <b>52</b> so as to create a siphon having an up-flow leg <b>60</b> and a down-flow leg <b>62</b> which communicate with each other over the weir <b>52</b>. It will be appreciated that each of the up-flow legs <b>60</b> and down-flow legs <b>62</b> widens as viewed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, in the radially outwards direction. The arched regions <b>58</b> are connected to each other at a valley <b>64</b>. Below the valley <b>64</b>, the down-flow legs <b>62</b> merge together to occupy the full cross-section of the housing <b>14</b></p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the drain-down outlets <b>50</b> are situated in the lower region of the outlet housing <b>14</b>, and may be provided with any suitable drain-down device. Any outlet <b>50</b> that is not used can be closed. The presence of more than one drain-down outlet <b>50</b> enables the drain-down rate to be controlled by utilising an appropriate number of them.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an alternative form of drain-down outlet. A duct <b>66</b> extends through an opening in the wall of the outlet housing <b>14</b>, with sealing achieved by a sealing ring <b>68</b>. The duct <b>66</b> has a crest formed by a reverse bend <b>67</b> where it passes through the wall of the housing outlet <b>14</b>, so that a first portion <b>70</b>, situated within the outlet housing <b>14</b>, extends upwardly from a position close to the bottom of the outlet housing <b>14</b> shown as a base <b>69</b>, where it terminates at a discharge tube <b>72</b> constituting a first end of the duct <b>66</b>. On the outside of the outlet housing <b>14</b>, but within the chamber <b>2</b>, the duct <b>66</b> extends downwardly from the reverse bend <b>67</b> as a second portion <b>74</b> to terminate at a second end below the base <b>69</b> of the outlet housing <b>14</b>, and consequently below the level of the discharge tube <b>72</b>. At its second end, the second duct portion <b>74</b> terminates at an end cap <b>76</b>, which is releasable from the duct <b>66</b> by means of a screw-threaded collar <b>78</b>. The end cap <b>76</b> is perforated or made from a permeable material so that it does not prevent the flow of liquid through the duct <b>66</b> from the exterior to the interior of the outlet housing <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The discharge tube <b>72</b> is of a smaller diameter than the remainder of the duct <b>66</b>, and consequently serves as a flow restrictor, restricting the rate of flow through the duct <b>66</b>. The discharge tube <b>72</b> has a flow cross-section substantially smaller than that of the duct <b>66</b>. For example, the discharge tube <b>72</b> may have a flow cross-section which is 5% to 20% of that of the duct <b>66</b>. In one embodiment, the discharge tube has a diameter of 12.5 mm and the duct <b>66</b> has a diameter of 38 mm, i.e. a flow cross-section ratio of approximately 10%.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Alternatively, or in addition, the duct <b>66</b> may include a separate restrictor at any point along its length. Also, the duct <b>66</b> is provided with a filter media, for example in a cartridge <b>80</b> disposed in the second portion <b>74</b>, which may be removable from the duct <b>66</b> for replacement of the filter media within it, or for replacement of the entire cartridge <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The exterior second portion <b>74</b> of the duct <b>66</b> is stabilised by means of a clamp <b>82</b>, which may be secured at one of the outlets <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In operation, surface water run off enters the chamber <b>2</b> at the top, for example through a grating provided in a road surface. The chamber <b>2</b> may also receive flow from underground drainage systems entering through the wall <b>4</b>. As water accumulates in the chamber <b>2</b> it will flow upwards through the perforated screen <b>44</b> and the filter media blocks <b>42</b> to pass through the aligned openings <b>32</b>, <b>46</b> into the outlet housing <b>14</b> and thence through the outlet <b>20</b>. It will be appreciated that the screen <b>44</b> and the filter blocks <b>42</b> serve to trap solid materials, so that the water flowing though the outlet <b>20</b> is relatively clean. As water flows upwardly through the compartment <b>40</b> the slightly buoyant blocks <b>42</b> rise from the base panel <b>38</b> into contact with the upper panel <b>34</b>. If inflow of water to the chamber <b>2</b> ceases before the water level reaches the lower edge of the opening <b>32</b>, the level will simply fall again through the compartment <b>40</b> allowing the blocks <b>42</b> to settle again on the base panel <b>38</b>. The reverse flow of water through the blocks <b>42</b> and the perforated screen <b>44</b> will dislodge at least some of the collected solid material, allowing it to fall to the bottom of the chamber <b>2</b> where it will settle for eventual periodic collection.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The filter blocks <b>42</b> provide a resistance to the flow of water through the primary inlet <b>32</b>, <b>46</b> of the outlet housing <b>14</b>. Consequently, the flow rate through the filter units <b>12</b> into the outlet housing <b>14</b> is lower than the maximum capacity of the outlet <b>20</b>. Under heavy inflows into the chamber <b>2</b>, the incoming water will not all be able to escape though the filter units <b>12</b> and the level within the chamber <b>2</b> will continue to rise above the filter units <b>12</b>. Eventually, the water level will top the weirs <b>52</b>, and so some additional flow will take place through the bypass inlets <b>48</b> to cascade over the weirs <b>52</b> and pass into the outlet housing <b>14</b> and then to the outlet <b>20</b> without first passing through the filter units <b>12</b>. If the level rises even further, it will fully submerge the outlet housing <b>14</b>, including the top cover <b>56</b> so priming the siphons formed by the weirs <b>52</b> and the arched regions <b>58</b> of the top cover <b>56</b>. The siphon effect will cause accelerated flow of the water through the bypass inlets <b>48</b>, so increasing the discharge from the chamber <b>2</b> to a rate which will be sufficient to prevent overflowing of the chamber <b>2</b> except in the most extreme conditions. Even after the water has fallen below the level of the weirs <b>52</b> the bypass inlet <b>48</b> will remain submerged so the siphon effect will continue to reduce the level in the chamber <b>2</b> at a rapid rate. Once the water level falls below the inlet to the upwards leg <b>60</b> of the siphon, the siphon will be broken and flow from the chamber <b>2</b> to the outlet housing <b>14</b> will continue through the primary inlets <b>32</b>, <b>46</b>. As before, cessation of flow will result in the water level dropping through the filter blocks <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In addition, when the water in the chamber <b>2</b> reaches a level above the crest <b>67</b> of the siphon constituted by the duct <b>66</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), the siphon will prime so that, as the water level in the chamber <b>2</b> outside the siphon subsequently falls below the level of the siphon crest <b>67</b>, the siphon effect of the duct <b>66</b> will continue to carry flow from the interior of the chamber <b>2</b> to the interior of the outlet housing <b>14</b>. The perforated or permeable cap <b>76</b> serves to screen any flow passing through the duct <b>66</b> from the chamber <b>2</b> to the interior of the outlet housing <b>14</b>, and the filter in the cartridge <b>80</b> further serves to restrict the passage of solid material into the outlet housing <b>14</b>. The reduced diameter discharge tube <b>72</b> results in the flow through the duct <b>66</b> occurring relatively slowly. The resulting effect is that under low flow conditions, flow from the chamber <b>2</b> can reach the interior of the outlet housing <b>14</b> through the duct <b>66</b>, bypassing the filter units <b>12</b>. Flow through the duct <b>66</b> will continue even after the level in the chamber <b>2</b> has dropped below that of the lower edge of the primary inlet <b>32</b>, <b>46</b>. It will be appreciated that the level of the crest <b>67</b> of the siphon (duct <b>66</b>) need not be above the primary inlet <b>32</b>, <b>46</b>, but could be below that inlet.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an alternative embodiment, the drain-down outlet constituted by the duct <b>66</b> may be constructed so as to not provide any siphon effect, but instead to be connected directly to one of the outlets <b>50</b>. Thus, the duct <b>66</b> may have a 90&#xb0; bend so that it extends outwardly from the outlet <b>50</b> for a short distance, before turning at the bend into the downwardly extending portion <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The stormwater retention and treatment system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> comprises an inlet chamber <b>90</b>, having an inlet pipe <b>92</b>, and an outlet chamber <b>94</b>, having an outlet pipe <b>96</b>. The inlet and outlet chambers <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> are stacked one above the other, and an array of modules <b>98</b> (in this case, ten) is arranged on opposite sides of the stacked chambers <b>90</b>, <b>94</b>. Each module is similar in construction to the gully shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 4</figref>, and so accommodates an outlet assembly <b>8</b> comprising an outlet housing <b>14</b> and an arrangement of filter units <b>12</b>, which are represented in phantom in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Although only two filter units <b>12</b> are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, other numbers of filter units may be used, as will be discussed in more detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each module <b>98</b> has an inlet connected by a duct <b>100</b> to the inlet chamber <b>90</b>. The inlet opens into the module <b>98</b> at a level above the filter units <b>12</b>. An outlet, corresponding to the outlet <b>20</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is connected to the outlet chamber by a duct <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In operation, stormwater is conveyed by suitable pipework to the inlet pipe <b>92</b>, and so enters the inlet chamber <b>90</b>. From there, the water flows to the modules <b>98</b>, and passes through the filter units <b>12</b> to the outlet housing <b>14</b> and then to the outlet chamber <b>94</b> to be discharged through the outlet pipe <b>96</b>. It will be appreciated that the system thus provides a stormwater retention function, since stormwater can accumulate in the chambers <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> and in the modules <b>98</b>, so reducing the load on downstream equipment. When flow levels subside, water can drain from the modules <b>98</b> through the outlet housing <b>14</b>, to make capacity available for the next period of heavy flow.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a similar system, although in this case the inlet and outlet chambers <b>90</b>, <b>94</b> are disposed side-by side in a common housing <b>104</b>, separated by a partition <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, different numbers of filter units <b>12</b> may be provided in a single gully or module <b>98</b>. It will be appreciated that each casing <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) has one of the openings <b>32</b> on each of two generally opposite walls, which walls extend radially of the chamber <b>2</b>. Consequently, the filter units may be mounted side-by-side with their openings <b>32</b> in communication with each other. The openings <b>32</b> in the outermost walls (i.e. the walls that do not contact another filter unit <b>12</b>) are closed by means of closure panels <b>108</b>. Thus, in use, water can flow from one filter unit <b>12</b> to the next, until it reaches the outlet housing <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The number of filter units in each gully or module will depend on the filtering capacity required; in some circumstances, the filter units may occupy the entire arcuate extent of the gully or module between the opposite sides of the outlet housing <b>14</b>. For example, six filter units <b>12</b> may be accommodated in a single gully or module <b>98</b>.</p>
