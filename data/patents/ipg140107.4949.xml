<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to an image heating apparatus suitable for use as a fixing apparatus to be mounted on an image forming apparatus such as an electrophotographic copier and an electrophotographic printer, and relates to a pressure roller to be used in the image heating apparatus and a manufacturing method for the pressure roller.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">A fixing apparatus of a heat roller system to be mounted on one of a printer and a copier of an electrophotographic system includes a halogen heater, a fixing roller heated by the halogen heater, and a pressure roller brought into contact with the fixing roller to form a nip portion. In addition, a fixing apparatus of a film heating system includes a heater including a heat generating resistor on a substrate made of ceramics, a fixing film moving while being held in contact with the heater, and a pressure roller forming a nip portion with the heater through the fixing film. In each of the fixing apparatus of the heat roller system and the fixing apparatus of the film heating system, while a recording material bearing an unfixed toner image is pinched and conveyed at the nip portion, the toner image is heated and fixed onto the recording material.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Regarding the above-mentioned fixing apparatuses, it is known that, when printing is performed on a small sized recording material continuously at the same print interval as the interval in a case of a large sized recording material, temperature rises extremely in a non-sheet feeding area (hereinafter, referred to as temperature rise at a non-sheet feeding portion).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The temperature rise at the non-sheet feeding portion is more likely to occur as process speed of the printer gets faster. The reason is that an intensive increase in speed is accompanied by shortening in time for the recording material to pass the nip portion and, therefore, fixing temperature required for heating and fixing a toner image onto the recording material is made frequently higher. When the temperature rise at the non-sheet feeding portion occurs in this way, respective parts configuring the fixing apparatus may be damaged. In addition, when printing is performed on a large sized recording material in a state of the temperature rise at the non-sheet feeding portion, toner is melted more than necessary in an area corresponding to the non-sheet feeding area in the recording material. Therefore, high-temperature offset takes place.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For the purpose of preventing the above-mentioned problem, as a unit of reducing the temperature rise at the non-sheet feeding portion, a method of increasing a thermal conductivity in an axial direction of a pressure roller is known. An advantage is that positive improvement in heat transfer in a rubber layer formed in the pressure roller leads to promote heat transmission in the axial direction so as to moderate extreme temperature rise at the non-sheet feeding portion.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-273771 discloses a pressure roller provided with a rubber layer containing dispersed pitch-based carbon fiber. In such pressure roller, the thermal conductivity in the axial direction of the rubber layer is high, and hence the temperature rise at the non-sheet feeding portion is effectively moderated.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The pressure roller disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open No. 2005-273771 is excellent in the thermal conductivity in a roller axis direction. However, simultaneously, the pressure roller is turned out to give rise to a problem that the thermal conductivity in a thickness direction of the rubber layer is increased and heat is easily transferred from the rubber layer to the metal core so that a surface temperature of the pressure roller is likely to decrease. In a case where the surface temperature of the pressure roller is extremely low, moisture generated when the recording material passes a nip portion is likely to form dew on the surface of pressure roller to unstabilize conveyance of the recording material.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, even in a method of dispersing an needle-shaped filler having high thermal conductivity in a rubber layer, the rubber layer is required to have a certain amount of thickness in order to ensure satisfactory heat transfer in the roller axis direction while preventing hardness of the rubber layer from being extremely high. As a method of manufacturing a pressure roller which has a thickness enough to contain the needle-shaped filler and includes a resin tube layer excellent in die-releasing property as a surface layer, there is known a method of placing a metal core at the center of a molding die having a cylindrical inner surface, placing the resin tube on the inner surface of the molding die, and injecting liquid-state rubber between the metal core and the resin tube.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">However, a step of applying primer on an inner surface of the resin tube is necessary. As a result, the number of steps of manufacturing the pressure roller is increased.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0058">The present invention is described with reference to the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0059">(1) Example of Image Forming Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic configuration diagram of a model of an example of an image forming apparatus mounting an image heating apparatus according to the present invention as a heat fixing apparatus. The image forming apparatus is a laser beam printer of an electrophotographic system.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0061">A printer illustrated in this example includes an electrophotographic photosensitive member of a rotation drum type (hereinafter, referred to as photosensitive drum) <b>1</b> as an image bearing member. The photosensitive drum <b>1</b> is configured by forming a photosensitive material layer such as OPC, amorphous Se, and amorphous Si on an outer peripheral surface of a cylindrical (drum-like) conductive base member made of material selected from the group consisting of aluminum and nickel.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0062">The photosensitive drum <b>1</b> is driven to rotate at a predetermined circumferential velocity (process speed) in a clockwise direction of an arrow a and the outer peripheral surface (surface) of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> undergoes a charging process uniformly during the procedure of the rotation to attain predetermined polarity and potential with a charging roller <b>2</b> as a charge means. The uniform charging surface on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> undergoes scan exposure with a laser beam LB modulated and controlled (ON/OFF controlled) corresponding with image information being output from a laser beam scanner <b>3</b> and. Thus, an electrostatic latent image corresponding with the image information being an object is formed on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0063">The latent image is developed and visualized by using toner TO as an unfixed toner image by a developing apparatus <b>4</b> serving as a developing unit. The developing step selected from the group consisting of jumping development method, 2-component development method, and FEED development method is used, and is frequently used in combination with image exposure and inversion development.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0064">Meanwhile, one sheet of recording material P stacked and housed inside a sheet feeding cassette <b>9</b> is discharged each time by driving a feeding roller <b>8</b> and is conveyed to a registration roller <b>11</b> through a sheet path including a guide <b>10</b>. The recording material P is fed to a transferring nip portion between the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> and an outer peripheral surface (surface) of a transferring roller <b>5</b> by the registration roller <b>11</b>. The fed recording material P is pinched and conveyed at the transferring nip portion. A toner image on the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> is sequentially transferred onto the surface of the recording material P by a transferring bias applied to the transferring roller <b>5</b> during the conveyance procedure. As a result, the recording material P bears a toner image which is not yet fixed.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0065">The recording material P bearing a toner image which is not yet fixed (unfixed toner image) is sequentially separated from the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b>, is discharged from the transferring nip portion, and is introduced into a nip portion of a heat fixing apparatus <b>6</b> through a conveyance guide <b>12</b>. The recording material P receives heat and pressure by the nip portion of the fixing apparatus <b>6</b> so that the toner image is heated and fixed onto the surface of the recording material P, thereby adhering thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0066">The recording material P coming out from the fixing apparatus <b>6</b> is printed and discharged to a discharge tray <b>16</b> via a sheet path including a conveyance roller <b>13</b>, a guide <b>14</b>, and a discharging roller <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0067">In addition, the surface of the photosensitive drum <b>1</b> after separation of recording material undergoes processing for removing adhesive contaminator such as residual toner subjected to transferring to form cleaned surface by a cleaning apparatus <b>7</b> as a cleaning unit and is served for repetitious image forming.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0068">A printer of this example is a printer accepting A3 sized sheet at print speed of 50 sheets/minute for the longitudinal side of A4 sized sheet. In addition, toner including a styrene acryl resin as main material with a glass transition point of 55 to 65&#xb0; C. obtained by one of internally adding and externally adding material selected from the group consisting of a charge controlling agent, magnetic material, and silica corresponding to necessity.</p>

<p id="p-0077" num="0104">(5) Needle-Shaped Filler (Elongated Fiber Filler)</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0105">In the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, if an average value of the fiber length portion L is shorter than 50 &#x3bc;m, a thermal conductivity anisotropic effect hardly appears in the self-adhesive silicone rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a</i>. In other words, if thermal conductivity is high in the longitudinal direction and low in the periphery direction of the pressure roller of the self-adhesive silicone rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a</i>, energy saving can be planned also in obtaining the same fixing performance, because the large amount of heat generated at the non-sheet feeding region of the roller axis direction can be transferred from the non-sheet feeding region to the center portion effectively. If the average value of the fiber length portion L is longer than 1 mm, dispersed process molding of the filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>into the highly thermal conductive elastic rubber layer <b>24</b><i>b </i>is difficult. Consequently, the length of the filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>is preferably 0.05 mm or more and 1 mm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0106">As the above-mentioned needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d</i>, pitch-based carbon fiber manufactured by adopting oil pitch and coal pitch as row material is suitable due to the thermal conductive performance of the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0107">The needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>has a thin fiber shape. Thus, when the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>is kneaded with the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> prior to hardening to be injected into a molding die, the axis of the filler is likely to be orientated in the direction of stream in the molding die, in other words, in the longitudinal direction (roller axis direction) of the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a</i>. Consequently, when the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e </i>is hardened and thus the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>is molded, a thermal conductivity in the roller axis direction of the second rubber layer can be intensified.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0108">Next, the configuration of the self-bonded silicone rubber layer (second rubber layer) <b>24</b><i>a </i>is described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0109">A thickness of the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>of 0.5 mm or more and 5.0 mm or less is suitable for molding in terms of performance. In a case where the thickness is smaller than 0.5 mm, when an attempt is made to obtain a satisfactory effect of moderating temperature rise at a non-sheet feeding portion, it is necessary to mix a larger amount of the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>with the liquid-state silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>. However, when the liquid-state silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> contains the extremely large amount of the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d</i>, viscosity of the self-bonded silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e </i>is extremely high, with the result that it is difficult to mold the pressure roller. Alternatively, in a case where the thickness is larger than 5.0 mm, the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>is not likely to be orientated in the longitudinal direction of the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>when the pressure roller is molded (when the liquid-state silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e </i>is injected into the molding die).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0110">Here, the lower limit of content amount in the liquid-state silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e </i>of the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>is 5 vol %. If the lower limit is under 5 vol %, the thermal conductivity is reduced so that it is impossible to obtain the desired effect of moderating temperature rise at the non-sheet feeding portion. The upper limit of content amount in the liquid-state silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e </i>of the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>is 40 vol %. If the upper limit is over 40 vol %, performing of the process molding is difficult. A volumetric percentage of the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>is obtained by the following formula:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>(entire volume of filler contained in the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition)/(volume of the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition+entire volume of filler contained in the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition)&#xd7;100 vol %.<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0111">Further, in order to increase the effect of moderating temperature rise at the non-sheet feeding portion, the thermal conductivity &#x3bb; in the longitudinal direction of the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>is required to be 500 W/m&#xb7;K or more. The thermal conductivity &#x3bb; was measured by laser flash method with use of a Laser Flash Method Thermal Constant Measuring System TC-7000 provided by ULVAC-RIKO, Inc. When the thermal conductivity &#x3bb; is under 500 W/m&#xb7;K, the effect of moderating temperature rise at the non-sheet feeding portion is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0112">If an average length of the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>is smaller than 50 &#x3bc;m, a thermal conductivity anisotropic effect hardly appears in the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a</i>, and the effect of moderating temperature rise at the non-sheet feeding portion is reduced. If the average length of the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>is larger than 1 mm, when being kneaded with the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition, the viscosity of the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition is extremely high, with the result that cast processing is difficult. Note that, the average length of the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>is determined by optical observation.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0113">Further, when the thermal conductivity of the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>in the longitudinal direction (roller axis direction) orthogonal to a recording material conveyance direction is 2.5 W/m&#xb7;K or more, it is possible to obtain the effect of moderating temperature rise at the non-sheet feeding portion. A measurement method for the thermal conductivity of the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>is described in detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0114">Regarding the thermal conductivity of the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>in the recording material conveyance direction (peripheral direction: x direction) and in its crossing direction (longitudinal direction: y direction), measurement can be performed with use of Hot Disk Method Thermophysical Properties Analyzer (TPA-501) provided by KYOTO ELECTRONICS MANUFACTURING CO., LTD. In order to secure the thickness sufficient for measurement, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, only the rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>is cut out to form a test sample to be measured by stacking the appropriate number of sheets as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0115">In this example, the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>is cut out at the dimensions of 15 mm (in x direction)&#xd7;15 mm (in y direction)&#xd7;thickness (set thickness), and is stacked to have a thickness of approximately 15 mm, thereby attaining a test sample to be measured. Upon measurement of the thermal conductivity, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the test sample to be measured is fixed with a kapton tape T having a thickness of 0.07 mm and a width of 10 mm. Next, in order to equalize the level of flatness of the surface to be measured of the test sample, the surface to be measured and the rear surface of the surface to be measured are cut with a razor. Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, two sets of the above-mentioned test sample to be measured are prepared. A sensor S is pinched by the two test samples to be measured to measure the thermal conductivity. In a case where the test sample to be measured is measured while being subjected to a change in the direction (x direction and y direction), the measurement direction may be changed to carry out the method as described above. Note that, in this example, an average value of the five times of measurement was used.</p>

As a result, the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>compounded with the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e </i>is orientated in the roller axis direction (step of injecting the liquid addition type silicone rubber containing the adhesion-imparting agent and the needle-shaped filler between the resin tube and the metal core provided with the solid rubber layer). After injection, depending on kinds of the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e </i>in use, heating and hardening are performed under an optimum heating condition, and then releasing from the die <b>25</b><i>a </i>is performed. After carrying out a step of cutting redundant hardened silicone rubber remaining on the end surface, the pressure roller <b>24</b> is obtained (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0123">As described above, the inner surface of the tube <b>24</b><i>b </i>is subjected to etching in advance, and the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the tube <b>24</b><i>b </i>are bonded together in the process in which the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e </i>is hardened to form the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>(step of hardening the liquid addition type silicone rubber and bonding the resin tube and the silicone rubber together by an action of the adhesion-imparting agent). The present invention has such a feature that the tube <b>24</b><i>b </i>and the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>are directly bonded together without using a method of applying primer between the tube <b>24</b><i>b </i>and the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>upon the above-mentioned bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0124">The molding method for the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>is not limited to the above-mentioned method, as long as the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>is formed by injecting the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition into a cylindrical molding die as in a case of the cast molding method.

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0103" num="0145">The molding method for the pressure roller <b>24</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A</figref>, <b>11</b>B, and <b>12</b>. First, on the outer periphery of the metal core <b>24</b><i>c </i>made of Al (aluminum) with a diameter of 422 (mm), a rubber layer forming product <b>24</b><i>f </i>as the first rubber layer with a thickness of 3.0 mm and a diameter of &#x3a6;28 (mm) is formed by a die molding method with used of addition type silicone rubber with density of 1.20 g/cm<sup>3 </sup>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0146">Next, the molding method for the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>is described. Liquid A and Liquid B of Product name: SE1819CV A&#x26;B (manufactured by Dow Corning Toray Co., Ltd.) serving as the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition are mixed together at a proportion of 1:1, and thus the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> is obtained. The SE1819CV A&#x26;B is the above-mentioned liquid addition type silicone rubber composition (silicone rubber adhesive) <b>24</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> of Type P.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0147">Here, in a case of using the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e</i><b>1</b> of Type P, when the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>is heated and hardened, the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the tube <b>24</b><i>b</i>, and the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the first rubber layer <b>24</b><i>f </i>are bonded together without primer. Product name: SE1816CV (manufactured by Dow Corning Toray Co., Ltd.) and Product name: TSE322SX (manufactured by Momentive Performance Materials Japan) also allow such bonding without primer. Note that, the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition (silicone rubber adhesive) of Type P is developed mainly for use as an adhesive, and the silicone rubber adhesive has variety in terms of viscosity. However, in this example, the silicone rubber adhesive functions not only as an adhesive but also as the rubber layer of the pressure roller. In particular, in order to increase the thermal conductivity in the axial direction of the pressure roller, the needle-shaped filler is required to be dispersed with 5 vol % or more and 40 vol % or less, and hence the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>according to this example is required to have a thickness of 0.5 mm or more and 5.0 mm or less. When forming the rubber layer required to have such thickness, it is necessary to form the rubber layer by injecting liquid-state rubber into a molding die. Therefore, the silicone rubber adhesive for forming the second rubber layer of the pressure roller according to this example is required to have appropriate viscosity. The viscosity of the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition for forming the second rubber layer is suitably 2 Pa&#xb7;s (Pa&#xb7;sec) or more and 100 Pa&#xb7;s or less (measurement method for the viscosity is compliant with JISK6249 (test method for unhardened and hardened silicone rubber)). The viscosity thereof is more suitably 2 Pa&#xb7;s or more and 60 Pa&#xb7;s or less. If the viscosity is under 2 Pa&#xb7;s, the needle-shaped filler and the liquid addition type silicone rubber are separated from each other, which is not suitable. Further, if the viscosity is over 100 Pa&#xb7;s, the viscosity is extremely high. As a result, it is difficult to inject the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition into the die, and orientating property of the needle-shaped filler is deteriorated.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0148">In Example 1, for the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e</i><b>1</b>, pitch-based carbon fiber 100-15M was uniformly composed and mixed at 25 vol % as the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>so as to obtain the self-bonded silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e </i>to be injected into the die.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0149">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a PFA tube (with a thickness of 50 &#x3bc;m) <b>24</b><i>b </i>having a surface subjected to etching is placed in the inside of a die with an inner diameter of &#x3a6;30 (mm), the surface of the PFA tube being opposed to the first rubber layer. In addition, the first rubber layer forming product <b>24</b><i>f </i>with the diameter of &#x3a6;28 (mm) is placed in the inside of the PFA tube to be coaxial with the center of the die. Then, the self-bonded silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e </i>is injected between the PFA tube <b>24</b><i>b </i>and the first rubber layer forming product <b>24</b><i>f </i>in the direction of the arrow A. After performing heating and hardening at 200&#xb0; C. for 30 minutes, a pressure roller I with an outer diameter of &#x3a6;30 (mm) and an axial length of 320 mm was obtained (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>). When performing such heating and hardening, the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the tube <b>24</b><i>b</i>, and the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the first rubber layer <b>24</b><i>f </i>are bonded together. Further, the thickness of the rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>is 1.0 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0150">Further, in a case where it is difficult to bond the rubber layers together without primer unlike the combination of the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the first rubber layer <b>24</b><i>f </i>in Example 1, bonding with use of primer may be adopted. In this case, as the primer, for example, Product name: DY39-051A&#x26;B manufactured by Dow Corning Toray Co., Ltd. may be used.</p>

<p id="p-0119" num="0161">Further, when an attempt was made to mold the pressure roller provided with the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>having the thickness smaller than 0.5 mm, molding was difficult.

In this case, the silicone rubber has no self-bonded property, and hence bonding between the metal core and the rubber layer, and bonding between the rubber layer and the tube are performed with use of primer.</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0173">In the fixing apparatus provided with the pressure roller according to Comparative Example 1, the thermal conductivity of the rubber layer was 0.4 W/m&#xb7;K, and the temperature at the non-sheet feeding portion was 310&#xb0; C. In the following, the assessment on the temperature rise at the non-sheet feeding portion was compared based on the results.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0174">In the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the tube <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the pressure roller I according to Example 1, no peeling was seen in an interface therebetween, and bonding performance remained good. Further, in the fixing apparatus provided with such pressure roller, the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>contains carbon fiber. Therefore, the thermal conductivity of the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>in the axial direction was 19.8 W/m&#xb7;K, and the temperature in the non-sheet feeding area was 265&#xb0; C., and hence a temperature rise suppression effect is seen in the non-sheet feeding area when compared to Comparative Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0175">In the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the tube <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the pressure roller II according to Example 2, no peeling was seen in an interface therebetween, and bonding performance remained good. Further, in the fixing apparatus provided with such pressure roller, the thickness of the second rubber layer is set to 0.5 mm. However, the thermal conductivity was 10.3 W/m&#xb7;K, and the temperature in the non-sheet feeding area was 270&#xb0; C. The temperature rise suppression effect is seen in the non-sheet feeding area when compared to Comparative Example 1, though not to the extent of Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0176">In the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the tube <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the pressure roller III according to Example 3, no peeling was seen in an interface therebetween, and bonding performance remained good. Further, in the fixing apparatus provided with such pressure roller, the content amount of carbon fiber in the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>is small, the fiber length of the carbon fiber is small, and the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>has thin thickness. Therefore, though the effect is inferior to that of Example 1, the thermal conductivity of the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>in the axial direction was 2.5 W/m&#xb7;K, and the temperature in the non-sheet feeding area was 289&#xb0; C., and hence the temperature rise suppression effect is seen in the non-sheet feeding area when compared to Comparative Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0177">In the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the tube <b>24</b><i>b </i>of the pressure roller IV according to Example 4, no peeling was seen in an interface therebetween, and bonding performance remained good. Further, in the fixing apparatus provided with such pressure roller, the content amount of carbon fiber in the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>is large, and the fiber length of the carbon fiber is large. The content amount and the fiber length in this example are upper limits allowing the needle-shaped filler <b>24</b><i>d </i>to be contained in the liquid addition type silicone rubber composition <b>24</b><i>e</i>. In this case, the thermal conductivity of the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>in the axial direction was 90.5 W/m&#xb7;K, and the temperature in the non-sheet feeding area was 245&#xb0; C. The temperature rise suppression effect is seen in the non-sheet feeding area more significantly than in Example 1.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0178">As described above, the rubber layer provided on the metal core includes the solid rubber layer and the self-bonded silicone rubber layer. The solid rubber layer has the thermal conductivity in the thickness direction of 0.16 W/m&#xb7;K or more and 0.40 W/m&#xb7;K or less. The self-bonded silicone rubber layer contains the needle-shaped filler at 5 vol % or more and 40 vol % or less, has the thermal conductivity in the roller axis direction of 2.5 W/m&#xb7;K or more and the thickness of 0.5 mm or more and 5.0 mm or less, and is provided between the solid rubber layer and the resin tube layer, the needle-shaped filler having the average length of 0.05 mm or more and 1 mm or less and the thermal conductivity of 500 W/m&#xb7;K or more in the length(axial) direction of the needle-shaped filler. With this configuration, it is possible to provide a pressure roller, a manufacturing method for the pressure roller, and an image heating apparatus using the pressure roller, the pressure roller being configured to allow to moderate the temperature rise at the non-sheet feeding portion, and to bond the second rubber layer <b>24</b><i>a </i>and the tube <b>24</b><i>b </i>together without primer to thereby simplify manufacturing steps.</p>
