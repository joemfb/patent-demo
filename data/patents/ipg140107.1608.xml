<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to a sieve adjust mechanism and more particularly to a rack and pinion sieve adjustment mechanism applicable to agricultural combines.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In an agricultural harvester combine, the grain is harvested, threshed and cleaned. In conventional agricultural combines, the stocks of grain flow on a conveyer from the harvester to a threshing drum where the grain is loosened from the stock. The grain is then cleaned by passing it through a cleaning assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In most combines, the cleaning assembly contains three main components: a blower, an upper sieve and a lower sieve. The blower has its own housing, whereas the upper sieve and lower sieve are mounted on a cleaning shoe. The sieve consists of a large number of louvers or slats which, based on the crop conditions, need to be opened or closed to control the separating characteristics. Grain is cleaned and separated by passing the grain through the sieves of the cleaning assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a conventional sieve adjustment mechanism <b>100</b> used in the industry consisting of pivoting handles or lever arms <b>102</b> which push or pull the louvers or slats through arm <b>104</b> to adjust the size of the sieve opening. However, a problem associated with conventional sieve adjustment mechanisms is that there is generally a significant amount of lost motion or play in the pivot joints of handle <b>102</b> and arm <b>104</b>. The lost motion of conventional sieve adjustments arises from the mechanisms used to adjust the positioning of sieve slats or louvers. Such conventional sieve adjustment mechanisms rely on linkages rotating about fixed pivot points, e.g., <b>106</b>, as a result there is not a true translation in a single direction of motion so the slats or louvers open or close at different rates during a range of motion of the handles <b>102</b>. As a result, when a sieve is remotely adjusted using e.g., in-cab electronics, this lost motion/play cannot be easily accounted for and results in less than optimal slat openings or slat openings differing from that set or anticipated by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, there is a need for a system and apparatus for a sieve adjustment mechanism that addresses the aforementioned deficiencies of conventional sieve adjustment mechanisms. Such needs are met by the sieve adjustment mechanism of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In accordance with a first aspect, the present invention provides a sieve adjustment mechanism that includes a rack gear, a pivot handle and an actuator. The rack gear is movable between a first and a second position and connectable to a sieve segment of a sieve for moving the sieve segment between a first sieve position and a second sieve position. The pivot handle includes a pinion gear at a first end of the pivot handle for operatively engaging the rack gear for moving the rack gear between the first and second positions and a second end opposite the first end. The pinion gear is rotatable about a first axis. The actuator is connected to the second end of the pivot handle for pivoting the pivot handle about the first axis to move the rack gear between the first and second positions.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In accordance with a second aspect, the present invention provides a cleaning system for an agricultural combine that includes a sieve and a sieve adjustment mechanism. The sieve includes a first sieve segment disposed adjacent a second sieve segment in an end to end relation. The sieve adjustment mechanism is operatively connected to at least one of the first and second sieve segments for moving at least one of the first and second sieve segments relative to the other to adjust the size of a sieve opening of the sieve. The sieve adjustment mechanism includes a rack and pinion gear mechanism for linearly moving at least one of the first and second sieve segments relative to the other. The rack and pinion gear mechanism includes a pinion gear integrally formed with an elongated handle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with a third aspect, the present invention provides a sieve assembly that includes a sieve, an arm and a sieve adjustment mechanism. The sieve includes a first sieve segment disposed adjacent a second sieve segment. The arm extends between and is operatively connected to the first and second sieve segments. The arm includes a rack gear integrally formed at an end of the arm. The sieve adjustment mechanism is operatively connected to the arm for moving at least one of the first and second sieve segments relative to the other to adjust the size of a sieve opening of the sieve. The sieve adjustment mechanism includes a pinion gear operatively engaged with the rack gear for moving the arm in a linear direction.</p>

<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-9</figref>, in accordance with a preferred embodiment, the present invention provides a sieve adjustment mechanism <b>10</b> for a sieve <b>108</b>, such as a sieve for an agricultural combine cleaning system (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). The sieve adjustment mechanism <b>10</b> includes a rack gear <b>12</b>, a pivot handle <b>14</b> and an actuator <b>160</b>. Collectively, the rack gear <b>12</b> and pivot handle <b>14</b> is also referred to as a rack and pinion gear mechanism. The sieve <b>108</b> can e.g., be a sieve as used in an agricultural combine that includes a first sieve segment <b>110</b> disposed adjacent to a second sieve segment <b>112</b> in an end to end relation along a first axis A. As used herein, the term &#x201c;sieve segment&#x201d; refers to a slat or louver, or a plurality of slats or louvers connected together. Each slat is composed of a plurality of parallel, longitudinally spaced upward and downwardly inclined fingers. The fingers of adjacent ones of the slats defining sieve openings therebetween for the passage of crop material of a desired maximum size therethrough, i.e., clean grain. Slats are simultaneously pivotable about respective pivotal axes through a range of pivotable positions for varying the opening size of the sieve in the well known conventional manner. Alternatively, the slats can be moved in a linear direction to vary the opening size of the sieve. Further details regarding the structure and operation of conventional slats and louvers of sieves applicable to the present invention are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,371,162, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The rack gear <b>12</b> is movable between a first position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) and a second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the rack gear <b>12</b> is directly connected to one of the first or second sieve segments <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> for moving one of the first and second sieve segments <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> relative to the other to adjust the size of a sieve opening of the sieve <b>108</b>. The rack gear <b>12</b> is directly connected to one of the first or second sieve segments <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> via arm <b>104</b>. The arm <b>104</b> extends along a length of the sieve <b>108</b> in a direction substantially parallel to axis A and connects to each sieve segment of the sieve <b>108</b> for pivotably (or translationally) moving the sieve segments.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">For purposes of convenience only, the present embodiment will hereinafter be described with the rack gear <b>12</b> being connected to the first sieve segment or slat <b>110</b> of the sieve <b>108</b>. In particular, the rack gear <b>12</b> is rigidly connected to the first sieve segment <b>110</b> or arm <b>104</b> without any pivot joints. As such, the rack gear <b>12</b> provides direct translational motion to the first sieve segment <b>110</b> without any lost motion due to variances inherent in pivot joints or linkage systems.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the first position, the first sieve segment <b>110</b> is at a first position that e.g., represents a smallest size opening for the sieve <b>108</b>. In the second position, the first sieve segment <b>110</b> is at a second position that e.g., represents a largest size opening for the sieve <b>108</b>. However, the rack gear <b>12</b> is configured to be movable and positionable throughout a range of motion corresponding to a range or plurality of positions and consequently a plurality of sieve size openings.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The rack gear <b>12</b> is configured as a linear gear bar, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and includes teeth <b>16</b>. The teeth <b>16</b> are configured to operatively engage the pivot handle <b>14</b>. The rack gear <b>12</b> has a first end <b>12</b><i>a </i>and a second end <b>12</b><i>b </i>that is opposite the first end <b>12</b><i>a</i>. About the second end <b>12</b><i>b </i>is a through hole <b>18</b> used for connecting the rack gear <b>12</b> to the first sieve segment <b>112</b> or arm <b>104</b>. The through hole <b>18</b> preferably extends in a direction perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the rack gear <b>12</b>. The overall longitudinal length of the rack gear <b>12</b> is sized sufficiently to translate the first sieve segment <b>110</b> through a range of motion relative to a second sieve segment <b>112</b> in order to provide the necessary or desired size opening for the sieve <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The pivot handle <b>14</b> is configured, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The pivot handle <b>14</b> is an elongated handle that includes a pinion gear <b>20</b> attached to a first end <b>14</b><i>a </i>of the pivot handle <b>14</b>. Preferably, the pinion gear <b>20</b> is integrally formed with the pivot handle <b>14</b>. The pinion gear <b>20</b> is also preferably configured as a partial pinion gear. That is, the pinion gear <b>20</b> includes teeth <b>22</b> covering about &#x2153; to about &#x2154; of a circumference of the pinion gear <b>20</b>. More preferably, the teeth <b>22</b> cover about &#xbd; of a circumference of the pinion gear <b>20</b>. The teeth <b>22</b> are configured to correspondingly engage teeth <b>16</b> on the rack gear <b>12</b>. A central through hole <b>26</b> extends through the pinion gear <b>20</b> in a direction coaxial with a central longitudinal axis B of the pinion gear <b>20</b>. The central through hole <b>26</b> is sized to receive a pivot axis <b>28</b> that extends therethrough for pivotably mounting the pivot handle <b>24</b> on a support <b>30</b>, as further described below.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In sum, the pinion gear includes a first end for operatively engaging a rack gear for moving the rack gear between first and second positions and a second end opposite the first end. Thus, in operation, the pinion gear <b>20</b> pivots about axis B which is coaxial with the central through hole <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A handle <b>24</b> of the pivot handle <b>14</b> extends from the pinion gear <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In other words, the handle <b>24</b> extends from the pinion gear <b>20</b> in a direction transverse to the central longitudinal axis B of the pinion gear <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">About a second end <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the pivot handle <b>14</b>, which is opposite the first end <b>14</b><i>a</i>, is a &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped bracket <b>32</b>. The bracket <b>32</b> includes a through hole <b>34</b> that extends through both ends of the &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped bracket <b>32</b>. The &#x201c;U&#x201d; shaped bracket <b>32</b> pivotably connects the pivot handle <b>14</b> to the actuator <b>160</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The actuator <b>160</b> can be any actuator known in the art, such as a hydraulic actuator, and electric actuator and the like. The actuator <b>160</b> is operatively connected to and in communication with a controller <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). The controller <b>36</b> can be any computer, logic control system, or the like, including the onboard controls of e.g., an agricultural combine. The actuator <b>160</b> is mounted to the sieve <b>108</b> and connected to the second end <b>14</b><i>b </i>of the pivot handle <b>14</b> to pivot the pivot handle <b>14</b> about the pivot axis <b>28</b>. In other words, the pivot handle <b>14</b> pivots about the axis B.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate the sieve adjustment mechanism <b>10</b> assembled to the support <b>30</b>. The support <b>30</b> is configured, as best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3-5</figref>, and includes a mounting bracket end <b>36</b> for mounting to the sieve <b>108</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. The mounting bracket end <b>36</b> includes an aperture <b>38</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) sized to allow for the passage of the rack gear <b>12</b> therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Opposite the mounting bracket end <b>36</b> is a sieve adjustment mechanism mounting end <b>40</b> which the sieve adjust mechanism <b>10</b> mounts to. The sieve adjustment mechanism mounting end <b>40</b> is configured as a track <b>42</b> that extends in a direction towards the first sieve segment <b>110</b> or arm <b>104</b> when the support <b>30</b> is mounted to the sieve <b>108</b>. Preferably, the track <b>42</b> extends in a direction substantially parallel to longitudinal axis A.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The track <b>42</b> includes opposing side walls <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>and a lateral wall <b>44</b><i>c</i>. The lateral wall <b>44</b><i>c </i>serves as a guiding surface about which a surface of the rack gear <b>12</b>, opposite the surface of the rack gear <b>12</b> that includes teeth <b>16</b>, slidingly engages. The opposing side walls <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>include a through hole <b>46</b> that extends through both side walls <b>44</b><i>a</i>, <b>44</b><i>b </i>and which is configured to receive the pivot axis <b>28</b>. The through hole <b>46</b> is spaced from the lateral wall <b>44</b><i>c </i>a distance such that the pinion gear <b>20</b> operatively engages the rack gear <b>16</b> when assembled on the sieve adjustment mechanism mounting end <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In operation, the sieve adjustment mechanism <b>10</b> is used to adjust the size of the openings of the sieve <b>110</b> about a plurality of size openings by adjusting the position of a first sieve segment <b>110</b> relative to a second sieve segment <b>112</b>. This is accomplished by direct linear translation of the first sieve segment <b>110</b> as a result of the direct connection of the rack gear <b>12</b> to the first sieve segment <b>110</b> and without any intervening linkages or pivot means. In other words, linear translation of the rack gear <b>12</b> moves at least one of the first and second sieve segments <b>110</b>, <b>112</b> relative to the other to adjust the size of a sieve opening of the sieve. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 6</figref>, when the sieve adjustment mechanism <b>10</b> is in the first position, the first sieve segment <b>110</b> is in a first position that reflects a minimized sieve opening size. However, when the pivot handle <b>14</b> of the sieve adjustment mechanism <b>10</b> is pivoted to the second position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) by the actuator <b>160</b>, the first sieve segment <b>110</b> is moved to the second position which reflects a maximum sieve opening size. Intermediate sized openings of the sieve <b>108</b> can be effectuated by positioning the pivot handle <b>14</b> between the first and second positions.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In sum, owing to the direct linear translation of the rack gear <b>12</b> without the necessity of any linkage or pivoting linkages, the present invention advantageously provides for a more accurately controllable sieve adjustments means for controlling and adjusting the size of openings on a sieve. That is, the rack and pinion gear mechanism of the present invention has significantly less lost motion or play due to the nature and tolerances of the meshing gears of the rack and pinion gear mechanism. Further, the rack and pinion gear mechanism of the present invention provides for true straight line motion which is a preferred path of travel for slats/louvers to move between open and closed positions. Consequently, the sieve adjustment mechanism of the present invention provides a more robust mechanism compared to conventional sieve adjustment mechanisms and one that is less prone to deterioration in function over time due to the simple and robust design of the rack gear and pivot handle having a pinion gear of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Another advantage of the present invention is that it can be used to replace existing pivoting handle assemblies of a conventional sieve adjustment assembly. That is, the sieve adjustment mechanism <b>10</b> can be coupled to an existing arm <b>104</b> of conventional sieves.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In accordance with another aspect, instead of a separate rack gear <b>12</b> and arm <b>104</b> that connects to the sieve segments of a sieve, a rack gear <b>12</b>&#x2032; can be formed, and preferably integrally formed, as part of the arm <b>104</b>&#x2032; that extends to the support <b>30</b> for engagement with the pinion gear <b>20</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. As such, an additional linkage between the rack gear <b>12</b>&#x2032; and the arm <b>104</b>&#x2032;, along with its play and lost motion, can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In other words, the arm <b>104</b>&#x2032; extends between and operatively connects e.g., first and second sieve segments, as discussed in the above embodiment, for moving at least one of the first and second sieve segments relative to the other to adjust the size of a sieve opening of the sieve. Preferably, the arm <b>104</b>&#x2032; is configured to move in a linear direction to effectuate movement of the first and second sieve segments relative to each other. More preferably, the arm <b>104</b>&#x2032; is connected to at least one of the first and second sieve segments so as to be substantially transverse to a longitudinal axis of the first and/or second sieve segments. The arm <b>104</b>&#x2032; includes the rack gear <b>12</b>&#x2032; formed at an end of the arm <b>104</b>&#x2032; and preferably integrally formed at the end of the arm <b>104</b>&#x2032;. The end of the arm <b>104</b>&#x2032; having the rack gear <b>12</b>&#x2032; extends further past the plurality of sieve segments of the sieve so as to reach and engage a sieve adjustment mechanism <b>10</b>&#x2032;.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The sieve adjustment mechanism <b>10</b>&#x2032; includes a pinion gear <b>20</b> that operatively connects to the rack gear <b>12</b>&#x2032; for moving the arm <b>104</b>&#x2032; in a linear direction. The sieve adjustment mechanism <b>10</b>&#x2032; operatively engages with the rack gear <b>12</b>&#x2032; of the arm <b>104</b>&#x2032; for moving at least one of the first and second sieve segments relative to the other. The pinion gear <b>20</b> preferably includes an integrally formed elongated handle <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The sieve adjustment mechanism <b>10</b>&#x2032; also includes an actuator <b>160</b> connected to the pinion gear <b>20</b> for pivoting the pinion gear <b>20</b> about a first axis. Thus, in operation, the actuator <b>160</b> is preferably assembled to the pinion gear <b>20</b> and configured to move in a direction substantially traverse to the linear direction of travel of the arm <b>104</b>&#x2032;, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">It will be understood that changes in the details, materials, steps, and arrangements of parts which have been described and illustrated to explain the nature of the invention will occur to and may be made by those skilled in the art upon a reading of this disclosure within the principles and scope of the invention. The foregoing description illustrates the preferred embodiments of the invention; however, concepts, as based upon the description, may be employed in other embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.
