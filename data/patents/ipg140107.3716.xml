<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a Continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/052,473 filed on Mar. 20, 2008 and issued on Oct. 26, 2010 as U.S. Pat. No. 7,821,456, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e) to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/896,104, filed on Mar. 21, 2007, the disclosure of which are expressly incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The method and apparatus are directed generally to efficient utilization of location determination signals to determine location in noisy environments, and more particularly to efficient utilization of location determination signals for location determination in noisy environments that results in reduced power usage and/or increased computing resources.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">There currently exist a number of location determination methods and apparatuses. For example, one common system is the Global Positioning System (GPS) which utilizes a constellation of medium earth orbit satellites that transmit precise microwave signals. These signals allow a suitable receiver to determine a position location.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">GPS devices typically employ a time consuming process to find GPS signals and subsequently solve location equations to determine the location of a user and their mobile station.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Many GPS systems exist on platforms or are used in environments in which other RF receivers such as cellular telephones, wireless fidelity (WiFi), Bluetooth, Ultra-wideband, Wi-MAX, or any other radio frequency interferences from other communication devices interfere with GPS reception. Similarly GPS signals may fade or become degraded due to changing environmental conditions. Attempts to determine location in poor reception conditions may cause various problems, including but not limited to, inefficient use of power resources available to a GPS device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In accordance with an aspect of the invention, a method and apparatus are provided to predict various parameters in a noisy environment and control a GPS receiver to avoid wasting power resources and/or computing resources during periods of noise. The result is that there is an improvement in the use of the GPS samples in noisy environments, particularly when the magnitude of noise fluctuates, while minimizing the adverse affect on location determination. This further results in a shorter time to first fix in obtaining a location determination in noisy environments. Various advantages may result including an improvement in the power consumption of the GPS apparatus in noisy environments and especially during acquisition mode, an improvement in the tracking mechanism in a number of cases, and better service of the various location applications. Further benefits will be apparent in the discussion that follows.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The invention may be implemented in a number of ways. According to an embodiment of the invention an apparatus for location determination includes a location determination receiver configured to receive location determination signals, a location determination signal quality assessment component configured to assess a quality of received location determination signals, and a location determination processor responsive to an output of the location determination signal quality component for determining a location of the location determination receiver based on the location determination signals that are received during time periods when the location determination signal meets or exceeds a location determination signal quality threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to another embodiment of the invention a method for location determination includes determining whether or not there is radio frequency interference caused by a transmitter, receiving location determination signals for determining a location based on the location determination signals, and controlling a processing of received location determination signals in response to the determination of radio frequency interference caused by the transmitter.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Additional features, advantages, and embodiments of the invention may be set forth or apparent from consideration of the following detailed description, drawings, and claims. Moreover, it is to be understood that both the foregoing summary and the following detailed description provide examples and are intended to provide further explanation without limiting the scope of the invention as claimed.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The embodiments of the invention and various features and details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the non-limiting embodiments and examples that are described and/or illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description. It should be noted that the features illustrated in the drawings are not necessarily drawn to scale, and features of one embodiment may be employed with other embodiments as would be apparent to a skilled artisan, even if not explicitly stated herein. Descriptions of well-known components and processing techniques may be omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure teaching principles of embodiments of the invention. The examples and embodiments herein should not be construed as limiting the scope of the claimed invention, which is defined solely by the appended claims and applicable law. Moreover, it is noted that like reference numerals represent similar parts throughout the several views of the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram showing a device, such as a mobile device, a cellular telephone, or PDA constructed and arranged in accordance with an embodiment. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a mobile station <b>100</b> that may include an antenna <b>112</b> that is used to receive GPS signals from one or more GPS satellites of a GPS satellite constellation. The mobile station <b>100</b> may further include a band pass filter <b>102</b> operating as is well known in the art to select a particular frequency band to pass through to an output. The output of the band pass filter <b>102</b> is input to a low noise amplifier (LNA) <b>104</b>. The low noise amplifier is a special type of amplifier used in communication systems to amplify weak signals received by the antenna <b>112</b>. The output of the amplified signal from the low noise amplifier <b>104</b> is then fed to a second band pass filter <b>106</b>. The second band pass filter <b>106</b> passes frequencies within a certain range and rejects or attenuates other frequencies. The band pass filter <b>106</b> passes some signals on to the GPS receiver <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The mobile station <b>100</b> further includes a prediction component <b>110</b>. The prediction component <b>110</b> may be used to predict start and/or stop times of different signals that interfere with the GPS reception resulting in undesirable noise that may cause the mobile station to operate with a lower performance and/or higher power usage. The mobile station <b>100</b> may also include a transmitter <b>114</b>. The transmitter <b>114</b> may be a cellular transmitter, a WiFi transmitter, a Bluetooth transmitter, an Ultra-wideband transmitter, a Wi-MAX transmitter, and the like. The transmitter <b>114</b> transmits signals from antenna <b>116</b>. The signals may cause interference within the mobile station <b>100</b>. The prediction component <b>110</b> controls the GPS receiver <b>108</b> to operate at those times when the signals from transmitter <b>114</b> do not generate enough interference to keep the GPS receiver <b>108</b> from being able to determine a location. In particular, the prediction component <b>110</b> may use knowledge of when other transmitters/receivers are operating in a manner that interferes. The prediction component <b>110</b> may also base controlling on actual measurement software and the like. The prediction component <b>110</b> may operate according to the process described in further detail below or may use another type of process to control the GPS receiver <b>108</b> to operate at low interference times based on the interference generated at least by the transmitter <b>114</b>. There may also be signal degradation due to environmental conditions etc.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The prediction component <b>110</b> may allow for non-continuous acquisition and/or tracking of GPS signals that may utilize short non-continuous bursts of samples of the signal, while providing a user with a continuous indication of location during movement of a GPS receiver unit <b>118</b> (the user may not even be aware that the GPS signals are acquired non-continuously).</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The prediction component <b>110</b> may also determine time slots of suitable use GPS signals (either as a function of knowledge of system noise or from within the signal itself), only acquiring GPS signals during non-continuous time slots in which the signals are suitable and then only processing the suitable signals for making location determination.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The prediction component <b>110</b> may also acquire GPS signals, determining a characteristic of the signals that may be suitable, and then performing different processes as a function of the GPS signal characteristics. For example, when a signal is of insufficient quality (determination may be made as function of knowledge of system noise or signal analysis), the prediction component <b>110</b> may not use the poor signals for making any location determination.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the prediction component <b>110</b> is shown as a separate component within the mobile station <b>100</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, both the prediction component <b>110</b> and the GPS receiver <b>108</b> may be combined in a single component. Of course other arrangements or a mobile station having additional receivers/transmitters or an additional arrangement of components is contemplated.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an interconnection between the transmitter <b>114</b> and the prediction component <b>110</b>. This interconnection <b>302</b> provides a signaling input from the transmitter <b>114</b> to the prediction component <b>110</b> providing an indication of the start and/or stop time of possible sources of interfering signals to the prediction component <b>110</b>, so that the prediction component <b>110</b> may more accurately control the operation of the GPS receiver <b>108</b>. The interfering signals (in a non-physics sense) cause undesirable noise, signal degradation, or may actually, but not necessarily &#x201c;interfere.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The determination of whether or not there is interference by the prediction component <b>110</b> may be determined by prior or real time knowledge of times when the other transceivers are in question, for example prediction component <b>110</b> may have knowledge of TDMA time slots, or when a call is being received, paging signals are received, etc. or may be made by calculations, measurements, or both. In particular, the interfering signals from a transmitter that is on the same platform (or adjacent platform) may be based on known protocols, frequencies, amplitudes, time durations, signaling, and so on. These known actions may be stored in a look-up table or calculated in the prediction component <b>110</b>. Additionally or alternatively, the determination of interfering signals may be determined by radio frequency measurement or other sensing that may result in the determination of a noisy environment or other interfering signals.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">It should be noted that the particular arrangement of the mobile station <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is presented as an example. That is to say that the band pass filter <b>102</b>, low noise amplifier <b>104</b> and band pass filter <b>106</b> may be replaced by greater or fewer components. Additionally, the fact that there are two antennae <b>112</b>, <b>116</b> is merely for this example and there may be greater or fewer antennae providing transmission and reception of any number of wireless signals including MIMO arrays, diversity receivers, etc. Now the process that may be used in the mobile station <b>100</b> will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows several examples of wave patterns of GPS signal samples and other signals that interfere causing degradation of the GPS signal. In particular <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows two separate radio frequency signals plotted with respect to time. The upper line shows GPS samples during three time periods. The first time period A on the left, time period B in the middle and time period C on the right. The interfering signal time plot (interferer) shown in the lower line shows no interfering signals during time period A, shows the existence of interfering signals during time period B, and shows no interfering signals during time period C. Accordingly, GPS samples acquired during the period A may be considered good samples in that a GPS apparatus may be able to readily use these samples to determine a location. On the other hand, the GPS samples acquired during the period B may be considered &#x201c;bad samples&#x201d; and the GPS apparatus may not be able to calculate/determine a location or may require more time or processing resources to calculate/determine a location when using samples acquired during period B. The subsequent time period C, samples are good samples, as the interfering signals are no longer present in the spectrum and a location may be readily determined using samples acquired in time period C.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The apparatus described above and the process described below addresses these cases. As shown in case one, the GPS system attempts to obtain a clean set of GPS signals during time period A. The GPS apparatus requires a certain amount of time in order to obtain a good sample. This time period is referred to as &#x394;t<sub>req</sub>. In case one, the GPS apparatus starts the reception process during time period A. However, the reception time (&#x394;t) is not long enough and extends into time period B during which period interfering signals are transmitted or received. Accordingly, the apparatus and process of the invention may suspend or stop the GPS reception and/or location determination process during interference, and knowing or having a good prediction of when the interfering signals may stop, may continue or restart the sampling process at the start of time period C. Accordingly, the GPS system is able to reduce power consumption and save computing resources. In case two, also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the requested start of a sampling process occurs during time period B. The prediction component and process of the invention may suspend the sampling process until time period C at which time the receiver may obtain a full clean sample (&#x394;t&#x3e;&#x394;t<sub>req</sub>). Again processor resources are saved and power consumption is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">It should be noted that &#x394;t<sub>req </sub>is the time that a GPS receiver needs to receive GPS signals to make a location determination. At must be greater than &#x394;t<sub>req</sub>. &#x394;t<sub>req </sub>may vary depending on the GPS system and may also vary depending on three different scenarios. The three different scenarios are cold, warm and hot. The cold scenario is with respect to when the GPS receiver has missing or in accurate estimates of its position, velocity, time and/or visibility of any GPS satellites. In this regard, the receiver must systematically search for all possible signals from the constellation of satellites. After acquiring one or more satellite signals, the receiver must then obtain information regarding other satellites and in particular the almanac. The almanac is typically transmitted from the satellites over several minutes. The next scenario is the warm scenario. The receiver has some estimates of the current time and current position and may have some valid almanac data. However, it still must acquire each satellite signal and obtain the satellites detail orbital information. Finally, the hot scenario is when a GPS apparatus has a valid time, position, almanac and other data enabling a rapid acquisition of satellite signals. Accordingly, the &#x394;t<sub>req </sub>for a time to first fix (TTFF) is based on whether or not a GPS apparatus is currently in a cold, warm, or hot scenario. The process in which the GPS system may operate will now be discussed with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. It should be noted that the apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref> may use a different process than described herein providing the same functionality.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows an exemplary process operating according to the principles of an embodiment of the invention. In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows a process for reducing power consumption and/or saving processing resources for a GPS receiver operating in noisy environments. The process <b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes a communications manager process <b>502</b> for the efficient utilization of location determination signals. The first step in the process may be to determine whether or not there is any current interfering signals or other type of noise within the environment as shown by <b>504</b>. If there is no current interfering signals or noise, then the logic may move forward to <b>512</b> and the GPS receiver may obtain a fix on the various signals from the satellite of the GPS constellation. Thereafter, the radio frequency samples from the GPS system may be obtained as shown in <b>514</b>. Next, the GPS base band processing may begin as shown in <b>516</b>, and the position calculation process may begin and be completed as shown in <b>518</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">If however on the other hand, there are interfering signals or other noisy signals determined in <b>504</b>, the processing may not move to GPS <b>512</b>, but instead may stop and execute the process described in further detail below. The determination of whether or not there is interference may be found by calculations, measurements, or both. In particular, the interfering signals from a transmitter or received in a receiver may be based on known protocols, frequencies, amplitudes, time durations, signaling, and so on that are caused by the transmitter that is on the same platform or in the same mobile station as the GPS receiver. In this regard, known actions may cause interference, accordingly such actions may be signaled to the GPS receiver to provide an indication of interference or possible interferences in <b>504</b>. Additionally, the determination of interference as shown in <b>504</b> might be via some form of radio frequency measurement or other sensing that may result in the determination of a noisy environment or other interference. In any event, any type of known interference and any ability to ascertain that there is a noisy environment and/or interference is within the scope and spirit of the invention in determination of interference as shown in <b>504</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In <b>506</b>, a determination is made whether or not the start time and/or stop time are known for the interference. In this regard, the transmitter that is part of the platform of the GPS receiver or mobile station is operating may provide and indication on the length of time (start and/or stop time) of the transmission of interfering signals. Alternatively the period of time may be known, for example set by standards. Such information may be stored in a look up table, such that when a particular activity is used or started, that information may be obtained in the look up table to provide a start and/or stop time that may be used for further processing. In that regard, as shown in <b>510</b>, when a start and stop time is known, the GPS receiver may stop for a predetermined time until the known interference may be gone. This works for each of the cold, warm, hot scenarios. After the predetermined time has lapsed then the process may flow to the GPS radio frequency sample <b>514</b> and may go forward in accordance with the process that is described above.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">On the other hand if the start and stop time are not known in <b>506</b>, then the flow of logic may move to <b>508</b>. In <b>508</b>, the process may stop until the interference has stopped regardless of whether or not the GPS receiver is currently operating in a cold, warm or hot scenario. This may allow whatever interference and/or noisy environment currently complicating the position calculation process to change or stop. Once the interference has stopped, then the process may again start obtaining the GPS signals as described in <b>514</b>, <b>516</b>, and <b>518</b> described above.</p>
