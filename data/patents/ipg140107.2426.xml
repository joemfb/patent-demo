<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a novel acrylic ester compound which serves as an organic semiconductor material used for an organic electrophotographic photoconductor, an organic EL, an organic TFT and an organic solar cell; more specifically, it relates to an acrylic ester compound and a manufacturing intermediate, and a method for manufacturing an acrylic ester compound, wherein the acrylic ester compound includes a structural unit with a charge transport function, i.e. hole transport property, as well as an acrylic ester or methacrylic ester group in a molecule, and it can form a polymer with high crosslink density by means of a chain reaction.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The present invention relates to a highly abrasion-resistant and highly reliable electrophotographic photoconductor, which may also be hereinafter referred to as a photoconductor or a latent electrostatic image bearing member, as well as an image forming apparatus, an image forming method and a process cartridge, where the electrophotographic photoconductor has an extremely high abrasion resistance; moreover, it has superior electric properties such as charge property, sensitivity and rest potential accumulation property; and it can maintain high image quality with few image defects for a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An organic semiconductor material having a charge transport function is useful in various applications such as organic electrophotographic photoconductor, organic EL, organic TFT and organic solar cell. As a method for giving the charge transport property to an organic material used for such applications, i.e. resin used as a binder in forming a functional film, a method to mix and disperse a charge transport material in a resin is the most common, and this method is widely adopted for forming an electrophotographic photoconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, since it is difficult to ensure the mechanical strength and the heat resistance simply by mixing and dispersing a charge transport material in a resin, a material with sufficient properties cannot be achieved. Therefore, it is an effective method to attach and integrate a charge transport material and a resin used as a binder to improve these properties.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Consequently, the integration of a charge transport material with a resin has been recently addressed, and various charge transport monomers having a functional group for chain polymerization, e.g. radically polymerizable functional group, in their charge transport structure and polymers thereof have been proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">For example, various charge transport monomers having two or more functional groups for chain polymerization have been proposed, and an application of these to an electrophotographic photoconductor has been proposed. Among charge transport monomers proposals, an acrylic ester compound has a favorable cross-linking property, and many proposals thereof have been made including Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) Nos. 2000-66424 and 2000-206716. These proposals claim that the application of such charge transport monomers can improve the precipitation resistance, the abrasion resistance, the scratch resistance, the sensitivity and the rest potential.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Also, the applicants of the present invention have proposed before an acrylic ester having a triphenylamine moiety and a polymer thereof in Japanese Patent (JP-B) No. 3164426. The use of this acrylic ester can improve the sensitivity and the durability of an electrophotographic photoconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">With regard to the hole mobility which indicates the charge transport property, it has been known that an aminobiphenyl structure or amino-substituted stilbene structure with more expanded conjugated system than a simple triphenylamine structure shows high mobility; among the disclosed charge transport monomers, monomers having these structures are particularly useful. The formation of a three-dimensional cross-linking film with sufficiently high crosslink density by means of a chain reaction with such charge transport monomers provides a film with high degree of hardness and high heat resistance as well as scratch resistance. The durability may be improved by using such film for various organic semiconductor devices. However, the increase in the crosslink density reduces the essential charge transport property, and as a result, sufficient functions cannot be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In other words, many of the proposed charge transport monomers cannot simultaneously satisfy the formation of a structure with high crosslink density which can meet the various disabilities such as abrasion resistance and scratch resistance and the development of a favorable charge transport property. The development of a novel compound which can satisfy the both requirements has been desired.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also, an organic photoconductor (OPC) has various advantages including: (1) optical properties such as wide light absorption wavelength range and large absorption quantity, (2) electric properties such as high sensitivity and stable charge property, (3) wide selection of materials, (4) the ease of manufacturing, (5) low cost, and (6) non-toxicity, and it has widely been used for a copier, facsimile, a laser printer and a complex machine thereof in place of an inorganic photoconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Recently, the downsizing of an image forming apparatus has promoted the reduction in the diameter of the photoconductor. Combined with the moves towards the speeding-up and the maintenance free of apparatuses, the increased durability of a photoconductor has been highly craved. In this view, an organic photoconductor is generally soft since the charge conductor has a low-molecular charge transport material and an inert polymer, and it is disadvantageous since the mechanical load by a developing system and a cleaning system in an electrophotographic process can easily cause abrasion in a repeated use. Also, the demand for high image quality has reduced the size of toner particles, and the rubber hardness and the contact pressure of a cleaning blade have been increased to improve the cleaning ability. This is also one of the factors which promote the abrasion of a photoconductor. Such abrasion of a photoconductor degrades electric properties such as sensitivity and charge property, and it increases the occurrences of abnormal images such as decrease in image density and background fog. In addition, a scratch with local abrasion results in an image with streaks with insufficient cleaning.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Therefore, improvements in the abrasion resistance of a photoconductor have been examined. For example, JP-A No. 56-48637 discloses a photoconductor in which a crosslinking binder is used in the charge transport layer; JP-A No. 64-1728 discloses a photoconductor which a polymer charge transport material is used; JP-A No. 04-281461 discloses a photoconductor in which an inorganic filler is dispersed in the charge transport layer; JP-B No. 3262488 discloses a photoconductor which includes a polyfunctional acrylic ester monomer hardener; JP-B No. 3194392 discloses a photoconductor having a charge transport layer formed with a coating solution including a monomer with a carbon-carbon double bond, a charge transport agent with carbon-carbon double bond and a binder resin; and JP-A Nos. 2000-66425 and 2004-212959 disclose a photoconductor including a compound obtained by curing a hole transport compound having two or more functional groups for chain polymerization in a molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">These modifications improved the abrasion resistance compared to conventional equivalents. A conventional photoconductor had its surface refaced with abrasion even though an adhesion of a foreign substance or a scratch occurred on its surface, and image defect did not persist indefinitely. However, once an adhesion of a foreign substance or a scratch occurs on the surface of a photoconductor with improved abrasion resistance, the condition and image defect persist indefinitely.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Recent requirements for high image quality as well as energy saving has reduced the toner diameter, which has decreased the softening temperature. In order to secure the flowability of the toner, inorganic particles such as silica are added to the toner. There are occasions the silica particles stick in the OPC surface in the developing process. When this happens, the toner component such as wax accumulates around it and inhibits the development, and an image defect with white spot occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The four hundred and several tens of radically polymerizable compounds disclosed in JP-A No. 2004-212959 could not simultaneously satisfy the high abrasion resistance and the electrical property with little occurrence of rest potential at a high level. The reason thereof is the presumably insufficient cross-linking. Various attempts have been made to improve this such as increasing the fraction of the radically polymerizable groups, polyfunctionalizing the radically polymerizable groups and reducing the molecular weight of the charge transport structure. However, there is a limitation in the reduction of the molecular weight of a structure which develops the favorable charge transport property. On the other hand, the polyfunctionalization is effective for increasing the fraction of the content but decreases the charge transport property after curing. The reason for this is not clear, but it is presumably because the heavy cross-linking constrains the molecular movement in the charge transport structure, reduces the space for free movement is reduced and decreases the hopping mobility of the charge.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Therefore, a latent electrostatic image bearing member with sufficiently satisfactory performance and a related technology thereof have not yet been obtained thus far even with the use of a specific radically polymerized compound.</p>

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">The latent electrostatic image bearing member of the present invention includes one of a cured material obtained through a radical polymerization of a radically polymerizable compound of component (A1), and a cured material obtained through a radical polymerization of a radically polymerizable compound of component (A2) in the outermost layer, wherein the radically polymerizable compound of component (A1) includes two radically polymerizable groups and a substituted amino group in a molecule, and the radically polymerizable group and the nearest substituted amino group which do not include an unsaturated bond in between are connected with two or more aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, and, the radically polymerizable compound of component (A2) includes a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon formed by bonding a radically polymerizable group and a non-radically polymerizable substituted amine group through a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon group.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Regarding the latent electrostatic image bearing member, there were problems with conventional polyfunctional charge transport compounds such as occurrences of cracks and insufficient hardness despite the polyfunctionality due to the growing deformation in curing, but the cured material of the specific radically polymerizable compound of the present invention enables the formation of a uniform and smooth film with sufficient cross-linking and curing without occurrences of cracks, and it functions as a favorable surface layer of a photoconductor. Also, since it becomes possible to form a high-density charge transport cured film, the film strength is high enough to prevent external additives in a toner with extremely high hardness such as silica particles from sticking in the latent electrostatic image bearing member, and image defects such as white spots may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In addition, the high-density cross-linked cured film may be obtained by employing one of a cured material obtained through a radical polymerization of a radically polymerizable compound of component (A1) and a cured material obtained through a radical polymerization of a radically polymerizable compound of component (A2) in the outermost layer, wherein the radically polymerizable compound of component (A1) includes two radically polymerizable groups and a substituted amino group in a molecule, and the radically polymerizable group and the nearest substituted amino group which do not include an unsaturated bond in between are connected with two or more aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, and, the radically polymerizable compound of component (A2) includes a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon formed by bonding a radically polymerizable group and a non-radically polymerizable substituted amine group through a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon group. More preferably, a radically polymerizable compound having three or more radically polymerizable group in the molecule is preferably mixed in the component (A1) or (A2). Also, various heretofore known methods may be applied to the initiation of radical polymerization, and a latent electrostatic image bearing member with high crosslink density and superior mechanical strength may be obtained by adding a photo-polymerization initiator and irradiating a light for curing in a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Also, it is possible to provide a long-lasting latent electrostatic image bearing member with few image defects by white spots because the both abrasion resistance properties and electric properties of the latent electrostatic image bearing member of the present invention become favorable by installing in the outermost layer any one of a radically polymerizable compound of component (A1) and a cured material obtained through a radical polymerization of a radically polymerizable compound of component (A2) in the outermost layer, wherein the radically polymerizable compound of component (A1) includes two radically polymerizable groups and a substituted amino group in a molecule, and the radically polymerizable group and the nearest substituted amino group which do not include an unsaturated bond in between are connected with two or more aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, and, the radically polymerizable compound of component (A2) includes a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon formed by bonding a radically polymerizable group and a non-radically polymerizable substituted amine group through a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon group. This is presumably because the condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon or two or more aromatic hydrocarbon compounds in the component (A1) or (A2) have expanded conjugation of pi electrons compared to benzene ring in a conventional component; therefore, favorable electrophotographic properties may be obtained because of the superior charge transfer. It is also because the addition of the components (A1) or (A2) provides a stronger polymerized film than a benzene ring alone, providing the superior abrasion resistance. Furthermore, the surface having the cured material obtained through radical polymerization of the (A1) or (A2) with the radically polymerizable compound having three or more radically polymerizable groups in a molecule enables to provide a totally non-conventional latent electrostatic image bearing member which has extremely superior abrasion resistance as well as superior charge transfer property with small rest potential. Especially regarding a latent electrostatic image bearing member having on its surface a cured material obtained through radical polymerization of the component (A1) or (A2), the radically polymerizable compound having three or more radically polymerizable group in a molecule and a photo-polymerization initiator, a latent electrostatic image bearing member having superior properties described above may be easily manufactured in a short period of time and thus provided in the market at a low cost.</p>

Since the image forming apparatus of the present invention employs the latent electrostatic image bearing member of the present invention as the latent electrostatic image bearing member, an image with high durability and high quality may be obtained for a long period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">The image forming method of the present invention includes at least a latent electrostatic image forming process to form a latent electrostatic image on a latent electrostatic image bearing member, a developing process to form a visible image by developing the latent electrostatic image with a toner, a transferring process to transfer the visible image to a recording medium, a fixing process to fix a transferred image transferred on the recording medium and a cleaning process to clean the latent electrostatic image bearing member, and the latent electrostatic image bearing member is the latent electrostatic image bearing member of the present invention.

<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The process cartridge of the present invention includes at least a latent electrostatic image bearing member and a developing means to form a visible image by developing a latent electrostatic image formed on the latent electrostatic image bearing member with a toner. Since the latent electrostatic image bearing member of the present invention is used as the latent electrostatic image bearing member, the process cartridge has high scratch resistance and abrasion resistance; the surface resistance does not decrease in a high-humidity environment; an image with high durability and high quality may be obtained for a long period of time even under a high-temperature environment, which is seen in high-speed processing; the abrasion of the latent electrostatic image bearing member is suppressed to a minimal even though a blade cleaning is performed; and the cleaning performance is favorable.</p>

The acrylic ester compounds have superior film formation properties, and they can meet the demand for mechanical resistance such as abrasion and heat resistance; moreover, they can provide favorable charge transport properties as well.

Favorable chain polymerizability such as radical polymerizability may be provided as well since the acrylic ester or methacrylic ester group is introduced. Therefore, a cured resin film with high crosslink density may be easily formed with the irradiation of ultraviolet (UV) rays, electron rays and radioactive rays and with the use of radical initiator. The acrylic ester compounds have superior film formation properties, and they can meet the demand for mechanical resistance such as abrasion and heat resistance; moreover, they can provide favorable charge transport properties as well. Because of such superior properties, they are extremely useful as an organic functional material for various organic semiconductor devices such as organic electrophotographic photoconductor, organic EL, organic TFT and organic solar cell.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0239">In addition, the acrylic ester compound of the present invention has a favorable compatibility with other monomers.

<p id="p-0244" num="0243">In the second aspect of a latent electrostatic image bearing member of the present invention, an outermost layer includes a polymer including a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and it further includes other components according to requirements.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0244">The polymer including a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is not particularly restricted as long as it includes a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and it can be appropriately selected according to applications. Examples thereof include a cured material (1) which is obtained by polymerization of a radically polymerizable compound including a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon in which a radically polymerizable group and a non-radically-polymerizable substituted amino group are connected through a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon group, and a cured material (2) which is obtained by polymerization of a radically polymerizable compound of (1) above including a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and a radically polymerizable compound including three or more radically polymerizable groups in a molecule.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0245">Also, the latent electrostatic image bearing member of the present invention related to the second aspect includes an outermost layer which includes a cured material which may be obtained through radical polymerization of a radically polymerizable compound of component (A2), where the radically polymerizable compound of component (A2) includes a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon connected with a radically polymerizable group and a substituted amino group which does not include a radically polymerizable group through a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon group. It further includes a radically polymerizable compound including three or more radically polymerizable groups in a molecule, a photo-polymerization initiator, and other compositions according to requirements.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">&#x3c;Radically Polymerizable Compound of Component (A1)&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0246">This relates to an electrophotographic photoconductor that a cured film obtained by radical polymerization of a specific radically polymerizable monomer is arranged on its surface, an image forming method which uses thereof, an image forming apparatus and a process cartridge for an image forming apparatus. The radically polymerizable monomer here preferably has a structure which develops a charge transport function as well as a structure of radical polymerizability. Many radically polymerizable monomers having the structure which develops a charge transport function as well as the structure of radical polymerizability have been proposed, and JP-A No. 2004-212959 discloses four hundred and several tens of compounds as examples.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0247">However, these conventional radically polymerizable monomers cannot simultaneously satisfy the high abrasion resistance and the electrical property with little occurrence of rest potential at a high level. The reason thereof is presumably the following. It has become clear that the crosslink density should be sufficiently increased in order to achieve an advanced abrasion resistance such that hardly any scratches can be made. To increase the crosslink density, the content of the radically polymerizable group should be increased, and thus it is required that the radically polymerizable group is polyfunctionalized or that the molecular weight of the charge transport structure is reduced. However, the reduction in the molecular weight of the structure which develops favorable charge transport property is limited. On the other hand, the polyfunctionalization of the radically polymerizable group is effective in increasing the content but impairs the charge transport property after curing. The reason thereof remains unclear, but it is presumably because the heavy cross-linking constrains the molecular movement of the charge transport structural portion and reduces the range of free movement, which consequently decreases the hopping mobility of the charge.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0248">The inventors of the present invention examined a novel radically polymerizable monomer which can simultaneously satisfy the high-density radical polymerizability and the charge transport property. As a result, they found an effective radically polymerizable monomer, where the radically polymerizable monomer includes two radically polymerizable groups and a substituted amino group which does not include a radically polymerizable group, and the radically polymerizable group and the nearest substituted amino group are connected with two or more aromatic hydrocarbon compounds without an unsaturated bond in between, and they found that a film produced by using and curing this monomer could simultaneously satisfy the high-density radical polymerizability and the charge transport property. In order to reduce the constraint of molecular movement despite high crosslink density, a favorable radically polymerizable monomer has a structure in which a charge transport group composed of an aromatic compound whose structure is bulky and hardly moves is connected to the crosslinking portion of an aliphatic structure in the form of a pendant that the group may easily rotate with only one bonding. Such structural refinement can balance the higher-density radical hardenability and favorable charge transport property.</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0249">A conventional polyfunctional charge transport monomer has problems such as the occurrence of cracks due to the growing deformation in curing and insufficient hardenability despite the polyfunctionality, but the specific radically polymerizable monomer of the present invention may be cured without the occurrences of cracks to provide a uniform and smooth film which is sufficiently cross-linked and cured and favorably functions as a surface layer of a photoconductor. Also, the formation of a high-density cured film with charge transfer property sufficiently increases the film strength, prevents an external additive in a toner with extremely high hardness such as silica particles from sticking in the photoconductor and therefore decreases image defects such as white spots.</p>
<p id="p-0251" num="0250">The formation of a high-density cross-linking cured film may be achieved with the radically polymerizable monomer of the component (A1). More preferably, the component (A1) is mixed with a radically polymerizable monomer as a component B which includes three or more radically polymerizable groups in a molecule. Also, various heretofore known methods may be applied to the initiation of radical polymerization, and a latent electrostatic image bearing member with high crosslink density and superior mechanical strength may be obtained by adding a photo-polymerization initiator and irradiating a light for curing in a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0251">As a radically polymerizable group in the component (A1) of a radically polymerizable compound, any heretofore known group may be used. Examples thereof include a vinyl group, an allyl group, an acryloyloxy group, a methacryloyloxy group and an acrylamide group. Especially, an acryloyloxy group and a methacryloyloxy group are preferable in terms of polymerization property. The use of an acryloyloxy group, a methacryloyoxy group or a combination thereof enables the preparation of a sufficiently cured smooth film in a short period of time.</p>
<p id="p-0253" num="0252">The substituted amino group which does not include a radically polymerizable group is a substituted amino group which does not include the vinyl group, allyl group, acryloyloxy group, methacryloyloxy group and acrylamide group, and it preferably has a structure which develops the charge transport property as described above. A secondary amino group is given as a precursor of the substituted amino group, and examples of the amino group include a dialkyl amine such as dimethylamine and diethylamine, an aralkyl amine such as dibenzyamine and bis(4-methylbenzyl)amine, a diarylamine such as diphenylamine and di-p-tolylamine, and diheterocyclic amine such as bis(2-thienyl)amine and bis(2-furyl)amine.</p>

With the ratio exceeding 250, the cross-linked charge transport layer is soft, and the abrasion resistance decreases in some degree. Therefore, regarding the radically polymerizable compounds with modified groups such as EO, PO and caprolactone among the exemplary radically polymerizable compounds given above, it is not preferable to use a compound with an extremely long modified group by itself.</p>

It depends on the ratio of the radically polymerizable compound which has three or more radically polymerizable groups in a molecule in the solid content of the coating solution. When the content is less than 20% by mass, the three-dimensional crosslink density is low, and significant improvement in the abrasion resistance may not be achieved compared to a conventional thermoplastic binder resin.

When the content is less than 0.5 parts by mass, photo-polymerization may not proceed sufficiently. When it exceeds 40 parts by mass, the electrical properties of the latent electrostatic image bearing member may be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0278">Next, the method for forming the outermost layer is described.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0279">The outermost layer is formed by preparing: (1) an outermost layer coating solution including a radically polymerizable compound of component (A1) or component (A2), and a radically polymerizable compound which includes three or more radically polymerizable groups in a molecule, or (2) an outermost layer coating solution including a radically polymerizable compound of component (A1) or component (A2), a radically polymerizable compound which includes three or more radically polymerizable groups in a molecule and a photo-polymerization initiator; and applying the coating solution to the surface of a photoconductor, which is then radically polymerized.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0280">When the radically polymerizable compound is a liquid, other components are dissolved in the outermost layer coating solution for coating, and it may also be diluted by a solvent for coating. Examples of the solvent include: alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, 2-propanol and butanol; ketones such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone; esters such as ethyl acetate and butyl acetate; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and propyl ether; halogens such as dichloromethane, dichloroethane, trichloroethane and chlorobenzene; aromatics such as benzene, toluene and xylene; cellosolves such as methyl cellosolve, ethyl cellosolve and cellosolve acetate. These solvents may be used alone or in combination of two or more. The dilution ratio varies depending on the solubility of the compositions, the coating method and the desired thickness, and it is discretionary. It may be coated with spray-coating, bead-coating and ring-coating methods.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0281">The radically polymerizable compounds of component (A1) or component (A2) is important for providing the charge transport property to the outermost layer, and the content of the radically polymerizable compound in the outermost layer is preferably 20% by mass to 80% by mass, and more preferably 30% by mass to 70% by mass. When the content is less than 20% by mass, the charge transport property cannot be sufficiently maintained, and the degradation in the electrical properties under repeated use such as decrease in sensitivity and increase in rest potential. When it exceeds 80% by mass, the content of the radically polymerizable compound which includes three or more radically polymerizable groups in a molecule decreases. This reduces the crosslink density, and the desired property may not be fully exhibited.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0282">Other than the radically polymerizable compound of component (A1) or component (A2), the radically polymerizable compound including three or more radically polymerizable groups in a molecule and the photo-polymerization initiator, a monofunctional or bifunctional radically polymerizable compound, a functional monomer and a radically polymerizable oligomer may be combined in the outermost layer coating solution according to requirements for the purpose of functionalization such as adjusting the viscosity in coating, easing the stress of the cross-linked charge transport layer, reducing the surface energy and reducing the friction factor. Heretofore known radically polymerizable compound, functional monomer and oligomer may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0283">Examples of the monofunctional radically polymerizable compound include 2-ethylhexyl acrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate, 2-hydroxypropyl acrylate, tetrahydrofurfuryl acrylate, 2-ethylhexylcarbitol acrylate, 3-methoxybutyl acrylate, benzyl acrylate, cyclohexyl acrylate, isoamyl acrylate, isobutyl acrylate, methoxy triethylene glycol acrylate, phenoxy tetraethylene glycol acrylate, cetyl acrylate, isostearyl acrylate, stearyl acrylate and styrene monomer.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0284">Examples of the bifunctional radically polymerizable compound include 1,3-butanediol diacrylate, 1,4-butanediol diacrylate, 1,4-butanediol dimethacrylate, 1,6-hexanediol diacrylate, 1,6-hexane diol dimethacrylate, diethylene glycol diacrylate, neopentyl glycol diacrylate, bisphenol A-EO-modified diacrylate, bisphenol F-EO-modified diacrylate and neopentyl glycol diacrylate.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0285">Examples of the functional monomer include a fluorinated monomer such as octafluoro pentyl acrylate, 2-perfluorooctyl ethyl acrylate, 2-perfluorooctyl ethyl methacrylate, a vinyl monomer, acrylate and methacrylate having a polysiloxane group such as acryloylpolydimethylsiloxaneethyl, methacryloylpolydimethylsiloxaneethyl, acryloylpolydimethylsiloxanepropyl, acryloylpolydimethylsiloxanebutyl and diacryloylpolydimethylsiloxanediethyl groups, which have 20 to 70 siloxane repeating units as described in JP-B Nos. 05-60503, JP-B 06-45770.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0286">Examples of the radically polymerizable oligomer include epoxy acrylate, urethane acrylate and polyester acrylate oligomers. However, introduction of a large amount of a mono- and bi-functional radically polymerizable monomer or radically polymerizable oligomer may substantially decrease the three-dimensional cross-linkage density of the cross-linked surface layer, causing the reduction in abrasion resistance.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0287">Therefore, the content of these monomers or oligomers is preferably 50 parts by mass or less, and more preferably 30 parts by mass or less, with respect to 100 parts by mass of the radically polymerizable compound which includes the condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0288">The outermost layer coating solution may further include additives such as various plasticizers (for the purpose of stress relaxation and adhesion improvement), leveling agents and low-molecular charge transport substances which do not have radical reactivity according to requirements. These additives are not particularly restricted, and any heretofore known substance may be used. As the plasticizer, substances used for a common resin such as dibutylphthalate and dioctylphthalate may be used, and the content is preferably 20% by mass or less, and more preferably 10% by mass or less with respect to the total solid content of the coating solution. Examples of the leveling agent include silicone oils such as dimethyl silicone oil and methylphenylsilicone oil and a polymer or an oligomer which includes perfluoroalkyl group in a side chain, and the content is preferably 3% by mass or less with respect to the total solid content of the coating solution.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0289">After the outermost layer coating solution is applied, a drying process may take place in some situations, and then the coating is cured by light irradiation. Regarding the light irradiation, a UV light source such as high-pressure mercury-vapor lamp and metal halide lamp having an emission wavelength in an ultraviolet range may be used, and a visible light source may also be used to comply with the absorption wavelength of a radically polymerizable compound and a photo-polymerization initiator. The amount of the irradiated light is preferably 50 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>or greater, and more preferably 2,000 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>or less. When the amount of the irradiated light is less than 50 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, the curing reaction may require long time. When it exceeds 2,000 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, the reaction may proceed heterogeneously, resulting in local wrinkles as well as many non-reacted residues or halt ends on the surface of the outermost layer. Also, an abrupt cross-linking increases the inner stress, causing cracks or film exfoliation. In addition, nitrogen displacement may be performed during the light irradiation to prevent the oxygen from inhibiting the polymerization. The light irradiation may be performed continuously or intermittently with a few intervals. As an analogous means of the light irradiation, an electron beam irradiation may be used; however, it is preferable to use light energy by virtue of the ease of controlling the reaction speed and the simplicity of apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0290">The increase in the quantity of the light irradiation increases the gel fraction, and the system becomes more insoluble and infusible. This gel fraction is preferably 95% or greater to achieve the purpose of the present invention. The gel fraction may be obtained by immersing the cured material in an organic solvent with high solubility such as tetrahydrofuran for five days and subsequently measuring the mass decrease. thickness of the charge transport layer is restricted to the hardening condition. The cross-linking charge transport layer is most preferably the outermost layer including the cured material. The cross-linking charge transport layer is preferably insoluble in an organic solvent.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0291">The thickness of the cross-linking charge transport layer is preferably 1.0 &#x3bc;m to 11.5 &#x3bc;m, more preferably 1.5 &#x3bc;m to 11.5 &#x3bc;m, and even more preferably 3 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m. When the thickness exceeds 11.5 &#x3bc;m, cracks or film exfoliation tends to occur. Also, it becomes difficult to form a film with high crosslink density since the radical polymerization initiated by photo-fragmentation of a photo initiator does not occur easily in the deep portion. On the other hand, radical polymerization is easily inhibited by oxygen. That is, the cross-linking does not proceed or become non-uniform on the surface which is in contact with the atmosphere because of radical traps by oxygen. This effect is most prominent when the thickness of the cross-linking charge transport layer is 1.0 &#x3bc;m or less, and a cross-linking charge transport layer having a thickness of less than this value shows a decrease in the abrasion resistance and a non-uniform abrasion. In addition, the cross-linking charge transport layer is contaminated with the components of the lower charge transport layer during coating. When the coating thickness of the cross-linking charge transport layer is small, the contaminants spread in the whole layer, inhibiting the curing reaction and decreasing the crosslink density. In view of these reasons, the cross-linking charge transport layer can form a high-density cross-linking body with a thickness of 1.5 &#x3bc;m or greater, which can prevent white spots. The

<p id="p-0293" num="0292">To form a cured covering composition having the gel fraction of 95% or greater, the cumulative energy of 10 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>or greater is preferably irradiated. It is more preferable to harden to a gel fraction of 97% or greater. Raising the gel fraction can further prevent silica particles from sticking. In this case, the cumulative energy of 20 J/cm<sup>2 </sup>or greater is preferably irradiated.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0293">Having been cured by means of light irradiation, the material is annealed at 80&#xb0; C. to 150&#xb0; C. and then used as a latent electrostatic image bearing member. The time for annealing is preferably one minute to 60 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0294">The latent electrostatic image bearing member of the present invention includes the cured material in its outermost layer. The composition is not restricted, but an organic photoconductor surface with negative-charge method is preferable since the radically polymerizable compound of component (A1) or component (A2) has a hole transport characteristic. A major example of a negatively charged organic photoconductor has a charge generating layer and a charge transport layer laminated in this order on a substrate, and the cured covering composition may be applied as the charge transport layer. However, the photoconductor is configured such that a cross-linking charge transport layer is further laminated on the charge transport layer since the cross-linking charge transport layer most preferably has a thickness of 3 &#x3bc;m or greater for a longer operational life since the decrease in the thickness due to abrasion in repeated use causes local variation in charge property and sensitivity.</p>

<p id="p-0396" num="0395">An aspect that implements the image forming method of the present invention by the image forming apparatus of the present invention is illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic diagram showing an example of an image forming apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0397" num="0396">In this image forming apparatus, a charger <b>3</b> is used as a means to uniformly charge a latent electrostatic image bearing member, i.e. a photoconductor. As this charging means, a corotron device, scorotron device, a solid discharging element, a needle electrode device, a roller charging device and a conductive brush device may be used, and a heretofore known method may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0398" num="0397">The configuration of the present invention is effective when a charging means decomposes a photosensitive composition by means of a close discharging from the discharging means such as contact charging method and noncontact, closely-spaced discharging method. The contact charging method is a charging method that a photoconductor directly contact with a charging roller, charging brush or charging blade. On the other hand, the closely-spaced discharging method is a charging method that a charging roller, for example, is allocated closely between a photoconductor and a charging means with a space of 200 &#x3bc;m or less in a noncontact state.</p>
<p id="p-0399" num="0398">The size of the space is preferably 10 &#x3bc;m to 200 &#x3bc;m, and more preferably 10 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m. When the size of the space is too large, the charge may become unstable. When the size is too small, the surface of the charging member may be contaminated when there is a residual toner on the photoconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0400" num="0399">An image exposing unit <b>5</b> is used to form a latent electrostatic image on a uniformly charged latent electrostatic image bearing member <b>1</b>, i.e. photoconductor. A light source thereof may be light-emitting materials in general such as fluorescent lighting, tungsten lamp, halogen lamp, mercury lamp, sodium lamp, light-emitting diode (LED), laser diode (LD) and electroluminescence (EL). Various filters such as sharp-cut filter, band-pass filter, near-infrared-cut filter, dichroic filter, interference filter and color conversion filter may be used to irradiate only a light with a desired wavelength.</p>
<p id="p-0401" num="0400">A developing unit <b>6</b> is used to visualize the latent electrostatic image formed on the photoconductor <b>1</b>. Regarding the developing method, there are a one-component developing method with a dry toner and a two-component developing method with a wet toner. When an image exposure is performed with a positively (negatively) charged photoconductor, a positive (negative) latent electrostatic image is formed on the surface of the photoconductor. A positive image may be obtained by developing this with a negative (positive) toner, i.e. detecting particles, and a negative image may be obtained by developing this with a positive (negative) toner.</p>
<p id="p-0402" num="0401">Next, a toner image visualized on the photoconductor is transferred to a recording medium <b>9</b> by means of a transfer charger <b>210</b>. A pre-transfer charger may also be used for a more favorable transfer. A transfer method thereof may be an electrostatic transfer method using a transfer charger or a bias roller, a mechanical transfer method such as adhesive transfer method and pressure transfer method and a magnetic transfer method. Regarding the electrostatic transfer method, the charging means may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0403" num="0402">As a means to separate the recording medium <b>9</b> from the photoconductor <b>1</b>, a separating charger <b>211</b> and a separating claw <b>212</b> are used. Other separating means include an inductive separation by electrostatic adsorption, side-to-end belt separation, tip-gripping transfer and separation by curvature. As the separation charger, the charging means may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0404" num="0403">A fur brush <b>214</b> and a cleaning blade <b>215</b> are used to clean the toner remained on the photoconductor after transferring. A pre-cleaning charger <b>213</b> may also be used for efficient cleaning. Other cleaning means include a web method and a magnet brush method, and these may be used alone or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0405" num="0404">Next, a discharging means is used to remove the latent image on the photoconductor according to requirements. As the discharging means, a discharging lamp <b>2</b> and a neutralizing charger are used, for which the image exposure light source and the charging means may be used, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0406" num="0405">Moreover, heretofore known processes may be used for processes such as document scanning, paper feeding, fixing and paper delivery processes, which are not located near the photoconductor.</p>
<p id="p-0407" num="0406">Another aspect to implement the image forming method of the present invention by means of the image forming apparatus of the present invention is illustrated with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8 and 9</figref>. A tandem image forming apparatus shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a tandem color image forming apparatus. The tandem image forming apparatus has a copying apparatus body <b>150</b>, a paper feed table <b>200</b>, a scanner <b>300</b> and an automatic document feeder (ADF) <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0408" num="0407">In the copying apparatus body <b>150</b>, an intermediate transferring member <b>50</b> is located as an endless belt at the center. The intermediate transfer member <b>50</b> is spanned over support rollers <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> and rotatable clockwise in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Near the support roller <b>15</b>, an intermediate transferring member cleaning apparatus <b>17</b> is placed to remove the residual toner on the intermediate transferring member <b>50</b>. On the intermediate transferring member <b>50</b> spanned by the support roller <b>14</b> and the support roller <b>15</b>, a tandem developing unit <b>120</b> is placed, opposite to which four image forming means <b>18</b> of yellow, cyan, magenta and black are arranged in parallel along the transporting direction. Near the tandem developing unit <b>120</b>, an exposure apparatus <b>21</b> is placed. On the side of the intermediate transferring member <b>50</b> opposite to the side of the tandem developing unit <b>120</b>, a secondary transferring apparatus <b>22</b> is placed. In the secondary transferring apparatus, a secondary transfer belt <b>24</b> as an endless belt is spanned over a pair of rollers <b>23</b>, and transfer paper transported on the secondary transfer belt <b>24</b> and the intermediate transferring member <b>50</b> can contact with each other. Near the secondary transferring apparatus <b>22</b>, a fixing apparatus <b>25</b> is placed. The fixing apparatus <b>25</b> has a fixing belt <b>26</b> as an endless belt and a pressure roller <b>27</b> arranged such that it is being pressed thereby.</p>
<p id="p-0409" num="0408">Here, near the secondary transfer apparatus <b>22</b> and the fixing apparatus <b>25</b> of the tandem image forming apparatus, a sheet reversing apparatus <b>28</b> is placed to reverse transfer paper so that images are formed on both sides of the transfer paper.</p>
<p id="p-0410" num="0409">Next, the formation of a full-color image, i.e. color copy, by means of the tandem image forming apparatus is illustrated. That is, first of all, an original document is placed on a document table <b>130</b> of the automatic document feeder (ADF) <b>400</b>, or the original document is placed on a contact glass <b>32</b> of the scanner <b>300</b> by opening the automatic document feeder <b>400</b>, which is then closed.</p>
<p id="p-0411" num="0410">A start key (not shown) is pressed, and the scanner <b>300</b> is activated to drive a first carriage <b>33</b> and a second carriage <b>34</b> after the document is fed and transported onto the contact glass <b>32</b> when the original document has been placed on the automatic document feeder <b>400</b>, or on the other hand immediately when the original copy is placed on the contact glass <b>300</b>. At this time, the light from the light source is irradiated by the first carriage <b>33</b> as well as the light reflected from the document surface is reflected by a mirror in the second carriage <b>34</b>, which is received by a reading sensor <b>36</b> through a lens <b>35</b>. As a result, a color document (color image) is read as black, yellow, magenta and cyan image information.</p>
<p id="p-0412" num="0411">Each of the black, yellow, magenta and cyan image information is transmitted to each image forming means <b>18</b> (black image forming means, yellow image forming means, magenta image forming means and cyan image forming means) in the tandem image forming apparatus, and black, yellow, magenta and cyan toner images are formed in the respective image forming means. That is, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, each image forming means <b>18</b> (black image forming means, yellow image forming means, magenta image forming means and cyan image forming means) in the tandem image forming apparatus has: a photoconductor <b>10</b> (black photoconductor <b>10</b>K, yellow photoconductor <b>10</b>Y, magenta photoconductor <b>10</b>M and cyan photoconductor <b>10</b>C); a charging unit <b>60</b> that uniformly charges the respective photoconductor; an exposing unit that exposes imagewise the photoconductor (L in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) corresponding to the respective color image based on the color image information and forms a latent electrostatic image of the respective color image on the photoconductor; a developing unit <b>61</b> that develops the latent electrostatic image using the respective color toner (black toner, yellow toner, magenta toner and cyan toner) and forms a toner image of the respective color toner; a transfer charging unit <b>62</b> for transferring the toner image on the image transferring member <b>50</b>; a photoconductor cleaning apparatus <b>63</b>; and a discharging unit <b>64</b>. Therefore, based on the image information of the respective color, an image of a single color (black image, yellow image, magenta image and cyan image) may be formed. The black image formed on the black photoconductor <b>10</b>K, the yellow image formed on the yellow photoconductor <b>10</b>Y, the magenta image formed on the magenta photoconductor <b>10</b>M and the cyan image formed on the cyan photoconductor <b>10</b>C as above are sequentially transferred on the intermediate transferring member <b>50</b>, which is rotationally shifted by means of the support rollers <b>14</b>, <b>15</b> and <b>16</b> (primary transfer). Then, a composite color image (color transfer image) is formed by superimposing the black image, the yellow image, the magenta image and the cyan image on the intermediate transferring member <b>50</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0413" num="0412">On the other hand, on the paper feed table <b>200</b>, one of the feed rollers <b>142</b> is selectively rotated to let out a sheet of recording paper from one of the multi-stage paper feeding cassettes <b>144</b> provided in a paper bank <b>143</b>. The sheet is separated one by one and delivered to the paper feeding path <b>146</b> by separation rollers <b>145</b>. It is then transported and guided by conveyance rollers <b>147</b> to a paper-feeding path <b>148</b> in the copying machine body <b>150</b> and finally stopped by striking to a paper stop roller <b>49</b>. Here, the paper stop roller <b>49</b> is generally used grounded, but it may be used in the state a bias is applied for paper-powder removal.</p>
<p id="p-0414" num="0413">Then, the paper stop roller <b>49</b> is rotated with precise timing with the composite color image (color transfer image) combined on the intermediate transferring member <b>50</b> to feed the sheet (recording paper) between the intermediate transferring member <b>50</b> and the secondary transferring apparatus <b>22</b>, and by transferring the composite color image (color transfer image) on the sheet (recording paper) by means of the secondary transferring apparatus <b>22</b> (secondary transfer), a color image is transferred and formed on the sheet (recording paper). Here, the residual toner on the intermediate transferring member <b>50</b> after the image transfer is removed by means of the intermediate transferring member cleaning apparatus <b>17</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0415" num="0414">The sheet (recording paper) on which a color image is transferred and formed is transported and delivered by the secondary transferring apparatus <b>22</b> to the fixing apparatus <b>25</b>, and in the fixing apparatus <b>25</b>, the composite color image (color transfer image) is fixed on the sheet (recording paper) under heat and pressure. Then, the sheet (recording paper) is switched by a switching claw <b>55</b>, discharged by a delivery roller <b>56</b> and stacked on a copy receiving tray <b>57</b>. Alternatively, the sheet (recording paper) switched by the switching claw <b>55</b> is reversed by the sheet reversing apparatus <b>28</b> and guided again to the transferring position for recording an image on the back side. It is then discharged by the delivery roller <b>56</b> and stacked on the copy receiving tray <b>57</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0416" num="0415">A process cartridge of the present invention includes at least a latent electrostatic image bearing member of the present invention and at least any one means selected from the charging means, developing means, transferring means, cleaning means and discharging means, and it further includes other means according to requirements.

<p id="p-0418" num="0417">An image forming process by means of the process cartridge shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is illustrated. A latent electrostatic image corresponding to an exposure image is formed on the surface of the photoconductor <b>101</b>, which is rotating in the direction of the arrow, by the charge from the charging means <b>102</b> and exposure <b>103</b> from an exposing means (not shown). This latent electrostatic image is toner developed in the developing means <b>104</b>, and the toner development is transferred to the recording medium <b>105</b> by the transferring means <b>108</b>.

<p id="p-0483" num="0482">An undercoat layer having a thickness of 3.5 &#x3bc;m, a charge generating layer having a thickness of 0.2 &#x3bc;m and a charge transport layer having a thickness of 18 &#x3bc;m were formed by sequentially applying and drying a coating solution for an undercoat layer, a coating solution for a charge generating layer and a coating solution for a charge transport layer having the following compositions respectively on an aluminum cylinder having a diameter of 30 mm. On this charge transport layer, a coating solution for a cross-linking charge transport layer having the following composition was spray-coated and let to dry for 20 minutes. Then, the coated layer was cured by irradiating a light under the conditions: a metal halide lamp with 160 W/cm, irradiation distance of 110 mm, irradiation intensity of 750 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>and irradiation time of 240 seconds. The sample was further dried at 130&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes to form a cross-linking charge transport layer having a thickness of 5.0 &#x3bc;m. Thus, an electrophotographic photoconductor of the present invention was obtained.</p>

Also, the gel fraction of each cross-linking charge transport layer was obtained with the following procedure. That is, the coating solutions for a cross-linking charge transport layer was directly applied to an aluminum substrate in the same manner as respective Examples and Comparative Examples, and the samples were subjected to light irradiation and drying under the same conditions. The films were then immersed in a tetrahydrofuran solution at 25&#xb0; C. for five days, and the gel fraction was obtained from the mass decrease. The results are shown in Table 3.</p>

<p id="p-0509" num="0508">Next, photoconductors were prepared in the same manner as Examples A-1 to A-8 and Comparative Examples A-1 to A-8 except for the photoconductor of Comparative Example A-5 which had cracks in the formation of the cross-linking charge transport layer. Using these photoconductors and a toner with silica additive, operating tests with 100,000 sheets of A4 paper were performed. The photoconductors were mounted on process cartridges for electrophotography, and an image exposure light source having 655 nm of laser diode of the remodeled imagio Neo 270, manufactured by Ricoh Company Ltd., was configured such that the initial unexposed electric potential was set at &#x2212;700 V. Then, the film thicknesses of all the layers were measured prior to the operation and after 50,000 printings. Then, the wear amount was calculated from the difference thereof, and the number of white spots in a solid image area was counted per unit area. Also, the electric potential of the exposed area was measured prior to the operation and after 50,000 printings. The results are shown in Table 4.</p>

<p id="p-0511" num="0510">As indicated in Table 4, the electrophotographic photoconductors of the present invention on one hand had the more superior abrasion resistance and on the other hand enabled an image printing with fewer defects among the organic photoconductors with superior abrasion resistance. In particular, a white spot caused by silica stinging was less likely to occur, and they had the sufficient image stability for long-term use. It is evident from the comparison with Comparative Examples that these advantages are owing to Component A used in the present invention, and it shows that an electrophotographic photoconductor which contains on its surface a cured coating composition obtained from the radical polymerization of Component A of the present invention has superior properties. Also, as indicated by Examples, the combination of Component A and Component B of the present invention provides a highly durable photoconductor with the smooth surface, extremely superior abrasion resistance, low rest potential accumulation property and fewer image defects. Examples also show that the cured coating material of the composition which had been photo-cured under the presence of photo-polymerization initiator was effective. In addition, there was little allowance for wear after 50,000 printings when the thickness was less than 1 &#x3bc;m, and the residential potential accumulation property degraded with the decrease in gel fraction when the thickness exceeded 10 &#x3bc;m. Therefore, the favorable properties were maintained when the thickness of the cross-linking charge transport layer was 1 &#x3bc;m to 10 &#x3bc;m. The photoconductors cured under the curing conditions of Examples were determined practically insoluble with respect to an organic solvent based on the gel fraction data. This implies that the superior abrasion resistance and image stability may be achieved under such conditions.</p>

The film thickness of the cross-linking charge transport layer was 5.0 &#x3bc;m for all the photoconductors. The surface observation and determination of gel fraction were performed in the same manner as Example A-1. The results are shown in Table 5. In addition, operating tests were performed with these photoconductors and a toner with silica additive in the same manner as Example A-1. The results are shown in Table 6.</p>

<p id="p-0515" num="0514">It is evident from the results in Table 5 and Table 6 that a photoconductor of the present invention has the superior properties, as in the case of Examples above.</p>
<p id="p-0516" num="0515">According to the present invention, a long-lasting photoconductor having the favorable abrasion resistance as well as electric properties with fewer defects due to white spots may be provided by using a cured coating composition obtained from the radical polymerization of Component A1 on the surface of the photoconductor. Especially, a non-conventional electrophotographic photoconductor having the superior abrasion resistance as well as reduced rest potential may be obtained by disposing a cured coating composition obtained by the radical polymerization of Component A and Component B on the surface. An electrophotographic photoconductor having a cured coating composition obtained by the radical polymerization of Component A1, Component B and Component C on its surface may be provided commercially at a low cost since such photoconductor having the superior properties may be easily manufactured in a short period of time. Therefore, the use of this photoconductor can provide an image forming method, an image forming apparatus and a process cartridge for the image forming apparatus with high-quality image over a long period of time.</p>

The obtained residue was purified with a silica gel chromatography with a mixture of n-hexane and toluene as a solvent, where the ratio of n-hexane to toluene in the mixture was one to nine. Thus, the objective product was obtained as colorless crystal with the yield of 1.99 g</p>

<p id="p-0588" num="0587">An undercoat layer having a thickness of 3.5 &#x3bc;m, a charge generating layer having a thickness of 0.2 &#x3bc;m and a charge transport layer having a thickness of 18 &#x3bc;m were formed by sequentially applying and drying a coating solution for an undercoat layer, a coating solution for a charge generating layer and a coating solution for a charge transport layer having the following compositions respectively on an aluminum cylinder having a diameter of 30 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0589" num="0588">On this charge transport layer, a coating solution for a cross-linking charge transport layer having the following composition was spray-coated and let to dry for 20 minutes. Then, the coated layer was cured by irradiating a light under the conditions: a metal halide lamp with 160 W/cm, irradiation distance of 110 mm, irradiation intensity of 750 mW/cm<sup>2 </sup>and irradiation time of 240 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0590" num="0589">The sample was further dried at 130&#xb0; C. for 20 minutes to form a cross-linking charge transport layer having a thickness of 5.0 &#x3bc;m. Thus, an electrophotographic photoconductor of the present invention was obtained.</p>

<p id="p-0618" num="0617">Photoconductors were prepared in the same manner as Examples B-1 to B-8 and Comparative Examples B-1 to B-8 except for the photoconductor of Comparative Example B-5 which had cracks in the formation of the cross-linking charge transport layer. Using these photoconductors and a toner with silica additive, operating tests with 50,000 sheets of A4 paper were performed.</p>
<p id="p-0619" num="0618">The photoconductors were mounted on process cartridges for electrophotography, and an image exposure light source having 655 nm of laser diode of the remodeled imagio Neo 270, manufactured by Ricoh Company Ltd., was configured such that the initial unexposed electric potential was set at &#x2212;700 V. Then, the film thicknesses of all the layers were measured prior to the operation and after 50,000 printings. Then, the wear amount was calculated from the difference thereof, and the number of white spots in a solid image area was counted per unit area.</p>
<p id="p-0620" num="0619">Also, the electric potential of the exposed area (VL) was measured prior to the operation and after 50,000 printings for examining the rest potential accumulation property.</p>

<p id="p-0622" num="0621">As indicated in Tables 9 to 10, the latent electrostatic image bearing members of Examples B-1 to B-8 on one hand had the more superior abrasion resistance and on the other hand enabled an image printing with fewer defects among the organic photoconductors with superior abrasion resistance. In particular, a white spot caused by silica stinging was less likely to occur, and they had the sufficient image stability for long-term use. It is evident from the comparison with Comparative Examples that these advantages are owing to a radically polymerizable compound having a specific condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and it shows that a latent electrostatic image bearing member which contains on its surface a cured material obtained from the radical polymerization of a radically polymerizable compound having a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon of the present invention has superior properties. Also, as indicated by Examples, the combination of a radically polymerizable compound having a condensed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon and a radically polymerizable compound having three or more radically polymerizable groups in a molecule provides a highly durable latent electrostatic image bearing member with smooth surface, extremely superior abrasion resistance, low rest potential accumulation property and fewer image defects.</p>
<p id="p-0623" num="0622">Examples B-1 to B-8 also show that the cured material of the composition which had been photo-cured under the presence of photo-polymerization initiator was effective.</p>
<p id="p-0624" num="0623">In addition, there was little allowance for wear after 50,000 printings when the thickness was less than 1.5 &#x3bc;m, and the residential potential accumulation property degraded with the decrease in gel fraction when the thickness exceeded 11.50 &#x3bc;m. Therefore, the favorable properties were maintained when the thickness of the cross-linking charge transport layer was 1.5 &#x3bc;m to 11.5 &#x3bc;m. The photoconductors cured under the curing conditions of Examples were determined practically insoluble with respect to an organic solvent based on the gel fraction data. This implies that the superior abrasion resistance and image stability may be achieved under such conditions.</p>
