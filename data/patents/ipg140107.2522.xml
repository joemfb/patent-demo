<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A reactor system includes a flexible bag having an interior surface bounding a compartment. An elongated tubular connector is disposed within the compartment of the flexible bag, the tubular connector having a first end and an opposing second end, the first end of the tubular connector being coupled with the flexible bag. An impeller is disposed within the compartment of the flexible bag and is secured to the tubular connector. A drive shaft is removably received within the tubular connector such that rotation of the drive shaft facilitates rotation of the impeller.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. The Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a stirred-tank reactor system and methods of use. The present invention further encompasses the use of the stirred-tank reactor system as a disposable bioreactor and in kits with disposable elements.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. The Relevant Technology</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Bioreactors or fermenters include containers used for fermentation, enzymatic reactions, cell culture, biologicals, chemicals, biopharmaceuticals, tissue engineering, microorganisms, plant metabolites, food production and the like. Bioreactors vary in size from benchtop fermenters to stand-alone units of various sizes. The stringent asepsis requirements for sterile production in some bioreactors can require elaborate systems to achieve the desired product volumes. Consequently, the production of products in aseptic bioreactors can be costly which provides the motivation for pursuing improved systems.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Conventional bioreactors perfuse nutrient media through a single type of hollow fiber. The various disadvantages of such bioreactors may include heterogeneous cell mass, difficult procurement of representative cell growth samples, poor performance due to inefficient oxygenation and an inability to control oxygen levels, and problems with contamination of cell cultures. Moreover, micro-environmental factors such as pH may not be effectively controlled and a mixed culture or co-culture of cells may not be possible. Some known bioreactors include a reaction container, through which a central strand of porous hollow fibers extends, through which a nutrient solution is pumped. This central strand of hollow fibers is concentrically surrounded by a plurality of strands of hollow fibers, through which a gaseous medium is conveyed. The hollow fibers of these strands are also constituted in such a manner that the gaseous medium&#x2014;for example oxygen or carbon dioxide&#x2014;can at least partly emerge from these strands or enter into these strands respectively. This type of bioreactor can achieve enhanced nutrient media oxygenation as compared to other known devices. However, occasional contamination of cell cultures and an inability to control pH levels effectively may continue to present difficulties.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The expense of producing cells, biopharmaceuticals, biologicals and the like in aseptic bioreactors is often exacerbated by the required cleaning, sterilization and validation of the standard bioreactors (i.e., stainless steel or glass reactors). Attempts have been made to solve this problem with the development of pre-sterilized disposable bioreactor systems that need not be cleaned, sterilized or validated by end users. The use of such disposable bioreactor systems could provide significant savings. Furthermore, plastics are lightweight, easy to transport, and require less room than stainless steel or glass reactors. Some have reported the use of disposable elements in bioreactors that include a reactor chamber with a support housing. The interior chamber of the support housing is lined with a disposable liner and sealed with a head plate attached to the liner to form a sealed chamber. As the liner is open at the top, it is typically used in a vertically oriented bioreactor to prevent the contamination of the head plate. Although this system provides a disposable liner, the head plate and the interior chamber may still require cleaning and sterilization.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Others have attempted to develop flexible, disposable plastic vessels that do not require cleaning or sterilization and require only minimal validation efforts. Such approaches can include a flexible, disposable, and gas permeable cell culture chamber that is horizontally rotated. The cell culture chamber is made of two sheets of plastic fused together. In addition, the culture chamber is made of gas permeable material and is mounted on a horizontally rotating disk drive that supports the flexible culture chamber without blocking airflow over the membrane surfaces. The chamber is placed in an incubator and oxygen transfer is controlled by controlling the gas pressure in the incubator according to the permeability coefficient of the bag. The rotation of the bag assists in mixing the contents of the bag. However, the cell culture chamber will often be limited to use within a controlled gas environment. Particularly, the cell culture chamber may have no support apparatus and may be limited to small volumes. Furthermore, the chamber may not provide an inlet and an outlet for media to be constantly pumped into and out of the chamber during rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Some companies have developed a range of pre-sterile, disposable bioreactors that do not require cleaning or sterilizing. Such reactors are made of sheets of flexible, gas impermeable material to form a bag. The bag is partially filled with media and then inflated with air that continually passes through the bag's headspace. The media is mixed and aerated by rocking the bags to increase the air-liquid interface. However, since there is typically no solid housing that supports the bags, the bags may become cumbersome and difficult to handle as they increase in size. Furthermore, the wave action within the rocking bag can create damaging turbulent forces. Certain cell cultures, particularly human cell cultures, may benefit from more gentle conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Thus, there is a continuing need to develop flexible, pre-sterilized, disposable bioreactors that are easy to handle and require little training to operate, yet provide the necessary gas transfer and nutrient mixing required for successful cell and tissue cultures. Such disposable bioreactors would be equally useful for the production of chemicals, biopharmaceuticals, biologicals, cells, microorganisms, plant metabolites, foods and the like.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In a first aspect, the present invention provides a stirred-tank reactor system with disposable elements, such as a flexible plastic bag with an attached bearing, shaft, and impeller assembly. The instant invention further relates to the use of this novel stirred-tank reactor system as a disposable bioreactor and in kits with disposable elements. The advantages of the present invention are numerous. Particularly, the stirred-tank reactor system may be pre-sterilized and does not require a steam-in-place (SIP) or clean-in-place (CIP) environment for changing from batch to batch or product to product in a culture or production system. As such, the system may require less regulatory control by assuring zero batch-to-batch contamination and can, thus, be operated at a considerable cost-advantage and with minimal or no preparation prior to use. In addition, the system can be a true stirred-tank reactor system unlike other disposable reactor systems. This provides the added advantage that the instant invention can offer a hydrodynamic environment that can be scaled to various sizes similar to conventional non-disposable reactor systems. As the system typically does not require cleaning or sterilizing, it combines a flexible, easy-to-use, true stirred-tank reactor environment with zero cross-contamination during the cell culture or production process.</p>

The fluidic medium is not limited to any particular consistency and its viscosity may vary from high to medium to low. When the fluidic medium is a cell culture medium the system may be operated in, for example, batch mode, semi-batch mode, fed-batch mode, or continuous mode.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In some embodiments, the term &#x201c;impeller&#x201d; can refer to a device that is used for agitating or mixing the contents of a stirred-tank reactor system (e.g., bioreactor). The impeller may agitate the fluidic medium by stirring or other mechanical motion. The impeller of the instant invention includes, but is not limited to, a Rushton, a marine, a hydrofoil, a pitched blade, and any other commercially available impeller.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In some embodiments, a &#x201c;hydrodynamic&#x201d; environment of the instant invention may refer to an environment that is influenced by the motion of fluids and the forces acting on solid bodies immersed in these fluids within the stirred-tank reactor system.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The present invention includes single use bioreactors, stirred tank reactors, and the like. Such reactors have a variety of applications, such as for the production of therapeutic proteins via batch cell culture. Relatedly, these systems can be used to provide for cell growth and antibody production for CHO and other cell lines. The hydrodynamic environment within the reactors can be well characterized, and, as such, may be scaled to other stirred tank bioreactors.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">Single use bioprocess containers can be used for the storage of biopharmaceutical media, buffers, and other products. Using these storage container systems, several mixing systems for preparation of media and buffers can be developed, often to commercial scale up to 10,000 liters or more. Such mixing systems and bioreactors can use various means for mixing the reactor contents, such as a pulsating disk, a paddle mixer, a rocking platform, an impeller, and the like. These systems are well suited for use in chemical processing. The operating characteristics of the reactors can be well defined, and can be readily predicted and scaled to various sizes. In the biopharmaceutical industry, such stirred tank bioreactors can be established as a means for manufacture of biologic products from a wide range of biological systems, including animal cell culture. Processes for biological systems can be developed using stirred tank bioreactors at the bench scale and transferred to stirred tank bioreactors at the commercial scale, up to 10,000 liters or greater, using well established scale-up methodologies. For a stirred tank bioreactor, design parameters such as tip speed, power input, Reynolds number, and oxygen transfer coefficient can be readily determined and used for scale-up.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">A single use portion of the system can include a flexible plastic container with the following single use integrated components: a bearing, shaft, and impeller assembly; a sparger assembly; ports for sterile attachment of sensor probes; and various ports for inlet and outlet of liquids and gases. A single use bioreactor can be manufactured using medical grade film. In some cases, other components of the single use bioreactor can be manufactured from readily machined materials that are not necessarily USP Class VI materials. The impeller can be a pitched-blade impeller that is attached to a bearing assembly by a flexible sheath. The impeller and sheath can rotate along with an inner bearing assembly, which is isolated from the exterior bearing assembly using various seal assemblies. An outer bearing assembly can be directly affixed to the single use container. A sparger can include a porous membrane that is sealed to the bottom of the single use container. Sparge gas can be introduced to the space between the porous membrane and bottom of the container through a port after passing through a pre-attached sterilization filter. The pH and dO<sub>2 </sub>sensors may or may not be part of the single use container and can be connected to the bioreactor using PALL KLEENPACK&#xae; connectors. Industry-standard 12 mm sensors can be calibrated, then steam sterilized with one half of the connector. The other half of the connector can be pre-attached to the container, allowing the sensor to be inserted in direct contact with the reactor contents. Ports and tubing for headspace gas, thermo well, media inlet, titrant, sampling, harvest, and various pulse feeds can be pre-attached and pre-sterilized with the container.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A permanent support vessel that contains a motor and drive shaft assembly, heat jacket, and openings for inlets, outlets, and probes can hold a single use container. A drive shaft can fit through the single-use bearing, through the flexible sheath, and lock into the impeller. This shaft can be driven using a standard bioreactor mixer motor of sufficient power. Heat can be provided to the bioreactor contents, for example, by electric heat bands that are in direct contact with sides of the single-use container. The permanent support vessel can be mobile, and can be placed on a weigh scale for control of reactor volume.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The system can be operated using standard sensors and controllers that have industry-accepted track records of performance. In some embodiments, no control system may be required for steam sterilization or clean in place, and a controller commonly used for bench-scale bioreactors may be sufficient for control of the pH, dO<sub>2 </sub>concentration, and temperature of the single use bioreactor. A single use bioreactor often requires no cleaning or sterilization in-place. As such, the capital and operating costs of control systems and utilities, such as clean steam, required for steam sterilization of a large pressure vessel may be eliminated. The cost for fabrication of a rigid-walled pressure vessel designed to handle the stresses exerted during steam-in-place sterilization may also be eliminated. Likewise, the capital and operating costs for clean-in-place control systems and utilities may be unnecessary. The design elements of traditional stainless steel vessels dictated by cleanability requirements may similarly be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In some embodiments, a single use bioreactor can be a closed system that is discarded after use. This may eliminate the need for cleaning validation studies. The potential for cross contamination between production batches may also be reduced. In some embodiments, the capital expenditure required to accommodate multiple products simultaneously in single use bioreactors can be low compared to the cost of the fixed assets and utilities required to segregate traditional bioreactor systems. A single use bioreactor can be manufactured using medical grade film, and regulatory documentation for the film may be currently available. Other product contact components of a single use bioreactor can be manufactured from USP Class VI materials. Current applications of bioprocess containers manufactured from these materials include bioreactor feed and harvest, and transport and storage of bulk intermediate and final product.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">As noted above, a stirred tank single use bioreactor according to the present invention can provide a well-characterized hydrodynamic environment for cell growth. Mixing characteristics can be readily calculated and can be translated to larger stirred tank reactors. Thus, processes developed at the lab or pilot scale may be scaled up directly to commercial scale, either in larger single use bioreactors or larger traditional stirred tank bioreactors. Scale-up parameters such as power input per unit volume, tip speed, oxygen transfer coefficient, or geometric similarity may be maintained at the larger scale. In some embodiments, the present invention provides a stirred tank reactor with a design that includes a rotating impeller driven by a drive shaft isolated through a series of rotating seals. Such designs can provide effective and efficient means of transmitting the energy required for mixing and mass transfer to the reactor contents.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The present invention can also include or be compatible with industry-standard sensor and controller technology. A standard that has developed in the industry is the use of 12 mm diameter pH and dO<sub>2 </sub>sensors inserted through DN25 (Inglold-style) ports in direct contact with the reactor contents. Systems such as a single use bioreactor can incorporate the same 12 mm diameter pH and dO<sub>2 </sub>sensors in direct contact with the reactor contents. Calibration and standardization procedures for these sensors can be readily performed during operation of the bioreactor. In addition, outputs from these sensors can be compatible with current controllers used by industry. The use of PID controllers to maintain pH, dO<sub>2 </sub>concentration, and temperature can be used in such bioreactors. As a stirred tank bioreactor with standard sensors, these control strategies can be directly translatable to a single use bioreactor. Because it can be a stand-alone unit, the single use bioreactor may be controlled using whichever controller type that is preferred by a given facility.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">A. The Stirred-Tank Reactor System</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some embodiments, the stirred-tank reactor system of the present invention provides a flexible and disposable bag for a variety of purposes, including culturing cells, microorganisms, or plant metabolites as well as processing foods, chemicals, biopharmaceuticals and biologicals. The disposable bag may include disposable elements such as a shaft, impeller and bearing and is designed to fit into a permanent housing such as a reactor housing. The bag may further include one or more openings, pouches, ports or the like. The stirred-tank reactor system allows a user to operate the culture or production with relative ease and little training. In particular, the disposable system may not require cleaning or sterilizing. Furthermore, the system may not need continuous validation between production runs. Thus, it combines a flexible, easy-to-use, true stirred-tank reactor environment with little or no cross-contamination during the production process.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Referring to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts a flexible bag <b>104</b> with at least one opening and an agitation shaft <b>112</b> with an attachable impeller <b>113</b>.

The bag <b>104</b>, agitation shaft <b>112</b>, impeller <b>113</b>, and bearing <b>105</b>, including seals or O-rings <b>106</b> are optionally disposable. The disposable bag can be a flexible, plastic bag. The bag <b>104</b> can be affixed to the agitation shaft <b>112</b> and the bearing <b>105</b> through at least one seal or O-ring <b>106</b> such that the inside of the bag remains sterile. The seals or O-rings can be further affixed to the bag as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Additionally, the disposable stirred-tank reactor system may be connected to a support or one or more bracket(s) <b>103</b> that hold the bearing <b>105</b> and motor <b>101</b>. In one embodiment (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), the support <b>103</b> is a motor and bearing support <b>103</b>, wherein the upper end of the agitation shaft <b>112</b> is further connected to a motor coupling <b>102</b>. The motor coupling <b>102</b> is connected to the motor <b>101</b> which drives the stirring motion of the agitation shaft <b>112</b> and impeller <b>113</b> leading to a hydrodynamic environment within the bag <b>104</b>. The bag <b>104</b> is designed to fit into a housing <b>111</b> such as a barrel or chamber. The housing may be a metal barrel, a plastic barrel, a wood barrel, a glass barrel, or any other barrel or chamber made from a solid material. In one embodiment of the instant invention, the housing further includes a plurality of baffles, wherein the bag folds around the baffles. In another embodiment, the flexible bag <b>104</b> further includes a top port (single or multiple) <b>108</b>, a bottom port (single or multiple) <b>109</b>, and a side port (single or multiple) <b>110</b>, wherein flexible tubing <b>107</b> can be connected to one or more of these ports.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The stirred-tank reactor system may optionally include a heater such as a heating pad, a steam jacket, or a circulating fluid or water heater. In one embodiment, the heater is located between the bag <b>104</b> and the housing <b>111</b>. In another embodiment, the heater is incorporated into the housing <b>111</b> (e.g., into a double wall between the reactor housing and the bag). In yet another embodiment, the stirred-tank reactor system is placed inside an incubator. The heater allows for heating or warming of a specific culture or production. This is particularly important for cell cultures which are often grown at 37&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In one embodiment of the instant invention, the bag <b>104</b>, the bearing <b>105</b>, the seal(s) or O-ring(s) <b>106</b>, the tubing <b>107</b>, the top port(s) <b>108</b>, the bottom port(s) <b>109</b>, the side port(s) <b>110</b>, the shaft <b>112</b>, and the impeller <b>113</b> are disposable. The motor <b>101</b>, the motor coupling <b>102</b>, the bracket(s) or motor and bearing support <b>103</b>, and the housing <b>111</b> are permanent.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">B. Devices and Ports</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The stirred-tank reactor system may also include sensors and other devices. In one embodiment, the bag includes a pH sensor and a dissolved-oxygen sensor, wherein the sensors are incorporated into the bag. As such, the sensors are disposable with the bag. In another embodiment, the sensors are attachable to the bag and are separate units. Such sensors may optionally be reusable after sterilization. In another embodiment, the system includes a product loop with flow past a pH sensor and dissolved-oxygen sensor, wherein the sensors are incorporated into the reactor housing. The system is flexible and provides alternative ways of supplying optional equipment of various kinds (e.g., sensors, probes, devices, pouches, ports, etc.). The system may also include one or more internal pouches that are sealed to the bag. In one preferred embodiment, the pouch has at least one end that can be opened to the outside of the bag to insert a probe into the reactor (i.e., the bag) while remaining on the exterior of the bag. The probe may be, for example, a temperature probe, a pH probe, a dissolved gas sensor, an oxygen sensor, a carbon dioxide sensor, a cell mass sensor, a nutrient sensor, an osmometer or any other probe that allows for testing or checking the culture or production. In another preferred embodiment, the system includes at least one port in the bag allowing for the connection of a device to the port. Such a device includes, but is not limited to, a tube, a filter, a connector, a probe, and a sampler. The incorporation of various ports into the bag allows for gas flow in and out of the bag as well as liquid flow in and out of the bag. Such ports also allow for sampling or testing the media or culture inside the bag. Tubing, filters, connectors, probes, samplers or other devices can be connected to the ports by using any desirable tubing connection technology. Pouches and ports that are sealed or affixed to the bag are disposable with the bag. The bag may also include a sparger (i.e., the component of a reactor that sprays air into the medium) sealed to the bag which can be disposed off with the bag.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Particularly, ports may be incorporated at any place on the flexible bag to accommodate the following:</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Each port may have flexible tubing attached to the port, to which media bags, sample devices, filters, gas lines, or harvest pumps may be attached with sterile or aseptic connections. In one embodiment, the ports are sealed onto the flexible bag during bag manufacture, and are sterilized with the bag assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Devices that may be used to make aseptic connections to the flexible tubing are the following:

</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0102">In another embodiment, flexible tubing that is attached to an appropriate stainless-steel valve assembly may be sterilized separately (e.g., via autoclave), and then used as a way to connect the disposable bioreactor to traditional reactors or process piping. The valve assembly is used to make a traditional steam-in-place (SIP) connection to a traditional reactor or other process, and the flexible tubing is used to make a sterile or aseptic connection to a port on the disposable reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0103">Referring to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts a probe connection that can be employed with the stirred-tank reactor system according to one embodiment of the instant invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the probe <b>201</b> can be connected to a flexible sleeve <b>202</b> or bag which extends to one half of a PALL connector <b>203</b>. The PALL connector <b>203</b> can be connected to the other half of the PALL connector <b>205</b> to provide for a sterile connection between the probe and the stirred-tank reactor system. The PALL connectors <b>203</b>, <b>205</b> include covers <b>204</b> and filters <b>207</b> to keep the connection site sterile. Filters <b>207</b> can comprise a sealing layer or stripout layer. Sterile tubing <b>206</b> extends from the other half of the PALL connector <b>205</b> to a reactor port <b>208</b> of the reactor vessel <b>209</b> of the stirred-tank reactor system. In order to attach the probe, the PALL connection is made by removing the covers <b>204</b>, mating the connectors <b>203</b>, <b>205</b>, removing the filters <b>207</b>, and sliding the movable part of the connector into position. The probe sensor tip <b>212</b> is then pushed into the reactor as the flexible sleeve or bag bunches or compresses <b>210</b>. The probe sensor tip <b>212</b> is then in direct contact with the inside of the reactor vessel <b>209</b>. A clamp <b>211</b> is placed around the probe and tubing to seal the reactor contents from the PALL connection assembly. Thus, when a sterile connection is made between the two halves of the PALL connectors <b>203</b>, <b>205</b>, the flexible sleeve <b>202</b> or bag becomes compressed <b>210</b> and the probe is in contact with the culture or production media.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0104">In one embodiment, the probes may be sterilized separately (e.g., via autoclave) then attached to the reactor via a sterile or aseptic connection. For example, a probe assembly may be made by inserting a probe <b>201</b> into one half of a PALL KLEENPAK&#xae; connector <b>203</b> and sealing the probe to the connector using a flexible sleeve or bag <b>202</b> as described above and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The sleeve extends from the outside end of the probe to the barb of the PALL connector. This assembly is sterilized separately. The other half of the PALL connector <b>205</b> is connected to a port <b>208</b> on the reactor <b>209</b> via flexible tubing <b>206</b> that will accommodate the probe. This assembly is sterilized as part of the reactor. The PALL connector is described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,655,655, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>

Reactor system <b>300</b> can include a rotational assembly <b>301</b> coupled with a container <b>302</b>. Optionally, reactor system <b>300</b> may include an impeller <b>340</b>. In some embodiments, rotational assembly <b>301</b> is in sealed cooperation with an opening or aperture in container <b>302</b>. Similarly, rotational assembly <b>301</b> may include a casing <b>360</b> that is coupled with the opening or aperture in container <b>302</b>. Typically, impeller <b>340</b> is disposed within the interior of container <b>302</b>. Rotational assembly <b>301</b> can be supported or held by bracket <b>308</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0106">In some embodiments, rotational assembly <b>301</b> may include a hub <b>320</b> that is coupled with impeller <b>340</b>, and hub <b>320</b> may be coupled with impeller <b>340</b> via a connector <b>390</b>. Optionally, hub <b>320</b> may be directly coupled with impeller <b>340</b>. In some embodiments, hub <b>320</b> is tubular in shape and includes an interior surface which bounds a passageway <b>320</b><i>a </i>longitudinally extending therethrough. In one embodiment an annular barb <b>321</b> radially encircles and outwardly projects from the exterior surface of hub <b>320</b>.

<p id="p-0103" num="0107">Connector <b>390</b> can be tubular in shape, and can include an interior surface which bounds a passageway <b>390</b><i>a </i>extending longitudinally therethrough. In some embodiments, connector <b>390</b> includes a flexible tube having a first end connected in sealed engagement with hub <b>320</b> and an opposing second end connected in sealed engagement with impeller <b>340</b>. Hub <b>320</b>, either alone or in cooperation with connector <b>390</b>, can provide a sealed channel in which drive shaft <b>304</b> can be received and removably coupled with impeller <b>340</b>. Consequently, drive shaft <b>304</b> can be used repeatedly without sterilizing because it does not directly contact the contents of container <b>302</b>. Furthermore, by using a flexible tube as connector <b>390</b>, a flexible container <b>302</b> such as a bag assembly can be easily rolled up or folded for easy transport, storage, or processing.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0108">Often, rotational assembly <b>301</b> will include a bearing assembly <b>370</b> disposed between hub <b>320</b> and casing <b>360</b>.

Wear plate <b>382</b> can be disposed circumferentially to, and coupled with, hub <b>320</b>. Seal(s) <b>384</b> can be disposed between wear plate <b>382</b> and casing <b>360</b>. Rotational assembly <b>301</b> may also include one or more seals <b>392</b> disposed between wear plate <b>382</b> and hub <b>320</b>, wherein seals <b>392</b> may be, for example, static seals.

Similarly, drive shaft <b>304</b> may extend through passageway <b>390</b><i>a</i>. Drive shaft <b>304</b> can be rotated by a motor, thereby rotating hub <b>320</b>, connector <b>390</b>, and impeller <b>340</b>. Thus, continuous rotation of drive shaft <b>304</b> facilitates continuous rotation of impeller <b>340</b>. In turn, impeller <b>340</b> agitates the contents of container <b>302</b>. As hub <b>320</b> is rotated by drive shaft <b>304</b>, seal(s) <b>392</b> provide a seal between wear plate <b>382</b> and hub <b>320</b> as they both rotate in unison, relative to casing <b>360</b>.

<p id="p-0110" num="0114">Container <b>302</b> can include any of a variety of materials. In some embodiments, container <b>302</b> includes a flexible bag of water impermeable material such as a low-density polyethylene or other polymeric sheets having a thickness in a range between about 0.1 mm to about 5 mm, or between about 0.2 mm to about 2 mm. Other thicknesses can also be used. The material can be comprised of a single ply material or can comprise two or more layers which are either sealed together or separated to form a double wall container. Where the layers are sealed together, the material can comprise a laminated or extruded material. The laminated material can include two or more separately formed layers that are subsequently secured together by an adhesive. The extruded material can include a single integral sheet having two or more layers of different material that are each separated by a contact layer. All of the layers can be simultaneously co-extruded. One example of an extruded material that can be used in the present invention is the HyQ CX3-9 film available from HyClone Laboratories, Inc. out of Logan, Utah. The HyQ CX3-9 film is a three-layer, 9 mil cast film produced in a cGMP facility. The outer layer is a polyester elastomer coextruded with an ultra-low density polyethylene product contact layer. Another example of an extruded material that can be used in the present invention is the HyQ CX5-14 cast film also available from HyClone Laboratories, Inc. The HyQ CX5-14 cast film comprises a polyester elastomer outer layer, an ultra-low density polyethylene contact layer, and an EVOH barrier layer disposed therebetween. In another example, a multi-web film produced from three independent webs of blown film can be used. The two inner webs are each a 4 mil monolayer polyethylene film (which is referred to by HyClone as the HyQ BM1 film) while the outer barrier web is a 5.5 mil thick 6-layer coextrusion film (which is referred to by HyClone as the HyQ BX6 film).</p>

<p id="p-0131" num="0135"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates a cross-section view of a sparger body <b>1500</b> according to one embodiment of the present invention. Sparger body <b>1500</b> can include a sheet of permeable material. In some embodiments, sparger body <b>1500</b> includes a vapor-permeable and water-resistant material. In related embodiments, sparger body <b>1500</b> includes a high density polyethylene fiber. For example, sparger body <b>1500</b> can include TYVEK&#xae; material. Sparger body <b>1500</b> can be in fluid communication with a port of a container (not shown) via a sparger conduit <b>1510</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, sparger body <b>1500</b> can be in the shape of a donut or ring. Relatedly, sparger body <b>1500</b> can include a base <b>1502</b> which is adapted to anchor to an interior surface of a container (not shown). The base may or may not include a gas permeable material. In other embodiments, one or more sheets of gas permeable material can be directly sealed with the interior of the container, whereby the interior of the sparger body <b>1500</b> includes a gas permeable material on one side (e.g. top side of body), and a corresponding portion of the container on the other side (e.g. bottom side of body).</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0136">In some embodiments, the permeability of the sparger body is such that fluid is prevented from flowing into the sparger when not in use. Similarly, the sparger may be constructed so as to only allow gas to pass through the permeable material when it is subject to sufficiently high gas pressure. Often, a sparger body will include a soft, flexible material. In some embodiments, sparger body <b>1500</b> may be welded directly onto the container so as to ensure proper placement and alignment. When coupled with a flexible container such as a flexible bag, sparger body <b>1500</b> can effectively be folded up with the bag for storage and transport, sterilized simultaneously with the bag, and disposed of so as to eliminate subsequent cleaning Sparger body <b>1500</b> can provide for minute gas bubbles which can increase diffusion of gas into the fluid. It is appreciated that other types of spargers can be used with the present system.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0137">A variety of materials or assemblies can be used to provide gas transfer into growth chambers. These include, for example, porous materials in the form of tubing made of TEFLON&#xae; (PTFE), polysulfone, polypropylene, silicone, KYNAR&#xae; (PVDF), and the like. In some embodiments, used to provide gas transfer into growth chambers. As noted above, sparger body <b>1500</b> can include TYVEK&#xae; material, which can be used in a bioreactor for the use of active gas diffusion. Similarly, this material can be used in a growth chamber utilizing passive gas transfer. Permeability of TYVEK&#xae; film can be measured using the quantitative property of Gurley Hill Porosity. In some embodiments, such materials range in values between about 6 to about 30 (sec/100 cc in<sup>2</sup>). Permeability rated according to the methods of Bendtsen Air Permeability are often in a range between about 400 to about 2000 (ml/min).</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0138">In some embodiments, a permeable material will have high permeability while maintaining hydrophobicity, strength, weldability, biocompatibility, and gamma stability. Often, it is desirable to have a flexible material that welds readily to common materials used in the film or port configurations, often found in the manufacture of bioprocessing containers (BPCs). For example, the flexible nature of a soft or paper like film can allow it to be folded during manufacturing, packaging, loading, and use of the bioreactor. It may also be desirous to allow for the surface area and shape of the sparge material to easily be modified or changed according to weld or cut pattern. Optionally, instead of providing a sparger body to be immersed in the contents of a container, a permeable envelope could be used to encapsulate the liquid contents of the bioreactor, thus providing a broad area for diffusion.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0139">Welding the sparger body on a port or container surface can provide for a high level of surface area while providing a low-profile sparge. In some embodiments, this can reduce turbulence near the impeller and/or reduce the possibility of cells accumulating in cracks, seams, or crevices. Often, conventional sparge configurations rely on the use of sparging rings that have small hole perforations that are placed below the impeller. Spargers can also include the use of extremely small pore sizes. Such porous materials are commonly seen as sintered metal or ceramic materials. Using a single use disposable material such as TYVEK&#xae; may be helpful in avoiding or reducing contamination and cleaning issues that may be associated with some conventional spargers, which sometimes involve cleaning numerous holes, pores, and crevices of such units. For example, small void areas in some spargers may present areas for cell debris to lodge and accumulate leading to increased occurrence of contamination. In some cases, this may carry over in subsequent cell runs.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0140">One purpose of a sparge unit in a cell culture is to aid in the mass transfer of oxygen (K<sub>L</sub>a), which is often necessary for the respiration of the growing cells. An advantage of a sparge approach used in a single use bioreactor is that the tortuous pore structure of a gas permeable membrane such as TYVEK&#xae; can allow for a beneficial effect on mass transfer of oxygen from the bulk gas introduced through the sparger. In some embodiments, it is desirable to have small bubbles introduced into the bioreactor as they can benefit mass transfer. Mass transfer across a permeable membrane can occur independent of mass transfer resulting from a gas bubble. Relatedly, a long gas retention time within the fluid column and higher surface to volume ratios are often desirable effects. It is generally accepted that the bubble size can be dominated by surface tension effects, inherently related to the component ratio of salts, proteins, sugars, and micro and macro components of the nutrient media. Experimentally calculated K<sub>L</sub>a values, visual observation, and data from bioreactor runs often indicate that bubble size and perhaps improved mass transfer are qualities of the present sparge approaches. The composition and rheological properties of the liquid, mixing intensity, turnover rate of the fluid, bubble size, presence of cell clumping, and interfacial absorption characteristics all influence mass transfer of gas such as oxygen to the cells. Main driving forces of mass transfer include surface area and concentration gradient. In many cases, a main source of resistance of oxygen mass transfer in a stirred tank bioreactor can be the liquid film surrounding the gas bubble.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0141">A sparging material such as TYVEK&#xae; can provide for the transfer of gas across the membrane. Relatedly, by incorporating TYVEK&#xae; and similar gas permeable membranes, the surface area can easily be increased. In some embodiments, the oxygen gradient between the membrane and the liquid interface can be maintained at a high level through constant replenishment directly through a sparge inlet. Further, a rapid mixing intensity can also benefit mass transfer as the impeller pumps media directly down onto a sparger surface. The use of a membrane can allow for mass transfer of oxygen across the bulk film surface, which can be in addition to the formation of bubbles that rise within the fluid column. In many cases, small bubbles can lead to greater foaming at the top of a bioreactor, which can have negative effects on cell viability and K<sub>L</sub>a according to Henry's law and the solubility of gases related to partial pressures. This boundary layer often results in a reduced ability to control dissolved oxygen levels within the bulk liquid. Typically, it is desirable to avoid or mitigate the presence of foam, as excessive amounts can result in exhaust filter blocking and run failure. The novel sparger approaches described herein can provide the desired mass transfer properties, often with reduced levels of foam generated as compared to conventional systems. This may be due to greater efficacy and less gas being introduced through the sparger to maintain a target oxygen solubility.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0142">TYVEK&#xae; is similar in some aspects to the material GORE-TEX&#xae; in that it has hydrophobic qualities but will still allow water vapor to pass through. For medical grades of TYVEK&#xae; a large relative pore size can be about 20 (micrometers) and the surface energy can be about 25 to about 32 (dynes/cm). As mentioned elsewhere herein, it may be beneficial to use a check valve in a gas inlet stream near a sparger to reduce undesirable transfer of water vapor through the membrane when the sparger is submerged while not in use. Actual moisture transmission rates may vary largely with the media used and the particular application. Moisture Vapor Transmission Rates (MTVR) often range from about 1500 to about 1640 (g/m<sup>2</sup>/24 hrs). The present invention also contemplates the use of these sparger approaches in the form of a replaceable retrofit kit, which may be adapted for use with conventional bioreactors. Such kits can improve K<sub>L</sub>a and replace a piece of hardware commonly used in steam sterilized bioreactors that may be difficult to sterilize or clean.</p>

<p id="h-0008" num="0000">C. Cultures</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0157">The stirred-tank reactor system can be designed to hold a fluidic medium such as a biological fluid, a cell culture medium, a culture of microorganisms, a food production, or the like. When the fluidic medium is a cell culture the system can be operated in, for example, batch-mode, semi-batch mode, fed-batch mode, or continuous mode. A batch culture can be a large scale cell culture in which a cell inoculum is cultured to a maximum density in a tank or fermenter, and harvested and processed as a batch. A fed-batch culture can be a batch culture which is supplied with either fresh nutrients (e.g., growth-limiting substrates) or additives (e.g., precursors to products). A continuous culture can be a suspension culture that is continuously supplied with nutrients by the inflow of fresh medium, wherein the culture volume is usually constant. Similarly, continuous fermentation can refer to a process in which cells or micro-organisms are maintained in culture in the exponential growth phase by the continuous addition of fresh medium that is exactly balanced by the removal of cell suspension from the bioreactor. Furthermore, the stirred-tank reactor system can be used for suspension, perfusion or microcarrier cultures. Generally, the stirred-tank reactor system can be operated as any conventional stirred-tank reactor with any type of agitator such as a Rushton, hydrofoil, pitched blade, or marine. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the agitation shaft <b>112</b> can be mounted at any angle or position relative to the housing <b>111</b>, such as upright centered, upright offset, or 15&#xb0; offset. The control of the stirred-tank reactor system can be by conventional means without the need for steam-in-place (SIP) or clean-in-place (CIP) control. In fact, the system of the instant invention is not limited to sterile bioreactor operation, but can be used in any operation in which a clean product is to be mixed using a stirred tank, for example, food production or any clean-room mixing without the need for a clean-room.</p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">D. The Kit</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0158">The invention encompasses a kit that includes a stirred-tank reactor system and instructions for use. In one embodiment, the kit includes a disposable stirred-tank reactor system. Accordingly, the kit includes at least one disposable element such as the bag, the shaft, the impeller, or the bearing. The kit can be entirely disposable. The flexible, disposable bag may be affixed to the shaft and the bearing through at least one seal or o-ring such that the inside of the bag remains sterile. In addition, the bag may include a pH sensor and a dissolved-oxygen sensor, wherein the sensors are incorporated into the bag and are disposable with the bag. The kit may also include one or more internal pouches that are sealed to the bag. The pouch has one end that can be opened to the outside of the bag such that a probe can be inserted into the reactor. The probe may be a temperature probe, a pH probe, a dissolved gas sensor, an oxygen sensor, a carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) sensor, a cell mass sensor, a nutrient sensor, an osmometer, and the like. Furthermore, the system may include at least one port in the bag allowing for the connection of a device to the port, wherein the device includes, but is not limited to, a tube, a filter, a sampler, a probe, a connector, and the like. The port allows for sampling, titration, adding of chemostat reagents, sparging, and the like. The advantage of this kit is that it is optionally entirely disposable and easy-to-use by following the attached instructions. This kit comes in different sizes depending on the preferred culture volume and can be employed with any desired reaction chamber or barrel. This kit is pre-sterilized and requires no validation or cleaning. The kit can be used for cell culture, culture of microorganisms, culture of plant metabolites, food production, chemical production, biopharmaceutical production, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0159">In another embodiment the kit includes a housing or barrel that holds the disposable bag. Such a housing or barrel can be supplied with the bag or provided separately.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">E. Examples</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0160">The following specific examples are intended to illustrate the invention and should not be construed as limiting the scope of the claims.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0161">(1) A Disposable Bioreactor</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0162">One example of a stirred-tank reactor system of the instant invention is a disposable bioreactor, or single use bioreactor (SUB). The bioreactor is similar to a 250 liter media bag with built-in agitation and attachable sensors (e.g., pH sensors, temperature sensors, dissolved oxygen (dO<sub>2</sub>) sensors, etc.). The reactor is operated via conventional controllers. The agitator (e.g., agitation shaft and impeller) and bearing are disposable and built into the bag. The motor attaches to a support (e.g., motor and bearing support) or bracket(s) on the 250 liter barrel that holds the bag. In size, shape, and operation, this bioreactor appears similar to a stainless steel reactor with a sterile liner, however, the bioreactor of this invention provides a multitude of advantages compared to a conventional stainless steel reactor. It can be appreciated that the size and volume of such media bags can be scaled both upward and downward, according to industry needs.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0163">Most importantly, the need for cleaning and steam sterilization is eliminated. The bag is pre-sterilized by irradiation and, thus, ready for use. In fact, no cleaning, sterilization, validation or testing is required at culture start-up or between culture runs. Consequently, the bioreactor provides a culture environment of zero cross-contamination between runs. In conventional systems, the majority of costs are related to clean-in-progress (CIP) and steam-in-progress (SIP) as well as the design of a skid and control system to oversee these functions. These costs are eliminated in the disposable bioreactor and multiple products may be cultured or manufactured simultaneously and with much greater ease.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0164">The disposable bioreactor can be easily scaled-up by using larger culture bags and larger barrels to hold the bags. Multiple bioreactors can be operated at the same time without any need for extensive engineering or cleaning. The bioreactor is a true stirred tank with well characterized mixing. As such, the bioreactor has the added advantage that it can be scaled and its contents transferred to a stainless steel reactor if desired. Notably, the bioreactor combines ease of use with low cost and flexibility and provides, thus, a new technical platform for cell culture.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0165">(2) Cell Culture</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0166">The disposable bioreactor of the instant invention can be used for a batch culture in which cells are inoculated into fresh media. As the cells grow, they consume the nutrients in the media and waste products accumulate. For a secreted product, when the culture has run its course, cells are separated from the product by a filtration or centrifugation step. For viral-vector production, cells are infected with a virus during the growth phase of the culture, allowing expression of the vector followed by harvest. Since there is zero cross-contamination in the bioreactor it works well with batch cultures.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0167">The bioreactor can also be used for perfusion cultures, wherein product and/or waste media is continuously removed and the volume removed is replaced with fresh media. The constant addition of fresh media, while eliminating waste products, provides the cells with the nutrients they require to achieve higher cell concentrations. Unlike the constantly changing conditions of a batch culture, the perfusion method offers the means to achieve and maintain a culture in a state of equilibrium in which cell concentration and productivity may be maintained in a steady-state condition. This can be accomplished in the disposable bag as easily as in any conventional stainless steel reactor. For viral-vector production, the perfusion process allows for an increase in the cell concentration and, thereby the post-infection virus titer. For a secreted product, perfusion in the bioreactor offers the user the opportunity to increase the productivity by simply increasing the size of the culture bag. Most importantly, there is no need for sterilization, validation, or cleaning because the system experiences zero cross-contamination during the production process.</p>

Human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells in 200 liters of CDM4 culture medium were incubated in a 250 liter capacity reactor system. Among other parameters shown in the graph, the viable cell density of the reactor system culture increased for about the first 14 days of the batch run.</p>

Cell growth and metabolism, antibody production, and antibody characterization data from batch culture using a 250-liter prototype system are presented and compared to results from a traditional stainless-steel bioreactor of similar scale.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0172">Materials and Methods&#x2014;Mixing Studies. Mixing time in the bioreactor was estimated at various agitation rates by tracking the change in pH in the reactor over time in response to addition of a base solution. The reactor was filled to working volume of 250 liters with typical cell culture media. At time zero, 500 ml of 1N NaOH was added at the top of the reactor, and a combined pH glass electrode was used to measure pH from time zero until the pH had stabilized. The pH versus time was plotted, and the time required to reach 95% of the final pH was estimated from the graph.</p>

For each experiment, the agitation rate was set, and then air was sparged at the desired rate. The dO<sub>2 </sub>concentration was measured versus time until it reached approximately 80% saturation with air. The value of K<sub>L</sub>a can be estimated from a graph of C<sub>L </sub>versus dC<sub>L</sub>/dt, based on the following mass balance equation:

</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0180">where C<sub>L </sub>is the dO<sub>2 </sub>concentration, and C* is the equilibrium value for C<sub>L</sub>.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0181">Materials and Methods&#x2014;Cell Culture Procedures. A cell culture process that had been developed for a traditional stainless-steel reactor of 300-liter working volume was used to demonstrate the performance of the single use bioreactor. The cell line, media, and process parameters that had been demonstrated in the traditional reactor were repeated in the single use reactor.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0182">The cells used were CHO cells expressing a humanized monoclonal antibody. Cells were thawed and maintained in T-flasks using standard methods. Cells were then expanded from T-flasks into custom 1-liter expansion bags prior to being introduced into a traditional stainless-steel 110-liter inocula bioreactor. Once cells reached a concentration of 1.6&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml, 45 liters from the traditional 110-liter bioreactor were used as inocula for the single use bioreactor. Thus, exponentially growing cells from a controlled bioreactor at a pre-determined cell concentration were provided as inocula for the single use bioreactor.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0183">A standard, commercially available, chemically defined cell culture medium was used. At a specified point in the batch culture, a commercially available nutrient feed that is of non-animal origin but is not chemically defined was added. Solutions of D-glucose and L-glutamine were added daily as required during the batch culture to maintain a concentration of D-glucose between 1 and 3 mg/liter and a concentration of L-glutamine between 1 and 3 mMol/liter throughout the batch.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0184">Control of the single use bioreactor was accomplished using standard, industry-accepted sensors and controllers. The temperature, pH, and dO<sub>2 </sub>feedback controllers operated using proportional, integral, and differential (PID) control. Temperature was measured by a platinum resistance thermometer inserted in a thermo well in the reactor, and was controlled at 37&#xb0; C. via an electric heat jacket. The pH was measured using a combined pH glass electrode that was in direct contact with the bioreactor contents. The pH was controlled at a value of 7.1 via addition of CO<sub>2 </sub>into the headspace or addition of 1M Na<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>to the culture. The dO<sub>2 </sub>concentration was measured using a dO<sub>2 </sub>sensor that was in direct contact with the bioreactor contents. The dO<sub>2 </sub>concentration was controlled at 30% saturation with air via sparging of O<sub>2 </sub>at approximately 0.2 liters/min. Agitation was not controlled by feedback but was maintained at a single set point of 110 rpm and checked daily. Level in the bioreactor was measured using a weigh scale.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0185">A sampling system was attached to the bioreactor using a sterile connection device, and was used to withdraw 10-ml samples as required during the batch culture. Samples were withdrawn at least once daily. Samples were immediately analyzed using a Nova BioProfile 200 analyzer, which provided culture pH, dO<sub>2</sub>, dCO<sub>2</sub>, D-glucose, and L-glutamine concentrations. The pH probe was standardized, as required, and D-glucose and L-glutamine solutions were added based on the Nova measurements. Viable and total cell concentrations were determined for each sample based on hemacytometer counts using trypan blue dye exclusion. Samples were filtered through a 0.2 &#x3bc;m filter and stored for later analysis using an Igen based assay for antibody titer.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0186">Key cell culture parameters were calculated based on the sample measurements. Maximum viable cell concentration, cumulative cell time at harvest, final antibody concentration, and total glucose and glutamine consumed were calculated directly from the sample data. As a batch culture, the specific growth rate of the cells, &#x3bc;, was determined for only the exponential phase of the culture. Specific growth rate was calculated from a regression fit of viable cell concentration, X<sub>v</sub>, from days one through four following inoculation:

<p id="p-0185" num="0189">The single use bioreactor supernatant was harvested, clarified by filtration and purified (protein A-based affinity purification combined with ion exchange chromatography) using the procedures established for the traditional stainless bioreactor manufacturing process. The resultant purified antibody was characterized and compared to antibody derived from the traditional stainless steel process. Carbohydrate (CHO) profile, SDS-PAGE (reduced and non reduced), SEC-HPLC, SEC-MALS (Multi-Angle Light Scattering), BIACore Binding, RP-HPLC, Capillary Electrophoresis Isoelectric Focusing (CEIEF) and MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry assays were utilized to characterize the purified antibodies derived from the single use bioreactor. The results obtained were compared to those seen for antibody produced in a traditional stainless steel bioreactor.</p>

<p id="p-0192" num="0196">Results&#x2014;Oxygen Transfer Studies. The volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient, K<sub>L</sub>a was determined for various flowrates of air through the sparger and for various agitation speeds, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 30</figref>. As expected, K<sub>L</sub>a increased with increasing air flowrate and with increasing agitation speed, with one exception. At 200 rpm, K<sub>L</sub>a was lower than that at 100 rpm. This discrepancy may be due to an increased surface effect on K<sub>L</sub>a at the higher agitation rate. (Due to the experimental procedure, the headspace contained a mixture of nitrogen and air.) Further experiments are required to quantify the surface effects.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0197">These results are comparable, as expected, with oxygen transfer characteristics of traditional stirred tank bioreactors of the same geometry. A typical literature value for the equilibrium oxygen concentration in cell culture media is 0.18 mMol/liter, and specific oxygen uptake rate for typical animal cell culture is 0.15 mMol/10<sup>9 </sup>cells/hr. Operated in the middle of the range from the above chart (agitation=100 rpm; sparge rate=1.0 liter/min; K<sub>L</sub>a&#x2248;10 hr<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) the single use bioreactor is calculated to be capable of maintaining cell concentrations greater than 10&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml using air as the sparge gas and greater than 50&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml using oxygen as the sparge gas.</p>
