<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims the benefit of priority to a Canadian Patent Application Serial Number 2718863 entitled &#x201c;TRAY HOLDER&#x201d;, filed Oct. 29, 2010 with the Canadian Intellectual Property Office, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Aspects of the present invention are directed to a tray holder and, more particularly, a holder for Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council (JEDEC) tray manipulation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Integrated circuit (IC) manufacturing processes use trays as the transport media to protect sensitive electronic devices from mechanical and electrostatic damage that may occur in typical manufacturing of IC devices. These processes take stacks of trays containing IC devices as input and output and require manual handling of stacks of trays between process steps and in and out of in-process storage.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Common methods of handling stacks of trays containing IC devices presently include the use of individual or loose trays where the operator grabs stacks of 6-14 trays without any device to restrain the trays in the stack to transport the same from station to station. This technique runs the risk of operator error where trays come unstacked. Stainless steel baskets may be used where the operator stacks trays with IC devices in a stainless steel basket to transport the same from station to station. Metal baskets are typically required to withstand the thermal environment of some process steps, making them too heavy for routine tray stack handling. Extruded C-clips cut to length to bind two trays together have been used.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">An additional system involves the use of banding straps where the operator bands a stack of trays together using a secure bundle of trays to transport the IC devices from station to station. The use of a band which is buckled about the trays is not user friendly, however, in preparing the bundle or unbundling for single tray access. In particular, straps are often made of a plastic material and they may be applied at a remote strapping machine to tray stacks between each process operation (i.e., many times during production flow). The straps are then cut and removed at each operation. As such, a number of manipulations associated with strapping operations may be significant, the use of plastics and the inability to reuse the straps is ecologically unsustainable and tray contamination and scratch damage due to the strapping leads to tray deterioration.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In view of these issues, a further system for securing trays in a stack was proposed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,421,455, in which a clip attaches individual trays in a stack, the trays being formed for nesting and with end tabs located on the opposite ends of the trays. According to the '455 patent, the clip included a platform having a front and a rear surface and a leading and trailing edge, a plurality of spaced rails positioned parallel with each other positioned on the rear surface of the platform, the rails having a generally T-shape in cross-section, an end stop projecting from the trailing edge of the platform in a rearward direction for limiting the movement of the platform across the end of the stack of trays and latch means. The latch means were formed on the platform for locking the platform onto the end of a stack of trays and include a stop projecting in a rearward direction, biasing means to normally position the stop in a position projecting rearward from the rear surface of the platform and actuating means for moving the stop against said biasing means to move the stop from the rearward projecting position to a position in the plane of said rear surface.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the actuating means are operable in a manner that is separate from the movement of the platform relative to the stack of trays, however, the connection of the clip to the stack of trays and the disconnection of the clip involves a two-step process whereby the user manipulates the platform and the actuating means separately and at the same time. That is, in order for the clip to be connected to a stack of trays, it is necessary for the user to move the platform along the tray ends and, at the same time, to pull the actuating means such that the stop does not project rearwardly. By contrast, in order for the clip to be disconnected, the actuating means must be pulled again such that the stop does not project rearwardly and such that the platform movement is permitted.

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, a clip <b>10</b> to secure nestable trays <b>11</b> in a stack <b>12</b> is provided. The trays <b>11</b> are nestable with one another and, in particular, may be Joint Electron Devices Engineering Council (JEDEC) trays. Where the trays <b>11</b> are JEDEC trays, they may be configured to support integrated circuit (IC) devices in rows and columns across the widths of the trays and they may substantially conform to the JEDEC standard for thick trays. That is, the trays <b>11</b> may be about 0.480 inches (12.2 mm) high, 5.35 inches wide, and 12.4 inches long with end tray tabs <b>31</b> to be described below that increase the total length to about 12.70 inches. Each nestable tray <b>11</b> may be formed with a lip <b>13</b> inset from the tray edge and extending around the upper edge of the nestable tray <b>11</b>, and with a recess <b>14</b> along the lower edge of the tray about its periphery such that the trays are readily stacked or nested with the lip on one engaging the recess of the next adjacent upper tray to retain the trays from shifting longitudinally or laterally in relationship to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The clip <b>10</b> includes a platform <b>20</b> having a front surface <b>21</b>, a rear surface <b>22</b> opposing the front surface <b>21</b>, a leading edge <b>23</b> and a trailing edge <b>24</b> opposing the leading edge <b>23</b>. The platform <b>20</b> further includes a plurality of rails <b>30</b>, an edge stop <b>40</b>, a brake <b>50</b> and an elastic element <b>60</b>. The rails <b>30</b> may be coupled to and may protrude from the rear surface <b>22</b> to engage with the tray tabs <b>31</b> of at least the top-most and the bottom-most trays <b>11</b> in the stack <b>12</b> (i.e., the bookending trays) to prevent movement of the platform <b>20</b> relative to the stack <b>12</b> generally or the tray ends in particular in first and second transverse directions, such as directions X and Z as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. It is to be understood that the rails <b>30</b> may engage with the tray tabs <b>31</b> of each tray <b>11</b> in the stack <b>12</b> not just the bookending trays.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The edge stop <b>40</b> may project from the trailing edge <b>24</b> to limit movement of the platform <b>20</b> across the stack <b>12</b> in a third direction, such as the direction Y as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which is transverse to the first and second directions beyond a brake position. The edge stop <b>40</b> may also be positioned on the rails <b>30</b> as well or another portion of the platform <b>20</b> as long as it is disposed to limit the movement of the platform <b>20</b> in the third direction.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">At least two or more rails <b>30</b> may be provided for each nestable tray <b>11</b> in the stack <b>12</b>. In particular, each rail <b>30</b> pair may be disposed on either side of the brake <b>50</b>. In this way, a torsional moment about the brake <b>50</b> may be limited by the rails <b>30</b> on either side of the brake <b>50</b>. Also, the tray tabs <b>31</b> and the rails <b>30</b> may each have substantially L-shaped complementary cross-sections and the platform <b>20</b> and the edge stop <b>40</b> may have respective lengths to extend substantially along an entire thickness of the stack <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The brake <b>50</b> inhibits movement of the platform <b>20</b> relative to the tray stack <b>12</b> and the elastic element <b>60</b> biases the brake <b>50</b> in a rearward direction from a plane of the platform <b>20</b> to thereby increase friction of the rail <b>30</b> and tab <b>31</b> engagements when the platform <b>20</b> occupies the brake position. The brake <b>50</b> may include a bulbous member <b>51</b> and leading and trailing edge cams <b>70</b> and <b>71</b>, having tapered and/or curved surfaces <b>701</b>, <b>711</b>, respectively, that permit movement of the platform <b>20</b> to/from the brake position across the stack <b>12</b> in the third direction by encouraging movement of the brake <b>50</b> against the bias provided by the elastic element <b>60</b> during such platform <b>20</b> movement. The elastic element <b>60</b> may include a planar member <b>600</b> with the brake <b>50</b> disposed at a distal edge thereof. With this arrangement, a size of the bulbous member <b>51</b> and a length of the elastic element <b>60</b> may be provided such that the bulbous member <b>51</b> never protrudes from a plane of the forward surface <b>21</b> of the platform <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For a stack <b>12</b> of nestable trays <b>11</b>, the platform <b>20</b> may be slid across tray ends in a direction which is substantially parallel to a longitudinal axis of the platform <b>20</b> as defined from the leading edge <b>23</b> to the trailing edge <b>24</b> such that the rails <b>30</b> slideably engage with the tray tabs <b>31</b>. This engagement prevents movement of the platform <b>20</b> into and away from the stack <b>12</b> and along a thickness direction of the stack <b>12</b>, as the rails <b>30</b> and the tray tabs <b>31</b> each may have the substantially L-shaped complementary cross sections <b>26</b>. It is to be understood that the rails <b>30</b> and the tray tabs <b>31</b> need not have substantially L-shaped cross-sections and that the sliding of the platform <b>20</b> need not be in the direction described above. In fact, the rails <b>30</b> and the tray tabs <b>31</b> may have any complementary shapes and the movement of the platform <b>20</b> may be in any direction in accordance with those shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As the sliding progresses, the leading edge cam <b>70</b> of the brake <b>50</b> comes into contact with the near ends of the near-side tray tabs <b>31</b> such that the curvature or the taper of the leading edge cam <b>70</b> relatively smoothly absorbs the impact of the brake <b>50</b> with the near ends and, as the sliding progresses further, the leading edge cam <b>70</b> causes, in opposition to the bias of the elastic element <b>60</b>, the brake <b>50</b> to move away from the tray ends in, for example, the Y direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Then, as the brake <b>50</b> clears the near-side tray tabs <b>31</b>, the trailing edge cam <b>71</b> slides over the far ends of the near-side tray tabs <b>31</b> and allows for the return of the brake <b>50</b> to its normal position with the sliding continuing until the platform <b>20</b> occupies the brake position and the edge stop <b>40</b> abuts the stack <b>12</b> to prevent any further sliding. At this point, the brake <b>50</b> abuts the stack <b>12</b> in opposition to the bias of the elastic element <b>60</b> such that friction of the rail <b>30</b> and tab <b>31</b> engagements is increased sufficiently to prevent unselective movement of the platform out of the brake position.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">By contrast, when the platform <b>20</b> is to be removed from the brake position, the platform <b>20</b> may be slid in the reverse direction. In this case, the trailing edge cam <b>71</b> of the brake <b>50</b> comes into contact with the far ends of the near-side tray tabs <b>31</b> such that the curvature or the taper of the trailing edge cam <b>71</b> relatively smoothly absorbs the impact of the brake <b>50</b> with the far ends of the near-side tray tabs <b>31</b> and, as the sliding progresses further, the trailing edge cam <b>71</b> causes, in opposition to the bias of the elastic element <b>60</b>, the brake <b>50</b> to move away from the tray ends in, for example, the Y direction, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Then, as the brake <b>50</b> clears the near-side tray tabs <b>31</b>, the leading edge cam <b>70</b> slides over the near ends of the near-side tray tabs <b>31</b> and allows for the return of the brake <b>50</b> to its normal position with the sliding continuing until the platform <b>20</b> is completely removed from the stack <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The size and shape of the elastic element <b>60</b> must therefore be provided such that the bias provided by the elastic element <b>60</b> to the brake <b>50</b> is sufficient to maintain the platform in the brake position until, for example, a user selectively moves the platform out of the brake position. That is, the bias must increase the friction generated by the engagement of the rails <b>30</b> and the tray tabs <b>31</b> such that unselective sliding of the platform <b>20</b> is prevented. By the same token, the bias must permit the selective movement of the platform <b>20</b> by the user and therefore must not be excessively rigid.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The platform <b>20</b> is formed to define windows <b>25</b> through which the nestable trays <b>11</b> in the stack <b>12</b> are at least partially visible. In this way, the contents of the stack <b>12</b> are observable and determined without disassembly or removal of any of the individual trays.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, the platform <b>20</b> is nestable with another platform <b>20</b> to form a tray stack pile <b>80</b>. As shown, the platform <b>20</b> includes complementary legs <b>81</b> and grooves <b>82</b>. The legs <b>81</b> protrude from a bottom surface of the platform <b>20</b> and the grooves <b>82</b> are recessed from a top surface of the platform <b>20</b>. With this configuration, when stacked, the platforms <b>20</b> are retained from shifting longitudinally or laterally in relationship to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with various embodiments, the platform <b>20</b> may be formed of a molded thermoplastic material. Similarly, the rails <b>30</b>, the edge stop <b>40</b> and the elastic element <b>60</b> may be integrally formed with the platform <b>20</b>. The brake <b>50</b> may be integrally formed with the elastic element <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">While the disclosure has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the scope of the disclosure. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the disclosure without departing from the essential scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the disclosure not be limited to the particular exemplary embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this disclosure, but that the disclosure will include all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
