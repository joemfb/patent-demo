<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An wireless communication device has a housing with an exterior surface that is designed to face a user when the wireless communication device is transmitting a radio frequency signal. The communication device includes an antenna disposed inside the housing for emitting a radio frequency signal. A metal-dielectric structure resonates to reflect the radio frequency signal. The metal-dielectric structure is located between the antenna and the exterior surface at a position wherein he metal-dielectric structure traps and reflects the radio frequency signal thereby reducing a specific absorption rate of the wireless communication device.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Not Applicable</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATEMENT REGARDING FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR DEVELOPMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not Applicable</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present disclosure relates to mobile, wireless communication devices, examples of which include handheld, devices such as cellular telephones, personal digital assistants, wirelessly enabled notebook computers, and the like; and more particularly to controlling the emission of the radio frequency signals transmitted by such wireless communication devices to achieve compliance with governmental regulations regarding a specific absorption rate limit.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A wide variety of types of mobile, wireless communication devices are on the market for communicating voice, data, images, and other forms of information. The demand for smaller and thinner devices, present numerous challenges for the antenna design. The antennas must be designed to fit in a limited available space and support various operating characteristics. Because of the close proximity of the phone to the user, compliance with specific absorption rate (SAR) requirements can be a challenge. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a wireless device <b>10</b> with an antenna <b>12</b> is shown as being used by a user <b>14</b>. The antenna can be located internal or external to the device <b>10</b>. When the device is held against the ear of the user <b>14</b>, some of the transmitted radio frequency energy emitted from the antenna <b>12</b> is absorbed by the user's body, most notably the head <b>16</b>. A measure of absorption of energy at a particular radio frequency per unit mass of tissue is specified as the Specific Absorption Rate (SAR). As will be appreciated, the SAR value depends heavily upon the location of the transmitting antennas with respect to the body and the intensity and the duration of the transmitted energy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Government agencies, such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States of America, have adopted limits for safe exposure to radio frequency (RF) energy. For example, the FCC limit for exposure from cellular telephones is a SAR level of 1.6 watts per kilogram (1.6 W/kg), which is referred to as a specific absorption rate limit.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Voice and data transmissions may employ a communication protocol in which the transmissions occur in one millisecond transmission slots contained within a 20 millisecond frame. When transmitting data, it is desirable to utilize as many of transmission slots in each frame as possible in order to send the data quickly. However, the more of the frame that is used, the greater the RF energy that is emitted and thus the specified SAR limit may be exceeded by the data transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a consequence, in order to comply with the SAR limit, prior communication devices often transmitted with less than an optimal number of transmission slots in each frame and less that the desired signal intensity.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The disclosure generally relates to a mobile, wireless communication device, examples of which include mobile or handheld devices, such as pagers, cellular telephones, cellular smart-phones, wireless organizers, personal digital assistants, wirelessly enabled notebook computers, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">A wireless communication device includes an antenna for transmitting a radio frequency (RF) signal. Associated with the antenna are one or more elements that reflect radio frequency energy that is directed towards the user of the communication device. This enables a greater signal intensity and a greater data transmission rate to be used to transmit the RF signal, than otherwise would be possible without the transmission exceeding the specific absorption rate limit.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Each such element comprises a metal-dielectric structure that resonates at a frequency corresponding to the frequency of the signal being transmitted by the wireless communication device. These metal-dielectric structures are placed at locations in the wireless communication device that either the current distribution exceeds a predefined threshold or the electromagnetic field intensity is above a threshold. By way of an example. that threshold may be 70% of the maximum level of the electromagnetic field intensity from the associated antenna. For example, the metal-dielectric structures may be located on a printed circuit board on which the antennas are mounted or they may be located on a surface of the housing that encloses the components of the wireless communication device. Each metal-dielectric structure traps and reflects the surface waves and prohibits its transmission to the user thereby reducing the specific absorption rate of the wireless communication device.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Examples of specific implementations of the present SAR control technique now will be provided. For simplicity and clarity of illustration, reference numerals may be repeated among the figures to indicate corresponding or analogous elements. In addition, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the embodiments described herein. The embodiments described herein may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures and components have not been described in detail so as not to obscure the embodiments described herein. Also, the description is not to be considered as limited to the scope of the embodiments described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a mobile, wireless communication device <b>10</b>, such as a cellular telephone, illustratively includes a housing <b>20</b> that may be a static housing or a flip or sliding housing as used in many cellular telephones. Nevertheless, other housing configurations also may be used. A battery <b>23</b> is carried within the housing <b>20</b> for supplying power to the other internal components.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The housing <b>20</b> contains a main printed circuit board (PCB) <b>22</b> on which the primary circuitry <b>24</b> for the wireless communication device <b>10</b> is mounted. That primary circuitry <b>24</b>, typically includes a microprocessor, one or more memory devices, along with a display and a keyboard that provide a user interface for controlling the device.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">An audio input transducer <b>25</b>, such as a microphone, and an audio output transducer <b>26</b>, such as a speaker, function as an audio interface to the user and are connected to the primary circuitry <b>24</b>. The audio input and output transducers <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> typically are located on one side of the housing <b>20</b>, which is held against the head of a person who is using the wireless communication device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Communication functions are performed through a radio frequency transceiver <b>28</b> which includes a wireless signal receiver and a wireless signal transmitter that are connected to a MIMO antenna assembly <b>21</b>. The antenna assembly <b>21</b> may be carried within the upper portion of the housing <b>20</b> and will be described in greater detail herein.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The mobile, wireless communication device <b>10</b> also may include one or more auxiliary input/output (I/O) devices <b>27</b>, such as for example, a WLAN (e.g., Bluetooth&#xae;, IEEE. 802.11) antenna and circuits for WLAN communication capabilities, and/or a satellite positioning system (e.g., GPS, Galileo, etc.) receiver and antenna to provide position locating capabilities, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the art. Other examples of auxiliary I/O devices <b>27</b> include a second audio output transducer (e.g., a speaker for speakerphone operation), and a camera lens for providing digital camera capabilities, an electrical device connector (e.g., USB, headphone, secure digital (SD) or memory card, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an exemplary a first antenna assembly <b>30</b> that can be used as the MIMO antenna assembly <b>21</b>. The first antenna assembly <b>30</b> is formed on a printed circuit board <b>32</b> that has a non-conductive substrate <b>31</b> of a dielectric material with a first major first surface <b>33</b> on which a conductive layer <b>34</b> is applied to form a ground plane <b>35</b>. The first surface <b>33</b> of the substrate has a first edge <b>36</b> and has second and third edges <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> that are orthogonal to the first edge. The printed circuit board <b>32</b> can be part of a printed circuit board on which the radio frequency circuit <b>28</b> and/or a controller circuit <b>29</b> are mounted or it can be a separate printed circuit board connected to the RF circuitry <b>28</b>. A first antenna <b>40</b> comprises a radiating element formed by an open-ended first slot <b>41</b> that extends entirely through the thickness of the conductive layer <b>34</b>. The first slot <b>41</b> extends inwardly from the second edge <b>37</b> parallel to and spaced at some distance from the first edge <b>36</b>. The first slot terminates at a closed end <b>44</b>. A second antenna <b>46</b> is similarly formed by an open-ended second slot <b>47</b> extending inwardly from the third edge <b>38</b> parallel to and spaced from the first edge <b>36</b>. The second slot <b>47</b> terminates at a closed end <b>49</b>. In this embodiment, the slots of the two antennas <b>40</b> and <b>46</b> project inwardly from opposing edges <b>37</b> and <b>38</b> of the ground plane <b>35</b> and longitudinally parallel to the common first edge <b>36</b> of the ground plane and thus are aligned with each other. The first and second antennas <b>40</b> and <b>46</b> oppose each other across a width of the ground plane <b>35</b> and may have substantially identical shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The ground plane <b>35</b> extends along three sides of the first and second slots <b>41</b> and <b>47</b>. A first conducting strip <b>42</b> and a second conducting strip <b>48</b> are formed between the printed circuit board's first edge <b>36</b> and the open-ended slots <b>41</b> and <b>47</b>, respectively. The width of the conducting strips <b>42</b> and <b>48</b> can be adjusted to optimize antenna resonant frequency and bandwidth. As a result of this configuration, the first and second slots <b>41</b> and <b>47</b> form the radiating elements of the first and second antennas <b>40</b> and <b>46</b>, respectively, and are spaced apart by at least one-tenth of a wavelength of the resonant frequency of the second antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A first signal port <b>43</b> is provided on opposite sides of the first slot antenna <b>40</b> near the closed end <b>44</b> for applying a first signal source. A second signal port <b>45</b> is provided on opposite sides of the second slot <b>47</b> near its closed end <b>49</b> for applying a second signal source. These signal ports <b>43</b> and <b>45</b> are connected to the radio frequency circuit <b>28</b> of the wireless communication device <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Although the present SAR control apparatus is being described in the context of a communication device with a pair of slot type antennas, that apparatus can be used with a device that has a single antenna or more than two antennas. Likewise, the SAR control apparatus can be used with other types of antennas, such as an inverted F antenna or a microstrip patch antenna, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a SAR control apparatus <b>50</b> is located on a second major surface <b>39</b> on the opposite side of the substrate <b>31</b> from the first surface <b>33</b> on which the antennas <b>40</b> and <b>46</b> are located. The second major surface <b>39</b> faces the head of the user when the wireless communication device <b>10</b> is placed against the user's ear, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>. The SAR control apparatus <b>50</b> comprises one or more metal-dielectric structures associated with each of the first and second antennas <b>40</b> and <b>46</b>. As shown, a first set of three metal-dielectric structures <b>51</b>, <b>52</b> and <b>53</b> are located on the second surface <b>39</b> of the substrate <b>31</b> generally underneath the first antenna <b>40</b>. At least one of these metal-dielectric structures <b>51</b>-<b>53</b> is located at a position where the intensity of the radio frequency signal emitted by the first antenna <b>40</b> exceeds a given threshold level. It is through these locations that a relatively intense RF signal would otherwise pass into the head of the user, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and thus significantly contribute to the specific absorption rate of the wireless communication device <b>10</b>. For example, the RF signal intensity at these locations as determined from the emission pattern of the first antenna <b>40</b>. Note that locating the metal-dielectric structures <b>51</b>-<b>53</b> based on this criterion does not necessarily form a periodic array, i.e., the spacing between adjacent pairs of the metal-dielectric structures is not identical.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A similar set of metal-dielectric structures <b>54</b>, <b>55</b> and <b>56</b> is located on the second surface <b>39</b> of the substrate <b>31</b> generally underneath the second antenna <b>46</b>. Each of these additional metal-dielectric structures <b>54</b>-<b>56</b> is located at a position in which the intensity of the radio frequency signal emitted by the second antenna <b>46</b> exceeds the given threshold level. It should be understood that the number and location of these metal-dielectric isolation structures <b>51</b>-<b>56</b> in the drawings is for illustrative purposes and may not denote the actual number and locations for a given antenna assembly design.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The first and second antennas <b>40</b> and <b>46</b> are designed on the printed circuit board <b>32</b> first and their emission patterns determined for the desired radio frequency signals. Based on those emission patterns the paths through the substrate <b>31</b> at which the RF signal intensity exceeds the threshold level are found. A metal-dielectric structure is then placed in each of those places of high signal intensity.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As used herein, a metal-dielectric structure is a tuned resonant cell which has a stop band that reduces propagation of radio frequency signals by trapping and reflecting signals in a defined range of frequencies. Such a structure may comprise an electromagnetic band gap device, a frequency selective surface, or a metamaterial embedded in the printed circuit board substrate <b>31</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With additional reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, each of the exemplary metal-dielectric structures <b>51</b>-<b>56</b> comprises an electromagnetic band gap device that has two concentric rings <b>60</b> and <b>61</b> formed a metal pattern adhered to the second surface <b>39</b> of the substrate <b>31</b>. Each metal ring <b>60</b> and <b>61</b> is not a continuous loop, but has a gap <b>63</b> and <b>64</b>, respectively. The gap <b>63</b> in the inner ring <b>60</b> is oriented 180&#xb0; from the gap <b>64</b> of the outer ring <b>61</b>. In other words, the gap is on a side of one ring that is opposite to a side of the other ring on the other gap is located. Each metal-dielectric structure reflects the transmitted signal away from the user, thereby reducing the specific absorption rate of the wireless communication device. That reflection also intensifies the signal transmitted in directions away from the user.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Referring still to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>7</b>, each of these metal-dielectric structures <b>51</b>-<b>56</b> can be modeled as an inductor-capacitor network forming a tuned circuit that thereby creates a frequency selective surface adjacent the antennas <b>40</b> and <b>46</b> to reduce the signal transmitted through the printed circuit board <b>32</b>. Those metal-dielectric structures are designed to have a specific frequency stop band that impedes transmission of the RF signals toward the user of the wireless communication device <b>10</b>. If each antenna <b>40</b> and <b>46</b> transmits only at a single frequency, then the metal-dielectric structures <b>51</b>-<b>56</b> have a fixed stop band set to impede that frequency emitted from each antenna.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">If, however, the operating frequencies of the first and second antennas <b>40</b> and <b>46</b> are changed with time, the resonant frequency of each metal-dielectric structure <b>51</b>-<b>56</b> is tunable to reflect the transmission frequency currently in use. One way of accomplishing that dynamic tuning is to place one or more shorting device, such as switches <b>66</b>, <b>67</b> and <b>68</b>, at selected locations between the two rings <b>60</b> and <b>61</b>. Each switch <b>66</b>-<b>68</b> may be a microelectromechanical system (MEMS), for example, that is controlled by a signal from the SAR control circuit <b>29</b>. When closed, the respective switch <b>66</b>, <b>67</b> or <b>68</b> provides an electrical path that alters the effective electrical length of the rings <b>60</b> and <b>61</b> and thus the resonant frequency of the metal-dielectric structure. A tuning circuit <b>69</b> can be connected across the gap of one or both of the two rings <b>60</b> and <b>61</b>, instead of using the switches <b>66</b>-<b>68</b> or the switches and the tuning circuit <b>69</b> can be both used together.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an alternative electromagnetic band gap device type of metal-dielectric structure <b>70</b> that has inner and outer rectilinear, e.g. square, rings <b>74</b> and <b>72</b> formed by contiguous strips of metal. Each rectilinear ring <b>72</b> and <b>74</b> has a gap <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>, respectively, with the gap on one ring being on the diametrically opposite side from the gap on the other ring. A set of switches, like switches <b>66</b>-<b>68</b>, can be connected between the inner and outer square rings to dynamically tune the alternative metal-dielectric structure <b>70</b> to resonate at different radio frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts another electromagnetic band gap device type of metal-dielectric structure <b>80</b> that can be used as a resonant SAR cell. This structure <b>80</b> has a square ring <b>82</b> that is continuous and does not have a gap. Within the square ring <b>82</b> is an interior element <b>84</b> having a shape of a Jerusalem cross. Specifically the interior element <b>84</b> has four T-shaped members <b>85</b>, <b>86</b>, <b>87</b> and <b>88</b>, each having a cross section extending parallel to and spaced from one side of the square ring <b>82</b>. Each T-shaped member <b>85</b>-<b>88</b> has a tie section that extends from the respective cross section to the center of the square ring <b>82</b> at which point all the T-shaped members are electrically connected. Switches can be connected at various locations between the T-shaped members <b>85</b>-<b>88</b> and the square ring <b>82</b> to dynamically tune the resonate frequency of the metal-dielectric structure <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts another technique for dynamically tuning a metal-dielectric structure. In this instance, a layer <b>59</b> of a liquid crystal polymer is deposited upon the second surface <b>39</b> of the substrate <b>31</b> which surface <b>39</b> is on the opposite side of the printed circuit board <b>32</b> from the first and second antennas <b>40</b> and <b>46</b>. The metal-dielectric structures <b>51</b>-<b>56</b> are formed on the outer surface of the liquid crystal polymer layer <b>59</b> in locations with respect to the two antennas as previously described.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">A liquid crystal polymer has a dielectric characteristic that changes in response to variation of a DC voltage applied thereto. Therefore, when the radio frequency transceiver <b>28</b> alters the tuning of the first and second antennas <b>40</b> and <b>46</b>, a signal is sent to the SAR control circuit <b>29</b> which applies a DC voltage that biases the liquid crystal polymer layer <b>59</b> with respect to the ground plane <b>35</b>. That biasing alters the dielectric characteristic of the metal-dielectric structures <b>51</b>-<b>56</b>, thereby changing their resonant frequencies to correspond to the radio frequencies that excite the antennas. A common liquid crystal polymer layer <b>59</b> is employed in the illustrated embodiment to change the resonant frequency of all the metal-dielectric structures <b>51</b>-<b>56</b> in unison. Alternatively, separate liquid crystal polymer layers can be defined under each set of metal-dielectric structures associated with each of the first and second antennas <b>40</b> and <b>46</b> to separately tune each set of structures to the specific frequency of the associated antenna. As a further variation, separate liquid crystal polymer layers can be defined under each metal-dielectric structure <b>51</b>-<b>56</b>, thereby enabling the resonant frequency of each structure to be tuned independently.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates another arrangement for dynamically tuning a metal-dielectric structure <b>150</b>. A printed circuit board <b>160</b> comprises a substrate <b>162</b> of dielectric material with a first major surface that has a layer <b>164</b> of electrically conductive material thereon. That electrically conductive layer <b>164</b> forms a ground plane. A liquid crystal polymer layer <b>166</b> covers the opposite surface of the substrate <b>162</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A metal-dielectric structure <b>152</b> is formed on the opposite substrate surface and may be a &#x201c;mushroom&#x201d; type electromagnetic band gap device. That type of device comprises a patch style metal pattern <b>168</b> formed on the liquid crystal polymer layer <b>166</b>. The metal pattern <b>168</b> is connected to the electrically conductive layer <b>164</b> by a via <b>170</b>. The metal-dielectric structure <b>152</b> is dynamically tuned to correspond to the frequencies of the signals emitted by an adjacent antenna (not shown). That dynamic tuning is accomplished by the SAR control circuit <b>29</b> varying a DC voltage applied between the liquid crystal polymer layer <b>166</b> and the electrically conductive layer <b>164</b>. In addition or in the alternative, the via <b>170</b> may be connected to the electrically conductive layer <b>164</b> by a switch <b>171</b>, such as a MEMS, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">It should be appreciated that more than one such metal-dielectric structure <b>152</b> can be employed in a particular antenna assembly, depending upon the locations at which the radio frequency signal needs to be suppressed for SAR compliance.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates an alternative technique for varying the resonant frequency of the metal-dielectric structures. The antenna assembly the same as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> and six metal-dielectric structures <b>91</b>-<b>96</b> are located on the second surface <b>39</b> of the printed circuit board <b>32</b> at locations where the intensity of the radio frequency signal emitted by the first and second antennas <b>40</b> and <b>46</b> exceeds the given threshold level. This places the metal-dielectric structures <b>91</b>-<b>96</b> between the antennas and the user's head when the wireless communication device <b>10</b> is being used as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Specifically the metal-dielectric structures <b>91</b>-<b>96</b> are placed between the antennas and the exterior surface <b>109</b> of the surface of the wireless communication device <b>10</b> which faces the user <b>14</b>. Note that the six metal-dielectric structures <b>91</b>-<b>96</b> are not necessarily located in a periodic array, i.e., the spacing between adjacent pairs of the metal-dielectric structures is not identical.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For dynamic tuning purposes, an inductive-capacitive (LC) lumped element network <b>98</b> is connected between adjacent pairs of the metal-dielectric structures <b>91</b>-<b>96</b>. The LC lumped element network <b>98</b> has an inductor and a capacitor that is variable in response to a signal from the SAR control circuit <b>29</b> within the wireless communication device <b>10</b>. By varying the inductance or capacitance of the lumped element networks <b>98</b>, the resonant frequency of the metal-dielectric structures <b>91</b>-<b>96</b> is varied to correspond to the dynamic tuning of the two antennas <b>40</b> and <b>46</b> to different excitation frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Although the embodiments of the SAR control apparatus described thus far have located the metal-dielectric structures on the printed circuit board, those structures can be mounted on other components of the wireless communication device. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> for example, the SAR control apparatus <b>100</b> comprises metal-dielectric structures <b>101</b>-<b>106</b> mounted on the inside surface <b>108</b> of the housing <b>20</b> of the wireless communication device <b>10</b>. The metal-dielectric structures <b>101</b>-<b>106</b> are located on a portion of the housing <b>108</b> that is between the antennas and the user when the wireless communication device is held against the user's head during use (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>). As with the previous embodiments, the metal-dielectric structures <b>101</b>-<b>106</b> are located places where the intensity of the transmitted signal exceeds a predefined threshold. Each metal-dielectric structure <b>101</b>-<b>106</b> reflects the transmitted signal away from the user, thereby reducing the specific absorption rate of the wireless communication device. It should be understood that the number and location of these metal-dielectric structures <b>101</b>-<b>106</b> is for illustrative purposes and may not reflect the actual number and locations for a given antenna assembly design. Additional, metal-dielectric structures may be located adjacent to positions where the user places fingers to hold the wireless communication device.</p>
