No. 7,419,225 issued on Sep. 2, 2008, which is a Continuation application of PCT Application No. PCT/CH2003/00263 filed in Switzerland on Apr. 22, 2003. The disclosure of the prior applications is hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a brush head for an electric or manual toothbrush and to a method for producing such a brush head.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Electric toothbrushes usually have a handle, in which a motor is accommodated, and a generally exchangeable brush head. A brush head with a bristle carrier which can be driven in a rotationally movable manner is known for example from DE-U 295 20 230. An electric toothbrush of which the brush head is made to vibrate is disclosed by WO 01/28452. Furthermore, electric toothbrushes of which the brush heads perform a pivoting movement about their longitudinal axis in the manner of a rocker are also known, for example from CH 421 049. Known electric toothbrushes have a brush head which is provided with clusters of conventional bristles. These are rounded off at their end to avoid injuries.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Manual toothbrushes with a bristle arrangement which entirely comprises pointed filaments are known for example from EP-A 0 596 633 and DE-U 90 12 603. The pointed filaments serve for the handling or cleaning of fine structures in the surface of the tooth, for example fine cracks, which cannot be effectively treated with conventional cylindrical bristles. Furthermore, thanks to the narrower tips, the pointed filaments penetrate better into the spaces between the teeth and clean them better. Electric toothbrushes with pointed bristles are not known.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, pointed bristles react poorly to mechanical abrasion in the region of the tip. Under excessive mechanical loading, the tips of these bristles break and may, on the one hand, no longer bring about the cleaning effect and, on the other hand, entail the risk of injuring the gums by the edges and corners that are produced when they break off.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The invention is therefore based on the object of further improving the cleaning effect of toothbrushes with pointed bristles and optimizing the service life of the bristles with minimal potential for injury of the gums.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The object is achieved by a brush head for a toothbrush that includes filaments that are pointed at one end, are led through clearances in a bristle carrier and have a length of about 10 to 20 mm, the tips of the pointed filaments producing at least in certain regions a height profile other than that of a plane, and the ends of the pointed filaments that are remote from the tips being melted. A production method includes leading filaments that are pointed at one end and have a length of about 10 to 20 mm through clearances in a bristle carrier, the tips of the pointed filaments producing at least over certain regions a height profile other than that of a plane, and melting the ends of the pointed filaments that are remote from the tips. Advantageous developments of the invention are provided by the dependent claims, the description and the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The invention is based on the finding that the cleaning effect of pointed filaments can be optimally used with minimal wear if the path which the pointed filaments cover during use as intended is restricted. This possibility exists in the case of electric or manual toothbrushes on which the brush head or the bristle carrier, and with it the bristles, is set in motion and generally only a minimal additional manual cleaning movement is performed. In the case of electric toothbrushes, the path of the pointed filaments or the tips that is covered during use can therefore be controlled and restricted well by the arrangement of the filaments on the bristle carrier. According to the invention, the pointed filaments are arranged on the bristle carrier in such a way that, during the operation of the electric toothbrush, their tips cover at most a predetermined maximum path d<sub>max</sub>. The rest of the bristle carrier may be provided with conventional bristles and/or further cleaning elements, for example soft-elastic elements. Conventional bristles and/or further cleaning elements may also be arranged between the pointed filaments.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The high-frequency motion of the pointed filaments produces an optimum cleaning performance. The restriction of the path which the tips cover has the effect of minimizing the wear of the bristles, so that the risk of injury to the gums is also kept low.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">With preference, the maximum path d<sub>max </sub>of the tips is 5 mm, with particular preference 3 mm. These distances correspond to the typical dimensions of relatively large spaces between the teeth or of the teeth. If these maximum values are taken as a basis, the bristles move within the structures in the set of teeth. This allows in particular the finest fissures on the tooth surface and the interdental spaces to be reached well. It is also possible to reduce what is known as a &#x201c;whiplash effect&#x201d; when brushing over the spaces between the teeth perpendicularly to their alignment. In the case of the &#x201c;whiplash effect&#x201d;, the intrinsic flexibility of the pointed filaments causes them to bend when they meet obstacles, such as the transition between two teeth, and lash forward like a whip when there is further movement, making the filaments undergo considerable stress.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The filaments may be pointed at one end or at both ends. They may also be colored, at least in the region of the tip. The color variation also provides the user with a visible indication of the wear of the brush, for example if the color washes out over time.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a, b </i>show three teeth <b>1</b>, standing in a row of teeth, with interdental spaces <b>2</b> lying in between, respectively in side view and plan view. Examples of brush heads <b>3</b> with pointed filaments <b>5</b> are provided by the other figures.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">With pointed filaments <b>5</b>, preferably small movements along the row of teeth in the direction x and rather greater movements transversely thereto, i.e. in the direction Y, are performed in the plane of the teeth or in the direction Z perpendicular to the plane of the teeth. Excessive movements along the x direction are to be avoided, since they are accompanied by great mechanical loading of the pointed filaments <b>5</b> (whiplash effect). Consequently, the desired movements of the pointed filaments <b>5</b> extend over the entire width b<b>1</b> of the interdental spaces <b>2</b> and over a strip of the width b<b>2</b> and b<b>3</b>, respectively, along the flanks <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>of the teeth. The width b<b>1</b> is typically about 2 mm, the width b<b>2</b>, b<b>3</b> in each case about 5 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In order to achieve an improved cleaning effect in comparison with manual cleaning, the brush head <b>3</b> is driven in such a way that the pointed filaments <b>5</b> achieve more than 1000 cleaning movements per minute, but preferably more than 5000 movements. In the case of manual cleaning, significantly fewer than 1000 movements are achieved during the entire cleaning process. For each movement, the tip <b>5</b><i>a </i>of a pointed bristle covers a distance d with respect to the stationary set of teeth (i.e. without overlaying a movement that may possibly be performed manually). In order not to subject the pointed filaments <b>5</b> to excessive loading under this high-frequency back and forth motion on the tooth surfaces and in particular when changing between tooth surface <b>1</b><i>a</i>, <b>1</b><i>b </i>and spaces between the teeth, the path d of the tips <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the filaments <b>5</b> is less than a predetermined maximum path d<sub>max</sub>, which is preferably 3 mm. These values correspond approximately to the size of large spaces <b>2</b> between the teeth, which can consequently be optimally cleaned without damaging the tips <b>5</b><i>a</i>. The control and restriction of the movements of the tips <b>5</b><i>a </i>has the effect of reducing the risk of injuries to the gums.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an advantageous development, the maximum path d<sub>max </sub>of the tips <b>5</b><i>a </i>depends on the direction of movement, the maximum path d<sub>max,long </sub>in the longitudinal direction L of the brush head <b>3</b> preferably being less than the maximum path d<sub>max,trans </sub>transversely thereto. The longitudinal direction L of the brush head <b>3</b> corresponds during use approximately to the direction x of the row of teeth in which the movements of the bristles are preferably to be restricted because of the tooth-to-tooth transition and the accompanying loading of the bristles. This makes allowance for the geometry of the set of teeth and allows a movement along the spaces <b>2</b> between the teeth, i.e. in the Y and Z directions, with a greater deflection than transversely thereto. With preference, d<sub>max,long </sub>is 3 mm (X direction) and d<sub>max,trans </sub>is 5 mm (Y, Z directions).</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref> and <b>5</b><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>show various examples of brush heads with a bristle arrangement of conventional bristles <b>6</b> and pointed filaments <b>5</b>. The bristles <b>5</b>, <b>6</b> are respectively arranged in clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032;, <b>6</b>&#x2032; on a bristle carrier <b>4</b>. The clusters <b>6</b>&#x2032; of conventional bristles <b>6</b> are symbolized by an empty circle and the clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032; of pointed filaments <b>5</b> are symbolized by a circle with a dot.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In the case of the brush head <b>3</b> represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the bristle carrier <b>4</b> is connected to the brush head <b>3</b> such that it can rotate back and forth about an axis of rotation D running perpendicularly to the bristle carrier <b>4</b>. For this purpose, a suitable drive is present (not represented here). During operation, a maximum angle of rotation &#x3b1; is achieved. The pointed filaments <b>5</b> are arranged on the bristle carrier in such a way that the following applies for the maximum distance r<sub>max</sub>, of their exit points on the bristle carrier from the axis of rotation D: r<sub>max</sub>=d<sub>max</sub>&#xb7;180&#xb0;:(&#x3c0;&#x3b1;), where d<sub>max </sub>is the maximum path mentioned at the beginning. By approximation (distance between the points of inflection instead of length of the arc), the following applies: r<sub>max</sub>=d<sub>max</sub>:(2 sin(&#x3b1;/2)). Preferably, d<sub>max</sub>=3 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Devices with angles of rotation of up to 70&#xb0; are currently on the market. The diameter of the brush head <b>3</b> is generally less than 20 mm. The movement of the tips <b>5</b><i>a </i>increases with the radius or the distance from the axis of rotation. The following table gives some values for the path, calculated in dependence on the angle of rotation and the radius. The figures for the path that are shown with a gray background belong to the pairs of radius/angle-of-rotation values that are permissible according to the invention for d<sub>max</sub>=3 mm (d<sub>max</sub>=distance between the points of inflection).</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The table shows that, in the case of small angles of rotation, in principle the entire brush head <b>3</b> can be provided with pointed filaments <b>5</b> and that, in the case of large angles of rotation, only a central segment <b>7</b> should be provided with pointed filaments <b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a brush head <b>3</b>, which is pivoted about its longitudinal axis L during operation, so that the brush head <b>3</b> performs a rocking sideward motion. The brush head <b>3</b> thereby passes over an angle &#x3b2;. The following applies for the maximum distance l<sub>max </sub>of the tips of the pointed filaments from the pivot axis L: l<sub>max</sub>=d<sub>max</sub>&#xb7;180&#xb0;:(&#x3c0;&#x3b2;) or l<sub>max</sub>=d<sub>max</sub>:(2 sin(&#x3b2;/2)) (distance between the points of inflection), where d<sub>max </sub>is the maximum path mentioned at the beginning.

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In connection with pointed filaments <b>5</b>, the rocking sideward motion is particularly appropriate. With this type of toothbrush, during use the pointed filaments <b>5</b> move along the interdental spaces <b>2</b>. The direction of movement that is less desired for the bristles and the gums is excluded for the pointed filaments <b>5</b>. In the case of this movement, the maximum path covered by the tips should likewise be less than 3 mm. The angle of rotation can consequently be fixed on the basis of the following table in dependence on the distance of the tips from the pivot axis. The figures for the path that are shown with a gray background belong to the pairs of distance/pivoting-angle values that are permissible according to the invention for d<sub>max</sub>=3 mm.

In the case of this variant of movement, the brush head geometry has less influence on the deflection of the conventional bristles <b>6</b> and pointed filaments <b>5</b>. The size of the deflection can be determined by choice of the electric current, motor and/or vibration generators. The direction of the deflection can be influenced by a special construction of the brush handle, for example stiffening in the vertical direction, and additional damping measures. Since the deflection of the brush head <b>3</b>, and with it the tips of the pointed filaments <b>5</b>, preferably follows the interdental spaces <b>2</b>, the toothbrush is preferably intended to have a greater lateral deflection in the direction S<b>1</b> than a vertical deflection in the direction S<b>2</b>. Deflections of less than 3 mm here also produce a very gentle action and stimulation of the gums.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>show brush heads <b>3</b> in the case of which a rotational movement is combined with other types of movement. If a mechanical movement, for example rotation, is performed with an electric toothbrush, vibration is also produced in any event. In the present examples, the bristle carrier <b>4</b> is of a multipart form. A round, first carrier element <b>4</b><i>a </i>is connected to the brush head <b>3</b> rotatably about the axis of rotation D (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). It is provided with conventional bristles <b>6</b>. At least one further carrier element <b>4</b><i>b </i>is firmly connected to the brush head <b>3</b> and provided with pointed filaments <b>5</b>. Under rotation of the part <b>4</b><i>a</i>, it is made to vibrate. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>, this further carrier element <b>4</b><i>b </i>is in front of and behind the rotating carrier element <b>4</b><i>a </i>in the longitudinal direction L; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>, it is only behind it and in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>c </i>it is only in front of it. The moved carrier element <b>4</b><i>a </i>with conventional bristles <b>6</b> undertakes the surface cleaning and the co-vibrating, only indirectly mechanically moved carrier element <b>4</b><i>b </i>with the pointed filaments <b>5</b> undertakes the interdental cleaning and the cleaning of very small structures. Instead of rotating the first carrier element <b>4</b><i>a</i>, it may also be pivoted about the longitudinal axis.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>show examples of the arrangement of the pointed filaments <b>5</b> on the bristle carrier <b>4</b>. The pointed filaments <b>5</b> are first grouped together in clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032;. In the present case, these are circular in cross section, but may also have some other shape, for example as represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>. In the case of the brush head <b>3</b> according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, the clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032; are grouped together in rows <b>9</b>, which run transversely to the longitudinal direction L. This arrangement is used with preference in the case of bristle carriers <b>4</b> which can pivot about the longitudinal axis L or vibrate in this direction, since the rows <b>9</b> coincide there with the running direction of the clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032;. In the case of the example from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, the bristle clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032; are arranged on arcs of a circle <b>10</b>. This arrangement is used with preference in the case of rotating bristle carriers <b>4</b>. There are two inner circles of bristle clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032; with pointed filaments <b>5</b>, the maximum radius of which is r<sub>max</sub>.

The mixed bristle arrangement has the advantage that the pointed filaments <b>5</b> have more freedom of movement and, in spite of bending on the tooth structures, cannot become jammed in one another during use. In principle, the pointed filaments <b>5</b> should be given more freedom of movement than the conventional bristles <b>6</b>. In particular at the outer limits, i.e. for arrangements in which the bristle tips cover approximately the maximum distance d<sub>max</sub>, such a mixture with conventional bristles is advantageous.</p>

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Instead of arranging bristle clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032; with a round cross section as described in groups (rows, circles, segments), bristle clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032; with a correspondingly adapted cross section may also be used (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref><i>a</i>-<i>e</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In order that the pointed filaments <b>5</b> can move freely and the interdental spaces <b>2</b> are not clogged, the individual clusters <b>8</b> are preferably spaced sufficiently apart from one another. Since, in the case of certain embodiments, the tips cover different distances in dependence on their location on the bristle carrier <b>4</b>, the minimum hole spacing x between neighboring clusters <b>8</b> is fixed in dependence on the path covered. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an example of a rotating bristle carrier <b>4</b>, of which only a centrally arranged pair of bristle clusters <b>8</b> and a peripherally arranged further pair of bristle clusters <b>8</b>&#x2032; are shown for the sake of overall clarity. The minimum spacings x<b>1</b> near the axis of rotation D are smaller than the minimum spacings x<b>2</b> further away from the axis of rotation D.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Since, in the case of certain embodiments it is only appropriate to arrange the pointed filaments at a suitable position on the surface of the brush head, other types of filaments can be used at the positions which are not suitable. Conventionally rounded-off bristles, which consist for example of polyester PBT or polyamide PA, may be used in particular for the surface cleaning of the tooth surface. If a massaging effect of the gums is additionally required, soft rubber-elastic elements in the form of bristles, lamellae or other formations of thermoplastic elastomer TPE may be additionally molded or inserted. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an example of a bristle carrier <b>4</b> with such a mixed bristle arrangement comprising pointed filaments <b>5</b> within a central area with a radius r<sub>max </sub>and peripherally arranged conventional bristle clusters <b>6</b>.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In order to achieve adequate flexibility of the filaments, their length from where they leave the brush head is chosen to be between 7 and 13 mm. In order to ensure adequate stability of the individual filaments under high-frequency motion, over 75% of the nominal diameter is left over a large part of the length. The table presented above shows that the pointing of the filaments predominantly takes place over the last 4 to 5 mm. With this configuration, the tip <b>5</b><i>a </i>can optimally reach the smallest fissures and interdental spaces <b>2</b> with adequate filament stability.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">For the pointed bristles, polyamide is preferably used, or else polyester (PBT). The pointing process is based on the reduction of the diameter by means of a chemical process. Depending on the length of time for which the bristle remains in the chemical substance, the plastic decomposes and the diameter is reduced. In this way, the shape of the point can be influenced.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>show examples of the shape of clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032; of pointed filaments <b>5</b>. Such a cluster <b>5</b>&#x2032; does not necessarily have to have a round shape. Substantially triangular (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a</i>), substantially rectangular (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>b</i>), elliptical (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>c</i>), arcuate (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>d</i>) or other shapes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>e</i>) come into consideration. The elongate shapes according to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>a</i>-<i>c </i>are appropriate in particular for pivotable toothbrushes and may be used instead for the arrangement of round bristle clusters in rows (cf. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, in which a mixed bristle arrangement of normal bristle clusters <b>6</b>&#x2032; with round cross section and clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032; of pointed filaments <b>5</b> with the shape represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>a </i>is shown). The shape shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref><i>d </i>is particularly advantageous for rotating toothbrushes.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b </i>show another embodiment of a mixed bristle arrangement of normal bristle clusters <b>6</b>&#x2032; with round cross section and clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032; of pointed filaments <b>5</b>. In this embodiment, a set of the clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032; is replaced by a pair of soft rubber-elastic elements <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The greatest extent e is preferably approximately 3 mm and consequently corresponds to a large interdental spacing. If too many filaments are grouped together in each cluster <b>5</b>&#x2032;, this can cause unnecessary stiffening of the individual filaments <b>5</b> and make penetration into the interdental spaces <b>2</b> more difficult. A cluster <b>5</b>&#x2032; therefore preferably contains fewer than 80, with particular preference fewer than 50, pointed tips <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the filaments <b>5</b>. In this case, depending on the production technique, each filament may have one or two pointed tips <b>5</b><i>a</i>. Certain filaments also have a round tip and a pointed tip <b>5</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>f+g </i>show examples of the height profile of the bristle clusters <b>5</b>&#x2032; from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref><i>d </i>and <b>11</b><i>e</i>, respectively. Such non-constant height profiles are realized with preference by the AFT or IMT method.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref><i>a</i>-<i>e </i>show brush heads <b>3</b> in side view, in the case of which the tips <b>5</b><i>a </i>of the pointed filaments <b>5</b> form different profiles. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref><i>a</i>-<i>d </i>relate to pivotable brush heads, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>e </i>to a rotating brush head.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">For fabrication reasons, the flat profile shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>a </i>can be produced most simply. In this case, just one basic filament length is used, adopting conventional punching technology. Approximately 80% of the filament ends are positioned within the height range &#x394;h of 4 mm in latitude. Different filament lengths within these limits are desired to a certain extent, since they consequently ensure easier interdental penetration than in the case of an exactly equal length, as is produced when cutting conventional bristles. Individual, prominently projecting filaments should be avoided, however, since they entail the risk of injuring the gums, in particular under high-frequency motion.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref><i>b </i>shows a brush head in the case of which a profile shape deviating from a plane is produced by means of conventional punching technology with two different basic lengths of the pointed bristles. Usually, both ends of the filaments are pointed. The latter are bent in a U-shaped manner to create bristles. For this reason, the pointed bristles cannot be cut, and with this technology there is a limitation to different planes, here planes E<b>1</b> and E<b>2</b>. Within the planes E<b>1</b>, E<b>2</b>, height variations are in turn possible within the height range &#x394;h of approximately 4 mm. There is greater freedom with filaments pointed at one end.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">If, for the reasons already mentioned, different filament types are combined, the pointed filaments <b>5</b> for the interdental cleaning are preferably longer than conventionally rounded-off bristles or massaging elements. The different types of bristles are preferably used in the bristle carrier in place of the other respective type or types of bristles. Alternatively, the bristle carriers <b>4</b> could be of a multipart form, separately provided with bristles and subsequently joined together.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">For the production of the brush heads <b>3</b> according to the invention, the AFT (Anchor Free Tufting) method or IMT (In Mold Tufting) method is appropriate in particular. The AFT method is described for example in EP-A 0 972 464. The IMT method is described for example in EP-A 0 795 711 and EP-A 0 346 646. Unlike in the case of conventional tufting, the pointed filaments <b>5</b> are in this case only pointed at one end when they are fed to the AFT or IMT machine. The length of the filaments is between 10 and 20 mm. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14</figref><i>a</i>, <b>14</b><i>b</i>, the filaments <b>5</b> are preferably inserted into the receiving tank <b>13</b> with the tips <b>5</b><i>a </i>downward. There is consequently no need for later reorientation within the AFT or IMT machine. The filaments <b>5</b> are pushed by the pushing means <b>17</b> on the pointed side <b>5</b><i>a </i>through the bristle carrier <b>4</b> (in the case of IMT through the transporting inserts) as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b</i>. For this purpose, as also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref><i>b</i>, the bristle carrier has clearances <b>14</b> for the bristles. The non-pointed side is cut and, as known, subsequently melted to form a melted end <b>15</b>. If the bristle carrier is not in one piece with the brush head, the two parts are subsequently connected to each other, preferably by means of ultrasonic welding. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15</figref><i>a</i>, <b>15</b><i>b </i>further show a support <b>19</b> for the pushing means <b>17</b>, a guidance plate <b>21</b>, a carrier means <b>23</b> and a filament guidance <b>25</b> of an AFT machine as disclosed in EP 0 972 464.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The AFT or IMT method makes simplified production of the pointed filaments possible, since they only have to be pointed at one end. Furthermore, by corresponding configuration of the pushing means, the individual clusters are profiled, for example for better interdental penetration. Examples of this are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref><i>c</i>-<i>e </i>and also in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref><i>f+g </i>(profiling of the individual clusters). This is not possible with the conventional tufting technology. Since the filaments are cut after the profiling, only one filament length has to be provided. The bristles can be cut to the desired length. By contrast with this, in the case of conventional tufting technology, a number of material lengths have to be used to create a topology other than that of a plane.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The AFT and IMT methods consequently have great advantages for the production of the toothbrushes according to the invention, since a largely unrestricted shape of the bristle clusters is made possible. This allows the path covered by the tips during use to be controlled particularly well. The production method can also be advantageously used for the production of manual toothbrushes.</p>
