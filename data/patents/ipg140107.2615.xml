No. 8,247,856, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0025979, filed on Mar. 26, 2009, the disclosures of which are each hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entireties.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Example embodiments relate to a semiconductor device and to a method of manufacturing the semiconductor device. More particularly, example embodiments relate to a semiconductor device including a transistor having a vertical channel region and a capacitor connected to the vertical channel region, and to a method of manufacturing the same.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, as semiconductor devices have become more highly integrated, a transistor structure including a vertical channel region having a small horizontal area where a source/drain region is formed in a vertical direction relative to a substrate has been researched. An impurity region of the vertical channel transistor is electrically connected to a wiring or a capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">On the other hand, the vertical channel transistors and other type transistors such as a planar type transistor may be formed together in the substrate. However, it may be difficult to form the different type transistors together in the substrate. In particular, because there may exist a height difference between a surface of the substrate where the vertical channel transistors are formed and a surface of the substrate where the planar type transistors are formed, it may be difficult to increase the height of the capacitor substantially that is connected to the vertical channel transistor and consequently it may also be difficult to ensure a required high capacitance of the capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, there is a need in the art for a semiconductor device including a capacitor that is connected to a vertical channel transistor, wherein the capacitor has an improved high capacitance and for a method of manufacturing the same.</p>

Thus, example embodiments should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing. For example, an implanted region illustrated as a rectangle will, typically, have rounded or curved features and/or a gradient of implant concentration at its edges rather than a binary change from implanted to non-implanted region. Likewise, a buried region formed by implantation may result in some implantation in the region between the buried region and the surface through which the implantation takes place.

Hereinafter, the active region of the first region (CA) is referred to as a first active region and the active region of the second region (PA) is referred to as a second active region.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an example embodiment, the first active region may have, for example, a linear shape extending in a first direction. An impurity region is provided under an upper surface of the substrate in the first active region.

Alternatively, the upper surfaces of the pillars <b>110</b> may be higher or lower than the upper surface of the substrate <b>100</b> in the second region (PA).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An insulation layer pattern <b>128</b> is provided to cover the surface of the substrate <b>100</b> in the first region (CA) and to surround lower sidewalls of the pillars <b>110</b>.

An insulation interlayer <b>140</b> is provided to fill gaps between the first gate electrodes <b>132</b> and between the silicon pillars <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Accordingly, vertical pillar transistors are provided in the pillars <b>110</b> in the first region (CA) of the substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">On the other hand, planar type transistors are provided on the upper surface of the substrate <b>100</b> in the second region (PA). The planar type transistor includes a second gate structure <b>150</b> having a second gate insulation layer pattern <b>144</b>, a second gate electrode <b>146</b>, a mask pattern <b>148</b> stacked on the surface of the substrate <b>100</b> in the second region (PA), and a source/drain <b>154</b> under the surface of the substrate <b>100</b> in both sides of the second gate structure <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Upper insulation interlayer pattern <b>160</b> is formed on the first region (CA) and the second region (PA) in the substrate <b>100</b>. In an example embodiment, the upper insulation interlayer pattern <b>160</b> covers the planar type transistors in the second region (PA) and exposes the upper surfaces of the pillars <b>110</b> in the first region (CA). That is, the upper insulation interlayer pattern <b>160</b> has an opening that exposes the upper surfaces of the pillars <b>110</b> in the first region (CA). An upper surface <b>170</b><i>a </i>of the upper insulation interlayer pattern <b>160</b> in the second region (PA) may be higher than the upper surface of the pillar <b>110</b> in the first region (CA) of the substrate <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A first wiring <b>162</b> is provided to penetrate the upper insulation interlayer pattern <b>160</b> to be electrically connected to an end portion of the first gate electrode <b>132</b> of the vertical pillar transistor.

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In an example embodiment, a capacitor may be provided to be electrically connected to the upper surface of the pillar <b>110</b> in the first region. The capacitor may include a lower electrode <b>192</b>, a dielectric layer <b>194</b> on the lower electrode <b>192</b> and an upper electrode <b>196</b> on the dielectric layer <b>194</b>.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The upper insulation interlayer pattern <b>160</b> exposes the upper surfaces of the pillars <b>110</b> in the first region (CA). Accordingly, the lower electrode <b>192</b> of the capacitor <b>190</b> directly contacts the impurity region <b>134</b> in the upper portion of the pillar <b>110</b>. As the upper surfaces of the pillars <b>110</b> are exposed by the upper insulation interlayer pattern <b>160</b>, the entire outer surface including an outer lower surface of the lower electrode <b>192</b> is exposed. Because the dielectric layer <b>194</b> is formed on the entire outer surface of the exposed lower electrode <b>192</b>, a node height of the capacitor <b>190</b> is increased, to thereby improve the capacitance of a resultant capacitor.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Thus, a DRAM cell including the vertical pillar transistor and the capacitor <b>190</b> electrically connected to the impurity region <b>134</b> of the vertical pillar transistor is provided in the first region (CA) of the substrate <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The upper surface of the impurity region <b>134</b> of the vertical pillar transistor in the first region (CA) is lower than the upper surface <b>170</b><i>a </i>of the upper insulation layer pattern <b>160</b> covering the planar type transistors in the second region (PA). Accordingly, the entire outer surface of the lower electrode <b>192</b> connected to the impurity region <b>134</b> is exposed and the dielectric layer <b>194</b> is formed on substantially the entire or the entire outer surface including the outer lower surface of the lower electrode <b>192</b>, to increase the height of the capacitor <b>190</b> substantially and provide an improved capacitance.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 13</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating a method of manufacturing a semiconductor device in accordance with an example embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a substrate <b>100</b> having a first region (CA) and a second region (PA) is prepared. The substrate <b>100</b> may be a semiconductor substrate such as, for example, a silicon substrate or a germanium substrate, a SOI (silicon-on-insulator) substrate, a GOI (germanium-on-insulator) substrate, etc. The first region (CA) of the substrate <b>100</b> may include a cell region where memory cells are formed and the second region (PA) may include a peripheral region where logic cells are formed.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">A pad oxide layer and a first mask layer are sequentially formed on the substrate <b>100</b>. For example, the pad oxide layer may be formed using silicon oxide by a thermal oxidation process or a chemical vapor deposition process. The first mask layer may be formed, for example, using silicon nitride or silicon oxynitride by a chemical vapor deposition process.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">A first photoresist pattern is formed on the first mask layer. The first mask layer is patterned using the first photoresist pattern as an etching mask to form a first mask pattern <b>104</b><i>a </i>in the first region (CA) on the substrate and a second mask pattern <b>104</b><i>b </i>in the second region (PA) on the substrate <b>100</b>. The first photoresist pattern is removed from the substrate <b>100</b> by, for example, ashing and strip processes.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In an example embodiment, the first mask pattern <b>104</b><i>a </i>may have, for example, a cross-sectional shape of a circle or a polygon. The second mask pattern <b>104</b><i>b </i>may have, for example, a bar shape extending in a first direction.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The pad oxide layer and the substrate <b>100</b> are partially etched using the first and second mask patterns <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>as etching masks to form a first pad oxide layer pattern <b>102</b><i>a </i>and a first upper pattern or vertical pillar <b>110</b> in the first region (CA) and to form a second pad oxide layer pattern <b>102</b><i>b </i>and a second upper pattern <b>109</b> in the second region (PA).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As a portion of the substrate <b>100</b> in the second region (PA) is etched using the second mask pattern <b>104</b><i>b </i>to form the second upper pattern <b>109</b>, a second isolation trench <b>108</b> is formed in the second region (PA) of the substrate <b>100</b> to define the second upper pattern <b>109</b>. By forming the second isolation trench <b>108</b>, the second region (PA) of the substrate <b>100</b> is divided into an active region and an isolation region. Accordingly, a second active structure including the second upper pattern <b>109</b> defined by the second isolation trench <b>108</b> is formed in the second region (PA).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">For example, the first and second upper patterns <b>110</b> and <b>109</b> may be formed by an anisotropic etch process. In an example embodiment, the first upper pattern <b>110</b> may have, for example, a shape of cylinder or a polygonal pillar corresponding to the cross-sectional shape of the first mask pattern <b>104</b><i>a</i>. The second upper pattern <b>109</b> may have, for example, a bar shape extending in a direction parallel with the first direction corresponding to the cross-sectional shape of the second mask pattern <b>104</b><i>b</i>. The second upper pattern <b>109</b> may have a width substantially greater than that of the first upper pattern <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, impurities are implanted into the first region (CA) of the substrate <b>100</b> adjacent to the first upper pattern <b>110</b> to form a preliminary impurity region <b>112</b>. The preliminary impurity region <b>112</b> may include P-type or N-type impurities. For example, the preliminary impurity region <b>112</b> may include P-type impurities such as boron (B) and indium (In) or N-type impurities such as phosphorous (P) and arsenic (As).</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Then, a third mask pattern <b>114</b> is formed on sidewalls of the first mask pattern <b>104</b> and the first upper pattern <b>110</b>. The third mask pattern <b>114</b> may have, for example, a bar shape extending in a direction substantially parallel with the first direction and surrounding the first upper pattern <b>110</b>. For example, the third mask pattern <b>114</b> may be formed using nitride such as silicon nitride or oxynitride such as silicon oxynitride.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">In an example embodiment, after a third mask layer is formed along a profile of the first mask pattern <b>104</b><i>a </i>and the first upper pattern <b>110</b>, the third mask layer may be etched by, for example, an anisotropic etch process to form the third mask pattern <b>114</b> surrounding the first upper pattern <b>110</b>. At this time, a fourth mask pattern may be formed to surround the second upper pattern <b>109</b>, but the process for forming the fourth mask pattern may be omitted for simplicity. In this case, a fourth mask layer is formed on the second region (PA) of the substrate <b>100</b> to cover the entire second region (PA) of the substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a portion of the substrate <b>100</b> in the first region (CA) is etched using the first and third mask patterns <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>114</b> as an etching mask to form a first isolation trench <b>120</b> in the first region (CA) of the substrate <b>100</b>. In an example embodiment, the portion of the substrate <b>100</b> in the first region (CA) may be removed by, for example, an anisotropic etch process. In this case, the substrate <b>100</b> in the second region (PA) covered by the second mask pattern <b>104</b><i>b </i>and the fourth mask layer may be not removed by the anisotropic etch process.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Accordingly, the preliminary impurity region <b>112</b> is partially removed to form a buried bit line <b>112</b><i>a</i>. The buried bit lines <b>112</b><i>a </i>may be spaced apart from one another by the first isolation trench <b>120</b> interposed between the buried bit lines <b>112</b><i>a</i>. By forming the first isolation trench <b>120</b>, the first region (CA) of the substrate <b>100</b> is divided into an active region and an isolation region.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Accordingly, a first active structure including a first lower pattern <b>122</b> and the first upper pattern <b>110</b> on the first lower pattern <b>122</b> is formed in the first region (CA). The first lower pattern <b>122</b> is defined by the first isolation trench <b>120</b>. The first lower pattern <b>122</b> may extend in a direction substantially parallel with the first direction in the first region (CA) of the substrate <b>100</b> corresponding to the shape of the third mask pattern <b>114</b>. The first lower pattern <b>122</b> may have a width substantially greater than that of the first upper pattern <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Then, the fourth mask layer is removed from the second region (PA). For example, the fourth mask layer may be removed by a wet etch process to prevent the surface damage of the substrate <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In an example embodiment, after the first upper pattern, that is, a vertical pillar <b>110</b> is formed on the substrate <b>100</b> in the first region (CA), the first isolation trench <b>120</b> and the buried bit line <b>112</b><i>a </i>may be formed in the first region (CA).</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Alternatively, after the isolation layer pattern and the buried bit line are formed in the substrate, the single crystal of the substrate <b>100</b> may be grown using the substrate <b>100</b> as a seed to form a single-crystalline silicon pillar. In this case, the single-crystalline silicon pillar may be formed by, for example, a selective epitaxial growth process, a laser-induced epitaxial growth process, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, an insulation layer is formed to cover the first and second mask patterns <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>and the first and second active structures. The insulation layer fills up the first isolation trench <b>120</b>, a gap between the pillars <b>110</b> in the first region (CA) and the second isolation trench <b>108</b>. Then, the insulation layer is planarized until upper surfaces of the first and second mask patterns <b>104</b><i>a </i>and <b>104</b><i>b </i>are exposed.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The insulation layer may be formed using, for example, silicon oxide having beneficial gap-fill characteristics. The insulation layer is formed to sufficiently fill between the adjacent first active structures in the first region (CA) and between the adjacent second active structures in the second region (PA).</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Accordingly, a first isolation layer pattern <b>124</b><i>a </i>and a second isolation layer pattern <b>124</b><i>b </i>are formed in the first isolation trench <b>120</b> and the second isolation trench <b>109</b>, respectively. A first insulation layer pattern <b>124</b><i>c </i>is formed between the adjacent pillars <b>110</b> in the first region (CA).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a second photoresist pattern <b>126</b> is formed on the second isolation layer pattern <b>124</b><i>b </i>and the second mask pattern <b>104</b><i>b</i>.

<p id="p-0084" num="0083">An upper portion of the first insulation layer pattern <b>124</b><i>c </i>is etched using the second photoresist pattern <b>126</b> as an etching mask to form a second insulation layer pattern <b>128</b> on the substrate <b>100</b> of the first region (CA). For example, the first insulation layer pattern <b>124</b><i>c </i>may be etched by a wet etch process.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Accordingly, as the portion of the first insulation layer pattern <b>124</b><i>c </i>is etched, a sidewall of the first upper pattern, that is, the vertical pillar <b>110</b> is exposed. The second insulation layer pattern <b>128</b> surrounds a lower sidewall of the pillar <b>110</b>. The pillar <b>110</b> penetrates the second insulation layer pattern <b>128</b> such that an upper portion of the pillar protrudes from the second insulation layer pattern <b>124</b><i>c</i>. Thus, the second insulation layer pattern <b>128</b> may insulate the substrate <b>100</b> of the first region (CA) from a gate electrode of a vertical pillar transistor to be formed by a following process.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Then, the second photoresist pattern <b>126</b> may be removed by, for example, ashing and strip processes.</p>

<p id="p-0088" num="0087">A preliminary conductive layer for a gate electrode is formed on the second insulation layer pattern <b>128</b> and on the first gate insulation layer <b>130</b>.

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Then, after the preliminary conductive layer for a gate electrode is planarized, an upper portion of the preliminary conductive layer for a gate electrode is partially etched such that the thickness of the preliminary conductive layer for a gate electrode is decreased to expose the upper portion of the pillar <b>110</b>.

Thus, a conductive layer for a gate electrode is formed in the first region (CA). The upper surface height of the conductive layer may be lower than the upper surface height of the substrate <b>100</b> in the second region (PA).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Then, the conductive layer for a gate electrode is patterned to form a first gate electrode <b>132</b>.

<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, a mold layer is formed on the etch stop layer <b>172</b>. The mold layer may be used to form a lower electrode of a capacitor that contacts the upper surface of the pillar <b>110</b>.

<p id="p-0108" num="0107">The height of the lower electrode depends on a thickness of the mold layer. Accordingly, it may be understood that the thickness of the mold layer may be determined to meet a required capacitance of a resultant capacitor.</p>

Then, the mold layer pattern <b>180</b> is removed from the first region (CA) of the substrate <b>100</b>.

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">Accordingly, as the mold layer pattern <b>180</b> is removed from the first region (CA) of the substrate <b>100</b>, the entire outer surface including an outer lower surface of the lower electrode <b>192</b> is exposed.

<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As mentioned above, a semiconductor device includes a vertical pillar transistor in a first region of a substrate and a planar type transistor in a second region of the substrate. The vertical transistor has a pillar in a first region of a substrate and an impurity region in an upper portion of the pillar. An insulation interlayer pattern is formed on the first and second regions to cover the planar type transistor in the second region and expose an upper surface of the pillar in the first region. The upper insulation interlayer pattern has an upper surface substantially higher than the upper surface of the pillar.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">A lower electrode directly contacts the impurity region in the exposed pillar, and a dielectric layer is formed on the entire outer surface of the lower electrode.
