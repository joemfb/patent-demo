<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a manufacturing method for a thermal head.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">There have been conventionally known a thermal head which is used in a thermal printer often equipped in a compact information terminal typified by a compact hand-held terminal, and which is used to perform printing on a thermal recording medium based on printing data with the aid of selective driving of a plurality of heating elements (for example, see JP 2007-83532 A).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As to increasing efficiency of the thermal head, there is known a method of forming a heat insulating layer in a lower layer of a heating portion of a heating resistor. When the heat insulating layer is formed in the lower layer of the heating portion, among an amount of heat generated in the heating resistor, an amount of upper-transferred heat which is transferred to a wear-resistant layer formed above the heating portion becomes larger than an amount of lower-transferred heat which is transferred to an insulating substrate located under the heating portion, and thus energy efficiency required during printing can be sufficiently obtained. In the thermal head described in JP 2007-83532 A, owing to a substrate including a concave portion, a hollow portion is formed below a heating portion of a heating resistor, and the hollow portion is caused to function as a void heat insulating layer. That is, heat transfer in a thickness direction of the substrate is prevented by means of the hollow portion, and accordingly, sufficient heat storage performance is obtained. It should be noted that the substrate for forming the hollow portion is formed by employing a fusion method in which a glass substrate including a concave portion and a flat glass substrate are bonded to each other at a temperature of about 500&#xb0; C. or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, glass has a property of shrinking in a heat cycle, and thus a position of the concave portion (void heat insulating layer) formed on the glass substrate varies between before and after the bonding. In addition, a heat shrinkage percentage of glass varies depending on a composition of the glass substrate or conditions (for example, temperature, heating time, and the like) of the heat cycle. For this reason, when a thin-film-like heating resistor is formed in the heating element forming step, a pattern misalignment (position misalignment) occurs between the concave portion and the heating portion of the heating element due to heat shrinkage occurring in the bonding step, leading to inconvenience that the heating portion cannot be accommodated in the concave portion of the substrate. The pattern misalignment as described above reduces a heat insulating effect of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further, when a large number of thermal heads are collectively manufactured on a large substrate, an effect of the pattern misalignment due to the heat shrinkage percentage becomes particularly serious in accordance with a position of the thermal head. This leads to a decrease in yield to obtain a thermal head having high energy efficiency. The effect of the heat shrinkage on the substrate may be reduced, in some cases, by using a photo mask which is manufactured by taking the heat shrinkage percentage into consideration. However, there are variations in heat shrinkage percentage, and hence it is difficult to deal with the pattern misalignment due to the heat shrinkage only by correction using a correction mask.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been made in view of the above-mentioned problems, and therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a manufacturing method for a thermal head, which is capable of preventing a pattern misalignment between a void heat insulating layer and a heating portion, and improving a yield to obtain a thermal head having high energy efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In order to achieve the above-mentioned object, the present invention provides the following means.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention provides a manufacturing method for a thermal head, including: a concave portion forming step of forming a plurality of concave portions on a surface of a substrate; a bonding step of thermally fusion bonding an insulating substrate to the surface of the substrate including the plurality of concave portions formed thereon in the concave portion forming step; and a heating resistor forming step of forming a plurality of heating resistors on the insulating substrate so as to be opposed to the plurality of concave portions, in which the concave portion forming step includes setting any one of the plurality of concave portions as a reference, and setting sizes of the plurality of concave portions other than the any one of the plurality of concave portions so as to become larger as a distance from the any one thereof increases.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the present invention, through the bonding step, the concave portions of the substrate, which are formed in the concave portion forming step, are covered with the insulating substrate, whereby a hollow portion is formed between the substrate and the insulating substrate. The hollow portion functions as a void heat insulating layer, and heat generated in the heating portions of the heating resistors is prevented from being conducted to the substrate through the insulating substrate, with the result that the thermal head having high energy efficiency can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Here, the substrate and the insulating substrate are bonded to each other through thermal fusion in the bonding step, and thus the substrate exposed to high temperature undergoes thermal shrinkage after the bonding. For this reason, positions of the concave portions formed on the surface of the substrate vary between before and after the bonding. For example, when any one of the concave portions formed on the substrate is set as a reference (hereinafter, the concave portion serving as the reference is referred to as a &#x201c;reference concave portion&#x201d;), the positions of the concave portions are more likely to vary due to an effect of the thermal shrinkage as the distance from the reference concave portion increases.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the present invention, the sizes of the concave portions other than the reference concave portion are made to increase along with an increase in distance from the reference concave portion. Accordingly, even when the thermal shrinkage occurs, only by, for example, aligning a photo mask for forming the heating resistors and the substrate with each other in accordance with the reference concave portion in the heating resistor forming step, it becomes possible to limit formation positions of the heating resistors formed on the photo mask in advance to ranges of the concave portions of the substrate after the thermal shrinkage. Therefore, the heating resistors can be formed so that portions serving as the heating portions of the heating resistors are opposed to the concave portions of the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In addition, the sizes of the concave portions are changed in accordance with the distance from the reference concave portion, and thus, compared with the case where sizes of all the concave portions are increased, a bonding area between the substrate and the insulating substrate is increased to assure a mechanical strength of the insulating substrate. Accordingly, a larger number of thermal heads which have high mechanical strength and reliability can be obtained. Therefore, the yield to obtain thermal heads having high energy efficiency can be improved in the collective substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the above-mentioned invention: the plurality of concave portions may each have a rectangular shape; lengths of the plurality of concave portions other than the any one of the plurality of concave portions may become larger as a distance from the any one thereof in a length direction increases; and widths of the plurality of concave portions other than the any one of the plurality of concave portions may become larger as a distance from the any one thereof in a width direction increases.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">With the structure as described above, by increasing sizes of the concave portions having the rectangular shape in a direction in which the concave portions are apart from the reference concave portion, that is, in the direction in which the positions thereof vary considerably due to an effect of the thermal shrinkage, the heating portions of the heating resistors can be efficiently accommodated in the concave portions after the bonding without unnecessarily increasing the concave portions.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Still further, in the above-mentioned invention, the manufacturing method may further include a mark forming step of forming, on the substrate, a mark indicating the any one of the plurality of concave portions that serves as the reference.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">With the structure as described above, in the heating resistor forming step, alignment between the photo mask and the substrate can be easily and accurately performed with reference to the mark formed on the substrate, for example, with the reference concave portion as the reference.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">According to the present invention, an effect is achieved whereby the pattern misalignment between the void heat insulating layer and the heating portion is prevented, thereby improving the yield to obtain a thermal head having high energy efficiency.</p>

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The manufacturing method A for a thermal head according to this embodiment is a method for manufacturing, for example, a thermal head <b>1</b> used in a thermal printer or the like, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Note that, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an arrow Y represents a transport direction of an object-to-be-printed (for example, thermal recording paper).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The thermal head <b>1</b> is a plate-like member, and includes a rectangular substrate <b>3</b>, an insulating film (insulating substrate) <b>5</b> which is formed on the substrate <b>3</b> and serves as an undercoat layer, a plurality of heating resistors <b>7</b> which are formed on the insulating film <b>5</b> and serve as a heating element, an electrode portion <b>17</b>, <b>19</b> which is connected to the heating resistors <b>7</b> and serve as wiring, and a protective film <b>11</b> for covering top surfaces of the heating resistors <b>7</b> and the electrode portion <b>17</b>, <b>19</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The substrate <b>3</b> is, for example, a glass substrate having a thickness of about 300 &#x3bc;m to 1 mm. A rectangular concave portion <b>13</b> extending in a longitudinal direction of the substrate <b>3</b> is formed on a surface (upper end surface) of the substrate <b>3</b>. Note that a length in a longitudinal direction and a width in a width direction of the concave portion <b>13</b> are denoted by a length L and a width W, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As the insulating film <b>5</b>, for example, flat sheet glass having a thickness of 5 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m is used.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Between the substrate <b>3</b> and the insulating film <b>5</b>, a hollow portion (hereinafter, the hollow portion is referred to as a &#x201c;void heat insulating layer&#x201d;) <b>15</b> is formed in a region in which the concave portion <b>13</b> is covered with the insulating film <b>5</b>. The void heat insulating layer <b>15</b> functions as a heat insulating layer for preventing an influx of heat from the insulating film <b>5</b> to the substrate <b>3</b> and has a communicating structure so as to be opposed to all the heating resistors <b>7</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The heating resistors <b>7</b> are each provided so as to straddle the concave portion <b>13</b> in its width direction on an upper end surface of the insulating film <b>5</b>, and are arranged at predetermined intervals in the longitudinal direction of the concave portion <b>13</b>. In other words, each of the heating resistors <b>7</b> is provided to be opposed to the void heat insulating layer <b>15</b> with the insulating film <b>5</b> being sandwiched therebetween so as to be located substantially directly above the void heat insulating layer <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The electrode portion <b>17</b>, <b>19</b> is formed of a common electrode <b>17</b> connected to one end of the respective heating resistors <b>7</b> in a direction orthogonal to an arrangement direction thereof and individual electrodes <b>19</b> each connected to another end of each of the heating resistors <b>7</b>, respectively. The common electrode <b>17</b> is integrally connected to all the heating resistors <b>7</b>. Note that a portion in which the heating resistor <b>7</b> actually generates heat (hereinafter, the heating portion is referred to as a &#x201c;heating portion <b>7</b>A&#x201d;) is a portion in which the heating resistor <b>7</b> does not overlap the electrode portion <b>17</b>, <b>19</b>, that is, a region located between a connection surface of the common electrode <b>17</b> and a connection surface of the individual electrode <b>19</b> of the heating resistor <b>7</b>, which is a portion located substantially directly above the void heat insulating layer <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Hereinafter, the manufacturing method A for the thermal head thus manufactured (hereinafter, simply referred to as &#x201c;manufacturing method A&#x201d;) is described.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The manufacturing method A according to this embodiment is, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, intended to form a large number of thermal heads <b>1</b> on the large substrate <b>3</b>, that is, a collective substrate (substrate) <b>300</b>A. The manufacturing method A includes a concave portion forming step of forming a plurality of concave portions <b>13</b> on a surface of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A having a rectangular shape, a bonding step of thermally fusion bonding the insulating film <b>5</b> on the surface of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A on which the plurality of concave portions <b>13</b> are formed in the concave portion forming step, and a heating resistor forming step of forming a plurality of heating resistors <b>7</b> on the insulating film <b>5</b> so as to be opposed to the respective concave portions <b>13</b>. Note that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a state in which a photo mask is aligned with the collective substrate <b>300</b>A in the heating resistor forming step.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">First, the collective substrate <b>300</b>A is distributed at the same intervals in its longitudinal direction, and a region is divided for each of the plurality of thermal heads <b>1</b>. The region of each thermal head <b>1</b> is a rectangular region which has sides in a width direction of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A, which are represented by a long side C, and the collective substrate <b>300</b>A is distributed so that short sides A and the long sides C are respectively equal among all regions of the thermal heads <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">For example, it is assumed here that a length in the longitudinal direction and a width in the width direction of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A are a length D and a width C, respectively, and a length in a longitudinal direction and a width in a width direction of the region of the thermal head <b>1</b> are a length C and a width A, respectively. Then, when a substrate which has a size of 100 mm&#xd7;60 mm as a size of (the length D)&#xd7;(the width C) is used as the collective substrate <b>300</b>A, a size of (the width A)&#xd7;(the length C) of the thermal head <b>1</b> is about 5 mm&#xd7;60 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the concave portion forming step, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the concave portion <b>13</b> is processed in a region on an upper end surface of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A, in which the heating resistor <b>7</b> is formed, and an alignment mark <b>21</b> (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;mark&#x201d;, see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) indicating one concave portion <b>13</b>A (reference concave portion) used as a reference is processed as well. Note that as the alignment mark <b>21</b>, for example, grooves may be formed in the vicinity of both ends of the reference concave portion <b>13</b>A in its longitudinal direction.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Specifically, the concave portion <b>13</b> and the alignment mark <b>21</b> are formed by, for example, sandblasting, dry etching, wet etching, or laser processing on one surface of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">For example, in the case of sandblasting, the surface of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A is covered with a photoresist material (not shown), and the photoresist material is exposed to light using a photo mask (not shown) having a predetermined pattern, thereby solidifying a portion other than a region in which the concave portions <b>13</b> are to be formed. Then, the surface of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A is washed, and the photoresist material which has not been solidified is removed, thereby obtaining an etching mask (not shown) including etching windows formed in the region in which the concave portions <b>13</b> are to be formed. The surface of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A is subjected to sandblasting in this state, and thus the concave portion <b>13</b> having a predetermined depth is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Alternatively, in the case where processing is performed through etching such as dry etching or wet etching, the etching mask including the etching windows formed in the region in which the concave portions <b>13</b> are to be formed is formed on the surface of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A in the same manner as that of the processing by sandblasting. The surface of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A is subjected to etching in this state, whereby the concave portion <b>13</b> having the predetermined depth is obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the case of etching, for example, wet etching using an etching liquid such as a fluorine etching solution, or dry etching such as reactive ion etching (RIE) or plasma etching is employed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Here, the collective substrate <b>300</b>A and the insulating substrate <b>5</b> are bonded to each other by thermal fusion in the following bonding step, whereby the collective substrate <b>300</b>A which has been exposed to high temperature undergoes heat shrinkage after the bonding. As a result, positions of the respective concave portions <b>13</b> formed on the surface of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A vary between before and after the bonding. For example, as the concave portion <b>13</b> is located further apart from the reference concave portion <b>13</b>, the position thereof is more likely to vary due to an effect of the thermal shrinkage.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">For that reason, in the concave portion forming step, a size of the concave portion <b>13</b> is determined in consideration of the thermal shrinkage of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A and its variations. A shrinkage percentage of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A after the bonding is experimentally, for example, set as 99.8%. Further, variations in shrinkage percentage are about &#xb1;0.05%.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In this embodiment, a region of the thermal head <b>1</b> arranged at one end of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is set as a region of a reference thermal head <b>1</b>A, and the concave portion <b>13</b> formed in the region of the reference thermal head <b>1</b>A is set as the reference concave portion <b>13</b>A. In addition, sizes of other concave portions <b>13</b> are formed so as to increase in proportion to an increase in distance from the reference concave portion <b>13</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Specifically, when it is assumed that a width of the reference concave portion <b>13</b>A is a width W<b>1</b>, and that widths of the concave portions <b>13</b> in regions of the other thermal heads <b>1</b> are widths W<b>2</b>, W<b>3</b> . . . Wn in a direction in which the thermal head <b>1</b> is located further from the region of the reference thermal head <b>1</b>A, setting is made so that a relationship of W<b>1</b>&#x2266;W<b>2</b>&#x2266; . . . &#x2266;Wn is satisfied among the widths of the respective concave portions <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">For example, when the width W<b>1</b> of the reference concave portion <b>13</b>A is assumed to be about 160 &#x3bc;m, the width Wn of the concave portion <b>13</b> located in the furthest position from the reference thermal head <b>1</b>A is about 300 &#x3bc;m. Note that the length L of each concave portion <b>13</b> is about 50 mm. Moreover, intervals B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b> . . . Bn&#x2212;1 of center lines between the concave portions <b>13</b> in the regions of the adjacent thermal heads <b>1</b> are formed so as to be equal to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The size of the width W is changed among the concave portions <b>13</b> in this manner, and hence, it is possible to eliminate position misalignment between a formation position of the heating resistor of a photo mask (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) which is used in the heating resistor forming step and the concave portion <b>13</b> even when the thermal shrinkage occurs in the collective substrate <b>300</b>A. In particular, it is possible to deal with the cases in which the percentage of thermal shrinkage of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A becomes smaller and larger than an estimated percentage of thermal shrinkage owing to irregularities in percentage of thermal shrinkage of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A. Note that the sizes of other concave portions <b>13</b> may be set so as to be larger in proportion to a distance from the reference concave portion <b>13</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, in the bonding step, an etching mask is all removed from the surface of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>), and then sheet glass is bonded to the surface thereof, whereby the insulating film <b>5</b> is obtained as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>. In the state in which the insulating film <b>5</b> is formed on the surface of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A, the concave portions <b>13</b> and the grooves of the alignment mark <b>21</b> are covered with the insulating film <b>5</b>, with the result that the void heat insulating layer <b>15</b> and the alignment mark <b>21</b> are formed between the substrate <b>300</b>A and the insulating film <b>5</b>. In this case, a depth of the concave portion <b>13</b> is equal to a thickness of the void heat insulating layer <b>15</b>, which is easily controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The substrate <b>3</b> and the insulating film <b>5</b> which are glass substrates are bonded to each other through thermal fusion in which an adhesion layer is not used. The bonding process is performed at temperature equal to or higher than a glass transition point and equal to or lower than a softening point of the glass substrates. For this reason, shape accuracy of the substrate <b>3</b> and the insulating film <b>5</b> can be maintained, which provides high reliability. Further, an interlayer made of metal or the like which has a larger thermal conductivity than glass is not used in a bonding portion between the substrate <b>3</b> and the insulating film <b>5</b>, whereby a laminated glass substrate which has a high heat insulating effect and a simple structure can be obtained. In addition, the substrate <b>3</b> and the insulating film <b>5</b> which have the same composition are bonded to each other, whereby warp of the substrate <b>3</b> and the insulating film <b>5</b>, which results from a difference in thermal expansion coefficient therebetween, can be ignored in the bonding step.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Note that, as the sheet glass used for the insulating film <b>5</b>, sheet glass having a thickness of about 10 &#x3bc;m is difficult to be manufactured or handled and also is expensive. Therefore, in place of bonding the thin sheet glass as described above directly to the substrate <b>3</b>, sheet glass having a thickness to be easily manufactured or handled may be bonded to the substrate <b>3</b>, and thereafter, the sheet glass may be processed so as to have a desired thickness through etching, polishing, or the like. Accordingly, the ultra-thin insulating film <b>5</b> can be easily formed on one surface of the substrate <b>3</b> at low cost.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When the insulating film <b>5</b>, that is, the sheet glass is etched, various types of etching which are employed in the concave portion forming step can be employed. Alternatively, when the sheet glass is polished, for example, chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) used in high precision polishing for a semiconductor wafer or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5C to 5E</figref>, the heating resistor <b>7</b>, the common electrode <b>17</b>, the individual electrode <b>19</b>, and the protective film <b>11</b> are sequentially formed on the insulating film <b>5</b>. The heating resistor <b>7</b>, the common electrode <b>17</b>, the individual electrode <b>19</b>, and the protective film <b>11</b> can be manufactured by using a conventionally-known manufacturing method for a conventional thermal head.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Specifically, in the heating resistor forming step, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5C</figref>, a thin film formation method such as sputtering, chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and vapor deposition is used to form a thin film made of a Ta-based or silicide-based heating resistor material on the insulating film <b>5</b>. Then, the thin film made of the heating resistor material is molded using lift-off, etching, or the like, whereby the heating resistor <b>7</b> having a desired shape is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Subsequently, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5D</figref>, on the insulating film <b>5</b>, a film made of a wiring material such as Al, Al&#x2014;Si, Au, Ag, Cu, and Pt is formed using sputtering, vapor deposition, or the like as in the heating resistor forming step. Then, the thus formed film is formed using lift-off or etching, or the wiring material is screen-printed and is, for example, baked thereafter, to thereby form the common electrode <b>17</b> and the individual electrode <b>19</b> which have the desired shape.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Note that the heating resistor <b>7</b>, the individual electrode <b>19</b>, and the common electrode <b>17</b> are formed in an appropriate order.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In patterning of the resist material for lift-off or etching in the formation of the heating resistor <b>7</b> and the electrode portion <b>17</b>, <b>19</b>, the photo mask is used with reference to the alignment mark <b>21</b> formed in the concave portion forming step, whereby the photoresist material is patterned.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As the photo mask, there is used a photo mask which is manufactured in consideration of the shrinkage percentage of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A during the heating process in the bonding step. On the photo mask, the formation position of the heating resistor, more specifically, a heating portion region <b>25</b>, and a mask-side mark <b>27</b> corresponding to the alignment mark <b>21</b> of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A are formed. Note that intervals of center lines between the adjacent heating portion regions <b>25</b> of the photo mask are formed in the same size as the above-mentioned intervals of the center lines between the adjacent concave portions <b>13</b> on the collective substrate <b>300</b>A, B<b>1</b>, B<b>2</b>, . . . Bn&#x2212;1.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In photolithography, the alignment mark <b>21</b> and the mask-side mark <b>27</b> are aligned with each other, whereby the heating resistors <b>7</b> are formed with the reference concave portion <b>13</b>A as the reference. In other words, when the photo mask and the collective substrate <b>300</b>A are merely aligned with each other with reference to the reference concave portion <b>13</b>A, all the heating portion regions <b>25</b> which are formed on the photo mask in advance can be limited to the range of the respective concave portions <b>13</b> of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A after the thermal shrinkage. Therefore, the heating resistors <b>7</b> can be formed so that the portions serving as the heating portions <b>7</b>A of the heating resistors <b>7</b> are opposed to the respective concave portions <b>13</b> of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">For example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when all the heating portion regions <b>25</b> which are formed on the photo mask in advance are accommodated in the respective concave portions <b>13</b>, and moreover, when the heating portion regions <b>25</b> are each located in the center of the concave portion <b>13</b>, it is considered that the percentage of thermal shrinkage which is estimated for the photo mask to be used in the heating resistor forming step completely coincides with the actual percentage of thermal shrinkage. In this case, the heating resistor <b>7</b> can be formed so that the heating portion <b>7</b>A is located substantially directly above the void heat insulating layer <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In this embodiment, for example, about 400 heating resistors <b>7</b> are arranged in the thermal head <b>1</b> at intervals of about 125 &#x3bc;m. Note that a length Wh (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) of the heating portion <b>7</b>A of each heating resistor <b>7</b> is about 150 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">After the formation of the heating resistors <b>7</b>, the common electrode <b>17</b>, and the individual electrodes <b>19</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5E</figref>, a film made of a material for the protective film <b>11</b>, such as SiO<sub>2</sub>, Ta<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, SiAlON, Si<sub>3</sub>N<sub>4</sub>, or diamond-like carbon is formed on the insulating film <b>5</b> using sputtering, ion plating, CVD, or the like to form the protective film <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In this manner, the collective substrate <b>300</b>A including a large number of the thermal heads <b>1</b> arranged thereon, which are as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, is obtained. After that, the collective substrate <b>300</b>A is cut to complete the respective thermal heads <b>1</b>. For example, 5 to 20 thermal heads <b>1</b> are manufactured from one collective substrate <b>300</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As has been described above, according to the manufacturing method A of this embodiment, other concave portions <b>13</b> are formed so that their sizes become larger in accordance with an increase in distance from the reference concave portion <b>13</b>A, and thus, the heating portion regions <b>25</b> of the photo mask can be limited to the range of the respective concave portions <b>13</b> of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A even when the thermal shrinkage occurs. Accordingly, the heating resistors <b>7</b> can be formed so that the heating portions <b>7</b>A are opposed to all the concave portions <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition, a bonding area between the collective substrate <b>300</b>A and the insulating film <b>5</b> can be made larger compared with the case of making the sizes of all the concave portions <b>13</b> large, and the mechanical strength of the insulating film <b>5</b> can be maintained. Thus, the larger number of the thermal heads <b>1</b> which have high mechanical strength and reliability can be obtained. As a result, the yield to obtain the thermal heads <b>1</b> having high energy efficiency can be improved in the collective substrate <b>300</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">For example, in the case where the thermal head <b>1</b> manufactured by the manufacturing method A is employed in a thermal printer, printing can be performed on thermal recording paper with low power consumption owing to high heating efficiency of the thermal head <b>1</b>. Therefore, it becomes possible to prolong battery duration.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Note that, the widths of the concave portions <b>13</b> are made so as to have a relationship of W<b>1</b>&#x2266;W<b>2</b>&#x2266; . . . &#x2266;Wn in this embodiment, but values of the widths W of the concave portions <b>13</b> of the adjacent thermal heads <b>1</b> may be changed geometrically. Moreover, the sizes of the widths W of the concave portions <b>13</b> may be the same with each other between the adjacent thermal heads <b>1</b>, but it is required that, as the entire collective substrate <b>300</b>A, the widths W of the concave portions <b>13</b> are made to satisfy the relationship of W<b>1</b>&#x3c;Wn in the direction in which the concave portions <b>13</b> are apart from the reference concave portion <b>13</b>A.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, this embodiment can be modified as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">For example, the region of the thermal heads <b>1</b> is distributed in the longitudinal direction of the collective substrate <b>300</b>A in this embodiment. However, as a manufacturing method B according to a first modification of this embodiment, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the concave portion <b>13</b> arranged at the center of a collective substrate <b>300</b>B in its longitudinal direction may be set as a reference concave portion <b>13</b>B in the collective substrate <b>300</b>B in which the region of the thermal heads <b>1</b> is distributed in the longitudinal direction as in the embodiment described above. In this case, the widths W of the concave portions <b>13</b> are set to be larger as the concave portions <b>13</b> are apart from the reference concave portion <b>13</b>B in a width direction thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">For example, in the case where a width W<b>1</b> of the reference concave portion <b>13</b>B is set to be about 160 &#x3bc;m, widths Wun and Wdm of the concave portions <b>13</b> which are arranged in positions which are most apart from the reference concave portion <b>13</b>B (in other words, the concave portions <b>13</b> arranged at both ends of the collective substrate <b>300</b>B in its longitudinal direction) are about 200 &#x3bc;m, respectively. As a result, the heating portion of the heating resistor <b>7</b> can be efficiently accommodated in the concave portion <b>13</b> after the bonding without making the concave portion <b>13</b> large unnecessarily.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Further, as a manufacturing method C according to a second modification of this embodiment, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the region of the thermal heads <b>1</b> may be distributed in a longitudinal direction and a width direction of a collective substrate <b>300</b>C. In this case, the concave portion <b>13</b> arranged at any one of four corners of the collective substrate <b>300</b>C may be set as a reference concave portion <b>13</b>C, and the lengths L and the widths W of the concave portions <b>13</b> are set so as to become larger as the concave portions <b>13</b> are apart from the reference concave portion <b>13</b>C in the longitudinal direction and in the width direction, respectively. Accordingly, as the entire collective substrate <b>300</b>C, position misalignment between the concave portion <b>13</b> and the heating portion in the longitudinal direction and the width direction can be eliminated.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">Still further, as a manufacturing method D according to a third modification of this embodiment, for example, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in a collective substrate <b>300</b>D in which the region of the thermal heads <b>1</b> is distributed in both its longitudinal direction and width direction as in the above-mentioned second modification, the concave portion <b>13</b> arranged at the center of the collective substrate <b>300</b>D may be set as a reference concave portion <b>13</b>D. In this case, the lengths L of the concave portions <b>13</b> may be set so as to become larger as the concave portions <b>13</b> are apart from the reference concave portion <b>13</b>D in the longitudinal direction, and the widths W thereof may be set so as to become larger as the concave portions <b>13</b> are away from the reference concave portion <b>13</b>D in the width direction.</p>
