<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This document relates to the generation and use of mass-communication templates for sending electronic communication in various communication-scenarios.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Businesses or other entities may include a large group of contacts with whom they send e-mails or other electronic communications. In order to send e-mails, one or more human operators of the business can manually create an e-mail and add relevant content for each contact. While this method of sending e-mails allows for flexibility, it also can require significant human effort, particularly for situations with hundreds or thousands of recipients. In another method, the one or more operators can create a single e-mail and add generally relevant content for multiple recipients. This method for sending e-mails minimizes the needs for operator effort at the cost of recipient-specific content flexibility.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In one aspect, a computer-implemented method includes receiving a selection of a communication scenario of multiple communication scenarios. Each of the communication scenarios is associated with content placeholders. The method also includes presenting availability of the content placeholders associated with the selected communication scenario and receiving a selection of a content placeholder from the content placeholders associated with the selected communication scenario. The content placeholder is configured to include content in electronic communications based on a state of a specified communication variable. The method further includes generating, based on the received selection of the content placeholder associated with the communication scenario, a mass-communication template including the content placeholder.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The method additionally includes accessing the mass-communication template to generate a first electronic communication and sending the first electronic communication with first content based on a first state of the communication variable specified by the content placeholder of the mass-communication template. Moreover, the method includes accessing the mass-communication template to generate a second electronic communication and sending the second electronic communication with second content based on a second state of the communication variable specified by the content placeholder of the mass-communication template.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This and other implementations can optionally include one or more of the following features, which also may optionally be in any combination. For example, receiving the selection of the communication scenario can include receiving input from a user through a graphical user interface to select one of multiple present communications scenarios presented to the user. Presenting availability of the content placeholders associated with the selected communication scenario can include presenting availability of one or more content placeholders which are not associated with other communication scenarios. The selected content placeholder can include instructions for including a greeting which is customized for the selected communication scenario in generated electronic communications. The greeting can include a first portion which is predetermined for all communications generated with the mass-communication template and a second portion which is conditional based on the specified communication variable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The method can additionally include accessing a database to determine the state of the communication variable. The communications variable can be an account number of the intended recipient of the electronic communication, accessing the database to determine the state of the communication variable can include accessing the database to determined the account number of the intended recipient, and the first content can be a first account number and the second content is a second account number.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The method can also include receiving a selection of a second content placeholder from the content placeholders associated with the selected communication scenario, wherein the second content placeholder is configured to conditionally include third content in electronic communications based on a state of a second specified communication variable, and wherein the generated mass-communication template includes the second content placeholder. Also, the method can include determining, based on the second content placeholder, that the second communication variable is in a first state, and including third content in the first electronic communication based on the determination that the second communication variable is in the first state, wherein sending the first electronic communication includes sending the first electronic communication with the first and the third content. Finally, the method can include determining, based on the second content placeholder, that the second communication variable is in a second state and determining not to include third content in the second electronic communication based on the determination that the second communication variable is in the second state.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">An organization wishing to send a customized e-mail to a large number of users can create a mass-communication template. The mass-communication template includes a set of instructions that can later be used to generate multiple e-mails in an automated fashion. For example, the instructions of the mass-communication template can instruct a processor to create multiple e-mails and to create content for each of the e-mails without requiring a human operator to instruct the processor to create each e-mail and to populate each e-mail.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Moreover, the instructions of the mass-communication template can include instructions in the form of a content placeholder to populate the created e-mails with static content and dynamic content. Static content is content that is to be similarly included in all e-mails. This may include text for an e-mail body, a subject line, graphics, or other information. For example, a content placeholder can include static content for a common greeting of &#x201c;Please find your latest statement below.&#x201d; Dynamic content is content that will only be included in some e-mails or is included differently or customized for some or all e-mails.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The dynamic content may be created or customized at the time of e-mail generation based on instructions and pre-defined criteria included in the content placeholder. In particular, the content placeholder can include instructions that indicate how content is to be generated or criteria to be considered in generating content. The instructions can enable the use of various personalization features when creating content of e-mails. For example, the instructions can include dynamic link generation and tracking, personalized hyperlinks, and multi-mime e-mails. The criteria may further specify content variables that vary between e-mails to be considered in generating content, such as the identity of the recipient or the location of the recipient. Accordingly, by using a content placeholder in a mass-communication template, a single mass-communication template can be used to create multiple e-mails sharing common static content but each with unique dynamic content created as the e-mails are created.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The criteria of a content placeholder can point to stored information with instructions for how to retrieve the information and incorporate it into an e-mail. For example, a content placeholder for name retrieval includes a pointer to an information database storing user names in a table with corresponding e-mail address. The name-retrieval content placeholder instructs a processor to, for each e-mail, retrieve the username in the information database corresponding to the e-mail address of the given e-mail and to insert the retrieved username in the e-mail being generated at a particular location in the body of the e-mail. Thus, the name retrieval content placeholder facilitates the inclusion of a customized greeting in each e-mail.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The criteria of a content placeholder can enable similar functionality with respect to generation of hyperlinks used in link tracking. In particular, each hyperlink can be uniquely tailored based on recipient-specific criteria, such as, recipient account name or number. For example, the criteria of a content placeholder can indicate instructions for creating a hyperlink to be included with each e-mail which is configured to enable e-mail tracking based on the recipient account number. Therefore, the content placeholder can customize each hyperlink such that when an e-mail recipient activities the hyperlink, the system sending the e-mail can be made aware of the activation.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Moreover, the content placeholder can be used to create content providing functionality and need not be content viewable to the recipient. For example, content created by the content placeholder can enable e-mail tracking. In one implementation, a content placeholder is used to insert customized read receipts and includes criteria of user account numbers. In particular, the read receipt created by the content placeholder of each e-mail is uniquely tailored to indicate a recipient user account number. The read receipts with the user account number enable various types of e-mail tracking.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a diagram <b>100</b> of how a mass-communication template <b>110</b> can be used to generate multiple unique e-mails. In the diagram <b>100</b>, a mass-communication template <b>110</b> is processed during run-time execution <b>120</b> to create a first e-mail <b>130</b> and a second e-mail <b>140</b> with content differing from the first e-mail <b>130</b>. The diagram <b>100</b> only illustrates two generated e-mails for brevity. The mass-communication template <b>110</b> may be used to generate thousands of e-mails with some recipients receiving identical e-mails. Although not shown, the mass-communication template <b>110</b> can be configured to be used to generate multiple forms of electronic communication. For example, in some implementations, the mass-communication template <b>110</b> is used to generate both e-mails and short message service (SMS) messages at run-time execution <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In this example, the mass-communication template <b>110</b> includes a content placeholder for the recipient address <b>111</b>, a content placeholder for the subject <b>112</b>, a content placeholder for the greeting <b>113</b> and content placeholders for the body <b>114</b>. After generation, the mass-communication template with the content placeholders <b>111</b>-<b>114</b> can be stored for later execution. Thereafter, a run-time execution <b>120</b> processes the instructions of the mass-communication template to create e-mails. In particular, one or more processors carrying out the instructions during run-time execution <b>120</b> create a first e-mail <b>130</b> with static content which is predetermined and identified by the mass-communication and dynamic content which is determined at the time of run-time execution <b>120</b>. The processors also create a second e-mail <b>140</b> with the same static content and with different dynamic content which is also determined at the time of run-time execution <b>120</b>. The number of e-mails and identity of the recipients may be determined by the instructions of the mass-communication template or by other instructions considered during run-time execution <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The content placeholder for the recipient address <b>111</b> can be used to specify the number of e-mails to be generated and/or the recipient addresses of the e-mails. In this example, the content placeholder for the recipient address <b>111</b> points to a database of account holders. The content placeholder for the recipient address <b>111</b> further includes instruction on how to use the information in the database. For example, the further instructions can specify that an e-mail is to be created for each account number listed in the database and with the recipient address being the corresponding e-mail address of each account number as listed in the database. During run-time execution <b>120</b>, the processor may find two accounts in the account database and generate a first e-mail <b>130</b> with a recipient address of john.doe@example.com <b>131</b> and a second e-mail <b>140</b> with a recipient address of janes1234@generic.gov <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The content placeholder for the subject <b>112</b> can be used to populate the subject line and, in this example, includes only the static content of &#x201c;New Statement.&#x201d; Therefore, the e-mails <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are identically populated with &#x201c;New Statement&#x201d; in their respective subject lines. The content placeholder for the greeting <b>113</b> includes a combination of static and dynamic content. For example, the content placeholder for the greeting <b>113</b> instructs the processor to determine the first name of the account number of the recipient and the current date. Thereafter, the processor creates the greeting with the static content of</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">&#x201c;, please find the statement dated for&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">between the dynamic content of the name and date. In this example, both the first and second e-mails <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> are sent on the same date. As such, the first e-mail <b>130</b> has a greeting <b>133</b> of &#x201c;John, please find your statement dated for Aug. 3, 2009.&#x201d; and the second e-mail <b>140</b> has a greeting <b>143</b> of &#x201c;Jane, please find your statement dated for Aug. 3, 2009.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The content placeholder of the body <b>114</b> can include static and dynamic content for conditional insertion in e-mails. For example, while the other content placeholders <b>111</b>-<b>113</b> may result in content being included in generated e-mails, the content place holder of the body <b>114</b> can be configured to instruct the processor to include content in some e-mail but not in other e-mails according to specified conditions. In this example, the condition of the content placeholder of the body <b>114</b> is whether the account of the recipient is delinquent. The condition may further point to a separate database listing a delinquency state of each account number. At run-time execution <b>120</b>, the processor accesses the separate database and looks up the value of the delinquency state of the account number of the e-mail being generated. In other implementations, the condition may instruct the processor to query another process or computer for an indication of whether the account is delinquent.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">If the condition of the content placeholder of the body <b>114</b> is met, a combination of static and dynamic content is added to the e-mail. In this example, the account of the recipient of the first e-mail <b>130</b> is not delinquent and, therefore, is not populated with content from the content place holder of the body <b>114</b>. The account of the recipient of second e-mail <b>140</b> is delinquent and is populated with a body <b>144</b> stating &#x201c;Your account is past due with a balance of $1,400.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Large enterprises may send out a vast number of e-mails for a specific scenario, such as a monthly statement. In particular, the content placeholders <b>111</b>-<b>114</b> in the mass-communication template <b>110</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are each examples illustrating functionality used in sending an account statement in such a scenario. E-mails sent in different scenarios may be better configured using different types of content placeholders. In some implementations, the content placeholders used may vary with the scenario of a given mass-mailing.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In order to assist human operators to efficiently create mass-communication templates for a particular mass-mailing, content placeholders can be tailored to a particular scenario and made available for use in creating a mass-communication template for the given scenario. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a diagram <b>200</b> of how content placeholders can be used with different communication-scenarios in creating a mass-communication template.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">An operator wishing to send a large number of e-mails for a given situation can first initiate mass-communication template generation <b>210</b>. Thereafter, the operator is asked to specify the communication scenario which the e-mails will be directed to. The example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes two scenarios, a statement scenario <b>220</b> and a promotion scenario <b>230</b>. The statement scenario <b>220</b> is directed to mass-mailings that provide statements or other standard account information to account holders. For example, the e-mails <b>130</b> and <b>140</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> are created for sending account holders electronic copies of their statements and are part of a statement scenario <b>220</b>. The promotion scenario <b>230</b> is directed to a mass mailing which promotes a product or service of the sending entity.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">By selecting the statement scenario <b>220</b>, the operator can be provided with statement scenario content placeholders <b>225</b>. These content placeholders are here tailored for use in mass-communications providing statements to users. The statement scenario content placeholders <b>225</b> can include the content placeholders <b>111</b>-<b>114</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> or other content placeholders. For example, upon selection of the statement scenario <b>220</b>, the operator is provided with the option to include a standard greeting content placeholder (a static salutation configured for e-mails with statements), a dynamic content placeholder which populates e-mails with the account balance of the recipient, and other content placeholders with varying combinations of static, dynamic, and conditional content tailored to the statement scenario <b>220</b>. In addition, the statement scenario content placeholders <b>225</b> can be provided along with functionality tailored to the statement scenario <b>220</b>. For example, tracking the successful sending of statements may be particularly important, and, therefore, an e-mail bounce management function may be provided along with the statement scenario content placeholders <b>225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">By selecting the promotion scenario <b>230</b>, the operator can be provided with promotion scenario content placeholders <b>235</b>. These content placeholders are here tailored for use in mass-communications promoting products to users. The promotion scenario content placeholders <b>235</b> can include a standard greeting content placeholder (a static salutation configured for e-mails promoting products), a dynamic content placeholder which populates e-mails with the price of a product dependent upon the geographic location of the recipient, and other content placeholders with varying combinations of static, dynamic, and conditional content tailored to the promotion scenario <b>230</b>. In addition, the promotion scenario content placeholders <b>235</b> can be provided along with functionality tailored to the promotion scenario <b>230</b>. For example, tracking the recipient activation of hyperlinks may be useful in tracking the success of a product promotion, and, therefore, a hyperlink tracking function may be provided along with the promotion scenario content placeholders <b>235</b>. The hyperlinks created for e-mails by the hyperlink tracking function may be based on recipient account information and customized for each e-mail to allow for tracking.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The operator is also provided with the option to include universal content placeholders <b>228</b>. Universal content placeholders <b>228</b> are generic content placeholders provided for use with any scenario. Either the universal content placeholders <b>228</b> or the scenario specific content placeholders can be provided along with various other functionality not directly tied to content viewable by the user. The functionality can include, for example, link tracking, email open rate tracking, contact tracking, bounce management, personalized hyperlinks, and use of multi-mime e-mails. This functionality can be provided generally along with the universal content placeholders <b>228</b> or can be customized for a scenario and provided along with the scenario specific content placeholders. By customizing functionality generally provided along with universal content placeholders <b>228</b>, development effort required for generating new functionality to be provided along with scenario specific content placeholders can be minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">After being provided with the content placeholders tailored to the selected scenario and the universal content placeholders, the operator can construct the mass-communication template by selecting content placeholders as desired. The two scenarios shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are exemplary. An enterprise may use other scenarios or may create additional scenarios and content placeholders. To create a scenario, an operator specifies the type of scenario and scenario specific content placeholders to be made available when creating a mass-communication template for the new scenario. The operator can also create content placeholders to be used by one or more scenarios by specifying the static, dynamic, or condition content to be included by the content placeholder.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a system <b>300</b> configured to use mass-communication templates for multiple communication-scenarios. The system <b>300</b> can represent computers of a large business, government agency, or other enterprise which electronically communicates with a large number of individuals. For simplicity, the system <b>300</b> is here shown as including a single computer. In some implementations, the system <b>300</b> can represent any number of computers and storage devices at different locations. The enterprise server <b>310</b> uses data storage <b>320</b> and processes <b>330</b> in generating e-mails to be sent over a communications network <b>340</b> to the multiple recipient computers <b>341</b>-<b>343</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The data storage <b>320</b> represents one or more storage devices accessible to the enterprise computer server <b>310</b> and includes storage of mass-communication templates <b>328</b>, scenarios for generating mass-communication templates <b>322</b> and <b>324</b>, and information used in generating e-mails with mass-communication templates <b>326</b>. The storage of scenarios includes storage of the statement scenario <b>322</b> stored along with content placeholders of the statement scenario and storage of the promotion scenario <b>324</b> along with content placeholders. The storage of scenarios can also include storage of functionality provided with content placeholders not directly tied to placement of content viewable by the recipient of the e-mail. The storage of information used in generating e-mails includes storage of recipient account information <b>326</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The processes <b>330</b> represent programs used in conjunction with mass-communication templates to send e-mails and includes a scenario and content placeholders generation process <b>332</b>, a mass-communication template generation process <b>334</b>, and a run-time execution process <b>336</b>. The scenario and content placeholders generation process <b>332</b> can enable a human operator to program a new scenario and customized content placeholders and functionality to be used in generating mass-communication templates with the new scenario. The mass-communication template generation process <b>334</b> can enable an operator to select a particular scenario and then use the content placeholders of that scenarios to generate a mass-communication template for a particular communication campaign. The run-time execution process <b>336</b> can access a mass-communication template and generate e-mails according to the instructions of content placeholders in the mass-communication template.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart of an example of a process <b>400</b> for sending e-mails for a communication scenario with a mass-communication template. The process <b>400</b> is described below with reference to the system <b>300</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, and in other implementations the process <b>400</b> can be implemented with other systems. The first portion of the process <b>400</b> is here directed to the generation of a mass-communication template and begins with the presentation of the availability of multiple communication scenarios through a graphical user interface (GUI) generated by the mass-communication template generation process <b>334</b> running on the enterprise server <b>310</b> (step <b>405</b>). For example, the mass-communication template generation process <b>334</b> can access the data storage <b>320</b> and present the availability of the statement scenario <b>322</b> and the promotion scenario <b>324</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">An operator interacting with the GUI can select a particular communication scenario on the GUI and the mass-communication template generation process <b>334</b> can receive the selection of the communication scenario (step <b>410</b>). The mass-communication template generation process <b>334</b> can access the selected communication scenario from the data storage <b>320</b> to determine the existence of content placeholders associated with the selected communication scenario. Thereafter, the mass-communication template generation process <b>334</b> can present the availability of content placeholders associated with the selected communication scenario with the GUI (step <b>415</b>). The operator selects a particular content placeholder on the GUI and the mass-communication template generation process <b>334</b> receives the selection of the content placeholder (step <b>420</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Steps <b>415</b> and <b>420</b> can be repeated one or more times to include additional content placeholders. As another example, the user may specify conditional criteria, such as which communications variables are used in generating dynamic content of content placeholders. The mass-communication template generation process <b>334</b> can generate a mass-communication template (step <b>425</b>) and stores the generated mass-communication template in storage of mass-communication templates <b>328</b> in the data storage <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The second portion of the process <b>400</b> is directed to the use of a mass-communication template to send a first e-mail. The run-time execution process <b>336</b> running on the enterprise server <b>310</b> can access the stored mass-communication template from the database storage <b>320</b> to generate the first e-mail (step <b>435</b>). The content placeholder can be identified as included in the mass-communication template (step <b>440</b>). The run-time execution process <b>336</b> can then determine that a communication variable identified by the content placeholder is in a first state (step <b>445</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The content placeholder here includes dynamic content that is dependent on a communications variable. For example, the content placeholder can specify the inclusion of a name based on the communication variable of the recipient identity (i.e., the account holder receiving the e-mail). The content placeholder can also include conditions on when or how to include dynamic content. For example, the content placeholder can specify the inclusion of either a first sentence or a second sentence depending upon the communication variable of the recipient location (e.g., if the recipient is in the United States include one sentence but if the recipient is in Europe include another sentence). The run-time execution process <b>336</b> includes first content in the first e-mail based on the first state of the communication variable (step <b>450</b>). Steps <b>440</b>-<b>450</b> can be repeated to include content of additional content placeholders in the first e-mail. Thereafter, the run-time execution process <b>336</b> sends the first e-mail over the communication network <b>340</b> to a first recipient <b>341</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The third portion of the process <b>400</b> is directed to the use of the mass-communication template to send a second e-mail. The run-time execution process <b>336</b> running on the enterprise server <b>310</b> accesses the stored mass-communication template from the database storage <b>320</b> to generate the second e-mail (step <b>460</b>). The content placeholder is again identified as included in the mass-communication template (step <b>465</b>). The run-time execution process <b>336</b> then determines that the communication variable identified by the content placeholder is in a second state (step <b>470</b>). Second content is included in the second e-mail based on the second state of the communication variable (step <b>475</b>). Steps <b>465</b>-<b>475</b> can be repeated to include content of additional content placeholders in the second e-mail. Thereafter, the run-time execution process <b>336</b> sends the second e-mail over the communication network <b>340</b> to a second recipient <b>341</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Different implementation may include a different process or different steps of the process <b>400</b>. For example, in some implementations, all e-mails may be sent concurrently after the e-mails are generated. Also, the mass-communication template may only be accessed and the content placeholder may only be identified once when creating multiple e-mails. In addition, in some implementations, the mass-communication template is generated at the time a communication campaign is executed for a single use. Therefore, the mass-communication template may not be stored in or accessed from the database <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For reference with respect to the computer systems shown in and/or used by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> discussed above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a schematic diagram of a computer system <b>500</b>. The computer system <b>500</b> can be used for the operations described in association with any of the computer-implement methods described previously, according to one implementation. The computer system <b>500</b> includes a processor <b>510</b>, a memory <b>520</b>, a storage device <b>530</b>, and an input/output device <b>540</b>.

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The features described above can be implemented in digital electronic circuitry, or in computer hardware, firmware, software, or in combinations of them. The apparatus can be implemented in a computer program product tangibly embodied in an information carrier, e.g., in a machine-readable storage device, for execution by a programmable processor; and method steps can be performed by a programmable processor executing a program of instructions to perform functions of the described implementations by operating on input data and generating output. The described features can be implemented advantageously in one or more computer programs that are executable on a programmable system including at least one programmable processor coupled to receive data and instructions from, and to transmit data and instructions to, a data storage system, at least one input device, and at least one output device.

A computer program can be written in any form of programming language, including compiled or interpreted languages, and it can be deployed in any form, including as a stand-alone program or as a module, component, subroutine, or other unit suitable for use in a computing environment.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Suitable processors for the execution of a program of instructions include, by way of example, both general and special purpose microprocessors, and the sole processor or one of multiple processors of any kind of computer. Generally, a processor will receive instructions and data from a read-only memory or a random access memory or both. The essential elements of a computer are a processor for executing instructions and one or more memories for storing instructions and data.
