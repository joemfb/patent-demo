<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">However, such previous devices are not yet providing a user with various types of images including the view in his or her field of view direction.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is thus desirable to provide an imaging display apparatus and method that can provide a user with various types of images including the view in his or her field of view direction, enable to enhance the visual ability of the user, and offer the user with usability and enjoyment.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to an embodiment of the present invention, there is provided an imaging display apparatus, including: display means for image display; first image signal generation means for generating a display image signal based on a captured image signal captured by an imaging section with a field of view direction of a user being a direction of an object; second image signal generation means for generating a display image signal of an image different from an image of the display image signal generated by the first image signal generation means; and control means for allowing, simultaneously on the display means, display of the image of the display image signal generated by the first image signal generation means and display of the image of the display image signal generated by the second image signal generation means.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The display means is disposed before eyes of a user for image display.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Alternatively, the display means is formed in a chassis different from a chassis including therein the first image signal generation means.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The second image signal generation means generates the display image signal of the image different from the image of the display image signal generated by the first image signal generation means by operation control exercised by the imaging section over an imaging lens system.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The second image signal generation means generates the display image signal of the image different from the image of the display image signal generated by the first image signal generation means by the signal processing in the signal processing section.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The second image signal generation means includes a reception section that receives an image signal from an external device, and generates, based on the image signal received by the reception section, the display image signal of the image different from the image of the display image signal generated by the first image signal generation means.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The second image signal generation means includes a reproduction section that reproduces an image signal from a recording medium, and generates, based on the image signal reproduced by the reproduction section, the display image signal of the image different from the image of the display image signal generated by the first image signal generation means.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The display means is set with, in a screen area, a master screen area and a slave screen area, and in either the master screen area or the slave screen area, image display is made by the display image signal provided by the first image signal generation means, and on the remaining screen area, image display is made by the display image signal provided by the second image signal generation section.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In the display means, a screen area is split into two areas, and in one of the two areas, image display is made by the display image signal provided by the first image signal generation means, and in the remaining area, image display is made by the display image signal provided by the second image signal generation section.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One of the display image signals generated by the first and second image signal generation means is an image signal captured by close-range imaging or long-range imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">One of the display image signals generated by the first and second image signal generation means is an image signal captured by telephoto imaging or wide-angle imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">One of the display image signals generated by the first and second image signal generation means is an image signal captured by scale-up processing or scale-down processing.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">One of the display image signals generated by the first and second image signal generation means is an image signal captured with an increase or a decrease of an imaging sensitivity.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">One of the display image signals generated by the first and second image signal generation means is an image signal captured in a field of view direction of a user being a direction of an object.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">One of the display image signals generated by the first and second image signal generation means is an image signal captured in a direction, as the direction of the object, different from the field of view direction of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to another embodiment of the invention, there is provided an imaging display method, including: a first image signal generation step of generating a display image signal based on a captured image signal captured by an imaging section with a field of view direction of a user being a direction of an object; a second image signal generation step of generating a display image signal being an image different from an image of the display image signal generated in the first image signal generation step; and a display step of allowing, simultaneously, display of the image of the display image signal generated in the first image signal generation step and display of the image of the display image signal generated in the second image signal generation step.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">According to the embodiments of the invention, as described above, when a user wears the imaging display apparatus of the embodiments of the invention being of a glass type or head-wearing type, for example, the imaging section becomes ready for capturing an image of a view in the field of view direction of the user. The resulting image captured by the imaging section as such, i.e., a display image signal being the image of the view in the field of view direction of the user derived by the first image signal generation means, is supplied to the display means for display thereon. At the same time of display as such, the display image signal generated by the second image signal generation means is also displayed, e.g., a plurality of images may be displayed all at once with screen split, picture-in-picture display, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The image of the display image signal generated by the second image signal generation means is different from that of the display image signal generated by the first image signal generation means. The difference of these images may be variously resulted from the difference of imaging direction, or even with the same imaging direction, resulted from the difference of zooming, focal position, sensitivity, signal processing, and others, or the image of the second image signal generation means may be provided from any other apparatuses or reproduced from a recording medium, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The display image signal of the first image signal generation means displays the image of the view normally spreading in front of the user, and the display image signal of the second image signal generation means displays any image that cannot be usually available with any normal sense of sight. As such, the user's visual ability can be enhanced, and interesting display can be offered.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Note here that the first and second image signal generation means each serve as a source of display image signals for display. The expressions of the first and second do not restrictively mean that two of the image signal generation means are provided, and this surely does not hinder the provision of three or more of the image signal generation means.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to the embodiments of the invention, on the display means, the display image signal of the first image signal generation means displays the image of the view normally spreading in front of the user, and the display image signal of the second image signal generation means displays any image that cannot be usually available with any normal sense of sight so that the user's visual ability can be enhanced and usable or interesting display can be offered.</p>

<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As an embodiment of the invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> each show an exemplary external view of an imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> being a glass-type display camera. The imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> exemplarily includes a wearable unit of a frame configuration as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, i.e., extends halfway across the head from the sides to rear thereof. The wearable unit is placed on a user's ears as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> so that the user can wear the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> is so configured that a pair of display sections <b>2</b> and <b>2</b> is positioned immediately before the eyes of the user, i.e., where the lenses of a pair of normal glasses are positioned, when the user wears the apparatus. The display sections <b>2</b> are provided for the right and left eyes, respectively, and are each a liquid crystal panel, for example. Note here that when no image display is made by the display sections <b>2</b>, the liquid crystal panels may be controlled in terms of transmittance, and may be put in the through state, i.e., made transparent or translucent.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> is provided with two imaging lens <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a</i>, which are disposed toward the front direction of the user when the user wears the apparatus <b>1</b>, i.e., the two imaging lens <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a </i>are both so attached that the field of view direction (frontward) of the user wearing the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> is the direction of an object.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> is provided with light-emitting sections <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>a </i>that illuminate the direction of imaging by the imaging lenses <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The light-emitting sections <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>a </i>are each formed by an LED (Light Emitting Diode), for example.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although a detailed description will be given later by referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the imaging lenses <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a </i>are respectively included in imaging function components (C<b>1</b> and C<b>2</b>). The imaging lenses <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a </i>each provide a captured image signal being the imaging result. The captured image signals are both subjected to any predetermined processing, and the resulting display image signals are displayed on the display sections <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> is merely an example, and various other configurations are possible for the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> to make it available for the user to wear. The imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> may be formed with a wearable unit generally of a glass or head-wearing type, and in the embodiment, may be at least provided with the display sections <b>2</b> in the vicinity of the front of the user's eyes. The display sections <b>2</b> are not necessarily provided in pairs for each of the eyes, and alternatively, may be solely provided for one of the eyes.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In a possible configuration, the light-emitting sections <b>4</b><i>a </i>may not be provided.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, the imaging lenses <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a </i>are so attached that the front of the user is the direction of an object. Alternatively, the two imaging lenses <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a </i>may be so attached as to capture images of the view in each different direction as the direction of an object.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> show an example. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, for imaging in the front, one imaging lens <b>3</b><i>a </i>and one light-emitting section <b>4</b><i>a </i>are provided, and for the unit located on the rear side of the head, another imaging lens <b>3</b><i>a </i>and another light-emitting section <b>4</b><i>a </i>are provided. With such a configuration, one of these two imaging lenses <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a </i>is in charge of imaging in the field of view direction of the user, and the remaining imaging lens <b>3</b><i>a </i>is in charge of imaging in the direction different from the field of view direction of the user, i.e., in this case, in the rear direction of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">In this embodiment, at least one imaging lens <b>3</b><i>a </i>is assumed as being in charge of imaging in the field of view direction of the user. When the remaining imaging lens <b>3</b><i>a </i>is so disposed as to take charge for imaging in the direction different from the field of view direction of the user, the direction of an object is not necessarily the rear direction of the user, and may be the upward, leftward, rightward, or downward direction, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Alternatively, three or more of the imaging lens <b>3</b><i>a </i>may be provided, and these may be oriented in the same direction or in each different direction.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the exemplary configurations of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 2B</figref>, the imaging lenses <b>3</b><i>a </i>and <b>3</b><i>a </i>are fixedly provided, and thus the direction of an object during imaging is fixed, i.e., in front and/or rear of the user. Alternatively, the imaging lens <b>3</b><i>a </i>may be provided via a movable mechanism that can change the direction of an object so that the direction of the object during imaging may be changed manually or automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The imaging lenses <b>3</b><i>a </i>may be of various types, e.g., entirely a fixed type or a movable type, or partially a movable type.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 2B</figref> show the imaging display apparatuses <b>1</b> in which the portion for imaging is formed as a piece with the display sections <b>2</b> for monitoring of any captured images. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows another possible configuration of the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> in which the display section <b>2</b> is separately provided.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an imaging unit section <b>40</b> and a display unit section <b>30</b> are separately provided.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">The imaging unit section <b>40</b> is attached to the head portion of a user by any predetermined wearable unit.

<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The imaging unit section <b>40</b> is provided with the light-emitting section <b>4</b><i>a </i>that illuminates the direction of imaging by the imaging lens <b>3</b><i>a</i>. The light-emitting section <b>4</b><i>a </i>is formed by an LED, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">With such a configuration, although the details are left for later description, the imaging unit section <b>40</b> carries therein a communications section for forwarding data of any captured images to the display unit section <b>30</b>, which is separately provided.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The display unit section <b>30</b> is assumed as being portable for a user with light weight and small size.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The display unit section <b>30</b> is provided therein with a communications section for data communications with the imaging unit section <b>40</b>, and is operated to display image data, on a display screen <b>31</b>, provided by the imaging unit section <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The user may use such an imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> in which the imaging unit section <b>40</b> and the display unit section <b>30</b> are provided separately from each other.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">2. Exemplary Configuration of Imaging Display Apparatus</heading>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">By referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 to 8</figref>, described below is an exemplary internal configuration of the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">First of all, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an exemplary configuration corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 2B</figref> described above, i.e., two of the imaging function component are included.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">A system controller <b>10</b> is configured by a microcomputer including a CPU (Central Processing Unit), ROM (Read Only Memory), RAM (Random Access Memory), a nonvolatile memory section, and an interface section. The system controller <b>10</b> serves as a control section that exercises control over the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">This system controller <b>10</b> exercises control over the components in the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> based on any internal operation program and an operation trigger coming from an operation trigger information generation section <b>16</b>. The system controller <b>10</b> then makes the display section <b>2</b> perform any predetermined image display thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b>, as a first imaging function component C<b>1</b>, provided are an imaging section <b>3</b>, an imaging control section <b>11</b>, and an imaging signal processing section <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The imaging section <b>3</b> in the imaging function component C<b>1</b> is provided with the imaging lenses <b>3</b><i>a </i>of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, a lens system, a drive system, a solid-state imaging element array, and others. The lens system is configured to include an aperture, a zoom lens, a focus lens, and others. The drive system exercises control over the lens system to go through a focus operation and a zoom operation. The solid-state imaging element array detects an imaging light derived by the lens system, and generates an imaging signal through photoelectric conversion. The solid-state imaging element array is exemplified by a CCD (Charge Coupled Device) sensor array, and a CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) sensor array.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> examples, the imaging section <b>3</b> in the imaging function component C<b>1</b> capture images of the view in front of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> is configured to include a sample hold/AGC (Automatic Gain Control) circuit or a video A/D (Analog-to-Digital) converter, and derives an imaging signal being digital data. The sample hold/AGC circuit performs gain adjustment and waveform shaping with respect to a signal derived by the solid-state imaging element in the imaging section <b>3</b>. The imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> performs, with respect to the imaging signal, processing of white balance, brightness, color signal, camera-shake correction, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> is assumed as serving also as a so-called video processor, and being a portion for processing the imaging signal to achieve various types of display.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> is capable of performing, for example, with respect to the imaging signal, adjustment of intensity level, contrast, and sharpness (edge enhancement), correction of color, and others. The imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> is also capable of generating scaled-up or scaled-down images being results of partially scaling up or down the imaging signal, and image effects processing including mosaicing, intensity inversion, soft focus, partial highlight display, and entire color tone change, for example. The imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> is also capable of processing of generating character images and concept images, synthesizing the generated images to any captured images, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">That is, the imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> can go through various types of processing with respect to a digital video signal being an imaging signal.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The imaging control section <b>11</b> exercises control over the imaging section <b>3</b> and the imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> in terms of operation, i.e., control over the imaging operation of the imaging function component C<b>1</b>. Such control is exercised based on a command coming from the system controller <b>10</b>. For example, the imaging control section <b>11</b> exercises control over ON/OFF of the operation of the imaging section <b>3</b> and the imaging signal processing section <b>15</b>. The imaging control section <b>11</b> is assumed as exercising control, i.e., motor control, over the imaging section <b>3</b> to go through operations of auto focus, automatic exposure adjustment, aperture adjustment, zoom, focus change, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As described in the foregoing, when the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> is provided with a movable mechanism that can move the direction of an object by the imaging lens <b>3</b><i>a</i>, the imaging control section <b>11</b> exercises control over the movable mechanism in terms of operation based on a command coming from the system controller <b>10</b> so that the direction of the imaging lens <b>3</b><i>a </i>is changed in the imaging section <b>3</b>.</p>

Through such timing control, the imaging frame rate can be also controlled variable.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The imaging control section <b>11</b> exercises control over the solid-state imaging element and the imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> in terms of imaging sensitivity and signal processing. The imaging sensitivity control includes gain control over signals to be read from the solid-state imaging element, black-level setting control, varying coefficient control during processing of an imaging signal being yet digital data, and correction amount control during camera-shake correction processing, for example. The imaging sensitivity may be subjected to any entire sensitivity adjustment with no specific consideration for a wavelength band, or to any sensitivity adjustment for adjusting the imaging sensitivity of any specific wavelength band such as an infrared area or ultraviolet area, e.g., imaging of cutting off any specific wavelength band. The sensitivity adjustment in consideration of wavelength is possible by insertion of a wavelength filter in the imaging lens system, and by wavelength filter computation processing to an imaging signal. In these cases, the imaging control section <b>11</b> can exercise sensitivity control by insertion control over a wavelength filter, or by specifying a filter computation coefficient, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The imaging control section <b>11</b> also exercises control over the imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> in terms of image processing operation based on a command coming from the system controller <b>10</b>.

The system controller <b>10</b> is exercising operation control over the imaging section <b>3</b> of the imaging function component C<b>2</b> in terms of telephoto zoom. With telephoto imaging performed by the imaging function component C<b>2</b>, the image of the area AR<b>2</b> looks different from the image of the area AR<b>1</b>.

<p id="p-0264" num="0278">Alternatively, various requirements may be arbitrarily changed, e.g., scaling factor for zoom processing and scale-up/scale-down processing, level for an imaging sensitivity change, and processing coefficient for processing of intensity signal and color signal.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0279">On the other hand, in the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, when the imaging function component C<b>2</b> is so disposed as to capture an image of the view not in the field of view direction for the imaging function component C<b>1</b>, i.e., in front of a user, a display image signal derived by the imaging function component C<b>2</b> will be exemplified as below.</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0280">That is, in such a case, an image captured normally by the imaging function component C<b>2</b> already shows the view different from that of the image captured normally by the imaging function component C<b>1</b>, e.g., image showing the view in the rear, upward, downward, rightward, and leftward. As such, the captured image signal of the imaging function component C<b>2</b> may be used as a display image signal as it is, and the display image signal may be displayed on the display section <b>2</b> together with the display image signal of the imaging function component C<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0281">In such a case, as exemplarily listed above, image signals as a result of the imaging operations by the imaging section <b>3</b> of the imaging function component C<b>2</b> or the signal processing by the imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> may be used as display image signals.</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0282">The above description is similarly applicable to a case where three or more of the imaging function component are provided, i.e., C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, and others. Considered now is a case where any of the imaging function components C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, and others is provided with an imaging function component for capturing an image of the view in the same direction as the imaging function component C<b>1</b>. In this case, the resulting captured image signals may be subjected to the imaging operations by the imaging section <b>3</b> or the signal processing by the imaging signal processing section <b>15</b>, and the resulting images of the view different from that of the imaging function component C<b>1</b> may be used as display image signals.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0283">In another case where any of the imaging function components C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, and others is provided with the imaging section <b>3</b> for capturing an image of the view in the direction different from that of the imaging function component C<b>1</b>, i.e., direction not in front of a user. In this case, the resulting captured image signals may be used as display image signals, or as exemplarily listed above, image signals through with the imaging operations by the imaging section <b>3</b> or the signal processing by the imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> may be used as display image signals.</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0284">In still another case where any of the imaging function components C<b>2</b>, C<b>3</b>, and others is provided with an imaging function component for capturing an image of the view in the same direction. In this case, one of the normally-captured resulting images is used as a display image signal, and the remaining image signal through with the operations by the imaging section <b>3</b> or signal processing by the imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> is used as a display image signal. This enables to derive display image signals of different images from the images captured for the view in the same direction. In this case, surely, as described above, both of the images signals through with operations by the imaging section <b>3</b> or the signal processing by the imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> may be used as display image signals.</p>
<p id="p-0271" num="0285">When the imaging function components C<b>2</b> and C<b>3</b> both capture an image of the view in the rear of a user, one of the resulting normally-captured images may be used as a display image signal, and the other being a telephoto image may be used as a display image signal. On the other hand, one of the images being a scaled-up image may be used as a display image signal, and the other being an ultraviolet-sensitivity-increased image may be used as a display image signal.</p>
<p id="p-0272" num="0286">This is also applicable to the configuration in which the imaging function component C<b>2</b> is a movable imaging section that can be changed in direction for imaging. With such an image function component C<b>2</b>, any images captured for the view not in front of a user or any image signals through with the operations of the imaging section <b>3</b> and the signal processing by the imaging function processing section <b>15</b> may be used as display image signals.</p>
<p id="p-0273" num="0287">A movable imaging section provided as such may enable movable control of variously changing the imaging direction. When any captured image signal is subjected to image analysis and a specific target is detected, for example, the imaging direction may be changed in accordance with the movement of the specific target in the captured image. Through such control, a user can see an image following the specific target in the area AR<b>2</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0274" num="0288">This is applicable also to a case of displaying images provided by an external device and received by the communications section <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0289">That is, images from the external imaging apparatus <b>70</b> and the content source device <b>71</b> are different from images of display image signals derived by the imaging function component C<b>1</b>. Therefore, by displaying the image signals received by the communications section <b>26</b> as display image signals as they are on the display section <b>2</b>, various types of images can be available for display to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0290">This is also applicable to images reproduced by the storage section <b>25</b>, which are different from images of the display image signals derived by the imaging function component C<b>1</b>. As such, by displaying the image signals being the reproduction results of the storage section <b>25</b> as display image signals as they are on the display section <b>2</b>, various types of images can be available for display to a user.</p>
<p id="p-0277" num="0291">Note here that when the display image processing section <b>12</b> is allowed to execute image signal processing, e.g., image scaling-up or -down, processing of intensity or color, adjustment of contrast or sharpness, and image effects processing, the image signals received by the communications section <b>26</b> or the image signals being the reproduction results of the storage section <b>25</b> may be subjected to such image signal processing, thereby generating display image signals.</p>
<p id="p-0278" num="0292">When the communications section <b>26</b> and the storage section <b>25</b> are each being an image source, image display similar to that made by a personal computer or others is also possible, e.g., variable-speed reproduction including high-speed reproduction, slow-speed reproduction, and frame-by-frame advance, display page change, and scrolling display.</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0293">Described above is the case where the images normally captured by the imaging function component C<b>1</b> are display image signals. Alternatively, image signals through with operations by the imaging section <b>3</b> and signal processing by the imaging signal processing section <b>15</b> in the imaging function component C<b>1</b> may be used as display image signals. The operations and signal processing include, for example, telephoto/wide-angle zoom, scale-up/scale-down, sensitivity change, close-range imaging/long-range imaging, processing of intensity or color, and image effects processing.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0294">In any cases, any other image sources may be so configured as to generate display image signals of images different from those from the imaging function component C<b>1</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">5. Exemplary Operation Trigger</heading>
<p id="p-0281" num="0295">As shown in the flowchart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the system controller <b>10</b> performs display of images provided by a plurality of image sources when determining in step F<b>101</b> that a display start trigger is generated for a plurality of images. The system controller <b>10</b> also makes a display detail change or a display configuration change when determining in step F<b>103</b> that a display change trigger is generated. Moreover, the system controller <b>10</b> ends the display operation of a plurality of images when determining in step F<b>104</b> that a display end trigger is generated for a plurality of images.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0296">The triggers related to display operations as such may be generated in response to a user's operation. Alternatively, as described above, the state of a user or the state of the outside world may be detected first, and then based on any predetermined requirements, the system controller <b>10</b> may determine that a trigger is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0297">In the below, described is an example in which a determination is made about generation of a trigger based on the state of a user or the state of the outside world.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0298">When the state of a user is referred to for determining generation of a trigger, the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> is provided for the purpose with, as the operation trigger information generation section <b>16</b>, a vision sensor, an acceleration sensor, a gyro sensor, a body sensor, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0285" num="0299">The vision sensor is assumed as detecting information about the user's sense of sight, and can be implemented by an imaging section if it is disposed in the vicinity of the display section <b>2</b> for capturing an image of the portion of the user's eyes, for example. The resulting image captured as such by the imaging section for the portion of the user's eyes is acquired by the system controller <b>10</b> for image analysis thereof, thereby detecting various types of information, e.g., direction of line of sight, focal length, pupillary reflex, eyeground pattern, blinking of eyelid, and others. These detection results are used as a basis to determine the state of a user and his or her intension.</p>
<p id="p-0286" num="0300">Alternatively, the vision sensor may be configured by a light-emitting section and a light reception section. The light-emitting section is disposed in the vicinity of the display section <b>2</b> for illuminating the portion of the user's eyes, and the light reception section receives the light reflected by the portion of the eyes. For example, light-receiving signals may be used to detect the thickness of the crystalline lens of the user so that the focal length can be detected for the user's eyes.</p>
<p id="p-0287" num="0301">By detecting the direction of line of sight of a user, the system controller <b>10</b> can determine which part of the image displayed on the display section <b>2</b> the user is watching with interests.</p>
<p id="p-0288" num="0302">The system controller <b>10</b> can acknowledge the direction of line of sight of a user as an operation input. For example, the lateral movement of the user's line of sight may be regarded as a predetermined operation input for the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0289" num="0303">Detecting the focal length of a user also enables to determine whether the view the user is watching with interests is of a close range or a long-range. Based on the detection result, control may be accordingly applied, e.g., zoom, scale-up or -down, and focal point change. For example, when a user looks at the view in the long range, telephoto display is accordingly made.</p>
<p id="p-0290" num="0304">Detecting the pupillary reflex of a user enables to determine the brightness around the user if the detection result tells that the state is through, and when the detection result tells that the state is of a monitor display, determine the glaring of the currently-displayed image perceived by the user. Based on results of such determinations, adjustments of intensity and imaging sensitivity can be accordingly performed.</p>
<p id="p-0291" num="0305">Detecting the eyeground pattern of a user helps authentication of the user, for example. Because the eyeground pattern is unique to each individual, the eyeground pattern can be used to identify who is wearing the apparatus before control application specifically for the user, or only any specific user can be allowed to execute the display operation, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0292" num="0306">Detecting the blinking of a user's eyelids enables to determine the level of glaring perceived by the user or the fatigue of the user's eyes. Blinking of eyelids can be acknowledged also as any intentional operation input made by a user, e.g., when a user blinks three times, it will be determined as a predetermined operation input.</p>
<p id="p-0293" num="0307">The acceleration sensor and the gyro sensor each output a signal in accordance with the user's movement. For example, the acceleration sensor is suitable for detecting the movement in the linear direction, and the gyro sensor is suitable for detecting the rotation movement and oscillation.</p>
<p id="p-0294" num="0308">When the acceleration sensor and the gyro sensor are disposed at any specific positions, these sensors are allowed to detect the movement of the user's body or parts of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0295" num="0309">When these acceleration and gyro sensors are attached inside of the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> of a glass type as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, i.e., the sensors are provided for detecting the movement of the user's head portion, the resulting detection information of the acceleration sensor will be about the movement of the user's head portion or the entire body, and the resulting be about the angular velocity and oscillation of the movement of the user's head portion or the entire body.</p>
<p id="p-0296" num="0310">As such, the user's behavior of moving the portion above his or her neck can be detected, e.g., whether the user is looking up or down. When the user is looking down, it may be determined that he or she is looking the view in the close range such as a book at hand. On the other hand, when the user is looking up, it may be determined that he or she is looking the view in the long range.</p>
<p id="p-0297" num="0311">When detecting any user's behavior of moving the portion above the neck, the system controller <b>10</b> may acknowledge that it is the user's intentional operation. For example, when he or she shakes his or her head twice, it will be regarded as a predetermined operation input.</p>
<p id="p-0298" num="0312">Some type of acceleration sensor and the gyro sensor can determine whether the user remains still (not walking), walking, running, and others. It is also possible to detect the state change of the user, i.e., the user who has been standing is now sitting down, or the user who has been sitting down is now standing up.</p>
<p id="p-0299" num="0313">If the acceleration sensor and the gyro sensor are provided separately from a wearable unit placed to the head portion, and are attached to the user's arm or leg, the sensor can detect the user's behavior only of the arm or the leg.</p>
<p id="p-0300" num="0314">The body sensor detects the user's body information, e.g., information about heartbeat (heartbeat count), pulse (pulse count), perspiration, brain wave, e.g., &#x3b1; waves, &#x3b2; waves, &#x3b8; waves, and &#x3b4; waves, or galvanic skin response, body heat, blood pressure, breathing activity, e.g., breathing rate, breathing depth, breathing capacity, and others. Using such information, the system controller <b>10</b> can determine the state of the user, e.g., whether the user is under pressure or excitation, is emotionally calm, or is comfortable or uncomfortable, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0301" num="0315">Using such body information, it is also possible to detect whether the user is now wearing the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b>. When the user is not wearing the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b>, for example, the system controller <b>10</b> controllably puts the state into standby for detecting only body information. When the body information tells that the user puts on the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b>, the system controller <b>10</b> controllably puts the state into power ON, and when the body information tells that the user takes off the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b>, the system controller <b>10</b> controllably puts the state back to standby.</p>
<p id="p-0302" num="0316">The detection information derived by the body sensor can be used for user's authentication, i.e., identification of who is wearing the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0303" num="0317">Note here that the body sensor may be disposed inside of the wearable frame of the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> of a glass type, for example. With such a disposition, the body sensor may be allowed to detect the information about the user's head portion on the sides or in the rear. Alternatively, the body sensor may be provided separately from the wearable frame of the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b>, and attached to any predetermined portion of the body.</p>
<p id="p-0304" num="0318">For detection of the state of the outside world, in the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b>, for acquiring any outside world information, the operation trigger information generation section <b>16</b> is provided with a peripheral environment sensor, an imaging target sensor, a GPS (Global Positioning System) reception section, a date and time counting section, an image analysis section, or the communications section <b>26</b> may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0305" num="0319">The peripheral environment sensor is exemplified by an illumination sensor, a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, an atmospheric pressure sensor, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0306" num="0320">Some type of the illumination sensor can detect information about the brightness of the area around the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0307" num="0321">Some type of the temperature sensor, the humidity sensor, and the atmospheric pressure sensor can derive information for use as a basis to determine the temperature, humidity, the atmospheric pressure, or the weather.</p>
<p id="p-0308" num="0322">With such peripheral environment sensors, the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> is allowed to determine the brightness of the area therearound or the weather if the apparatus is disposed outside. As such, using such information as outside world information, the system controller <b>10</b> can controllably execute the operation of generating a display image signal suitable for the brightness therearound or the weather conditions, e.g., the intensity level is changed in the image based on the brightness therearound, or the tone of the image is changed based on the weather conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0309" num="0323">The imaging target sensor detects information about an imaging target. The imaging target sensor is exemplified by a range sensor, a pyroelectric sensor, and others, and can derive information about the distance to the imaging target or information for finding out what is the imaging target.</p>
<p id="p-0310" num="0324">By detecting the distance to the imaging target, the system controller <b>10</b> can controllably execute the imaging operation and display operation in accordance with the distance. Moreover, when an imaging target is detected as being a human being, for example, the system controller <b>10</b> can controllably execute the operation of generating a display image signal in accordance with the imaging target.</p>
<p id="p-0311" num="0325">A GPS reception section <b>21</b> acquires information about latitude and longitude as the current position. When the latitude and longitude are detected, the GPS reception section <b>21</b> refers to a cartographic database or others, thereby acquiring information about the point at the current position, i.e., in the vicinity of the point. For reference use by the system controller <b>10</b>, the GPS reception section <b>21</b> may be equipped with a relatively-large-capacity recording medium such as HDD (Hard Disk Drive) or a flash memory, and the recording medium may be recorded with the cartographic database so that the information related to the current position can be acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0312" num="0326">In the configuration that the communications section <b>26</b> is provided, even if the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> is not carrying therein a cartographic database, an access may be made to a network server or a device equipped therein with a cartographic database via the communications section <b>26</b>. With such an access, information about latitude and longitude may be transmitted for asking for information in accordance with the current position so that the information on request may be received.</p>
<p id="p-0313" num="0327">The information about the current position includes the area name in the neighborhood of the current position, the names of buildings, facilities, shops, stations, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0314" num="0328">The information about the current position also includes the type of buildings, e.g., park, theme park, concert hall, theater, movie theater, sports facility, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0315" num="0329">The information about the current position also includes the type or name of nature, e.g., seashore, sea, river, mountain-ringed region, mountain peak, forest, lake, plain, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0316" num="0330">As information about a more detailed position, the information about the current position includes a specific area in a theme park, an audience area in a baseball field or a soccer field, a seating area in a concert hall, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0317" num="0331">With such information acquired about the current position, the system controller <b>10</b> becomes able to controllably execute the operation of generating a display image signal in accordance with any geographic requirements, facilities, and others at the current position and in the neighborhood of the current position. The system controller <b>10</b> also becomes able to exercise control to start or end the display for the specific location.</p>
<p id="p-0318" num="0332">The date and time counting section counts the date and time, i.e., year, month, and day, and hour, minute and second, for example. Such a date and time counting section enables the system controller <b>10</b> to acknowledge the current time, day or night, month, season, and others. As such, the system controller <b>10</b> can controllably execute the operation of generating a display image signal in accordance with day or night (time), the operation of generating a display image signal suitable for the current season, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0319" num="0333">If with an image analysis section for use to analyze a captured image, the following various types of information can be detected from a captured image for an imaging target.</p>
<p id="p-0320" num="0334">The imaging target can be defined by type in the captured image, e.g., human being, animal, nature, building, and device. When the imaging target is defined as being an animal, the image may include a bird as being an object, or a cat as being an object, for example. When the imaging target is defined as being a nature, the image may include sea, mountain, trees, river, lake, sky, the Sun, the Moon, and others. When the imaging target is defined as being a building, the image may include a house, a building, a sports arena, and others. When the imaging target is a device, the image may include a personal computer, AV (Audio-Visual) equipment, mobile phone, PDA, IC (Integrated Circuit) card, two-dimensional bar code, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0321" num="0335">For type definition of an imaging as such, a characteristic setting may be made in advance for each of varying shapes, and a determination may be made whether a captured image includes therein an object of any of the shapes.</p>
<p id="p-0322" num="0336">If with image analysis performed by an image analysis section, the movement of an object, e.g., any quick movement, can be detected in the image with a technique of difference detection or others made between frames in the image. If this is the case, it becomes possible to detect any state of capturing an image of any object quickly in motion, e.g., capturing an image of a player(s) during a game, capturing an image of a vehicle(s) on the run.</p>
<p id="p-0323" num="0337">Also if with image analysis performed by the image analysis section, it is possible to detect the peripheral environment around a user, e.g., the brightness can be determined based on the time of day or the weather, and the amount of rainfall.</p>
<p id="p-0324" num="0338">Also if with image analysis performed by the image analysis section, when a human being is an imaging object, it is possible to identify the person from his or her face. As already known, the face of a human being can be constructed as individual characteristic data for use as relative position information about parts of the face. For example, each individual has his or her own unique ratio of Ed/EN, i.e., a space EN from the center of eyes to a nose to a space Ed between the eyes, and ratio of Ed/EM, i.e., a space <u style="single">EM</u> from the center of eyes to a mouth to the space Ed between eyes. As such, the ratios are known as being information not susceptible to changes of a user's outer appearance, e.g., even if a user changes his or her hair style or put on or take off a pair of glasses. The ratios are also known as being information not susceptible to changes with aging.</p>
<p id="p-0325" num="0339">As such, when a captured image includes a human face, the image analysis section can detect such individual characteristic data by analyzing the image.</p>
<p id="p-0326" num="0340">When any individual characteristic data is detected from a captured image, information about a person being the object can be acquired if an HDD or a flash memory is equipped for reference use by the system controller <b>10</b>, and if a human being database is stored in such a recording medium. Alternatively, even if no human being database is provided in the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b>, an access may be made to a network server or a device equipped therein with a human being database via the communications section <b>26</b>. With such an access, information about individual characteristic data may be transmitted for asking for information in need so that the information about a specific person may be received.</p>
<p id="p-0327" num="0341">If any information about people a user has met before, e.g., name and title, is entered into the human being database together with the individual characteristic database, for example, when the user meets any specific person (captures his or her image), the system controller <b>10</b> can make a search of his or her information.</p>
<p id="p-0328" num="0342">If there is a human being database carrying therein information about celebrities together with the individual characteristic data, when a user meets any of such celebrities, the system controller <b>10</b> can make a search of his or her information.</p>
<p id="p-0329" num="0343">Based on detection information derived by the image analysis section as such, the system controller <b>10</b> can controllably execute the process of generating a display image signal specifically for the imaging target. When the image of any specific target or person is captured, a display image signal of highlighting the target may be generated, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0330" num="0344">With the communications section <b>26</b>, as outside world information, various types of information can be acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0331" num="0345">For example, as described in the foregoing, the communications section <b>26</b> can acquire information found by any external device in accordance with information about latitude and longitude or individual characteristic data provided by the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0332" num="0346">Moreover, from any external device, the communications section <b>26</b> can acquire information about weather, e.g., weather information, temperature information, and humidity information.</p>
<p id="p-0333" num="0347">Moreover, from any external device, the communications section <b>26</b> can acquire information about facilities, e.g., information about how to use the facilities, about whether imaging in the facilities is prohibited or permitted, guidance information, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0334" num="0348">The communications section <b>26</b> can also acquire identification information about an external device itself, e.g., type and ID of the device for identification, as a network device, by any predetermined communications protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0335" num="0349">The communications section <b>26</b> can also acquire image data stored in any external device, image data reproduced or displayed by the external device, image data received by the external device, and others.</p>
<p id="p-0336" num="0350">Based on such information that can be acquired by the communications section <b>26</b>, the system controller <b>10</b> can controllably execute the process of generating a display image signal.</p>
<p id="p-0337" num="0351">Such components are provided as the operation trigger information generation section <b>16</b> for detecting the state of a user or the state of the outside world, and based on the detection results, the display is started, ended, or changed (display detail change and area configuration change), thereby implementing appropriate or interesting display operation with no specific user operation.</p>
<p id="p-0338" num="0352">The configuration for detecting the state of a user and the state of the outside world varies more.</p>
<heading id="h-0011" level="1">6. Effects of Embodiment, Modified Examples, and Enhanced Examples</heading>
<p id="p-0339" num="0353">As described in the foregoing, according to the embodiment, the screen area of the display section <b>2</b> partially displays, by a display image signal, an image captured by the imaging function component C<b>1</b> for the view in the field of view direction of a user. At the same time, display is performed by a display image signal provided by any other image sources, e.g., the imaging function component C<b>2</b>, the communications section <b>26</b>, and the storage section <b>25</b>. In such a manner, while looking at the normal view in the field of direction, the user can see images different from the image normally perceived by the user's sense of sight. For example, while looking at an image captured by the imaging function component C<b>1</b> for the view in front of the user, the user can see a telephoto image, a scaled-up image, a special-effect image, an image of the view in the rear, and others by the imaging function component C<b>2</b>. As such, the user can see the image of the view usually not available with the user's normal sense of sight together with any image of the normal view so that the user's visual ability can be enhanced artificially.</p>
<p id="p-0340" num="0354">The external view and configuration of the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> is not restrictive to the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b>, <b>3</b>, <b>4</b>, <b>5</b>, <b>7</b>, and <b>8</b>, and various other modified examples are also possible.</p>
<p id="p-0341" num="0355">An image signal derived by the imaging function component C<b>1</b> or others may be recorded on a recording medium in the storage section <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0342" num="0356">An image signal derived as such by the imaging function component C<b>1</b> may be forwarded from the communications section <b>26</b> to any other devices.</p>
<p id="p-0343" num="0357">Alternatively, for imaging, the configuration may include a microphone for gathering audio in a close range, and an earphone-type speaker section for outputting audio, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0344" num="0358">Still alternatively, the configuration may include a character recognition section for character recognition in an image, and an audio synthesis section for audio synthesis processing. When a captured image includes characters, an audio signal may be generated in the audio synthesis section by reading aloud the characters, and the resulting signal may be output from the speaker section.</p>
<p id="p-0345" num="0359">The display image signal may be a still image. For example, in the imaging function components C<b>1</b>, C<b>2</b>, or others, still images may be captured at any predetermined trigger, and the resulting still images may be displayed on the display section <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0346" num="0360">Exemplified above is the imaging display apparatus <b>1</b> including a wearable unit of a glass-type or a head-wearing type. This is surely not restrictive, and the imaging display apparatus of the embodiment of the invention may be so configured as to include, as the imaging function component C<b>1</b>, first image signal generation means for generating a display image signal based on a captured image signal derived by the imaging section taking charge of imaging in the field of view direction of a user. That is, the configuration will do if at least an image in the field of view direction of a user is captured. As such, a unit equipped with the first image signal generation means (the image function component C<b>1</b>) for a user to wear is not restrictive in type, e.g., a headphone type, a neck band type, and an ear-hang type. Moreover, for a user to wear, the unit may be attached to a normal pair of glasses, visor, headphone, or others using an attachment member such as clip. Moreover, the unit is not necessarily placed to the head portion of a user.</p>
<p id="p-0347" num="0361">It should be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications, combinations, sub-combinations and alterations may occur depending on design requirements and other factors insofar as they are within the scope of the appended claims or the equivalents thereof.</p>
