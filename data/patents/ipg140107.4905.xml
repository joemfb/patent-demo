<heading id="h-0001" level="1">INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority from Japanese application JP2010-236977 filed on Oct. 22, 2010, the content of which is hereby incorporated by reference into this application.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an optical communication card comprising a forward error correction (FEC) function and to an optical transmission device.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Along with the recent popularization of an optical communication technology in various fields such as the Internet (registered trademark) and optical phones, various technologies to realize a long distance transmission and a large-capacity transmission have been developed in an optical transmission system.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">As to the long distance transmission, in general, as a propagation distance becomes longer, a data error in a signal propagation due to an influence of a propagation loss in an optical fiber becomes more prominent. Therefore, an error correction function called an FEC function is effective. The FEC is a technology that correction bits necessary for a data correction are inserted into data to be transmitted on a transmission side, an error detection is performed based on the correction bit on a reception side, and when an error is detected, the data is corrected. Even if a data error occurs, the data correction is possible on the reception side without retransmitting data. Retransmission of data is prevented, and speeding up of the data is possible. At present, several types of FECs are widely used, and a generic FEC (GFEC) using an RS [255, 239] code standardized by ITU-T G.709 and an enhanced FEC (GFEC) standardized by ITU-T G.975.1 are typically used By using various codes such as a BCH [3860, 3824] code and an RS [1023, 1007] code gong the EFECs, multiple types of FECs can be realized.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As compared with the conventional GFEC, the EFEC has excellent error correction capability and can suppress an increase in a bit error rate along with an increase in transmission capacity. The conventional GFEC can correct an error up to approximately an error rate of 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>, and on the other hand, the EFEC can correct an error up to approximately an error rate of 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>by performing Concatenated Coding. Here, the error rate represents a percentage of the number of occurring error bits per one hundred thousand bits of transmitted data. The error rate after the error correction in the correctable range of the GFEC and the EFEC is generally an error rate of 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>or less requested for a high-speed signal such as fiber channel signal. Note that since the EFEC performs two or more times of error correction calculations, power consumption also increases as a throughput of information increases.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">JP-A-2010-118896 discloses a method for suppressing power consumption. JP-A-2010-118896, the number of bit errors of a main signal propagating on an optical transmission line is always monitored, and when the number of bit errors is smaller than the set threshold, an FEC function is not used. Then, the FEC function is necessary when a bit error increases during practical operation, and it is operated. This process permits power consumption of the unnecessary FEC function during practical operation to be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">On the other hand, as to a large capacity, by the multiplexing technology such as me-division multiplexing or wavelength-division multiplexing, an optical transmission system having the transmission capacity of 40 Gbit/s (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;bps&#x201d;) or 100 Gbps has been developed, recently.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, as a technology of performing a path selection by an optical transmission device, there are an optical switching technology of switching large capacity optical signals and a packet switching technology of switching large capacity optical signals on a packet basis. Note that in a current practical technology, when performing a packet switching, it is necessary to convert an optical signal into an electrical signal, to read destination information on each packet basis and to perform the packet switching. Therefore, it is also necessary to speed up a transmission speed of electrical signals in the device. As the transmission speed of electrical signals used in the current packet switching technology, 1 Gbps or 3.125 Gbps is the mainstream. Also, a packet switching element for 6.25 Gbps or up to 11.1 Gbps is currently developed. Since, when an electrical signal propagates through the device, propagation loss is caused by a substrate or connectors, etc., it is necessary to design considering propagation loss and the transmission speed. At present, the standard &#x201c;10GBASE-KR&#x201d; in which a backplane (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;BP&#x201d;) transmission of 10 Gbps is assumed in IEEE802.3ap is standardized including the FEC function, and the standard makes it possible to correct the data error possibly occurring due to the propagation loss and to speed up transmission speed of electrical signals.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is considered to realize, by performing a BP transmission of 10 Gbps using an FEC function, an optical transmission device mounted with a large-capacity switching function having high transmission quality. On the other hand, as to the large capacity, increasing signal processing operation because of adding the FEC function further increases power consumption, in addition to increasing signal processing operation because of a high-speed signal. When the FEC function is not used, power consumption can be reduced over the entire device. Since the transmission quality of a communication network exerts an influence on quality of communication service, it has to be most emphasized. In general, with respect to the main signal of data communication over a network, reliability is emphasized and the FEC function is used to secure the transmission quality in many cases. However, the propagation loss is practically different depending on the transmission speed or each transmission line in the device. Therefore, for example, in a transmission line which is low speed or has small attenuation, the FEC function may be unnecessary. By using the FEC function also for such a transmission line which needs little FEC function, power consumption increases more than necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an FEC function control method disclosed in JP-A-2010-118896, electrical power saving can be realized to some extent. However, since the number of bit errors of the main signal during practical operation is monitored on the decoder side, the FEC function cannot be validated before a bit error occurs. In short, there arises a problem of the maintenance of reliability as the optical transmission device.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">As described above, optical communication having a forward error correction (FEC) function needs a technology for definitely suppressing power consumption due to the use of the FEC function while reducing a rate of the bit error occurrence over a network.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">According to an aspect of the invention, an optical transmission device comprising: multiple optical communication cards, a control card that controls the optical communication cards; and a switch card connected to the multiple optical communication cards, wherein</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">the optical communication card comprises: a signal transmission/reception unit that performs optical-electrical signal conversion for a signal received from outside; a first FEC processing unit that performs FEC processing for a signal from the signal transmission/reception unit; a first function selection unit that selects a type of the FEC processing and controls the first FEC processing unit; and a first control unit that transmits/receives a signal to/from the control card,</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">the switch card comprises, a second FEC processing unit that performs FEC processing for a signal from the optical communication card; and a second control unit that selects a type of the FEC processing and controls the second FEC processing unit and that transmits/receives a signal to/from the control card, and</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">the control card comprises, a data table that associates a transmission line with multiple different types of FEC functions applicable to the transmission line and that stores them; and a retrieval processing unit that retrieves information to be transmitted to at least any one of the first and second control units from the data table.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In a main signal transmission in the device, a transmission speed and a bit error rate of each transmission line in the device may also be here grasped before practical operation by being computed from a signal attenuation amount of a design parameter such as a substrate material, a transmission line length, and a connector. For example, when an error rate after the FEC correction is required to be 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>or less as a system design value, the following FEC function may be selected from among multiple FEC functions so that an error rate after the FEC correction becomes 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>or less with respect to each transmission speed and transmission line: if an error rate is 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>or less, an FEC function OFF, if the error rate is in the range of 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;12</sup>, a first FEC function of which a correction processing operation is little and which reduces the error rate of the above range to 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>after the FEC correction, if the error rate is in the range of 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>, a second FEC function of which a correction processing operation is more than that of the first FEC function and which reduces the error rate of the above range to 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>after the FEC correction; and further, if the error rate is in the range of 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, a third FEC function of which a correction processing operation is more than that of the second FEC function and which reduces the error rate of the above range to 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>after the FEC correction.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A data table as a database for selecting the FEC function may be designed so as to be held in the control card or in some or all of the control units of the optical communication cards, or in both of them, and/or to be held in the external terminal used by a maintenance person when setting the device.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to the present invention, power consumption of the FEC function in the device can be reduced while keeping transmission quality of the main signal in the device necessary for system requirements.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">An optical transmission system using the present invention will be described below. Note that the present invention should not be limited by the embodiment described below.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a configuration of the optical communication card, control card and external terminal according to the present embodiment focusing on a configuration of a main signal processing unit of the optical communication card. Here, the optical transmission device is mounted with one or more optical communication cards and the control card capable of controlling the cards in the device.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The optical communication card <b>101</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> comprises a main signal processing unit <b>103</b> including a selection function about multiple types of FEC functions. The optical communication card <b>101</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> transmits/receives a main signal transmitted over a network outside the device. The optical communication card <b>101</b> comprises multiple optical signal transmission/reception units <b>102</b> that perform optical-electrical signal conversion, and each optical signal transmission/reception unit <b>102</b> internally has a transmission unit and a reception unit. Further, the optical communication card <b>101</b> comprises optical communication card main signal processing units <b>103</b> corresponding to an optical signal transmission/reception units <b>102</b>, respectively. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, only one optical signal transmission/reception unit <b>102</b> and one optical communication card main signal processing unit <b>103</b> corresponding thereto are described.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The main signal processing unit <b>103</b> has an accommodation signal processing unit <b>107</b> monitors a main signal accommodated from outside the device, an interface unit <b>108</b> for transmitting a main signal to other cards in the device, a mapping processing unit <b>109</b> that can convert multiple protocols, and an FEC processing unit <b>110</b> that can select an FEC function OFF or multiple types of FEC functions (for example, that can set an RS [255, 239] code FEC as an FEC function A, a BCH [3860, 3824] code FEC as an FEC function B), insert data correction bit, and process an error detection/correction, and further a function selection unit <b>111</b> that can select different types of functions of each unit <b>107</b> to <b>110</b> in the main signal processing unit <b>103</b>. Further, the optical communication card <b>101</b> comprises a control unit <b>104</b> that controls each function unit, and the control unit <b>104</b> performs, by control signals, processing instruction and alarm/monitoring, etc, of each function unit.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A maintenance person can determine and confirm communication service contents such as transmission speeds and path settings of transmission lines, etc, in the device from the external terminal <b>106</b>. Information from the external terminal <b>106</b> is input to the control unit <b>104</b> via the control card <b>105</b> that performs control of one or more optical communication cards mounted on the device or alarm/monitoring. Further, the control unit <b>104</b> transmits control signals to each function unit so as to realize communication service contents.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As described above, the FEC processing unit <b>110</b> internally has multiple types of FEC functions. Based on the selected FEC function, the unit <b>110</b> detects error from a main signal with correction bits of received signals to correct it, and inserts the correction bits into signals to be transmitted. This process permits the FEC processing unit <b>110</b> to select and process an appropriate FEC function based on the control signals from the control unit <b>104</b>. Here, the multiple types of FEC functions mean multiple FEC functions having different error correction capabilities and throughputs (i.e., power consumption) such as a first FEC function which can perform an error correction up to a constant error rate, and a second FEC function of which a throughput is more than that of the first FEC function and which can perform an error correction up to an error rate higher than that of the first FEC function. Further, the FEC processing unit <b>110</b> also has an FEC function OFF that can be used in the case where an FEC processing function is not performed at all and an error is allowed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Relating to a main signal transmission in the device, a transmission speed and a bit error rate of each transmission line in the device can also be here grasped before practical operation by being computed from a signal attenuation amount of a design parameter such as a substrate material, a transmission line length, and a connector, etc. In this case, by preparing a data table in which a bit error rate is previously grasped and an appropriate FEC function is selected in each transmission speed and transmission line and performing a path setting from the external terminal <b>106</b>, the FEC function can be selected. The appropriate FEC function means an FEC function that adapts to the error rate and reduces an error rate after the error correction to a system requirement value or less. For example, when an error rate after the FEC correction is required to be 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>or less as the system design value, the following FEC function is selected with respect to each transmission speed and transmission line: if the error rate is allowable 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>or less, the FEC function OFF; if the error rate is in the range of 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;12</sup>, the FEC function A that reduces the error rate of the above range to 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>after the FEC correction; if the error rate is in the range of 10<sup>&#x2212;12 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;5</sup>, the FEC function B that reduces the error rate of the above range to 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>after the FEC correction, and if the error rate is in the range of 10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>to 10<sup>&#x2212;3</sup>, the FEC function C that reduces the error rate of the above range to 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>after the FEC correction. An error correction throughput increases in the order of the FEC functions A, B, and C, and although the error correction capability increases, power consumption also increases at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Further, the path setting means a setting performed in order to transmit a main signal propagating at an arbitrary transmission speed over a network from one certain optical signal transmission/reception unit (hereinafter, referred to as a &#x201c;port&#x201d;) to another port. In the device, a transmission line is connected via physical wiring or LSI to each path, and propagation characteristics are different in each transmission line. Therefore, a FEC function is selected from among multiple FEC functions so that an error rate after the FEC correction becomes 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>or less with respect to each transmission line steadily.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">For example, it is assumed that there are two different transmission lines &#x201c;a&#x201d; and &#x201c;b&#x201d; in the device. In the control card <b>105</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in each transmission line (and in each transmission speed), the FEC functions to be selected based on the previously-grasped error rate are stored as an FEC selection data table <b>115</b>. Based on the transmission speed and transmission line information input to the data retrieval processing unit <b>114</b>, the FEC function is selected from the above-described table <b>115</b>. For example, as in the transmission line &#x201c;a&#x201d;, if the error rate increases more as the transmission speed becomes higher, then the FEC function is set in the FEC selection data table <b>115</b> so as to secure the error rate of 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>by using any one of the FEC functions A, B, and C to perform an error correction according to the increasing error rate. For example, as in the transmission line &#x201c;b&#x201d;, if the previously-grasped error rate 10<sup>&#x2212;15 </sup>can be secured in each transmission speed, then the FEC function OFF is uniformly set because the error is allowable.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A maintenance person can also input the transmission speed and transmission line info ion necessary for the data retrieval by performing the path setting from the external terminal <b>106</b>. By the path setting, the input transmission speed information is directly sent to the data retrieval processing unit <b>114</b>. As to the transmission line information, a transmission line retrieval unit <b>116</b> in the external terminal <b>106</b> selects a physical transmission line in the device from a transmission line data table <b>117</b> including database on each transmission line between ports of the device. The selected transmission line information is sent to the data retrieval processing unit <b>114</b> of the control card <b>105</b>. Further, the FEC function for a transmission line to be set in the device is determined based on the FEC selection data table <b>115</b>. Here, a port for inputting information to the optical communication card from outside is defined as an input side, and a port for outputting information to outside is defined as an output side. Further, transmission speed information corresponding to the optical communication card <b>10</b> included in product information transmitted to the control card <b>105</b> from the control unit <b>104</b> can be input to the data retrieval processing unit <b>114</b> for determining the transmission speed. Further, the transmission speed and the transmission line for a main signal connected to two different unconnected ports can be automatically input, by determining from information on the accommodation signal processing unit <b>107</b> corresponding thereto respectively and selecting connection ports so as to connect via the same protocols (Ethernet, etc.) to select the transmission line.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The control card transmits, to the control unit <b>104</b> of the optical communication card, a control signal including the selected FEC function information. The control unit <b>104</b> inputs, to the function selection unit <b>111</b> of the main signal processing unit <b>103</b>, a selection instruction of the FEC function based on the FEC function information in the control signals. As a result, the function selection unit <b>111</b> controls a selector of the FEC processing function unit <b>110</b> to select an appropriate FEC function from among multiple types of FEC functions of the FEC processing unit <b>110</b> and to perform an appropriate FEC processing for the main signal.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Further, by always monitoring an error rate detected by the FEC function unit <b>110</b> relating to the FEC function, the FEC function to be used may also be selected based on the error rate during the operation.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a configuration of the optical communication card. The optical communication card <b>101</b> has the multiple optical signal transmission/reception units <b>102</b>, the multiple main signal processing units <b>103</b>, an optical communication card switching unit <b>201</b> capable of selecting a path of a main signal in the card, and a backplane (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;BP&#x201d;) interface connector <b>202</b> that communicates with other cards. The optical communication card <b>101</b> can transmit a main signal between two arbitrary ports, and transmit/receive a main signal to/from other optical communication cards (not shown) mounted on the optical transmission device via the BP interface. Each card <b>101</b> comprises main signal transmission lines <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, and <b>203</b> for the outside, the inside of the card, and the BP as transmission lines for propagating a main signal between respective function units. The main signal propagates through the main signal transmission line. Further, the card <b>101</b> comprises control signal transmission lines <b>204</b>, <b>205</b>, <b>206</b>, and <b>207</b> for propagating control signals to perform function setting and alarm/monitoring of each function unit.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Here, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, propagation loss versus signal frequency is illustrated. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates, as one example, the propagation loss versus the signal frequency at the time of using an FR4 substrate (general flame-resistant glass epoxy substrate). The horizontal axis represents the signal frequency, and the vertical axis represents the propagation loss per meter. As the signal frequency increases, an attenuation amount of the signal propagating through the substrate increases. Since the signal frequency means the transmission speed in the device, a signal attenuation amount per unit distance becomes larger along with an increase in the transmission speed and a bit error rate increases. Further, as the propagation distance becomes longer, the attenuation amount becomes larger, and therefore, the bit error rate increases as expected. Accordingly, each transmission speed and each transmission line having different characteristics including the propagation distance need to be considered as a parameter to select the FEC function.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">As described also in the background of the invention, a throughput of the correction bits for each FEC function is different. Therefore, power consumption relating to one main signal is different. As a system capacity becomes larger, an effect of reducing power consumption of the FEC function in the device while securing transmission quality necessary for system requirements becomes larger.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates a configuration example of the optical transmission device mounted with the optical communication cards and connected to an external terminal. The optical transmission device <b>401</b> has an in-device BP <b>402</b> that transmits main signals or control signals between various cards, and it can be mounted with the optical communication cards <b>101</b>, the control card <b>105</b>, and a switch card <b>403</b> for changing a main signal path from one card to another card in the device. The in-device BP <b>402</b> has a BP control signal transmission line <b>406</b> that propagates control signals between the control card <b>105</b> and each optical communication card, and a BP main signal transmission line <b>407</b> for propagating main signals between the optical communication cards <b>101</b> and the switch card <b>403</b>. The control card <b>105</b> and the switch card <b>403</b> have a control card BP interface connector <b>404</b> and switch card BP interface connector <b>405</b> for transmitting/receiving signals to/from the in-device BP <b>402</b>, respectively. From the external terminal <b>106</b> to a control signal transmission line for an external terminal <b>408</b> connected to the control card <b>105</b>, the maintenance person can transmit control information on a transponder function for relaying signals or performing port setting to select a main signal path or an interface function via the switch card <b>403</b> to thereby select a configuration of the optical transmission device <b>401</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a configuration example of the state where main signal are transmitted among the multiple optical communication cards in the optical transmission device mounted with the switch card and the optical communication cards. The switch card <b>403</b> comprises a switch card switching unit <b>501</b> (large-capacity switching unit) capable of changing paths of a large amount of main signals from the multiple optical communication cards, a control unit <b>502</b> that controls the large-capacity switching unit <b>501</b>, a main signal transmission line <b>503</b> for propagating the main signal, and control signal transmission lines <b>504</b> and <b>505</b> for propagating a control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For example, when the maintenance person performs two path settings so as to connect both of the ports to transmit one optical signal over a network from the optical signal transmission/reception unit <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>-<b>1</b> to the optical signal transmission/reception unit <b>102</b>-M-<b>1</b> and another optical signal over a network from <b>101</b>-<b>1</b>-<b>2</b> to <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>-N, transmission lines A and B are selected, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a main signal processing control sequence by means of path setting according to the present embodiment. When the optical communication card is mounted on the optical transmission device, mounting information <b>601</b> including a product code indicating a card type and manufacturing date, etc., and when the transmission speed depends on the individual card, product information such as a transmission speed corresponding to the card is transmitted from the control unit <b>104</b> of the optical communication card to the control card <b>105</b>. When the transmission speed depends on the individual card, it can be determined at this step, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates a case where the transmission speed depends on the individual card. By transmitting the mounting information <b>602</b> from the control card <b>105</b> to the external terminal <b>106</b>, the maintenance person can confirm the mounting information on the mounted card. Here, when the multiple optical communication cards and the switch card are mounted on the optical transmission device, the mounting information on all of the cards may be transmitted to the control card <b>105</b>. When the maintenance person performs path setting of a main signal from the external terminal <b>106</b> based on the information, the external terminal <b>106</b> retrieves and selects a transmission line corresponding to a path, and gives path setting information <b>603</b> including the determined transmission line information to the control card <b>105</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the control card <b>105</b> holds as a data table the FEC function information necessary for the transmission speed and the transmission line. The control card <b>105</b> retrieves and selects the relevant FEC function information based on the mounting information <b>601</b> including transmission speed information and the path setting information <b>603</b> including transmission line information. Further, the control card <b>105</b> transmits control information <b>604</b> including FEC function selection information to the control unit <b>104</b> of the optical communication card <b>101</b>. Then, for establishing a connection configuration between the arbitrary main signal processing units <b>103</b> of an optical communication card, or between the main signal processing unit <b>103</b> and the BP interface connector <b>106</b>, the control unit <b>104</b> of the optical communication card transmits a connection instruction <b>605</b> to the switching unit <b>201</b>. When confirming a connection result <b>606</b>, the control unit <b>104</b> then transmits a processing function selection instruction <b>607</b> including the selected FEC function information to the main signal processing unit <b>103</b>. Setting including a selection of the necessary FEC function is performed by the main signal processing unit <b>103</b> based on the processing function selection instruction <b>607</b>, and then the main signal processing unit <b>103</b> sends back a processing function selection result <b>608</b> to the control unit <b>104</b>. The control unit <b>104</b> confirms the main signal processing function to transmit to the optical signal transmission/reception unit <b>102</b> a port setting instruction <b>609</b> to enable the optical signal transmission/reception unit <b>102</b>. The control unit <b>104</b> receives a port setting result <b>610</b> to transmit a final setting result <b>611</b> of the optical communication card <b>101</b> to the control card <b>105</b> therefrom, and further the control card <b>105</b> transmits setting information <b>612</b> of the optical communication card to the external terminal <b>106</b>. As described above, a configuration requested by the maintenance person can be established, and further a configuration of the optical transmission device <b>401</b> can be confirmed. When the multiple optical communication cards and the switch card are mounted, the control card <b>105</b> may transmit the card setting information <b>612</b> after confirming that setting of each optical communication card has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates an embodiment of a configuration in which the optical communication cards, the control card, and the extended switch card are mounted on the optical transmission device. The extended switch card <b>701</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> comprises an extended switch card FEC processing unit <b>702</b>. When the device is made larger using a long distance transmission of BP to increase the capacity by speeding up electrical signal transmission speed to 10 Gbps or more or increasing the number of ports to be accommodated in the device, the long distance transmission of BP increases propagation loss from one optical communication card to another optical communication card via the switch card and a bit error rate increases, and as a result, worsens transmission quality. In the present embodiment, by mounting the FEC function on the switch card, an error correction can be performed once for main signals between one optical communication card and the switch card. The error correction can be performed for main signals also from the switch card to another optical communication cards. Further, in the present embodiment, the extended switch card <b>701</b> comprises main signal transmission lines <b>703</b> and <b>704</b> for transmitting main signals in the extended switch card, and an extended switch card control transmission line <b>705</b> for transmitting control information including information for selecting the FEC function from the control unit <b>502</b> to the FEC processing unit <b>702</b>. As a result, for example, in the case where it is desired that a main signal over the network is transmitted from the port <b>102</b>-<b>1</b>-<b>1</b> of the optical communication card <b>101</b>-<b>1</b> to the port <b>102</b>-M-<b>1</b> of the optical communication card <b>101</b>-M via the extended switch card <b>701</b>, a transmission line for transmitting the main signal in the device which an FEC is to be functioned for is divided into transmission lines &#x201c;i&#x201d; and &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d; illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>

As a result, in the same manner as in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the FEC processing unit can select the FEC function necessary for an error rate required by system specifications with respect to each of main signals between the optical communication cards <b>101</b> and the extended switch card <b>701</b>. By transmitting the control signal including the FEC function selected by the control card to the extended switch card and the optical communication cards, the different FEC processing can be performed for main signals of the transmission lines &#x201c;i&#x201d; and &#x201c;<b>1</b>&#x201d; in the FEC processing units of the cards, respectively. In the present embodiment, a configuration in which the FEC function is not used between the large-capacity switching unit <b>501</b> and the FEC processing unit <b>702</b>. However, by holding a transmission line data table on the transmission line between the units <b>501</b> and <b>702</b> and a necessary FEC function selection data table in the control card <b>105</b> and the external terminal <b>106</b>, the FEC processing can also be performed for main signals by the same process as in the above description.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a main signal processing control sequence of the extended switch card according to the present embodiment.

When recognizing the mounting information <b>901</b>, the control card <b>105</b> selects <b>801</b> and <b>802</b> as FEC selection data tables, and the external terminal <b>106</b> selects <b>803</b> and <b>804</b> as transmission line data tables.
