<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation application and claims priority from U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/801,424, entitled &#x201c;Location of Basestation,&#x201d; by Giustina et al, filed on May 8, 2007, which claims priority to GB Application No. 0702095.1, filed Feb. 2, 2007, and GB Application No. 1114396.3, filed Feb. 2, 2007, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to a basestation for a cellular communication system, and in particular to a method and a system for determining the location of the basestation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are situations in which it may be essential or highly desirable to know the position of a basestation in a cellular communication system. For example, when an emergency call is made through the basestation, it may be a requirement that the emergency services be informed of the location of the basestation, in order that they can attend the emergency. In addition, knowing the location of the basestation, and hence knowing at least approximately the location of a mobile device that has a connection to that basestation, allows the mobile network operator to offer location-based services to the mobile device user.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In existing cellular communication systems, basestations are constructed and commissioned by the mobile network operators themselves, and so the mobile network operators always know exactly where the basestations are located.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Femtocell basestations are now proposed, which can be purchased by consumers for use within their own homes or offices, using their own existing broadband internet connection to provide backhaul into the core network of the mobile network operator. In such situations, the mobile network operator may not know where exactly the femtocell basestation has been positioned.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the present invention, there are provided methods for use in a basestation of a mobile communications network, or in the network itself, for determining information about the position of the basestation itself, and for determining the position of mobile devices having a connection to the basestation. Where the basestation has a small coverage area, information about the position of the basestation can be taken as an acceptably accurate estimate of the position of the mobile device and, conversely, information about the position of the mobile device can be taken as an acceptably accurate estimate of the position of the basestation.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a part of a cellular wireless communications network in accordance with an aspect of the present invention. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a core network (CN) <b>10</b> and a radio network (RN) <b>12</b> of a cellular wireless communications network. These are generally conventional, and are illustrated and described herein only to the limited extent necessary for an understanding of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Thus, the core network <b>10</b> has connections into the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) (not shown) and into a packet data network, for example the internet <b>14</b>. The radio network <b>12</b> may include, for example, a GSM radio network and/or a UMTS radio network, which are then generally conventional. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the radio network <b>12</b> has a number of basestations (BS) <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c </i>connected thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As will be recognized by the person skilled in the art, a typical radio network <b>12</b> will have many such basestations connected thereto. These basestations provide coverage over respective geographic areas, or cells, such that a service is available to subscribers. Often, there is a group of basestations that together provide coverage to the whole of the intended service area, while other basestations provide additional coverage to smaller areas within that intended service area, in particular to smaller areas where there is expected to be more demand for the service. The cells served by the basestations of the first group are then referred to as macrocells, while the smaller areas served by the additional basestations are referred to as microcells.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also shows an additional basestation <b>18</b> that can be used to provide coverage over a very small area, for example within a single home or office building. This is referred to as a femtocell basestation (FBS). The femtocell basestation <b>18</b> is available for purchase by a customer from a general retail outlet and, after purchase, can be connected into the mobile network operator's core network <b>10</b> over the internet <b>14</b>, by means of the customer's existing broadband internet connection <b>20</b>. Thus, a user of a conventional mobile phone <b>22</b> can establish a connection through the femtocell basestation <b>18</b> with another device, in the same way that any other mobile phone can establish a connection through one of the other basestations of the mobile network operator's network, such as the basestations <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the core network <b>10</b> includes a management system (MS) <b>11</b>, which is provided specifically for managing the femtocell basestation <b>18</b> and the other femtocell basestations that are active in the network.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As mentioned above, the macrocell basestations provide coverage to the whole of the intended service area including the location of the femtocell basestation <b>18</b> and the location of the mobile phone <b>22</b> while it is in the coverage area of the femtocell basestation <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">This property is used in aspects of the present invention, as will be described in more detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment of the invention, the customer's broadband internet connection <b>20</b> is provided by an internet service provider (ISP) <b>60</b> over infrastructure provided by a wholesale service provider (WSP) <b>62</b> using DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) technology, the same infrastructure being used to make landline telephone calls. Each broadband line, such as the line <b>20</b>, is identified by a Manufacturers Authentication Code (MAC), while the internet service provider (ISP) knows the customer's IP address. At the same time, the line is identified by a Calling Line Identity (CLI), which is used to indicate the customer's landline telephone number. There is a mapping between the Manufacturers Authentication Code (MAC) and the Calling Line Identity (CLI), and at least one of the internet service provider (ISP) and the wholesale service provider (WSP) is able to associate at least one of the Manufacturers Authentication Code (MAC) and the Calling Line Identity (CLI) with the customer's physical address.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In one embodiment of the invention, therefore, the physical location of the femtocell basestation <b>18</b> can be determined from the IP address that it is using.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In this and other embodiments of the invention, the physical location of the femtocell basestation can be determined periodically, and an alert can be provided when this physical location is determined to have changed. This alert can for example be used to prevent further usage of the femtocell basestation, or to restrict the available services.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Further, since the femtocell basestation is intended to operate with low power, and hence with a short range (for example in the range 10 m-25 m), the physical location of the femtocell basestation that has been determined gives an estimate of the location of any mobile device that has a connection to the femtocell basestation, and this estimate is sufficiently accurate for most purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">More specifically, in one embodiment of the invention, the radio network <b>12</b> includes an SMLC (Serving Mobile Location Center) <b>64</b>, that is able to calculate the location of the femtocell basestation or the connected mobile device, as described in more detail below. Further, the core network <b>10</b> includes a GMLC (Gateway Mobile Location Center) <b>66</b> that is able to store and retrieve location information.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram, illustrating in more detail the form of the basestation <b>18</b>. The basestation has an antenna <b>23</b>, connected to a duplexer <b>24</b>. In the case where the cellular wireless network operates on the frequency division duplex principle, where each device can simultaneously transmit and receive radio frequency signals on a pair of frequencies having a known relationship, the duplexer is effectively a pair of matched filters that allow signals at the system downlink frequencies (that is, the transmit frequencies of the basestation <b>18</b>) to be passed to the antenna <b>23</b>, and allow signals at the system uplink frequencies (that is, the receive frequencies of the basestation <b>18</b>) to be passed from the antenna <b>23</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In addition, in preferred embodiments of the present invention, the basestation <b>18</b> is also able to detect signals transmitted by other basestations, such as the basestations <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c</i>, at allocated system downlink frequencies. For example, the basestation <b>18</b> may be provided with separate receiver circuitry, corresponding to the receiver circuitry conventionally found in a user device such as a mobile phone, or further means may be provided for allowing signals at the system downlink frequencies, received at the antenna <b>23</b>, to be received in the basestation <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The basestation <b>18</b> includes a signal processor <b>26</b>. In the case of signals for transmission by the basestation <b>18</b>, the signal processor <b>26</b> receives the digital signals, converts them to the required format based on the communications standard used by the basestation, and passes the signals to transmit RF circuitry (TX) <b>28</b>. As is generally conventional, the transmit RF circuitry <b>28</b> converts the signals to analog form, and upconverts them to the required radio frequency using an oscillator signal supplied by synthesizer circuitry <b>21</b> at a downlink frequency F<sub>dl</sub>. The RF signals can then be passed through the duplexer <b>24</b> to the antenna <b>23</b> for transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the case of signals transmitted by a mobile device having a connection with the basestation <b>18</b>, the signals are received at the antenna <b>23</b>, and passed through the duplexer <b>24</b> to receive RF circuitry (RX) <b>25</b>. As is generally conventional, the receive RF circuitry <b>25</b> downconverts the signals from the relevant radio frequency using an oscillator signal supplied by the synthesizer circuitry <b>21</b> at an uplink frequency F<sub>ul</sub>, and converts them to digital form. The digital signals are then passed to the signal processor <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In accordance with the present invention, the basestation <b>18</b> uses information derived from signals transmitted by other network nodes, in particular the macrocell basestations <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c </i>and/or any attached mobile phone <b>22</b> within the coverage area of the femtocell basestation <b>18</b>, in order to optimize its own operation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The basestation <b>18</b> operates under the control of a controller <b>27</b>, to which is connected an interface <b>29</b> for a SIM card, or other module containing subscriber data. A suitable SIM card will typically be supplied to the customer on purchase of the basestation <b>18</b>, and this SIM card can be used to identify the basestation <b>18</b> uniquely. As it can contain a SIM card, the basestation <b>18</b> can itself perform some of the functions of a user equipment, and can be recognized as a user equipment by the network.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">There are various reasons why it may be necessary for the network to know the location of the basestation <b>18</b>, and more specifically the location of the SIM card.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">For example, when an emergency call is made by a mobile phone connected to the basestation <b>18</b>, the mobile network operator should preferably be able to indicate the location of the calling device. Where, as here, the femtocell basestation <b>18</b> has only a short range (for example, the range may be approximately 25 m, or the femtocell basestation may provide coverage only within one particular building), it may be sufficient to provide the emergency services authorities with the location of the femtocell basestation.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Also, while the femtocell basestation <b>18</b> may be supplied to the customer by the mobile network operator together with a SIM card, and while it may be advantageous for that SIM card to be removable from the basestation <b>18</b>, in the same way that SIM cards are typically removable from mobile phones, it may nevertheless be highly undesirable for the mobile network operator that the SIM card should be able to be inserted in a different basestation. Similarly, it may be highly undesirable for the mobile network operator that the basestation <b>18</b> should be operated from a non-approved location, for example outside the country where the mobile network operator has an operating license.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flow chart, illustrating a first method for determining the location of the basestation <b>18</b>. In step <b>30</b>, when the basestation <b>18</b> is purchased by the customer, either in a retail outlet or remotely (for example, over the internet), an address is recorded. In step <b>32</b>, this recorded address is stored in a database within the management system, and associated with data that uniquely identifies the basestation <b>18</b>, such as the unique Network Interface Controller (NIC) number associated with the basestation <b>18</b>, or the unique International Mobile Subscriber Identifier (IMSI) associated with the SIM card in the basestation <b>18</b> (if it can be assumed that the SIM card cannot be, or has not been, removed from the basestation <b>18</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In step <b>34</b> of the process, this stored address is activated when the basestation <b>18</b> first connects to the network, informing the mobile network operator that it is operational.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In some cases, it will be acceptable for the mobile network operator to use this stored address as the address at which the basestation <b>18</b> is in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In order to provide a higher degree of confidence that the location of the basestation <b>18</b> is correct, additional steps can be taken, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flow chart illustrating such a process. It will be apparent that certain steps of this process must be performed in the basestation <b>18</b>, while other steps of the process must be performed in the management system <b>11</b> or another network node, while still further steps may be performed either in the basestation <b>18</b>, or in the management system <b>11</b>, or in another network node, as seems appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In step <b>40</b>, the basestation <b>18</b> measures specified parameters in the signals transmitted from neighbouring basestations (for example the basestations <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c </i>in the network illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). For example, the measured parameters may relate to the strengths of specified signals transmitted by such neighbouring basestations.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The parameters to be measured may also include the cell-ID of each of the macrocells seen. This may only allow the location of the basestation <b>18</b> to be determined to a precision of a few kilometers, but this may be enough in some situations.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The basestation <b>18</b> may also detect the SFN-SFN observed time difference between detected signals. This can then be used according to the OTDOA (Observed Time Difference on Arrival) method to derive the location of the basestation <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Thus, the basestation <b>18</b> is able to identify the neighbouring basestations, and to obtain some information from the signals transmitted from those basestations. As mentioned above, the basestation <b>18</b> is preferably able to detect signals transmitted by other basestations, such as the basestations <b>16</b><i>a</i>, <b>16</b><i>b</i>, <b>16</b><i>c</i>, at allocated system downlink frequencies, either by interrupting its own transmissions, or by including separate receiver circuitry that is operational in parallel with the receiver circuitry used for handling calls.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In step <b>41</b>, specified radio parameters are obtained from the macrocell basestations identified by the basestation <b>18</b> in step <b>40</b>. For example, where the parameters measured in step <b>40</b> relate to the strengths of specified signals transmitted by the neighbouring basestations, the parameters obtained in step <b>41</b> may relate to the known powers with which such signals are transmitted by the neighbouring basestations. The basestation <b>18</b> may be able to obtain the radio parameters of neighbouring basestations operated by different operators and using different technologies such as GSM, UMTS, etc. In one example, these measured parameters are transmitted from the basestation <b>18</b> to the management system <b>11</b> for it to use in determining the location of the basestation <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Further, the locations of these macrocell basestations will be known to the mobile network operator, and will be stored in an appropriate form (for example in the form of geographic X-Y coordinates) in a database. In step <b>42</b>, location information is therefore retrieved from the database for the macrocell basestations identified by the basestation <b>18</b> in step <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Based on this information, in step <b>43</b>, the location of the basestation <b>18</b> can be calculated, or at least can be estimated to a sufficiently high degree of accuracy. For example, where the measured parameters of the signals relate to signal strengths, or relate to transit times of the signals, it is possible to calculate or estimate the distance of the basestation <b>18</b> from each of the neighbouring basestations from which such signals are detected. Then, provided there are at least three such neighbouring basestations, it is possible to use the well known technique of triangulation to calculate or estimate the location of the basestation <b>18</b> in the same geographic X-Y coordinates.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In step <b>44</b>, the previously recorded operating address of the basestation <b>18</b>, which may for example have been stored in the form of a street address or postal code, is converted to geographic coordinates in the same coordinate scheme.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In step <b>45</b>, the geographic coordinates of the basestation, as derived in step <b>43</b>, are compared with the geographic coordinates of the user address obtained in step <b>44</b>. Appropriate action is then taken. If the derived geographic coordinates match the geographic coordinates corresponding to the recorded address, to within an acceptable tolerance, then it is assumed that the recorded address is correct. For many purposes, it is then convenient to record the location of the basestation <b>18</b> in the geographic coordinates.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">If the derived geographic coordinates do not match the geographic coordinates corresponding to the recorded address, to within an acceptable tolerance, this implies that the basestation <b>18</b> is being used in a non-approved location. In such circumstances, an alarm signal may be sent to the mobile network operator, and it may be appropriate to discontinue service to the basestation <b>18</b> until its position changes again.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">This process can be performed at regular intervals while the basestation <b>18</b> is active.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A determination as to whether the basestation <b>18</b> has changed its position can then be made by comparing some of the measured parameters, without needing to determine the position exactly on either occasion. For example, detecting the cell-ID of each of the detected neighbour macrocells at different times should still give the same list of neighbour macrocells, and a significant change may be due to a change in the position of the basestation <b>18</b>. In such a situation, a significant change could perhaps also be due to a change in the network planning of the mobile network operator, and so the reliability of this technique is improved by detecting the cell-ID of each nearby macrocells in a plurality of mobile networks.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As mentioned above, another issue is that a SIM card could be removed from a basestation, such as the basestation <b>18</b> at one location, and then inserted in a different basestation at another location, potentially enabling the user to obtain the same services, to the possible disadvantage of the mobile network operator.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a flow chart, illustrating a mechanism for inhibiting the use of a SIM card in another basestation in such circumstances. The mechanism makes use of the unique Network Interface Controller (NIC) number associated with the basestation <b>18</b>, and the unique International Mobile Subscriber Identifier (IMSI) associated with the SIM card in the basestation <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In step <b>50</b>, the basestation <b>18</b> reads the IMSI number of the SIM and the NIC number. In step <b>51</b>, it then associates these two numbers and sends them onto the management system <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In step <b>52</b>, the management system <b>11</b> determines whether this association is allowable. For example, if an attempt is made to transfer the SIM from another basestation <b>18</b>, for example at another location, this results in the new basestation informing the management system <b>11</b> of an association between its NIC number and the SIM IMSI. The management system <b>11</b> therefore checks to determine if the SIM IMSI is already associated with another NIC number. If the SIM IMSI is in fact already associated with another basestation, the management system <b>11</b> inhibits the use of this new basestation. For example, the management system <b>11</b> may send a message to the new basestation to send a SMS message to the user informing them that the basestation is locked and that they should contact the mobile network operator, which they could possibly be permitted to do through the basestation.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">However, assuming that the association is allowable, in step <b>53</b> the management system <b>11</b> returns a message the basestation <b>18</b> that tells the basestation <b>18</b> to allow this particular SIM IMSI number to work only with the basestation having that particular NIC number, thereby locking them together.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">For maintenance purposes there could be provided a maintenance SIM, which might need to be used in many basestations, and which would therefore be recognizable by each basestation, such that the basestation does not go through this SIM/NIC validation process when the maintenance SIM is inserted in the basestation.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The process shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> relies on the basestation <b>18</b> detecting signals from neighbour basestations. However, in other situations, such measurements are not available, either because the basestation is not able to detect signals on system downlink frequencies, or because the macrocell coverage in the indoor environment of the basestation is inadequate. In that situation, the basestation can advantageously request, and receive, measurement reports from one or more mobile device connected to the basestation <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Then, the basestation <b>18</b> can assume that triangulation based on measurements from one or more of the mobile devices is reasonably accurate, for example because the mobile devices may be able to detect signals from a larger number of macrocells. For example, the mobile devices may be able to access GSM macrocell measurements, even when the basestation <b>18</b> is not, either because the GSM signal has better indoor coverage, or because the basestation <b>18</b> is able to detect signals on the UMTS system downlink frequencies but not on the GSM system downlink frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In addition, one of the mobile devices may be provided with satellite positioning system, such as GPS (Global Positioning System) or A-GPS (Assisted Global Positioning System) technology, in which case a highly precise position measurement may be available. Thus, the basestation <b>18</b> can request that any of the connected mobile devices provide it with its location, as determined by the GPS or A-GPS system, and the basestation <b>18</b> can then, as described above, use this location as an acceptably accurate estimate of its own location.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Moreover, when the basestation <b>18</b> already has an acceptably accurate knowledge of its own location, this can be used in order to provide to an A-GPS-equipped mobile phone the information (e.g. satellite information) that the mobile phone requires in order to be able to determine its own location more quickly than standard GPS would allow. For example, the basestation <b>18</b> can start from its registered address, which can be converted to geographical coordinates, and these can be used to determine the satellite information required by the mobile phone.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The basestation <b>18</b> can obtain a position detection by any of the methods described above, for example based on signals from one or more of the connected mobile devices, at a particular time, and can store this location until it is confident that a better signal is available.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">There are therefore provided techniques for determining the location of a basestation <b>18</b> and its attached mobile devices.</p>
