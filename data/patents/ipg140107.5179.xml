<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Embodiments of the present invention generally relate to methods and systems to discriminate and monitor arrhythmias based on cardiogenic impedance.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Atrial fibrillation has been characterized by a rapid irregular heartbeat and can be intermittent or permanent in nature. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is caused by a dysfunction of the heart tissue or nodes, by a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system or by a combination thereof. Individual heart cells are capable of beating outside of the control of the autonomic system. Sometimes, agglomerations of very active cells form and create a focus which results in ectopic beats, namely beats that originate at a location within the heart other than the sino-atrial (SA) node. The junction between the left atrium and the pulmonary vein may be a common location where ectopic beats originate from cell agglomerations.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">If left untreated, ectopic beats may become very frequent and run together with one another, thereby creating atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation involves a chaotic movement of electrical impulses across the atria. Atrial fibrillation may lead to a loss of synchrony between the atria and the ventricles. Once an episode of atrial fibrillation has begun, the atria may quiver or fibrillate at a rate as high as 300-600 times per minute. Such high fibrillation causes a very inefficient filling and emptying process of the atria. The chaotic quivering behavior of the atria may then be transferred to the ventricles and cause the ventricles to lose a regular rhythmic behavior and begin to contract fast and/or in a totally irregular manner. This type of chaotic transfer to the ventricles often gives rise to the fast and irregular pulse rate felt during an AF episode (e.g. between 90 and 160 per minute).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Atrial flutter is another atrial arrhythmia that is characterized by rapid atrial behavior. Atrial flutter may sometimes go unnoticed, yet its onset is often marked by characteristic sensations of regular palpitations. These sensations may last until the episode resolves or until the heart rate becomes under control. Atrial flutter is usually well tolerated initially, as the high heart rate is similar to the heart rate that a person experiences during normal exercise. However, some patients with underlying heart disease or poor exercise tolerance may rapidly develop adverse symptoms which can include shortness of breath, chest pains, light headedness or dizziness, nausea and, in some patients, nervousness and feelings of impending doom. Prolonged fast flutter may lead to decompensation with loss of normal function and potential heart failure. Prolonged fast flutter may manifest as breathlessness, nocturnal breathlessness, swelling of the lungs and swelling of the abdomen.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">IMDs detect various arrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial flutter (A-Flutter), and atrial tachycardia (AT) (hereafter collectively atrial arrhythmias). Arrhythmias are detected based on one or more of ventricular rate, rate stability, and the morphology of the cardiac signal. However, conventional algorithms for detecting arrhythmias experience certain limitations. For example, conventional AF detection algorithms that are based on rate stability may become confounded when an atrial tachyarrhythmia drives a ventricle at a high, but very stable rate. When a patient experiences atrial tachyarrhythmia having a stable rate, the AF detection algorithm may classify the events merely as high rate normal sinus events. Thus, the AF detection algorithm may not declare the events to be pathologic (non-physiologic) and may not deliver a therapy. Further, conventional algorithms may not correctly classify atrial fibrillation that exhibits rate dependent changes in the QRS complex. When a patient experiences atrial tachyarrhythmia having rate dependent changes in the QRS complex, the morphology detection algorithm may classify the events merely as physiologic events and thus, may not declare the events to be pathologic.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">At least certain limitations of conventional detection algorithms extend, in part, from the fact that the algorithms analyze IEGM signals from various combinations of electrodes within and surrounding the heart. IEGM signals are a direct indicator of the electrical activity within the tissue of the heart. While heart tissue electrical activity is a good surrogate of heart electrical behavior, the electrical activity is not directly correlated to the resultant actual &#x201c;mechanical&#x201d; output of the heart. The mechanical output of the heart constitutes the actual cardiac output (CO) of the heart. Cardiac output represents a volume of blood that is ejected from the heart over a period of time. For example, the cardiac output may be quantified in terms of the stroke volume (SV) (ml/heart beat) times the heart rate (beats/minute). While IEGM signals are a good approximation of cardiac output, IEGM signals are not a direct surrogate of hemodynamic performance.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Heretofore, various intra-cardiac indicators (ICI) have been proposed for monitoring cardiac activity, such as heart sounds, blood pressure, and the like. It has also been proposed to monitor certain types of intra-cardiac impedance (within the heart) to derive hemodynamic performance. Intra-cardiac impedance represents impedance that is measured between electrodes that are located within the heart (intra-cardiac electrodes). For example, the intra-cardiac electrodes may be located within the right atrium and the right ventricle with the intra-cardiac impedance measured therebetween. The intra-cardiac electrodes define an intra-cardiac impedance vector that extends through one or both of the atrium and ventricle. The entire intra-cardiac impedance vector or at least a substantial majority of the intra-cardiac impedance vector lies within, and extends through, the blood pool in the chambers of the heart.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Intra-cardiac impedance exhibits a high value when the associated heart chamber(s) are in a systole state. The intra-cardiac impedance exhibits a low value when the associated heart chamber(s) are in a diastole state. As the corresponding heart chambers transition between systole and diastole, the impedance waveform moves between peaks and valleys. The intra-cardiac impedance waveform has not proven to be a good surrogate of stroke volume or hemodynamic performance. One limitation of the intra-cardiac impedance waveform arose from the fact that the intra-cardiac impedance vector extends through multiple chambers of the heart. Thus, each measurement of intra-cardiac impedance includes components from individual chambers of the heart, not the overall cooperative effect of all of the heart chambers.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Presently, implantable devices have been proposed that record IEGM signals when AF episodes are identified. However, the IEGM signals alone do not entirely reflect the true mechanical hemodynamic performance of the heart. For example, the IEGM signals may indicate that a substantial AF episode occurred, yet the episode may be of a nature in which the hemodynamic performance has not been significantly diminished from normal hemodynamic performance. Alternatively, in certain AF episodes, the corresponding IEGM signal may indicate the episode to be of nominal significance, while the underlying mechanical behavior of the heart results in substantial diminished hemodynamic performance. IMDs that record only IEGM signals do not necessarily inform a physician of the true mechanical behavior of the heart during a corresponding episode. Given the potential limited correlation between IEGM signals and mechanical hemodynamic performance, it has been difficult to assess an appropriate therapy or ablation.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A need exists for an IMD that stores information directly correlated to the hemodynamic performance of the heart during AF and atrial flutter events.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A need remains for improved techniques for implantable medical devices to detect and accurately characterize atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings which form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration specific embodiments in which the present invention may be practiced. These embodiments, which are also referred to herein as &#x201c;examples,&#x201d; are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention. It is to be understood that the embodiments may be combined or that other embodiments may be utilized, and that structural, logical, and electrical variations may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, embodiments may be used with a pacemaker, a cardioverter, a defibrillator, and the like. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is defined by the appended claims and their equivalents. In this document, the terms &#x201c;a&#x201d; or &#x201c;an&#x201d; are used, as is common in patent documents, to include one or more than one. In this document, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is used to refer to a nonexclusive or, unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, hemodynamic stability is monitored through cardiogenic impedance which is used as a surrogate for hemodynamic performance. The cardiogenic impedance is analyzed during an episode of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. When the cardiogenic impedance confirms atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, the system may record various waveforms and signals such as the atrial IEGM signals, the ventricular IEGM signals and corresponding hemodynamic performance waveforms during the episode. The waveforms are stored within the implantable device and subsequently transmitted to an external device for offline analysis. By saving the foregoing signals and waveforms, once an AF or atrial flutter episode has been confirmed through cardiogenic impedance, a record of the event is saved for the physician to later analyze. Otherwise, an acute AF episode may cease and a patient may recover, previously rendering it difficult for physicians to figure out what happened.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Embodiments of the present invention may derive the cardiogenic impedance from an LV-to-CAN vector which affords a good surrogate for aortic blood flow. The LV-to-CAN vector does not cross the intra-cardiac blood flow where blood flow changes beat by beat. The LV-to-CAN vector enables direct measurement of the blood flow through the aortic vessel, bypassing the intra-cardiac blood pool, and thus cardiogenic impedance measurement affords an accurate measure that is closely correlated to hemodynamic performance.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the context of this application, the term &#x201c;impedance&#x201d; refers to the relatively low frequency component of the impedance. The impedance is calculated as z=u/i, where u is the measured voltage and i is the applied excitation current.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The term &#x201c;extra-cardiac impedance&#x201d; is the impedance measured between electrodes that are located outside of the four chambers of the heart. Extra-cardiac impedance is measured along an impedance vector that extends through at least a portion of the greater vessels. The &#x201c;extra-cardiac impedance&#x201d; may be described as having an offset generally known as Zo. Zo is typically in the range of 30 to 100 ohms. Riding on top of the offset Zo is a signal that is modulated by respiration and ejection of blood into the greater vessels, &#x394;Z. &#x394;Z decreases with each systolic ejection because blood injected into the great vessels has a lower impedance that the surrounding tissue. The great vessels are juxtapositioned between the measuring electrodes. In addition, the process of breathing modulates the signal as well because the electrodes move with each breath and because air is brought into the lungs raising the impedance with each inspiration. These relatively low frequency signals may be high pass filtered at about 0.7 to reject respiration which typically has frequency components of less than 0.2 hertz while the cardiac ejections have frequency components starting at about 1 hertz to about 14 hertz. The cardiac component of &#x394;Z is typically in the range about 0.5 to 4% of Zo and is in the range of 0.25 to 2 ohms.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The term &#x201c;hemodynamic performance&#x201d; is comprised of at least one or more of cardiac output, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, contractility, stroke volume, systolic time, Q-wave to onset of systole, QRS to onset of systole and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The term &#x201c;cardiac pacing conditions&#x201d; includes one or more of &#x394;V delay, V-V delay, stimulation rate, stimulating electrodes chosen for actuating pacing, stimulation lead configuration and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The term &#x201c;cardiac indicator&#x201d; (CI) includes extra-cardiac and intra-cardiac indicators.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a graphical representation of the upper torso of a human. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates various locates at which electrodes may be located outside of, but proximate to the heart, as well as at locations outside and remote from the heart. Electrodes are positioned at these locations to measure extra-cardiac impedance. An IMD or an external PSA analyzer then performs a hemodynamic assessment based on the impedance measurements. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the heart <b>110</b> between the left and right lungs <b>112</b> and <b>114</b>. The direction of blood flow is noted by various arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> also illustrates a portion of the greater vessels (generally denoted at <b>116</b>) through which blood flows during entry to and exit from the heart <b>110</b>. The greater vessels <b>116</b> generally include the superior vena cava (SVC) <b>118</b>, the aorta <b>128</b>, the pulmonary arteries <b>120</b> and <b>122</b>, and the pulmonary veins <b>124</b> and <b>126</b>. The greater vessels also include the left and right brachiocephalic arteries and veins, the left common carotid artery and left subclavian artery (not shown) which branch from the aorta <b>128</b>. The heart <b>110</b> includes left and right atrium <b>130</b> and <b>132</b>, and left and right ventricles <b>134</b> and <b>136</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In accordance with embodiments described herein, a lead assembly of one or more leads is provided having electrodes positioned inside and outside of the heart <b>110</b>. Intra-cardiac (IC) electrodes are located within one or more chambers of the heart, such as pacing, defibrillation or CRT electrodes. The IC electrodes sense IEGM signals and deliver therapies when an arrhythmia is identified that warrants therapy. Examples of IC leads and IC electrodes are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>. The electrodes outside the heart are located such that at least a portion of the greater vessels <b>116</b> are interposed between the electrodes. By way of example, EC electrode may be positioned at the SVC <b>118</b>, as denoted at EC electrode location <b>140</b>. When an electrode is positioned at location <b>140</b>, the electrode is outside of the heart <b>110</b>, but proximate to the SVC <b>118</b>, as well as proximate to the aorta <b>128</b>, pulmonary veins <b>122</b> and pulmonary arteries <b>126</b>. A second electrode may be located in a subcutaneous subclavical area, such as denoted at <b>142</b>. Location <b>142</b> is remote from the heart <b>110</b> and, by way of example may correspond to the position at which an IMD is located. The housing or case of the IMD may be configured to function as an electrode to, among other things, detect impedance and/or sense cardiac activity.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Electrodes at locations <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> form an ECI vector <b>144</b> there between. The electrodes at locations <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> may be bipolar, mono-polar, tri-polar and the like. The ECI vector <b>144</b> extends through a substantial portion of the aorta <b>128</b>, as well as the pulmonary veins and arteries <b>122</b> and <b>126</b>, and other portions of the greater vessels <b>116</b>. The ECI vector <b>144</b> may be referred to as an aorta-centric ECI vector due to the correlation of the vector <b>144</b> and the aorta <b>128</b>. Electrodes at locations <b>140</b> and <b>142</b> are both outside of the four chambers <b>130</b>, <b>132</b>, <b>134</b> and <b>136</b> of the heart <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Optionally, an electrode may be located within a coronary vein that passes along the heart wall, where this electrode is positioned to be outside of, but adjacent to, the left ventricle <b>134</b>. By way of example, an electrode located in the coronary vein may be positioned at location <b>146</b>. When an electrode is positioned in the coronary vein proximate to the left ventricle at location <b>146</b>, an ECI vector <b>148</b> may be created between electrodes at locations <b>142</b> and <b>146</b>. The ECI vector <b>148</b> may be referred to as a pulmonary-centric ECI vector due to the correlation of the vector <b>148</b> and the pulmonary veins and arteries <b>120</b> and <b>124</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Alternatively, the electrode within the coronary vein may be shifted further along the coronary vein to a position proximate to location <b>150</b> and configured to operate with an electrode at location <b>140</b> at the SVC to form an ECI vector <b>152</b>. The vectors <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>152</b> substantially extend through non-cardiac tissue such that impedance variations that are detected along the vectors <b>144</b>, <b>152</b> and <b>148</b> correlates closely to changes in the volume of blood flow through the greater vessels <b>116</b>. As a further option, a combination of the vectors <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>152</b> may be used to measure impedance. As a further option, alternative ECI vectors may be used in place of, or in combination with, the ECI vectors <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>152</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Impedance measurements detected along ECI vectors <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>152</b> closely correlate to hemodynamic performance and the mechanical behavior of the heart. In general, tissue has higher resistance than blood. During systole, blood is injected into the thoracic periphery (which includes the greater vessels). Hence, the tissue of the greater vessels between the extra-cardiac electrodes (such as at locations <b>140</b>, <b>142</b>, <b>146</b> and <b>150</b>) becomes engorged with blood. Thus, the impedance along the ECI vectors <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>152</b> decreases. During diastole, the amount of blood in the greater vessels decreases. Hence, the impedance along the ECI vectors <b>144</b>, <b>148</b> and <b>152</b> increases. Impedance measurements along the ECI vectors <b>144</b>, <b>152</b> and <b>148</b> increase and decrease based upon the amount of blood that is injected into the greater vessels <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Next, embodiments, alone or in combination with IEGM signals, are described that utilize the ECI to discriminate AF and A-Flutter and monitor patient symptoms during AF and A-Flutter episodes.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, processes and systems are described by which baseline ECI waveforms, HDP patterns, blood pressure and stroke volume (collectively &#x201c;hemodynamic patterns&#x201d;) are calculated based on ECI measurements obtained during normal blood flow. The baseline hemodynamic pattern(s) of a patient is determined and compared to subsequent hemodynamic patterns from current ECI impedance measurements at various times in connection with different episodes. For example, baseline and current HDP patterns of a patient may be assessed in connection with determining whether to declare a potential atrial arrhythmia, and if so, what type of arrhythmia.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates a process for collecting baseline extra-cardiac impedance measurements and developing baseline parameters for subsequent use during operation and analysis of hemodynamic performance. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, beginning at <b>210</b>, the process collects baseline ECI measurements over a predetermined period of time from two or more impedance electrodes located outside of the heart. The ECI measurements are taken in connection with an ECI vector that extends through at least a portion of the greater vessels surrounding the heart.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a baseline ECI waveform <b>310</b> produced from ECI measurements over a predetermined time period. The ECI waveform <b>310</b> is associated with a normal heart having no arrhythmia and exhibiting a physiologic (healthy) hemodynamic performance pattern or behavior over time. The ECI waveform <b>310</b> is shown for a series of four cardiac cycles, but may be longer or shorter. The vertical axis in the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> corresponds to an impedance difference &#x394;Z. Consistent with impedance cardiography, the axis for &#x394;Z represents a decrease in impedance when moving upward. Therefore, the abscissa is inverted. The ECI waveform <b>310</b> includes peaks <b>312</b>-<b>315</b> that are generally evenly spaced from one another by an interval <b>316</b>. Each of the peaks <b>312</b> has peak to peak amplitude <b>318</b> between the positive peaks <b>312</b>-<b>315</b> and the preceding corresponding minimal peaks (valleys) <b>320</b>-<b>323</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the peak to peak amplitudes or distances <b>318</b> are substantially similar for each heart cycle. A bracket <b>325</b> denotes the interval between the peaks <b>312</b> and <b>313</b>. During normal cardiac behavior, the waveform pattern of &#x394;Z within the region <b>325</b> may exhibit relatively small changes in amplitude with no or few shifts in the slope or direction of &#x394;Z. It should be realized that the intervals <b>316</b> may not be the same and the peak to peak amplitudes <b>318</b> may not be the same, yet the heart may still be healthy and exhibiting a normal hemodynamic performance. The waveform <b>310</b> is also modulated by breathing because the intra-thoracic pressure changes. These minor changes may be averaged out over several respiratory cycles or the signals may be sampled with the peaks and valleys identified on the respiratory component of the &#x394;Z waveform. Either method is useful for working with the respiratory variations in the cardiac &#x394;Z waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, once the ECI waveform <b>310</b> is obtained at <b>210</b>, flow moves to <b>212</b>. At <b>212</b>, the process analyzes a predetermined set of parameters associated with the ECI waveform <b>310</b> to determine baseline ECI values. The baseline ECI values are used to define desired characteristics of a baseline ECI waveform or pattern. By way of example, the parameters may correspond to i) the peak to peak amplitude <b>318</b>, ii) the interval <b>316</b>, iii) the number of slope changes within the inter-peak region associated with bracket <b>325</b> and the like. The parameters may also include a measure of the regularity or stability of the ECI waveform or waveform. The regularity represents the symmetry within the waveform for successive heart cycles. For example, the symmetry may be based on whether adjacent peaks or a series of peaks are separated by intervals <b>316</b> that are within a desired range from one another. The symmetry may be based on whether the intervals <b>316</b> are generally equal in length and/or fall within interval threshold limits. The symmetry may be based on whether the peak to peak amplitudes are within a desired range from one another, or are generally equal, and/or fall within peak to peak amplitude threshold limits. A combination of the above factors may be used, as well as other factors, to measure the regularity of an ECI waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Once the baseline ECI values are obtained at <b>212</b>, the baseline ECI values are recorded at <b>216</b> along with any other baseline information related to hemodynamic performance. For example, an optional operation may be provided at <b>214</b> where the blood pressure is directly measured and hemodynamic performance calculated. When the blood pressure is measured at <b>214</b>, the blood pressure may be recorded at <b>216</b> along with the corresponding baseline ECI values. At <b>216</b>, the heart rate at the baseline ECI values may also be recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Next, at <b>218</b>, ECI thresholds are set based upon the baseline ECI values. ECI thresholds may represent limits that, when exceeded, are indicative of unduly low or otherwise unacceptable hemodynamic performance. For example, when the peak to peak distance or amplitude is measured during a normal heart cycle, a peak to peak (P-P) threshold may be set as a percentage of the normal or baseline peak to peak amplitude. Thereafter, when a subsequently measured ECI waveform exhibits P-P amplitude that falls below the baseline P-P amplitude by more than the ECI threshold, the hemodynamic performance may be deemed too low or insufficient. As a further option, a regularity threshold may be established in which peaks in the ECI waveform must occur within some percentage of the baseline regularity. Otherwise, the system may determine that insufficient hemodynamic performance is being delivered and therapy is warranted. The ECI thresholds and baseline ECI values are used in various applications and systems as described hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Embodiments are described herein, whereby impedance is measured along various ECI vectors to detect changes in the impedance of the greater vessels around the heart. Optionally, the changes in impedance may be recorded as one or more impedance profiles reflecting changes in impedance along one or more ECI vectors over the cardiac cycle. The impedance profile(s) may be used to access hemodynamic performance, such as cardiac output over one or more cardiac cycles. The hemodynamic performance represents an amount (e.g. in ml) of blood output by the heart per unit of time (e.g. per minute). For example, if an individual's stroke volume is 20 ml/stroke and the heart rate was 60 beats per minute, then the hemodynamic performance would be 120 ml/minute. The hemodynamic performance is a function of the change in impedance &#x394;Z along an ECI vector. For example, the hemodynamic performance (HDP) is proportional to &#x394;Z times the mechanical heart rate (also referred to as the pulse rate). Embodiments calculate HDP based on the &#x394;Z and mechanical HR.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates an example of an ECI waveform E<b>10</b> that may be collected as a current ECI measurement during pathologic or abnormal hemodynamic performance. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the ECI waveform <b>410</b> exhibits a known pathologic pattern referred to as an &#x201c;alternan&#x201d;. The &#x201c;alternan&#x201d; hemodynamic performance is characterized by the repetitive pattern of a series of large peaks <b>412</b>-<b>414</b> that are separated by smaller local peaks <b>415</b> and <b>416</b>. When the current ECI waveform <b>410</b> is collected, it is analyzed, and the peak to peak amplitude <b>418</b> is measured for certain peaks (e.g. <b>412</b> and <b>413</b>). A smaller peak to peak amplitude <b>420</b> will be measured in connection with the local peaks <b>415</b> and <b>416</b> and identified to occur between the larger peaks <b>412</b>-<b>414</b>. When this repetitive pattern of larger and smaller peaks is identified, it is classified as alternan hemodynamic performance which is abnormal.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a process carried out in accordance with an embodiment to discriminate and monitor patient symptoms indicative of atrial fibrillation and/or atrial flutter through the use of cardiogenic impedance as a confirmation analysis. Beginning at <b>910</b>, the IMD or external device collects intra-cardiac electrogram (IEGM) signals from an electrode configuration with at least one cardiac electrode in contact with the heart. The IEGM signals may be ventricular or atrial. At <b>912</b>, the IEGM signals are analyzed to determine whether the IEGM signals are indicative of atrial fibrillation, an atrial arrhythmia, such atrial flutter and the like. The analysis at <b>912</b> may determine whether the heart rate is above an AF rate threshold, or the heart rate is above an A-Flutter threshold. For example, the rate within the atrium may be analyzed to determine whether the atrial rate exceeds one or more predetermined thresholds. Optionally, other characteristics of the IEGM signals may be analyzed, such as P-wave shape, T-wave shape, P-wave timing/absence, ST elevation and other morphology indicators. When the intra-cardiac electrograms are not indicative of AF or A-Flutter, flow passes back to <b>910</b> to collect new IEGM signals. However, when at <b>912</b> the atrial rate exceeds the one or more predetermined thresholds, flow moves to <b>916</b> to begin a cardiogenic impedance based confirmation process.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">At <b>916</b>, the IMD or external device detects cardiogenic impedance from a configuration of EC and RC electrodes that form one or more ECI vectors passing through the greater vessels. The collecting at <b>910</b> and ECI measurements at <b>916</b> may be for a simple cardiac cycle or for a series of cardiac cycles. Once ECI measurements are collected for a predetermined period of time, flow moves to <b>918</b> where the current ECI waveform collected at <b>916</b> is compared with a previously acquired baseline ECI waveform. When the current and baseline ECI waveforms correlate with one another by an amount within a predetermined correlation threshold, then it is determined at <b>918</b> that AF or A-Flutter is not confirmed. Instead, it is determined that sufficient hemodynamic performance exists. Hence, flow passes along 920 back to <b>910</b>. When the current ECI waveform diverges sufficiently from the baseline ECI waveform, this non-correlation may be an indication of insufficient hemodynamic performance depending upon the degree of non-correlation. The degree on non-correlation between current and baseline ECI waveforms may be quantified as a percentage, such as 20% non-correlation, 50% non-correlation, 80% correlation, etc. The degree of non-correlation, in combination with the heart rate detected by the IEGM signals, may be used to discriminate between AF and A-Flutter. For example, 70% correlation (30% non-correlation) and a heart rate between 90 and 160 bpm may be indicative of A-Flutter. Alternatively, 30% correlation (70% non-correlation) and a heart rate above 160 bpm may be indicative of AF. Hence, when the relation between the current and baseline ECI signals differs sufficiently in a predetermined manner, AF or A-Flutter is confirmed at <b>918</b>. When the process confirms a potential AF at <b>918</b>, flow moves to <b>922</b>. When the process confirms a potential A-Flutter, flow moves to <b>930</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, flow diverges at <b>918</b> depending upon whether a potential AF or a potential A-Flutter was being confirmed (to <b>922</b> or <b>930</b>). Optionally, the operations at <b>922</b> to <b>928</b> may be performed when actual AF or A-Flutter are declared to occur.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">At <b>922</b>, the IMD measures the three dimensional posture movement of the patient. At <b>922</b>, the system analyzes three dimensional posture movement to determine prior patient activity such as whether the patient abruptly switched to a horizontal position and has remained stationary for a predetermined number of seconds (e.g. 10 or 30 seconds) which may be indicative of fainting. Alternatively, the movement and posture or orientation of the patient may be analyzed for a preceding period of time (e.g. the last 10 seconds, 30 seconds or 1 minute) to determine whether the patient's behavior is associated with behavior indicative of AF or A-Flutter, or simply exercise. An accelerometer or motion detector may be used to measure the 3D posture movement to determine if the patient is oriented horizontal or standing up. The motion detector may be used to determine whether the patient is moving, and if not, how long it has been since the patient has last moved (e.g., 10 sec., 30 sec.). A horizontal position and/or lack of motion may indicate that the patient has fainted or is otherwise unconscious.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">At <b>924</b>, the system measures the breathing rate of the patient. The breathing rate may be determined by impedance measurements, motion signals, and the like. At <b>926</b>, the hemodynamic parameters and values are saved in a portion of memory for longer term storage. The information saved may include, among other things, the AF or A-Flutter waveform (such as acquired through an atrial IEGM, a ventricular IEGM, from the ECI measurements and the like). At <b>928</b>, the system transmits the saved hemodynamic information, IEGM signals, AF waveform and episode information to an external processing unit.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates a process carried out by one of an implantable device and an external programmer to analyze AF and A-Flutter episodes. Beginning at <b>1010</b>, the process receives a current ECI waveform associated with an episode of interest. The current ECI waveform may represent a waveform over a predetermined period of time corresponding to the change in cardiogenic impedance. The current ECI waveform may be for a single cardiac cycle or an ensemble average for a series of cardiac cycles. At <b>1012</b>, access is obtained to a baseline or pre-stored ECI waveform is obtained from memory. The baseline ECI waveform may be obtained as a baseline during a time when the patient is not experiencing AF or A-Flutter. The background ECI waveform may be for a predetermined of time or may be created from an average of multiple ECI waveforms obtained at different times, each of which are associated with normal rhythmic cardiac behavior. The baseline ECI waveform may be from the present patient, from a group of patients or may be a simulated pattern not from actual patients.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">At <b>1014</b>, the process identifies differences between the current ECI waveform and the baseline ECI waveform. For example, the differences may be obtained through an auto-correlation technique and the like. The identification at <b>1014</b> may also include analysis of the current ECI waveform alone or in combination with a baseline ECI waveform in an effort to identify alternates or other predefined waveform patterns known to be associated with AF or A-Flutter. At <b>1016</b>, the ventricular IEGM signals are analyzed to obtain ST elevations within the IEGM signals. ST elevations are accessed to determine whether potential acute ischemia or a chronic myocardial infarction (MI) exists.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">At <b>1018</b>, the current ECI waveform is analyzed to identify peaks and valleys within the waveform. The peaks of the ECI waveform are compared and the valleys of the ECI waveform are compared in an effort to determine whether there are progressive trends in the ECI waveform. For example, the amplitude of the ECI waveform may progressively decrease. Alternatively, the amplitude of the ECI waveform may remain steady, yet the area under each peak within the ECI waveform may decrease. These changes in the shape of the ECI waveform may be indicative of AF or A-Flutter.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">At <b>1020</b>, the process measures the beat by beat stroke volume during the episode. The stroke volume (SV) may be indirectly calculated through the ECI waveform which may be utilized as a surrogate for stroke volume. Once the beat by beat stroke volume is calculated from the ECI waveform, the current stroke volume is compared to a previously acquired stroke volume that was acquired during a normal non-AF episode. Comparing the current stroke volume to a previous normal stroke volume enables the system to better characterize AF episodes and A-Flutter episodes as valid or incorrect.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">At <b>1022</b>, an AF stability index is determined from the above discussed waveforms and parameters, such as from the IEGM and ECI waveforms, the stroke volume measurements, the ST elevation and the breathing rate during the AF episode. At <b>1024</b>, it is determined whether differences between current and baseline ECI waveforms exceed corresponding thresholds. If the threshold(s) are exceeded, flow moves to <b>1026</b>. Otherwise flow moves to <b>1028</b>. At <b>1026</b>, the AF mechanism is similar in the current and baseline ECI waveforms. At <b>1028</b>, the AF mechanism is not similar in the current and baseline ECI waveforms. At <b>1030</b>, a new arrhythmia episode log is created and the method saves A-IEGM, V-IEGM, and ECI waveforms and any analysis results.</p>

<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates a flow chart for a method implemented in accordance with an embodiment. At <b>1102</b>, the IMD detects AF episodes over time (e.g., over day, week, month, year) and stores AF episode information. The AF episode information may include the IEGM signal during the episode, during onset of the episode and during completion of the episode. The AF episode information may include number of AF episodes, the duration of the AF episodes, the AF burden (e.g., percentage of time in AF out of a predetermined period of time). At <b>1102</b>, the IMD also saves, for each AF episode, hemodynamic performance (HDP) information. The HDP information may include hemodynamic performance among other things, as well as contractility, strength of contractions, consistency of contractions and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">At <b>1104</b>, it is determined whether the HDP has deteriorated by an amount sufficient to indicate HD compromise. If not, flow returns to <b>1102</b>. If yes, flow moves to <b>1106</b>. HD compromise may be determined when the HDP level falls below a baseline HDP level by a predetermined amount (e.g., percentage or programmed amount). For example, an HDP baseline may be set under physician control or obtained automatically periodically during normal sinus rhythm. Thereafter, each time an AF episode is detected, the HDP is determined and compared to the baseline. When the change in HDP exceeds a threshold, the IMD may output an HDP compromise indication. The compromise indication may be conveyed to a physician. For example the IMD may transmit a series of HDP valves to a physician. The physician may use the HDP valves to determine a change in the prescription medicine (e.g., increase, add, reduce or remove dosage of Digitalis or a calcium channel blocker).</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">At <b>1106</b>, the method may provide a physician with recommendations or medicine related information.

For example, it may suggest adding or increasing dosage of a calcium channel blocker to reduce conductivity of the AV node.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">HDP information and AF episode information may be transmitted from the IMD periodically (e.g., daily) or only when certain criteria are satisfied (e.g., scheduled follow-ups). The HDP and AF information may then be conveyed over a network (e.g., the internet) to a physician, a hospital, a database or central network server. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the IMD <b>822</b> may communicate with a home base RF-wireless transmitter <b>808</b> (e.g., the Merlin&#x2122;@home transmitter).

The HDP and AF information may be sent to a secure internet based data management system <b>802</b>, <b>804</b> (e.g., the Merlin.net PCN system).

<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates a graph plotting an exemplary relation between hemodynamic performance (denoted HDP on the vertical axis) and heart rate along the horizontal axis. The graph <b>1200</b> includes a point <b>1202</b> that corresponds to a base pacing rate of a pacemaker. The graph <b>1200</b> illustrates that the relation between the heart rate and the HDP may differ depending upon the reason for the elevated heart rate. Curves <b>1204</b>-<b>1206</b> plot different relations between heart rate and HDP based on the reason for the reason for the elevation in heart rate. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, curve <b>1204</b> represents physiologic behavior that may occur when a patient is lying down and sleeping, curve <b>1205</b> represents physiologic behavior that may occur when a patient is standing up and is awake, and curve <b>1206</b> represents physiologic behavior that may occur when a patient is exercising.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Heart rate increase due to exercise is generally a normal and healthy physiologic behavior. The relation between heart rate and HDP follows curve <b>1206</b>, in which the HDP continues to improve to a relatively high level that is associated with a relatively high heart rate. A maximum HDP occurs at <b>1213</b> which is relatively distal to the base pacing rate <b>1202</b>. Heart rate increase not due to exercise, and while asleep is generally abnormal and un-healthy physiologic behavior. The relation between heart rate and HDP follows curve <b>1204</b>, in which the HDP does not improve with higher heart rate. A maximum HDP occurs at <b>1210</b> which is relatively close to the base pacing rate <b>1202</b>. Heart rate increase not due to exercise and while awake, falls between curves <b>1204</b> and <b>1206</b>. The relation between heart rate and HDP follows curve <b>1205</b>, in which the HDP improves some with higher heart rate. A maximum HDP occurs at <b>1211</b> which is at an intermediate rate above the base pacing rate <b>1202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In accordance with an embodiment, a method and system are provided to adjust a pacing rate of an IMD based on the ECI measurements to obtain a HDP-related pacing rate that affords a predetermined hemodynamic performance. Optionally, the IMD may receive an output from a motion sensor representing at least one of 3D posture movement and a level of exercise. The IMD adjusts a pacing rate of the IMD based on the ECI measurements and the output from the motion sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">During atrial fibrillation, the ventricles respond sporadically. When the ventricles are paced, the pacing stimulus places the AV node in a refractory state. The heart will exhibit different hemodynamic performance based on the temporal relation between onset of an AF episode and the refractory state of the AV node. By varying the pacing rate, the IMD changes the time period when the AV node is in the refractory state. Thus, by varying the pacing rate, the IMD is also able to impact the hemodynamic performance of the heart. In accordance with embodiments herein, a method and system are provided in which the pacing rate is adjusted in order to improve a level of hemodynamic performance.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> illustrates a process for a method for adjusting the pacing rate in order to improve a level of hemodynamic performance. Beginning at <b>1302</b>, an AF episode is identified. At <b>1304</b>, the IMD delivers one or more pacing pulses or antitachy pacing (ATP) pulses in accordance with a base or preprogrammed rate. At <b>1306</b>, ECI measurements are obtained and a reference HDP level is calculated. At <b>1308</b>, the pacing scheme or ATP scheme is adjusted. For example, the adjustment may represent a change in the pacing rate, a change in the pacing lead configuration, a change in the pacing polarity and the like. Optionally, the adjustment may be to change a number of pulses in an ATP scheme, the delay between ATP pulses, the locations at which the ATP pulses are delivered, the ATP pulse polarity and the like. Once the pacing or ATP scheme has been adjusted, at <b>1310</b>, the IMD delivers one or more pacing pulses or antitachy pacing (ATP) pulses in accordance with the current (adjusted) scheme. At <b>1312</b>, ECI measurements are obtained and a current HDP level is calculated. At <b>1314</b>, it is determined whether the operations at <b>1308</b>-<b>1312</b> should be repeated. The operations at <b>1308</b>-<b>1312</b> are repeated a predetermined number of times in order to obtain a desired number of ECI measurements and HDP levels for different pacing or ATP schemes.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Next, at <b>1316</b> the stored ECI measurements and/or HDP levels are analyzed to identify a preferred ECI measurement and/or HDP level. For example, the preferred ECI measurement and/or HDP level may represent a lowest ECI measurement or highest HDP level. At <b>1318</b>, the IMD is then set to utilize the pacing or ATP scheme that corresponded with the preferred ECI measurement and/or HDP level.</p>
