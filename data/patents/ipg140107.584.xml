<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from Korean Patent Application No. 10-2008-0081478 filed on Aug. 20, 2008 in the Korean Intellectual Property Office, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a fabric treatment machine, and more particularly, to a fabric treatment machine which can effectively treat clothes by properly moving the clothes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Fabric treatment apparatuses include various types of apparatuses for use in homes or in laundries or cleaners for managing or treating clothes such as washing, drying, or smoothing out the clothes such as a washing machine for washing clothes, a dryer for drying wet laundry, a washer dryer equipped with both a washing function and a dryer function, a refresher for refreshing clothes, and a steamer for smoothing out clothes.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In particular, the refresher is a device for refreshing clothes by drying the clothes, perfuming the clothes, preventing the clothes from getting static, or smoothing out the clothes. The steamer is a device for smoothing out clothes by supplying steam. The steamer, unlike an iron, does not involve applying a hot plate onto clothes and may thus be able to smooth out clothes more delicately than an iron.</p>

By using this type of fabric treatment apparatus, it is possible to effectively deodorize clothes and offer the benefits of ironing out clothes.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a fabric treatment apparatus in which a clothes rack can be moved.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention also provides a fabric treatment apparatus which can improve the efficiency of treatment of clothes by moving a clothes rack therein.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a fabric treatment apparatus including a treatment room adapted to receive laundry to be treated; a rack disposed in the treatment room, and adapted to support a plurality of hangers to hang the laundry; one or more electromagnets to apply attraction and repulsion to the clothes rack; and a heating unit adapted to supply at least one of hot air and steam into the treatment room.</p>

<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to the present invention, since a clothes rack on which a number of hangers are hung up moves reciprocally inside a fabric treatment apparatus in a linear path, it is possible to improve the efficiency of treating clothes on the hangers. In addition, since the clothes rack can slide out of the fabric treatment apparatus, it is easy to hang up hangers on the clothes rack. Moreover, it is possible to easily move the clothes rack simply using electromagnets and thus to simplify the structure of a fabric treatment apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">While the present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those of ordinary skill in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the following claims.</p>
