<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Systems, devices, apparatus, and methods of moving a door, over a water conveyances. Locking the door can be by rotating bolt heads attached to cams. Rotating heads causes cams to press the door against tracks. A strip can be compressed between the door and track to prevent flow. Slidable doors can move to allow water overflow. The door can slide so water can flow underneath. A secondary door can slide within an opening in a door. A half panel can have an upper opening located in a wall, to close or allow water flow. A channel can have grooves in sides of an opening, where a door can slide to different heights to close or allow flow.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to water damper controls for storm water treatment systems, manmade ponds and pools, natural lakes, ponds, actuaries and other water ways, and in particular to devices, apparatus, systems and methods of using a damper panel system to isolate a water treatment control structure from unwanted water inflow where a slidable doors can be sealed in place with rotatable cams pushing one side of the door against portions of the tracks, so that operators can unlock the sealed doors and pull out the individual doors by hand when needed, where the doors can slide upward to different height positions, and slide downward to different height position.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are federal clean water requirements that require water bodies such as lakes and rivers must meet strict minimal water quality specifications. To achieve these requirements, stormwater drainage pipes often require treatment before conveying stormwater into receiving water bodies. As a result, a wide variety of technologies have been developed to treat stormwater and improve the water quality. A common variety of stormwater treatment systems are hydrodynamic separators such as baffle type boxes and vortex systems. However, over time stormwater treatment systems often will fill with collected debris and will require service to remove the collected debris.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The servicing of a stormwater treatment structure typically requires the use of a vacuum truck that will suck out the collected solids and water within the structure. After the vacuum truck removes the debris and water from the stormwater structure, the vacuum truck transfers those contents to a processing facility for proper disposal. However, servicing stormwater structures is often complicated by unwanted water flow running into the stormwater structures during the service procedure. This unwanted water flow typically originates from high water levels in lakes and rivers adjacent to the treatment structure, or from an upstream base flow.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">While the vacuum truck is removing water and debris from the treatment structure, water sometimes continues to flow in. Often the amount of water flowing into the treatment structure during servicing exceeds the rate at which the vacuum truck can remove the water. Having water enter the stormwater structure during servicing procedure reduces the effectiveness and efficiency of the service procedure and results with having the vacuum truck to dispose of additional water.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There have been attempts over the years to try to use various damper or gate type systems, such as the aluminum slide and weir gates manufactured by Northcoast Valve &#x26; Gate Inc., and slide gates manufactured by Halliday Products Inc. The common problem with damper or gate systems used in the prior art is that they are either difficult to install and use, or they leak badly. Additionally, these gates are too heavy and cumbersome for a single person to unlock and lift, and instead usually require two or more persons to operate which adds extra expenses and time.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Thus, the need exists for solutions to the above problems with the prior art.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A primary objective of the present invention is to provide devices, apparatus, systems and methods of using door damper systems to isolate waterways, such as storm water treatment systems, manmade ponds and pools, natural lakes, ponds, actuaries and other water ways from unwanted water inflow so that gates can be easily opened when needed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A secondary objective of the present invention is to provide devices, apparatus, systems and methods of using door damper systems in a storm water treatment systems, manmade ponds and pools, natural lakes, ponds, actuaries and other water ways, that will reduce service treatment time and increase the effectiveness of services which will improve the removal efficiency of treatment systems and reduce servicing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A third objective of the present invention is to provide devices, apparatus, systems and methods of using door damper systems in a storm water treatment systems, manmade ponds and pools, natural lakes, ponds, actuaries and other water ways, that are easy to install and use, and will not leak.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A fourth objective of the present invention is to provide devices, apparatus, systems and methods of using door damper systems in a storm water treatment systems, manmade ponds and pools, natural lakes, ponds, actuaries and other water ways, that can be used by a single person to lock and unlock.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A fifth objective of the present invention is to provide devices, apparatus, systems and methods of using door damper systems in a storm water treatment systems, manmade ponds and pools, natural lakes, ponds, actuaries and other water ways, using doors in slidable tracks that dramatically reduce friction to allow the door to be lifted and removed by a single person.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A sixth objective of the present invention is to provide devices, apparatus, systems and methods of using door damper systems in a storm water treatment systems, manmade ponds and pools, natural lakes, ponds, actuaries and other water ways, where slidable doors allow for overflow of water over the door(s).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A seventh objective of the present invention is to provide devices, apparatus, systems and methods of using door damper systems in a storm water treatment systems, manmade ponds and pools, natural lakes, ponds, actuaries and other water ways, where slidable doors allow for underflow of water under the door(s).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An eighth objective of the present invention is to provide devices, apparatus, systems and methods of using door damper systems in a storm water treatment systems, manmade ponds and pools, natural lakes, ponds, actuaries and other water ways, where a half panel door allows for overflow of water over the door.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A ninth objective of the present invention is to provide devices, apparatus, systems and methods of using door damper systems in a storm water treatment systems, manmade ponds and pools, natural lakes, ponds, actuaries and other water ways, where a slidable door can be inserted to slide within a concrete channel opening for overflow and underflow applications.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The novel damper system can include a track that attaches to the inside wall of a separator that is used in storm water treatment systems, manmade ponds and pools, natural lakes, ponds, actuaries and other water ways, with a damper panel that rotatably slides in place.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The external housing of the stormwater vault or treatment structure is commonly made of concrete, fiberglass, or plastic. The damper system track can be installed so that it makes a kind of frame around the inflow and/or outflow pipes and is attached to the inside surface of the treatment structure. A track system can be ideally sized to accommodate the damper panel.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The damper panel can be made of metal, fiberglass, or plastic, combinations thereof, and the like, can have a cam system mechanism along the vertical edges of the panel on one side. On the other side of the panel a rubber seal is continuous along the edge of the panel, going down one side, then across the bottom, and then up the other side. When the damper panel is lowered into the track system to block the pipe it is very loose and does not bind along the track system. When the cams are rotated the mechanism can then force the panel to wedge into the track and compress the rubber seal along the inside surface of the track. Once the cams have wedged the damper panel in place and the rubber seal is compressed against the track, the panel is locked in place and it will not leak water from the pipe into the storm water vault.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The cams can be rotated to either lock the damper panel in place or release the damper panel. The cams can be either rotated by a lever attached to the top of the cam system, or a wrench, or other tools such as but not limited to pliers, pipes, and the like. The wrench can be either hand held or socket attached to the end of a hand held pole. The advantage of attaching the socket to the end of a long pole is that a person does not need to enter the vault to rotate the cams.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The damper panel can have a special lifting point attachment that allows the panel to be lowered into the track system without having to enter the vault. The lifting point would have a slot that would sized to receive an approximately 1&#x2033; diameter ball such as a metal sphere attached to the end of a thin rod, and the rod would be attached to a hand held pole. The damper panel would hang vertically on the end of the hand held pole and the geometry of the sphere in the slot would allow the damper panel to freely articulate on the end of the pole without binding. By this method the damper panel can be easily lowered into the vault and placed into the damper track.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">A plurality of wheels on each side of the panel assembly can allow for the panel assembly to easily ride up and down in the tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The separate rotatable cams in each of the tracks can be replaced by single elongated cams that can have paddle or wedge shapes. Alternatively, the invention can use removable wedges that when driven into place compress and water seal the damper panel in place.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">A preferred embodiment of a damper system for storm water treatment vault structures, can include a frame attached to an inner wall of a vault structure, the frame having an opening therethrough, tracks attached to the frame about the opening, a door having wheels along outer side edges, the wheels of the door being slidably received within the tracks, the door having an open position for allowing water to flow into the vault structure and a closed position for preventing water from passing into the vault structure, and moveable members along one side face of the door for pushing the door against portions of the track to seal the door against water intrusion.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The moveable members can include rotatable cams along perimeters of side edges of the door, the cams having an unlocked position where the door is loosely seated in the tracks and a locked position where the door is pushed against one side of the tracks, wherein the locked position prevents water from passing about edges of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The removable tool can be a hand wrench for rotating the cams from the unlocked to the locked position. The removable tool can be a socket wrench for rotating the cams from the unlocked to the locked position.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The moveable members can be a single elongated rotatable cam on each side edge of the door. Alternatively, the moveable members can include a plurality of rotatable cams on each side edge of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">An elongated seal members between perimeter edges of the door and the one side of the track, can be used wherein the cams in the locked position causes the door to compress the elongated sealing members against the one side of the track so that water is sealed and prevented from entering about the edges of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">A handle can be attached to the door for raising and lowering the door. An elongated tool having an end portion can attach to and detach to the handle. The elongated tool can have a hook end, wherein lifting the handle raises the door from the tracks, and allows the storm water to enter into the vault structure.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A preferred method of locking and unlocking slidable doors in a storm water vault structure in order to service the vault structure, can include the steps of providing a door having wheels on sides of the door, sliding the wheels within tracks against an inlet wall of a storm water structure, providing the sides of the door with rotatable cams, locking the door in the tracks by rotating the rotatable cams so that the cams push one side of the door against a portion of the tracks, and unlocking the door rotating the rotatable cams in a counter direction so that the door against loosely sits in the tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The method can further include the steps of providing elongated gasket members along side edges of the door, and sealing the door against the tracks by the locking of the door which compresses the elongated gasket members.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The method can further include the step of removing storm water in the vault structure after the door is sealed in place with as vacuum truck before physically servicing the interior of the vault structure.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The method can further include the step of selectively locking the door in a lower position wherein water flows over the door. The method can further include the step of selectively locking the door in an upper position wherein water flows under the door.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Another embodiment of the damper system for storm water treatment vault structures, can include a frame attached to an inner wall of a vault structure, the frame having an opening therethrough, tracks attached to the frame about the opening, a slidable door having outer side edges being slidably received within the tracks, the slidable door having a lower position for allowing water to flow over the door into the vault structure and an upper position for allowing the water to flow under the door into the vault structure, and the door having closed position for preventing the water from flowing into the vault, and a member for raising and lowering and closing the slidable door.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The system can include rollers on each of the side edges of the slidable door. The system can include cams for locking the door into different height positions within the tracks.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The slidable door can include a door in door version with a primary door that slides in tracks, and a secondary door smaller than the primary door, the secondary door slides up and down in tracks on the primary door.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Another version can use a half panel door allows for overflow of water over the door.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A still another version can allow for a slidable door can be inserted to slide within a concrete channel opening for overflow and underflow applications.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Further objects and advantages of this invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the presently preferred embodiments which are illustrated schematically in the accompanying drawings.</p>
