<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-284631, filed Nov. 5, 2008, the entirety of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a liquid ejecting apparatus and a liquid ejecting method.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Recently, an inkjet printer technique has been applied to eject a liquid (it is referred to as a high viscosity liquid) having a viscosity higher than that of the water-based ink which is usually used. For example, there has been proposed an apparatus in which a nozzle for ejecting liquid includes a taper portion tapering off toward the ink ejection side and a straight portion disposed successively from the tip of the ejection side of the taper portion (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 2004-90223).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When the high viscosity liquid is ejected from the nozzle including the taper portion and the straight portion, sometimes the ejection of the liquid becomes unstable. For example, the liquid may not be ejected, and an ejection amount may be insufficient. Various factors can be considered which make the ejection unstable. One of the factors is that a pressure of the liquid within the pressure chamber is not efficiently applied to eject the liquid.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An advantage of some aspects of the invention is to efficiently eject the high viscosity liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an aspect of the invention, a liquid ejecting apparatus includes: a pressure chamber that communicates with a liquid supply section and a nozzle; an element that changes a pressure of liquid within the pressure chamber; and an ejection pulse generation section that generates an ejection pulse for operating the element in order to eject the liquid from the nozzle. In the apparatus, the viscosity of the liquid is not less than 8 millipascal seconds. The nozzle has a first portion in which a liquid ejection side thereof has a smaller opening area than a pressure chamber side thereof, and a second portion which communicates with an ejection side end portion of the first portion. In addition, the ejection pulse has a depressurizing portion for depressurizing the liquid in order to attract a meniscus positioned on the second portion to the first portion, and a pressurizing portion for pressurizing the liquid in order to eject the liquid before the meniscus attracted to the first portion returns to the second portion.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The other characteristics of the invention will be described in the following embodiments and the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Hereinafter, embodiments of the invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Specifically, there is provided a liquid ejecting apparatus including: a pressure chamber that communicates with a liquid supply section and a nozzle; an element that changes a pressure of liquid within the pressure chamber; and an ejection pulse generation section that generates an ejection pulse for operating the element in order to eject the liquid from the nozzle. In the apparatus, the viscosity of the liquid is not less than 8 millipascal seconds. The nozzle has a first portion in which a liquid ejection side thereof has a smaller opening area than a pressure chamber side thereof, and a second portion which communicates with an ejection side end portion of the first portion. In addition, the ejection pulse has a depressurizing portion for depressurizing the liquid in order to attract a meniscus positioned on the second portion to the first portion, and a pressurizing portion for pressurizing the liquid in order to eject the liquid before the meniscus attracted to the first portion returns to the second portion.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to the liquid ejecting apparatus, when the element is operated by the pressurizing portion, a pressure at a local portion closer to the second portion in the first portion increases. Thereby, it is possible to efficiently use the pressure applied to the liquid for ejection of the liquid, and thus it is also possible to efficiently eject a high viscosity liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the liquid ejecting apparatus according to the embodiment, it is preferred that the ejection pulse have a maintaining portion for maintaining a state of the element at the time of stopping the generation of the depressurizing portion during the time period from the time of stopping generation of the depressurizing portion to the time of starting the application of the pressurizing portion.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">According to the liquid ejecting apparatus, it is possible to determine the timing of the start of the pressurization caused by the pressurizing portion by determining the time period of forming the maintaining portion. Hence, it is possible to optimize the timing.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In the liquid ejecting apparatus according to the embodiment, it is preferred that an impedance of the nozzle be smaller than an impedance of the liquid supply section.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">According to the liquid ejecting apparatus, it is possible to efficiently transfer pressure oscillation, which is generated in the liquid within the pressure chamber, to the nozzle. Therefore, it is possible to efficiently eject the high viscosity liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In the liquid ejecting apparatus according to the embodiment, it is preferred that the first portion of the nozzle should partition a space formed in a circular truncated cone shape having a taper angle of 40 degrees or more.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">According to the liquid ejecting apparatus, it is possible to prevent the tailing portions of ink droplets from excessively elongating. Furthermore, the angle of 40 degrees does not mean a precise angle, but may have some variation.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In the liquid ejecting apparatus according to the embodiment, it is preferred that the first portion of the nozzle be set to have a taper angle within a range depending on the viscosity of the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">According to the liquid ejecting apparatus, it is possible to prevent the tailing portions of the liquid droplets from excessively elongating.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In the liquid ejecting apparatus according to the embodiment, it is preferred that the second portion of the nozzle be formed in a shape of which a sectional area scarcely changes on a plane orthogonal to a nozzle direction.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">According to the liquid ejecting apparatus, it is possible to stabilize the flying directions of the ejected liquid droplets.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In the liquid ejecting apparatus according to the embodiment, it is preferred that a length of the second portion of the nozzle in the ejection direction be smaller than an inner diameter of an opening portion.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">According to the liquid ejecting apparatus, it is possible to efficiently transfer pressure oscillation, which is generated in the liquid within the pressure chamber, to the nozzle.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In the liquid ejecting apparatus according to the embodiment, it is preferred that the second portion of the nozzle should partition a space formed in a different circular truncated cone shape which has a smaller taper angle than the first portion.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">According to the liquid ejecting apparatus, it is possible to increase a flying speed of the liquid droplets.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the liquid ejecting apparatus according to the embodiment, it is preferred that the element be a piezoelectric element which is deformed in accordance with an electric potential of the applied ejection pulse so as to change a volume of the pressure chamber and thereby change the pressure of the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">According to the liquid ejecting apparatus, it is possible to minutely control the pressure applied to the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In the liquid ejecting apparatus according to the embodiment, it is preferred that the ejection pulse be set to allow a volume variation of the pressure chamber per unit time caused by the pressurizing portion to be larger than a volume variation of the pressure chamber per unit time caused by the depressurizing portion, and that there is no section, which is subsequent to the pressurizing portion, for suppressing movement of the meniscus after the ejection of the liquid.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">According to the liquid ejecting apparatus, it is possible to apply a stronger pressure by the liquid in the first portion. Further, it is also appropriate for high-frequency ejection of the liquid droplets.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Further, there is provided a liquid ejecting method for ejecting the liquid, of which the viscosity is 8 millipascal seconds or more, from the nozzle by using a liquid ejecting apparatus. The apparatus includes a pressure chamber, which communicates with a liquid supply section, a nozzle, which communicates with the pressure chamber and has a first portion in which a liquid ejection side thereof has a smaller opening area than a pressure chamber side thereof and a second portion which communicates with an ejection side end portion of the first portion, and an element, which changes a pressure of liquid within the pressure chamber. The liquid ejecting method includes: depressurizing the liquid in order to attract a meniscus positioned on the second portion to the first portion; and pressurizing the liquid in order to eject the liquid before the meniscus attracted to the first portion returns to the second portion.</p>

<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Regarding Printing System</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The printing system exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a printer <b>1</b> and computer CP. The printer <b>1</b> corresponds to a liquid ejecting apparatus, and ejects an ink as a liquid toward a medium such as a paper, a cloth, and a film. The medium is a target object which is a target of the liquid ejection. The computer CP is connected so as to be able to communicate with the printer <b>1</b>. In order to make the printer <b>1</b> print an image, the computer CP transmits print data based on the image to the printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0007" num="0000">Outline of Printer <b>1</b></p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The printer <b>1</b> includes a paper transport mechanism <b>10</b>, a carriage moving mechanism <b>20</b>, a driving signal generation circuit <b>30</b>, a head unit <b>40</b>, a detector group <b>50</b>, and a printer controller <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The paper transport mechanism <b>10</b> transports a paper in a transport direction. The carriage moving mechanism <b>20</b> moves a carriage, on which the head unit <b>40</b> is mounted, in a predetermined moving direction (for example, a widthwise direction of the paper). The driving signal generation circuit <b>30</b> generates a driving signal COM. The driving signal COM is transmitted to a head HD (piezoelectric elements <b>433</b>, refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) at the time of the printing of the paper, and includes an ejection pulse PS as exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. Here, the ejection pulse PS is a potential variation pattern which allows the piezoelectric elements <b>433</b> to perform a predetermined operation so as to eject the ink having a droplet shape from the head HD (nozzles <b>427</b>). Since the driving signal COM includes the ejection pulse PS, the driving signal generation circuit <b>30</b> corresponds to an ejection pulse generation section. Furthermore, a configuration of the driving signal generation circuit <b>30</b> or the ejection pulse PS will be described later. The head unit <b>40</b> has the head HD and a head control section HC. The head HD ejects an ink in a liquid state toward the paper, and corresponds to a liquid ejecting head.

Detection results obtained by those detectors are output to the printer controller <b>60</b>. The printer controller <b>60</b> controls the overall system of the printer <b>1</b>. The printer controller <b>60</b> also will be described later.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">Main Parts of Printer <b>1</b></p>
<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Regarding Head HD</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the head HD includes a casing <b>41</b>, a flow passage unit <b>42</b>, and a piezoelectric element unit <b>43</b>. The casing <b>41</b> is provided with a containing room <b>411</b> thereof for containing and fixing the piezoelectric element unit <b>43</b>. The casing <b>41</b> is made of, for example, a resin material. In addition, a flow passage unit <b>42</b> is bonded to the leading end surface of the casing <b>41</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The flow passage unit <b>42</b> has a flow passage formation substrate <b>421</b>, a nozzle plate <b>422</b>, and a vibrating plate <b>423</b>. In addition, the nozzle plate <b>422</b> is bonded to one surface of the flow passage formation substrate <b>421</b>, and the vibrating plate <b>423</b> is bonded to the other surface thereof. The flow passage formation substrate <b>421</b> is provided with pressure chambers <b>424</b>, an ink supply passage <b>425</b>, a common ink chamber <b>426</b>, and the like. The flow passage formation substrate <b>421</b> is formed by, for example, a silicon substrate. Each pressure chamber <b>424</b> is formed as a room having a thin and long shape in a direction orthogonal to an arrangement direction of the nozzles <b>427</b>. The ink supply passage <b>425</b> is a portion of a narrow flow passage for interconnecting the pressure chamber <b>424</b> and the common ink chamber <b>426</b>. The ink supply passage <b>425</b> corresponds to a liquid supply section for supplying the liquid to the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. The common ink chamber <b>426</b> is a portion for temporarily storing the ink supplied from an ink cartridge (not shown in the drawing), and corresponds to a common liquid reservoir.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The nozzle plate <b>422</b> is provided with the plurality of nozzles <b>427</b> which are arranged at a predetermined interval in a predetermined arrangement direction. The nozzle plate <b>422</b> is formed by, for example, a stainless plate or a silicon substrate. Furthermore, the nozzles <b>427</b> provided on the nozzle plate <b>422</b> will be described later in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The vibrating plate <b>423</b> has a double layer structure in which an elastic film <b>429</b> made of resin is laminated on a supporting plate <b>428</b> made of stainless steel. In a portion of the vibrating plate <b>423</b> corresponding to each pressure chamber <b>424</b>, the portion of the stainless steel plate is etched in a ring shape. In addition, an insular portion <b>428</b><i>a </i>is formed in the ring. The insular portion <b>428</b><i>a </i>and the elastic film <b>429</b><i>a </i>around the insular portion <b>428</b><i>a </i>constitute a diaphragm section <b>423</b><i>a</i>. The diaphragm section <b>423</b><i>a </i>is deformed by the piezoelectric element <b>433</b> included in the piezoelectric element unit <b>43</b>, and changes a volume of the pressure chamber <b>424</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The piezoelectric element unit <b>43</b> has a piezoelectric element group <b>431</b> and a fixation plate <b>432</b>. The piezoelectric element group <b>431</b> has a comb-teeth-like shape. In addition, each one of the teeth is the piezoelectric element <b>433</b>. The leading end surface of each piezoelectric element <b>433</b> is bonded to the corresponding insular portion <b>428</b><i>a</i>. The fixation plate <b>432</b> supports the piezoelectric element group <b>431</b>, and is formed as a mounting portion for the casing <b>41</b>. The fixation plate <b>432</b> is constituted by, for example, a stainless steel plate, and is bonded to an inside wall of the containing room <b>411</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The piezoelectric element <b>433</b> is an electromechanical transducing element, and corresponds to an element which performs an operation (a deformation operation) for changing a pressure of the liquid within the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. The piezoelectric element <b>433</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> expands and contracts in the lengthwise direction of the element orthogonal to a lamination direction by applying a potential difference between electrodes adjacent to each other. Specifically, the electrodes include a common electrode <b>434</b> having a predetermined electric potential and a drive electrode <b>435</b> having an electric potential depending on the driving signal COM (the ejection pulse PS). In addition, a piezoelectric substance <b>436</b> interposed between both electrodes <b>434</b> and <b>435</b> is deformed in accordance with a potential difference between the common electrode <b>434</b> and the drive electrode <b>435</b>. The piezoelectric element <b>433</b> expands and contracts in the lengthwise direction of the element in accordance with the deformation of the piezoelectric substance <b>436</b>. The electric potential of the common electrode <b>434</b> is set to a ground potential or a bias electric potential higher by a predetermined electric potential than the ground potential. In addition, the piezoelectric element <b>433</b> contracts as the electric potential of the drive electrode <b>435</b> becomes higher than the electric potential of the common electrode <b>434</b>. In contrast, the piezoelectric element <b>433</b> expands as the electric potential of the drive electrode <b>435</b> becomes closer to the electric potential of the common electrode <b>434</b> or becomes lower than the electric potential of the common electrode <b>434</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As described above, the piezoelectric element unit <b>43</b> is mounted on the casing <b>41</b> with the fixation plate <b>432</b> interposed therebetween. Hence, when the piezoelectric element <b>433</b> contracts, the diaphragm section <b>423</b><i>a </i>is attracted in a separating direction from the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. Thereby, the pressure chamber <b>424</b> expands. In contrast, when the piezoelectric element <b>433</b> expands, the diaphragm section <b>423</b><i>a </i>is pressed toward the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. Thereby, the pressure chamber <b>424</b> contracts. A pressure of the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is changed by the expansion and the contraction of the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. Specifically, the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is pressurized by the contraction of the pressure chamber <b>424</b>, and the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is depressurized by the expansion of the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. Since the expansion and contraction states of the piezoelectric element <b>433</b> are determined by the electric potential of the drive electrode <b>435</b>, the volume of the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is also determined by the electric potential of the drive electrode <b>435</b>. Accordingly, a degree of pressurization and a degree of depressurization applied to the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b> can be determined by a potential variation of the drive electrode <b>435</b> per unit time.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Regarding Ink Flow Passage</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The head HD is provided with a plurality of ink flow passages (which corresponds to liquid flow passages filled with the liquid), which extend from the common ink chamber <b>426</b> to the nozzles <b>427</b>, according to the number of the nozzles <b>427</b>. In each ink flow passage, the nozzle <b>427</b> and the ink supply passage <b>425</b> are connected to the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. Hence, in order to analyze characteristics such as ink flow, a Helmholtz resonator concept is applied. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a structure of the head HD based on the concept.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the general head HD, a length L<b>424</b> of the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is determined within the range from 200 &#x3bc;m to 2000 &#x3bc;m. A width W<b>424</b> of the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is determined within the range from 20 &#x3bc;m to 300 &#x3bc;m, and a height H<b>424</b> of the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is determined within the range of 30 &#x3bc;m to 500 m. In addition, a length L<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> is determined within the range of 50 &#x3bc;m to 2000 &#x3bc;m. A width W<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> is determined within the range of 20 &#x3bc;m to 300 &#x3bc;m, and a height H<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> is determined within the range of 30 &#x3bc;m to 500 &#x3bc;m. In addition, a diameter &#x3c6;<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is determined within the range of 10 &#x3bc;m to 35 &#x3bc;m, and a length L<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is determined within the range of 40 &#x3bc;m to 100 &#x3bc;m.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In addition, the width W<b>425</b> and the height H<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> are determined to be not more than the width W<b>424</b> and the height H<b>424</b> of the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. In addition, when one side of the width W<b>425</b> or the height H<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> is adjusted to one side of the width W<b>424</b> or the height H<b>424</b> of the pressure chamber <b>424</b>, the other side of the width W<b>425</b> or the height H<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> is determined to be less than the other side of the width W<b>424</b> or the height H<b>424</b> of the pressure chamber <b>424</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In such an ink flow passage, the ink is ejected from the nozzle <b>427</b> by changing a pressure of the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. At this time, the pressure chamber <b>424</b>, the ink supply passage <b>425</b>, and the nozzle <b>427</b> function as a Helmholtz resonator. Hence, a magnitude of the pressure applied to the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b> changes in accordance with a unique period which is called a Helmholtz period. Specifically, pressure oscillation occurs in the ink. The Helmholtz period is also called a natural oscillation period of the ink (liquid) in the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. A meniscus (a free surface of the ink exposed in the nozzle <b>427</b>) is periodically moved in the nozzle <b>427</b> by the pressure oscillation of the Helmholtz period. In addition, by using the pressure change of the Helmholtz period, it is possible to efficiently eject the ink from the nozzle <b>427</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In the general head HD, the Helmholtz period is determined within the range of 5 &#x3bc;s to 10 &#x3bc;s. For example, in the ink flow passage shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the width W<b>424</b> of the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is set to 100 &#x3bc;m, the height H<b>424</b> thereof is set to 70 &#x3bc;m, the length L<b>424</b> thereof is set to 1000 &#x3bc;m, the width W<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> is set to 50 &#x3bc;m, the height H<b>425</b> thereof is set to 70 m, the length L<b>425</b> thereof is set to 500 &#x3bc;m, the diameter &#x3c6;<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is set to 30 &#x3bc;m, and the length L<b>427</b> is set to 100 &#x3bc;m. In this case, the Helmholtz period is about 8 &#x3bc;s. Furthermore, the Helmholtz period also changes depending on the thicknesses of partition walls for partitioning the pressure chambers <b>424</b>, a thickness and a compliance of the elastic film <b>429</b>, and materials of the flow passage formation substrate <b>421</b> and the nozzle plate <b>422</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Regarding Printer Controller <b>60</b></p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The printer controller <b>60</b> controls the overall system of the printer <b>1</b>. For example, the printer controller <b>60</b> controls a control target section on the basis of print data received from the computer CP and the detection results obtained from the detectors, thereby printing an image on a paper. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the printer controller <b>60</b> has an interface section <b>61</b>, a CPU <b>62</b>, and a memory <b>63</b>. The interface section <b>61</b> exchanges data with the computer CP. The CPU <b>62</b> controls the overall system of the printer <b>1</b>. The memory <b>63</b> secures a region for storing the computer program, a work region, and the like. The CPU <b>62</b> controls the control target sections in accordance with the computer program stored in the memory <b>63</b>. For example, the CPU <b>62</b> controls the paper transport mechanism <b>10</b> and the carriage moving mechanism <b>20</b>. In addition, the CPU <b>62</b> transmits a head control signal for controlling the operation of the head HD to the head control section HC, or transmits a control signal for generating a driving signal COM to the driving signal generation circuit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Here, the control signal for generating the driving signal COM is also called DAC data, and for example, the signal is digital data of a plurality of bits. The DAC data determines a potential variation pattern of the generated driving signal COM. Accordingly, the DAC data also can be defined as data representing an electric potential of the ejection pulse PS or the driving signal COM. The DAC data is stored in a predetermined region of the memory <b>63</b>, and the DAC data is read out at the time of generating the driving signal COM and is output to the driving signal generation circuit <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Regarding Driving Signal Generation Circuit <b>30</b></p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The driving signal generation circuit <b>30</b> functions as the ejection pulse generation section and generates the driving signal COM containing the ejection pulse PS on the basis of the DAC data. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the driving signal generation circuit <b>30</b> has a DAC circuit <b>31</b>, a voltage amplification circuit <b>32</b>, and a current amplification circuit <b>33</b>. The DAC circuit <b>31</b> converts the digital DAC data into the analog signal. The voltage amplification circuit <b>32</b> amplifies a voltage of the analog signal converted by the DAC circuit <b>31</b> to a level capable of driving the piezoelectric element <b>433</b>. In the printer <b>1</b>, the analog signal, which is output from the DAC circuit <b>31</b>, is maximum 3.3 V, while the amplified analog signal (which is also referred to as a waveform signal for convenience), which is output from the voltage amplification circuit <b>32</b>, is maximum 42 V. The current amplification circuit <b>33</b> amplifies a current of the waveform signal output from the voltage amplification circuit <b>32</b>, and outputs the signal as the driving signal COM. The current amplification circuit <b>33</b> is formed by, for example, a pair of transistors connected in push-pull configuration.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Regarding Head Control Section HC</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The head control section HC selects necessary portions of the driving signal COM, which is generated by the driving signal generation circuit <b>30</b>, on the basis of the head control signal, and applies the selected portions thereof to the piezoelectric element <b>433</b>. Hence, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the head control section HC has a plurality of switches <b>44</b> which are respectively provided on the piezoelectric elements <b>433</b> in the course of the supply line of the driving signal COM. Then, the head control section HC generates a switch control signal from the head control signal. By controlling the switches <b>44</b> on the basis of the switch control signal, the necessary portions (for example, the ejection pulse PS) of the driving signal COM are applied to the piezoelectric elements <b>433</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">Regarding Driving Signal COM</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Next, the driving signal COM, which is generated by the driving signal generation circuit <b>30</b>, will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram illustrating the driving signal COM, wherein the vertical axis thereof represents a voltage of the driving signal COM, and the horizontal axis thereof represents time. Furthermore, in the embodiment, the driving signal generation circuit <b>30</b> generates the driving signal COM having a voltage based on the ground potential, and the common electrode <b>434</b> of the piezoelectric elements <b>433</b> is set to the ground potential. Hence, the voltage of the driving signal COM represents the electric potential of the drive electrode <b>435</b> determined by the driving signal COM.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">As shown in the drawing, the driving signal COM includes the ejection pulse PS. The driving signal COM is applied to the drive electrode <b>435</b>. Thereby, potential difference is caused by the waveform (which corresponds to the potential variation pattern) of the ejection pulse PS between the drive electrode <b>435</b> and the common electrode <b>434</b> of which the potential is fixed. As a result, the piezoelectric element <b>433</b> expands and contracts in accordance with the waveform, thereby varying a volume of the pressure chamber <b>424</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The ejection pulse PS is constituted by so-called trapezoidal waves. When the ejection pulse PS having these trapezoidal waves is applied to the piezoelectric element <b>433</b> (specifically, the drive electrode <b>435</b>), the pressure chamber <b>424</b> expands in the range from the minimum volume corresponding to the minimum potential thereof to the maximum volume corresponding to the maximum potential thereof. Then, the pressure chamber <b>424</b> contracts again to the minimum volume. Then, when the pressure chamber <b>424</b> contracts from the maximum volume to the minimum volume, the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is pressurized, thereby ejecting the ink (ink droplets) having a droplet shape from the nozzle <b>427</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In the ejection pulse PS exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a portion, in which the voltage changes from the minimum value to the maximum value, corresponds to the depressurizing portion P<b>1</b> for depressurizing the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. In addition, a portion, in which the voltage changes from the maximum value to the minimum value, corresponds to the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b> for pressurizing the ink in order to eject the ink. In addition, a portion, in which the voltage is constant at the maximum value, corresponds to the maintaining portion P<b>2</b> for maintaining the state of the piezoelectric element <b>433</b> at the time of stopping the application of the depressurizing portion P<b>1</b>. Accordingly, the ejection pulse PS does not have a portion (which is referred to as a damping portion) for suppressing excessive reciprocation of the meniscus after the ejection of the ink droplets. The reason is based on the knowledge that movement of meniscus of a high viscosity ink (a high viscosity liquid), which is used in the printer <b>1</b>, after the ejection of the ink droplets is restored earlier than that of the water-based ink, which is generally used, by the viscosity resistance of the ink. In addition, since the pulse does not have the damping portion, it is possible to shorten the time period required to generate the ejection pulse PS by that amount, and thus it is possible to eject the ink droplets at a high frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In the ejection pulse PS, the generation time period T<b>1</b> of the depressurizing portion P<b>1</b> is 2.8 &#x3bc;s, the minimum voltage is 0 V, and the maximum voltage is 23 V. Further, the generation time period T<b>2</b> of the maintaining portion P<b>2</b> is 2.8 &#x3bc;s, and the generation time period T<b>3</b> of the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b> is 2.4 &#x3bc;s. The driving signal generation circuit <b>30</b> generates a steady portion P<b>4</b> in which the voltage is constant at the minimum value subsequent to the ejection pulse PS. The portion P<b>4</b> is generated during the time period T<b>4</b> to the time of starting generation of the next ejection pulse PS, and corresponds to the connection portion. The driving signal generation circuit <b>30</b> repeatedly generates for each period T by repeating the driving signal COM including the ejection pulse PS.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The generation time periods of the portions P<b>1</b> to P<b>3</b>, the maximum voltage, and the minimum voltage of the ejection pulse PS are appropriately adjusted by the type of ink (the liquid) subjected to the ejection, a required flying speed of the ink droplet, the length of the tailing portion of the ink droplet, and the like. In addition, regarding the depressurizing portion P<b>1</b> and pressurizing portion P<b>3</b>, it is preferred that a volume variation of the pressure chamber <b>424</b> per unit time caused by the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b> be larger than a volume variation of the pressure chamber <b>424</b> per unit time caused by the depressurizing portion P <b>1</b>. The reason is that the depressurizing portion P<b>1</b> has a function of filling the pressure chamber <b>424</b> with the ink and the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b> has a function of ejecting the ink droplets from the nozzle <b>427</b>. By adopting such a configuration, it is possible to pressurize the ink with the pressure chamber <b>424</b> sufficiently filled with the ink. As a result, when the ink droplets are ejected, it is possible to apply a stronger pressure to the ink in the vicinity of the nozzle <b>427</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Regarding Reference Example</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">It has been suggested that the nozzle used in this type of printer has a taper portion (a portion for partitioning a space having the circular truncated cone shape) and a straight portion (a portion for partitioning a space having the cylindrical shape). However, although the nozzle having such a shape is used, sometimes the ejection of the ink droplets becomes unstable. One of the reasons is that change in the pressure of the liquid within the pressure chamber is inefficiently applied to the ejection of the liquid. For example, when the ink droplets are ejected by moving the meniscus within the range of the straight portion, a viscous force of the liquid to the inner wall of the straight portion is stronger than an inertial force of the liquid existing in the center of the straight portion. Hence, it can be considered that this causes disturbance in the ejection of the ink droplets and the ejection amount thereof to be lacking.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A to 6C</figref> are diagrams illustrating the case where the ejection becomes unstable in accordance with the pressurizing timing. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a shape of a meniscus M and pressure distribution at the time of application of a pressurizing portion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a diagram schematically illustrating a shape of a meniscus M and pressure distribution after the application of the pressurizing portion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> is a diagram illustrating a relationship between ink pressures and colors.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows the state where the meniscus M is attracted not to move over the straight portion by applying the depressurizing portion and maintaining portion of the ejection pulse to the piezoelectric element, and the pressurizing portion is applied. In this diagram, the colors such as blue and red represents the pressure of the liquid. That is, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the low pressure side is represented by a blue based color, and the high pressure side is represented by a red based color. Specifically, seven levels are classified by using the colors such as blue, light blue, green, yellowish green, yellow, orange, and red in order from the low pressure side. In addition, pressure distribution is represented by drawing isobaric lines at the boundaries between the pressures.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Furthermore, the colors do not represent absolute pressure magnitudes, but represent relative pressure differences. That is, at the time point, the lowest pressure region is represented by blue, and color classification is based on the blue region. Such expression of pressure based on colors is the same as those of the other drawings (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B</figref>, <b>10</b>B, . . . , and <b>17</b>B).</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the red region in which the pressure is highest exists at the bottom of the meniscus M. The red region is distributed in a semi-ellipsoid shape toward the pressure chamber (toward the lower side in the drawing) from the bottom of the meniscus M. Near the red region, the orange region of the second highest pressure is distributed in an arch shape. Further, near the orange region, the yellow region of the third highest pressure is distributed in an approximately Y-shape. In addition, aside the yellow region, the yellowish green region and the green region are distributed, and aside the green region, the light blue region and the blue region are distributed. It can be seen from the drawing that the red, orange, and yellow regions in which the pressure is high are distributed in a state of expansion toward the pressure chamber. From the result that the high pressure portions are distributed in a state of expansion as described above, it can be understood that the ink droplets may not be ejected and the ejection amount may be insufficient because of the lack of the pressure at the leading end of the ink pillar as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> a diagram illustrating simulation data for explaining a case where ejection becomes unstable depending on an impedance ratio of a nozzle to an ink supply passage. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the vertical axis represents the state of the meniscus M as an amount of the ink, and the horizontal axis represents time. Regarding the vertical axis, 0 ng represents a position of the meniscus M in a steady state. In addition, as the value positively increases, the value represents a state where the meniscus M is pushed in the ejection direction, and as the value negatively increases, the value represents a state where the meniscus M is attracted toward the pressure chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In the simulation data shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an impedance of the nozzle is determined to be larger than that of the ink supply passage. Specifically, a diameter of the straight portion in the nozzle is set to 28 &#x3bc;m, a length of the straight portion is set to 20 &#x3bc;m, a length of the nozzle is set to 60 &#x3bc;m, and a taper angle thereof is set to 25 degrees. In addition, a width of the ink supply passage is set to 100 &#x3bc;m, a height thereof is set to 100 &#x3bc;m, and a length thereof is set to 500 &#x3bc;m. Thereby, in the case of the ink of which the viscosity is 30 mPa&#xb7;s, an impedance of the nozzle is 1.59&#xd7;10<sup>14</sup>&#x3a9;, and an impedance of the ink supply passage is 1.27&#xd7;10<sup>14</sup>&#x3a9;. Furthermore, each impedance value is calculated by associating factors such as compliance, resistance, and inertance with values of an electric circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">As described above, when the impedance of the nozzle is larger than that of the ink supply passage, a problem arises in that the pressure change of the ink within the pressure chamber is inefficiently applied to the ejection of the ink. That is, most of the pressure change of the ink within the pressure chamber is transferred to the common ink chamber through the ink supply passage. Thereby, the mobility of the meniscus M relative to the pressure change of the ink decreases. Therefore, the ink droplets may not be ejected, and an insufficient ejection amount occurs. Further, it takes time for the meniscus M to restore the steady state after the ejection of the ink droplets. The reason can be considered as follows. First, when the impedance of the nozzle is large, a viscous force of the nozzle surface excessively increases. Second, even in a state where the meniscus M is attracted toward the pressure chamber, the difference between the ink pressure within the pressure chamber and the ink pressure within the common ink chamber decreases, and thus ink flow becomes weak in the range from the common ink chamber side to the pressure chamber side. In other words, the reason is that a surface tension of the meniscus M is dominant.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">Regarding Characteristics of Printer <b>1</b></p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">In consideration of the above mentioned situation, in the printer <b>1</b>, the following configuration is adopted in order to improve characteristics of the ejection of the ink droplets. First, the nozzle <b>427</b> is configured to have a taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>in which the ink ejection side thereof has a smaller opening area than the pressure chamber <b>424</b> side thereof and a straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>which communicates with the ejection side end portion of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>(refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and the like). Further, the ejection pulse PS is configured as follows: the depressurizing portion P<b>1</b> depressurizes the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b> in order to attract the meniscus M, which is positioned in the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>, to the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>; the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b> pressurizes the ink in order to eject the ink; and the time of starting the application of the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b> is determined as a time before the meniscus M attracted up to the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>returns to the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>. With such a configuration, when the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is pressurized by applying the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b> to the piezoelectric element <b>433</b>, the local ink pressure of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>close to the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>can be made to be high. In other words, it is possible to concentrate the high pressure portion of the ink on the vicinity of the meniscus M. Hence, it is possible to efficiently apply the pressure change of the ink to the ejection of the ink droplets. As a result, even when the ink has a high viscosity, it is possible to efficiently eject the ink. In addition, since the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>is provided, it is possible to regulate the flying directions of the ink droplets within an allowable range. That is, it is possible to stabilize the flying direction. Furthermore, the maintaining portion P<b>2</b> is generated between the depressurizing portion P<b>1</b> and the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b>. Hence, by setting the generation time period of the maintaining portion P<b>2</b>, it is possible to conveniently set a timing at which the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b> pressurizes the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Further, in the printer <b>1</b>, the following configuration of the head HD is adopted. That is, regarding the nozzle <b>427</b> and the ink supply passage <b>425</b>, an impedance Z<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is set to be smaller than an impedance Z<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> (the liquid supply section). With such a configuration, when the pressure of the ink within pressure chamber <b>424</b> is changed by allowing the piezoelectric element <b>433</b> to deform the diaphragm section <b>423</b><i>a</i>, it is possible to increase a rate of movement of the meniscus M caused by the pressure change as compared with the known techniques. Thereby it is possible to concentrate the high pressure portion on the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>of the nozzle <b>427</b> close to the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, it is possible to efficiently apply the pressure change of the ink to the ejection of the ink droplets. As a result, even when the ink has a high viscosity, it is possible to efficiently eject the ink.</p>
<p id="h-0017" num="0000">Regarding Shape and the Like of Nozzle <b>427</b></p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Hereinafter, characteristics thereof will be described in detail. First, a shape of the nozzle <b>427</b> and a shape of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> will be described. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, the nozzle <b>427</b> is formed in a funnel shape, and has the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>formed in a taper shape and the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>communicating with the ejection side end portion of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>. The taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>is a portion for partitioning the space having the circular truncated cone shape, and corresponds to the first portion in the nozzle <b>427</b>. The straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>corresponds to the second portion in the nozzle <b>427</b>, and is a portion for partitioning the space having the cylindrical shape as a shape of which a sectional area scarcely changes on a plane orthogonal to the nozzle direction. In other words, the sectional shape in a direction orthogonal to the ejection direction is fixed as a circular shape even at any location in the ejection direction. The opening area of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>increases as it becomes closer to the pressure chamber <b>424</b> (the lower side in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>). Specifically, an opening area thereof close to the ink droplet ejection side is set to be smaller than an opening area thereof close to the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. For example, a diameter &#x3c6;<b>427</b><i>b </i>of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>at the center position thereof is smaller than a diameter &#x3c6;<b>427</b><i>a </i>of the end portion thereof close to the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. In addition, a diameter &#x3c6;<b>427</b><i>c </i>of the ejection side end portion (the end portion close to the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>) is smaller than the diameter &#x3c6;<b>427</b><i>b </i>thereof at the central position.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the embodiment, the diameter &#x3c6;<b>427</b><i>c </i>of the ejection side end portion corresponds to the diameter of the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>, and is set to 30 &#x3bc;m. A length L<b>427</b><i>b </i>of the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>, that is, a length thereof in the ejection direction is set to 20 &#x3bc;m, and a length L<b>427</b><i>a </i>of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>is set to 80 &#x3bc;m. Hence, the length L<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is set to 100 &#x3bc;m. In addition, the taper angle &#x3b8;<b>427</b> is set to 50 degrees. On the other hand, a width W<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> is set to 100 &#x3bc;m, a height H<b>425</b> thereof is set to 100 &#x3bc;m, and a length L<b>425</b> thereof is set to 500 &#x3bc;m. As a result, the impedance Z<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is smaller than the impedance Z<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b>. Specifically, in the case of the ink of which the viscosity is 30 mPa&#xb7;s, the impedance Z<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>14</sup>&#x3a9;, and the impedance Z<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> is 1.27&#xd7;10<sup>14</sup>&#x3a9;.</p>
<p id="h-0018" num="0000">Regarding Ink Ejection Control</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Next, ink ejection control will be described. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 to 17</figref> shows states of the ink in the vicinity of the nozzle <b>427</b> at the time of the ejection of the ink droplets for each elapsed time from the time of starting the application of the ejection pulse PS. That is, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref>, <b>10</b>A, . . . , and <b>17</b>A show elapsed times from the time of starting the application of the ejection pulse PS and voltages at the time. In addition, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9B</figref>, <b>10</b>B, . . . , and <b>17</b>B schematically show states of the meniscus M and pressure distribution at the times in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A</figref>, <b>10</b>A, . . . , and <b>17</b>A. Furthermore, the simulation is performed by using ink of which the viscosity is 30 mPa&#xb7;s.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, the meniscus M is in the steady state just before the time (0.00 &#x3bc;s) of starting the application of the ejection pulse PS, and the ink pressure is stabilized at the minimum level (blue). As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, the meniscus M is slightly curved toward the pressure chamber <b>424</b> at the time (2.80 &#x3bc;s) of stopping the application of the depressurizing portion P<b>1</b>, and the red region is distributed from the bottom of the meniscus M toward the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. The red region is distributed in a substantially rectangular shape, and occupies a large area in the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>. As described above, the classification of the pressure represents the relative pressure difference. Hence, the red region represents that the pressure in the region becomes relatively higher since the pressure of the ink around the region becomes lower. Around the red region, the orange region is distributed to involve the red region, and the yellow region is distributed to involve the orange region. Those regions are distributed like thin layers. Outside the yellow region, the green region is distributed. A portion (the bottom portion) of the green region close to the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is thicker than a portion of the orange region and a portion of the yellow region close to the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. That is, the portion of the green region is widely distributed toward the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. Outside the green region, the light blue region is distributed. A distribution range of the light blue region is larger than that of the green region. In particular, a portion of the light blue region close to the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is larger than that of the green region. In addition, outside the light blue region, the blue region is distributed. In this situation, since the orange region and the yellow region is thin (the intervals of the isobaric lines are narrow), it can be said that high pressure regions are concentrated on the red region and the vicinity thereof From this, it can be seen that a strong force to move the meniscus M toward the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is applied to the meniscus M.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11A and 11B</figref>, the center of the meniscus M passes over the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>and reaches the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>at the time (3.80 &#x3bc;s) in the time period of applying the maintaining portion P<b>2</b>. At this time, the red region in which the pressure is highest is distributed in an oval sphere shape like the head of a match in the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>. In addition, the orange region is distributed to involve the red region, and the yellow region is distributed to involve the orange region. Likewise, other regions are distributed to involve the inside regions. In this situation, the orange region and the yellow region are thinly distributed around the distribution range of the red region. From this, it can be seen that the strong force to move the meniscus M toward the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is still applied to the meniscus M.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12A and 12B</figref>, the center of the meniscus M is attracted up to the center of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>at the time (4.20 &#x3bc;s) in the time period of applying the maintaining portion P<b>2</b>. In addition, around the meniscus M, the light blue region is mostly distributed and the green region is distributed in some portions. As described above, the red region and the orange region representing a high pressure disappear. The reason may be that the pressure difference decreases since energy is consumed by attracting the meniscus M. Thereby, the meniscus M stops movement toward the pressure chamber <b>424</b>, and subsequently starts to move in the ejection direction. The reason why the meniscus M starts to move in the ejection direction can be considered as follows. First, the ink flows therein from the ink supply passage <b>425</b> due to the depressurization of the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. Second, the meniscus M tends to return to the steady state due to the surface tension.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13A and 13B</figref>, at the time (5.60 &#x3bc;s) of starting the application of the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b>, the center of the meniscus M is positioned in the vicinity (the end of the taper portion) of the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>in the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>. This time corresponds to the time before the meniscus M attracted up to the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>returns to the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14A and 14B</figref>, at the time (6.00 &#x3bc;s) just after the start of the application of the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b>, the center of the meniscus M (the bottom portion) is positioned at the end of the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>close to the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. This time corresponds to the time at which the meniscus M attracted up to the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>returns to the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>. In addition, in a portion of the meniscus M closer to the pressure chamber <b>424</b> than the bottom thereof, the red region is distributed in a substantially trapezoidal shape. Further, the orange region is distributed to involve the red region, and the yellow region is distributed to involve the orange region. In addition, outside the yellow region, the green region is distributed. Here, the orange region and the yellow region are distributed in a small range. That is, the isobaric lines are densely distributed. This means that the high pressure portions are concentrated on the vicinity of the meniscus M. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, at the time (8.00 &#x3bc;s) of stopping the application of the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b>, the red region is distributed in the range of most of the ink existing in the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>and a portion projected out of the nozzle <b>427</b>. The orange region is distributed to involve the circumference of the red region, the yellow region is distributed to involve the orange region, and the yellowish green region is distributed to involve the yellow region. In addition, those regions are distributed in the narrow range similarly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14B</figref>. Accordingly, at the time of stopping the application of the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b>, a pressure of the ink within the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>of the nozzle <b>427</b> and a pressure of the ink within a portion which is projected from the nozzle <b>427</b> in a pillar shape are higher than ink pressures within the other portions.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Here, the reason why the high pressure portions can be concentrated is described. It can be inferred that this is caused by an operation of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>. Specifically, when the ink is pressurized by contracting the pressure chamber <b>424</b>, the force also has influence on the ink within the nozzle <b>427</b>. When the force (a suppressive strength in the ejection direction) is applied to the ink, the ink flows along the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>. Since the flow passage, through which the ink flows, tapers off in the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>, the force applied to the ink becomes larger, whereby the internal stress is concentrated on the ink. Therefore, it is possible to concentrate the high pressure portion on the boundary portion between the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>and the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>. In addition, the time of pressurizing the ink is set to a time just before the meniscus M attracted up to the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>returns to the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>. In other words, the ink is pressurized in a state where the amount of ink of the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>is at the minimum. Thereby, it is possible to concentrate the pressure on the ink which exists in the ejection side end portion of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>, and thus it is possible to locally and intensively pressurize the ink. This point also makes the high pressure portions be concentrated. Furthermore, since the operation of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>is used, it is preferred that the maximum degree of the attraction for the meniscus M be set not to be over the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As a result of such a control, it is possible to increase the pressure of the ink on the ejection side rather than that of the ink within the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16A and 16B</figref>. Thus, it is possible to create an ink pillar which moves at a speed sufficient to eject the ink droplet. Furthermore, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, it is possible to eject the leading end portion of the ink pillar as the ink droplet. That is, since the blue region having an elliptical shape exists in the portion in which the ink pillar is narrow, the ink pillar is cut off in this portion. Then, the leading end portion ahead of the elliptical region is ejected as the ink droplet. Here, most of the portion ejected as the ink droplet is the red region. From this, it can be seen that the pressure change of the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is efficiently applied to the ejection of the ink droplet. Accordingly, it is possible to suppress a phenomenon in which the tailing portion of the ink droplet excessively elongates. Furthermore, the portion of the ink closer to the pressure chamber <b>424</b> than the elliptical region forms a new meniscus M.</p>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">Regarding Taper Angle &#x3b8;<b>427</b></p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">The above mentioned data is based on the taper angle &#x3b8;<b>427</b> of 50 degrees. The reason why the stress is concentrated is based on the movement of the ink in the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>. In consideration of this, the taper angle &#x3b8;<b>427</b> is examined. Here, an evaluation is conducted in the following way: the taper angle &#x3b8;<b>427</b> is set to 20 degrees, 25 degrees, 30 degrees, 40 degrees, 50 degrees, 60 degrees, and 80 degrees; and the inks having viscosities of 8 mPa&#xb7;s, 10 mPa&#xb7;s, 15 mPa&#xb7;s, 20 mPa&#xb7;s, 30 mPa&#xb7;s, and 40 mPa&#xb7;s are ejected from the nozzles <b>427</b> corresponding to the respective taper angles. Furthermore, data other than the data exemplified herein is as described above. In this evaluation, the shape of the nozzle <b>427</b> is also determined so that the impedance Z<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is smaller than the impedance Z<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b>. In addition, the nozzle <b>427</b> of which the taper angle &#x3b8;<b>427</b> is 80 degrees or more is excluded from the evaluation target. The reason is that if the angle is 80 degrees or more (for instance, if a taper surface is provided with an angle within an angular range in which it is not an acute angle), the ink flows along the taper surface, and thus the effect of the pressure concentration is obtained. In this case, the maximum angle of the taper depends on a width of the pressure chamber <b>424</b>, a pitch of the nozzle <b>427</b>, a length of the nozzle <b>427</b>, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> shows a list of the evaluation results. In the drawing, the item of the column is the viscosity of the ink, and the item of the row is the taper angle &#x3b8;<b>427</b>. In addition, in the evaluation results, the sign x means that the ink does not have a droplet shape and is not ejected. Further, the sign &#x394; means that the tailing portion, which is created in the rear of the ink droplet in the flying direction, has a length which may cause trouble in the printer <b>1</b>. In this evaluation, when a length of the tailing portion is larger than 500 &#x3bc;m the evaluation result is represented by the sign &#x394;. Accordingly, the sign o means that the trailing portion has a length which does not cause trouble in the printer <b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">This evaluation result can be described as follows. That is, since there is a correlation between the taper angle &#x3b8;<b>427</b> and the viscosity of the ink, it may be preferred that the taper angle &#x3b8;<b>427</b> be set to be larger as the ink has a higher viscosity. This can be understood from the evaluation x which means that ink can not be ejected. For example, when the taper angle is 20 degrees, the ink having a viscosity of 20 mPa&#xb7;s or more is evaluated as &#xd7;. When the taper angle is 25 degrees and 30 degrees, the ink having a viscosity of 30 mPa&#xb7;s or more is evaluated x. In addition, when the taper angle is not less than 40 degrees and not more than 60 degrees, the ink having a viscosity of 40 mPa&#xb7;s is evaluated x. Further, when the taper angle is not less than 80 degrees, the ink having a viscosity of 40 mPa&#xb7;s is evaluated as &#x394;.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Focusing attention on evaluation o, it can be seen that an appropriate range of the taper angle &#x3b8;<b>427</b> depending on the viscosity of the ink exists. For example, it can be seen that, when the ink having a viscosity not less than 8 mPa&#xb7;s and not more than 15 mPa&#xb7;s is ejected, a taper angle &#x3b8;<b>427</b> of 40 degrees or more is allowed. In addition, it can be seen that, when the ink having a viscosity not less than 8 mPa&#xb7;s and not more than 30 mPa&#xb7;s is ejected, a taper angle &#x3b8;<b>427</b> of 50 degrees or more is allowed.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Next, the length L<b>427</b><i>a </i>of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>is examined. When the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>is provided, an operation effect is obtained which concentrates the stress on the portion of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>closer to the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>. Accordingly, it can be said that the length thereof is not related thereto. Here, it is required that the high viscosity ink be more stably ejected. From this viewpoint, it can be said that the length L<b>427</b><i>a </i>is preferably a length (a half of the length L<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b>) not less than that of the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>. In addition, in the above mentioned simulation, the length L<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is 100 &#x3bc;m and 80 &#x3bc;m of the nozzle length is the length L<b>427</b><i>a </i>of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, it can be said that the length L<b>427</b><i>a </i>of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>is more preferably &#x2158; of the length L<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b>. As described above, by increasing the ratio of the length L<b>427</b><i>a </i>of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>to the length L<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b>, it is possible to easily obtain the high pressure portion.</p>
<p id="h-0020" num="0000">Regarding Impedance</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">As described above, in the head HD used in the simulation, in the case of the ink of which the viscosity is 30 mPa&#xb7;s, the impedance Z<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>14</sup>&#x3a9;, and the impedance Z<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> is 1.27&#xd7;10<sup>14</sup>&#x3a9;. That is, the impedance Z<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is smaller than the impedance Z<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b>. Here, values of the impedances are changed in accordance with the viscosity of the ink. Hence, the values of the impedances are changed by using an ink having a different viscosity. However, the relationship that the impedance Z<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is smaller than the impedance Z<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> is established regardless of the viscosity of the ink.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As described above, the impedance Z<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is set to be smaller than the impedance Z<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b>. In this case, when the pressure of the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is changed, it becomes difficult (acoustically heavy) to cause the ink to flow toward the ink supply passage <b>425</b> having a large impedance, and it becomes easy (acoustically light) to cause the ink to flow toward the nozzle <b>427</b> having a small impedance. Thereby, it is possible to efficiently move the meniscus M by changing the pressure of the ink. In addition, residual oscillation (pressure oscillation applied to the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b>) generated after the ejection of the ink droplet tends to remain in the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. This makes easy to cause the ink to flow in the pressure chamber <b>424</b> from the common ink chamber <b>426</b>. Thereby, it is possible to return meniscus M to the steady state in an early stage, and thus it is possible to eject the ink droplets at a high frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> is a diagram illustrating the description mentioned above, and is simulation data corresponding to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. When the simulation data is obtained, the shape data of the nozzle <b>427</b> and the ink supply passage <b>425</b> is as described above. That is, the impedance Z<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is 1.0&#xd7;10<sup>14</sup>&#x3a9;, and the impedance Z<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> is 1.27&#xd7;10<sup>14</sup>&#x3a9;. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, the meniscus M returns to the position in the substantially steady state at the time point at which 100 &#x3bc;m has elapsed from the start of the application of the ejection pulse PS. In the embodiment, a criterion for determining whether the ink droplet can be stably ejected even at a high frequency of about 40 kHz is that the meniscus M returns to the position in the steady state at the time point at which 100 &#x3bc;s has elapsed from the start of the application of the ejection pulse PS. Here, from the result shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, it can be inferred that since the minimum interval of the ejection of the ink droplets is 100 &#x3bc;s, the maximum ejection frequency is about 10 kHz. However, when the ejection frequency is increased, the ink droplets are ejected one by one. From this, it can be inferred that the ink flow from the common ink chamber <b>426</b> toward the nozzle <b>427</b> is generated in the ink flow passage (the successive flow passage from the common ink chamber <b>426</b> to nozzle <b>427</b>). It can be inferred that since the ink flow becomes faster as the ejection frequency increases, this helps to supply the ink to the pressure chamber <b>424</b>. From the above, the criterion is determined. In addition, when the ink droplets of 10 ng or more can be ejected at a frequency of about 40 kHz, even in the case of the high viscosity ink, it is possible to exhibit the same performance as the printer for ejecting the existing water-based ink.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In addition, in order to decrease the impedance Z<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b>, it is preferred that the length L<b>427</b><i>b </i>of the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>be set to be smaller than the diameter &#x3c6;<b>427</b><i>b</i>. With such a configuration, it is possible to decrease inertance and flow passage resistance. Specifically, the inertance is calculated by multiplying the length L<b>427</b><i>b </i>of the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>by an ink density and by dividing the multiplication by the opening area. Therefore, the calculated value decreases as the opening area increases (as the diameter &#x3c6;<b>427</b><i>b </i>increases). Further, the flow passage resistance decreases as the length L<b>427</b><i>b </i>of the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>decreases and as the opening area increases. Accordingly, it can be said that making the length L<b>427</b><i>b </i>of the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>smaller than the diameter &#x3c6;<b>427</b><i>b </i>is an effective means for decreasing the impedance Z<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">Conclusion</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">The following can be understood from the description mentioned above. That is, the nozzle <b>427</b> has the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>(the first portion) in which the ink ejection side thereof has a smaller opening area than the pressure chamber <b>424</b> side thereof and the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>(the second portion) which communicates with the ejection side end portion of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>. The impedance Z<b>427</b> of the nozzle <b>427</b> is set to be less than the impedance Z<b>425</b> of the ink supply passage <b>425</b> (the liquid supply section). Hence, the pressure oscillation caused in the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b> is efficiently transferred to the nozzle <b>427</b>. Therefore, it is possible to efficiently eject the ink having a high viscosity.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">Further, the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>partitions the space of the circular truncated cone shape having a taper angle of 40 degrees or more. Therefore, it is possible to suppress the phenomenon that the tailing portion of the ink droplet excessively elongates. In addition, the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>is set to have an angle within the range according to the viscosity of the ink. Therefore, it is possible to improve the effect mentioned above. The straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>, which communicates with the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>, is formed in a shape of which a sectional area scarcely changes on the plane orthogonal to the nozzle direction. Thereby, it is possible to stabilize the flying direction of the ejected ink droplets. In addition, the length (the length in the ejection direction) of the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>is smaller than the diameter &#x3c6;<b>427</b><i>b </i>(an inner diameter of the opening portion) of the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>. Hence, it is possible to efficiently transfer the pressure oscillation, which is applied to the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b>, to the nozzle <b>427</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Further, in the ejection control using the ejection pulse PS, the ejection pulse PS has: the depressurizing portion P<b>1</b> for depressurizing the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b> in order to attract the meniscus M, which is positioned in the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>, to the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>; the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b> for pressurizing the ink in order to eject the ink before the meniscus M attracted up to the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>returns to the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, it is possible to efficiently apply the pressure of the ink to the ejection of the ink. In addition, the maintaining portion P<b>2</b> is generated between the depressurizing portion P<b>1</b> and the pressurizing portion P<b>3</b>. Therefore, it is possible to easily optimize the timings.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">The Other Embodiments</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The above-mentioned embodiments mainly described the printing system having a printer <b>1</b> as a liquid ejecting apparatus. However, disclosures of the liquid ejecting method and the liquid ejecting system are included therein. Further, disclosures of the liquid ejecting head and the method of controlling the liquid ejecting head are also included therein. Furthermore, the embodiment is for helping to understand the invention, and is not for limitedly analyzing the invention. It is apparent that the invention may be modified without departing from the technical spirit thereof and the invention may include the equivalents thereof In particular, the following embodiments are also included in the invention.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">Regarding Shape of Nozzle <b>427</b></p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">In the above-mentioned embodiments, the nozzle <b>427</b> has the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>for partitioning the space (the flow passage) having the circular truncated cone shape and the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b </i>for partitioning the space having the cylindrical shape. However, the nozzle <b>427</b> is not limited to these shapes. It may be preferred that the opening area of the liquid ejection side thereof is smaller than that of the pressure chamber <b>424</b> side thereof For example, like the nozzle <b>427</b>A shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20A</figref>, the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>&#x2032; and the straight portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>&#x2032; may be modified to have elliptical shapes. Further, like the nozzle <b>427</b>B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20B</figref>, the portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>&#x2033; having a quadrangular pyramid shape may be provided instead of the taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>. Even when these nozzles <b>427</b>A and <b>427</b>B are applied, the same effect can be obtained. Further, like the nozzle <b>427</b>C shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20C</figref>, the first taper portion <b>427</b><i>a </i>on the pressure chamber <b>424</b> side and the second taper portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; on the ejection side may be provided. In the nozzle <b>427</b>C, the second taper portion <b>427</b><i>b</i>&#x2033; corresponds to a portion for partitioning the space formed in a different circular truncated cone shape which has a smaller taper angle than the portion formed in the circular truncated cone shape partitioned by the first taper portion <b>427</b><i>a</i>. In the nozzle <b>427</b>C, it is possible to increase the flying speed of the ink droplets.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">Regarding Element for Performing Ejection Operation</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In the printer <b>1</b>, the piezoelectric element <b>433</b> is used as an element for performing the operation for ejecting the ink. Here, the element for performing the ejection operation is not limited to the above-mentioned piezoelectric element <b>433</b>. However, it may be preferred that the element be able to change the pressure of the liquid within the pressure chamber <b>424</b> by performing the operation in accordance with the applied electric potential. For example, a magnetostrictive element may be used. In addition, when the piezoelectric element <b>433</b> is used as the element similarly to the above-mentioned embodiment, it is possible to precisely control the volume of the pressure chamber <b>424</b> on the basis of the voltage of the ejection pulse PS. Consequently, it is possible to minutely control the pressure of the ink within the pressure chamber <b>424</b>.</p>
<p id="h-0025" num="0000">Regarding Other Application Examples</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">Further, in the above-mentioned embodiments, the printer <b>1</b> was described as a liquid ejecting apparatus, but this does not limit the invention.
