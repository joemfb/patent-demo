<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to apparatus and method for amplifying radio frequency (RF) signals, including microwave RF signals. More particularly, the present invention pertains to a transistor gate bias circuit for RF amplifier applications to overcome device variations and changing operating conditions to control and maintain transistor drain current.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention provides an RF amplifier gate bias circuit that is appropriate for use in a wide range of frequencies and applications having no particular bounds and including KHz to GHz, including in the L, S, and C bands. The S band ranges from 2 to 4 GHz and is part of the microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum used in weather radar, surface ship radar, and communications satellites applications. The L band, referred to as the IEEE L band, is a portion of the microwave band of the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from 1 to 2 GHz. The L band is used in communications, digital audio broadcast, satellite communications, telecommunications, military, telemetry as well as other applications. For instance, the Global Positioning System (GPS) utilizes carriers in the L band. Uses for IEEE C-band frequencies, which extend from 4 to 8 GHz, include satellite communications, weather radar, and military applications.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Laterally Diffused Field Effect Transistor (LDFET), also referred to as Laterally Diffused Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (LDMOS), type Radio Frequency (RF) devices have several advantages over bipolar transistors such as higher gain, higher efficiency, and wider dynamic range of output power. LDFETs also have a major disadvantage in that the gate bias voltage (V<sub>g</sub>) required to set the quiescent current (I<sub>d</sub>) drifts over temperature, time, input drive, and frequency, as well as from device to device variations. Considerable effort has been expended by the various manufacturers of these devices to lessen this undesirable effect, but no one has fully solved the problem.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Exemplary uses of the RF amplifier gate bias circuit of the present invention are transmission applications, including transmitters, receivers, and power amplifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">What is needed is a solution to address the various undesirable operational side effects associated with use of LDFET, GaNFET, GaAsFET, JFET and other such transistors to more fully and efficiently take advantage and utilize their beneficial properties and to expand the acceptable use of such devices in a wider range of RF applications.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In addition, N-Channel depletion device-based amplifiers operate with the negative characteristic of N-channel depletion mode devices that require a negative gate voltage and gate-drain bias sequencing for proper operation. With any N-Channel depletion device, such as GaAs FET, GaN FET, or N-channel silicon junction FET, it is essential that the negative gate voltage arrives before the drain voltage otherwise the drain to source resistance is a very low value which will essentially short out the input power and likely cause damage to several circuit components including the depletion device. Existing approaches to sequencing for GaN devices, e.g., test fixture set up for fire-up and shut-down sequencing, are cumbersome and are external to the device, e.g., amplifier. For example, supplying a negative voltage on a test fixture or lab bench is typically accomplished with an external supply having negative voltage generation capability or by switching the leads between the ground node and the positive voltage node. In an application circuit the negative voltage comes from a regulator or a negative voltage generator. The goal in bias sequencing the device is to avoid areas that are sensitive to potential instability of the device, e.g., the area where V<sub>DS </sub>drain to source is low and I<sub>DS </sub>drain to source is high. What is needed is an improved sequencer for use in RF amplifiers employing N-channel depletion mode devices that is internal to the amplifier circuit or device and that is flexible in accommodating a variety of such devices having differing attributes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Applications for the invention include two-way private radio communication, broadband amplifiers, cellular infrastructure, test instrumentation, and Class A, AB, Linear amplifiers suitable for OFDM, W-CDMA, EDGE, CDMA waveforms.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">As discussed above, temperature compensation is another aspect to circuit integrity and this has further relevance to bias sequencing and to adequately maintain the bias of the device for consistent performance over temperature. The quiescent current of a GaN HEMT device is primarily a function of temperature and V<sub>GS</sub>. What is needed is a bias circuit with temperature compensation that can maintain consistent operational performance over a prescribed range of temperature fluctuation, e.g., &#x2212;50 to 100 degrees Celsius.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The present invention is intended for many uses and applications including in design and manufacture of airborne and ground-based telemetry equipment, including aircraft (manned and unmanned), ground vehicles, fixed systems and military telemetry equipment. Telemetry system components include transmitters, receivers, and power amplifiers in a wide variety of frequency ranges. As in many areas, there is a growing need and desire for telemetry components that are low cost, low power consumption (for battery, heat and other concerns), light weight, low failure rate, less complex, compact, more robust and rugged design for harsh environments, and of course high performance. For instance, the RF amplifier gate bias circuit of the present invention may be incorporated in transmitters, receivers, and power amplifiers.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In one aspect, the invention provides a transistor gate bias circuit for RF amplifiers that senses drain current and automatically adjusts or biases the gate voltage to maintain drain current independently of temperature, time, input drive, frequency, as well as from device to device variations.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another aspect of the invention a major advantage over prior art is that unlike conventional gain blocks, the supply current varies according to the output power required to maintain a constant gain.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In yet another aspect of the invention an advantage over prior circuits is that it does not attempt to minimize the spurious responses by better decoupling or improved grounding or any of the other known techniques. Rather, the circuit of the invention eliminates the problem entirely by shutting down the negative voltage deriving oscillator once it is no longer needed.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In a further aspect, the present invention provides an improved N-Channel depletion device-based amplifier with novel gate bias circuit and sequencer. With any N-Channel depletion device, such as GaAs FET, GaN FET, or N-channel silicon junction FET, it is essential that the negative gate voltage arrives before the drain voltage or the drain to source resistance is a very low value which will essentially short out the input power and likely cause damage to several circuit components including the depletion device. The present invention provides a novel sequencer for more effectively maintaining the necessary condition to prevent damage to amplifier components. The present invention may also provide an Adaptive Drain Current Control (ADCC). In a further aspect, an opto-coupler may be used in the circuit or in the alternative a battery or a Peltier Effect thermoelectric device.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the present invention involves an RF amplifier circuit comprising: a FET for receiving a RF input signal and generating an amplified RF output signal, the FET having a gate, drain, and source; a control circuit, connected to the gate and drain of the FET, for controlling the current at the drain; and a bias circuit comprising a means for biasing and variably compensating drift in the gate threshold voltage required to set the quiescent drain current, the bias circuit being connected to the control circuit and controlling operation of the control circuit to maintain constant current at the drain at wake-up transition; whereby the output remains essentially constant relative to external temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Further, the present invention may comprise temperature-sensing means, connected to the control circuit, for sensing change in temperature; and thermal compensation means, connected to the temperature-sensing means and control circuit, for automatically adjusting the drain current if the temperature decreases or increases to maintain essentially constant output with respect to temperature; whereby the control circuit maintains essentially constant current at the drain with respect to time, input drive, frequency, and device-to-device variations, but not temperature. The present invention may be adapted to provide essentially constant output power throughout operation, including wake-up transition and post-wake-up transition operation. The thermistor of the present invention may comprise both the temperature-sensing means and the thermal compensation means.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The present invention will now be described in more detail with reference to exemplary embodiments as shown in the accompanying drawings. While the present invention is described herein with reference to the exemplary embodiments, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to such exemplary embodiments. Those possessing ordinary skill in the art and having access to the teachings herein will recognize additional implementations, modifications, and embodiments, as well as other applications for use of the invention, which are fully contemplated herein as within the scope of the present invention as disclosed and claimed herein, and with respect to which the present invention could be of significant utility.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The following exemplary circuits contain values which are typical for operation at +20VDC and in the 2 to 3 GHz band and help explain the inventive contribution in terms of performance. Although the invention may be described in examples in the GHz range, it should be understood that the invention has broad application in RF applications including in the KHz range. LDFETs generally have application up to 3 GHz while GaAs and GaN FETs typically have application up to 20-30 GHz. Although particular parts and values are shown, these are by way of example to help explain the invention and are not to be considered limiting to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a prior art Radio Frequency (RF) Amplifier <b>100</b> having a supply voltage of +20Vdc <b>102</b> and which receives an RF signal input <b>118</b> and outputs an amplified RF signal <b>132</b>. Input Matching Network <b>122</b>, which can include capacitors, inductors, resistors, and transmission lines, is designed to provide required impedance matching, harmonic attenuation, bandwidth and other operating characteristics for use at operating frequencies of circuit <b>100</b> and in particular in matching the power transistor Q<b>1</b>. This matching circuit may be calculated using mathematical models and simulation programs. In the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the gate of RF power transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>124</b> is biased by adjusting the potentiometer R<b>2</b> <b>110</b> to cause the desired quiescent drain current to flow. In this example, Q<b>1</b> <b>124</b> is a 10 Watt LDMOS (Laterally Diffused Metal-Oxide Semiconductor) power transistor for applications at frequencies between 2.5 and 2.7 GHz. For example, Q<b>1</b> <b>124</b> may be part number BLF6G27-10 supplied by NXP Semiconductors. In this example, diodes <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>,<b>112</b>, <b>114</b> (CR<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) are part number 1N4148 of NXP Semiconductors. By adding or removing diodes <b>104</b>, <b>106</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>114</b> (CR<b>1</b>-<b>4</b>) in series with resistors <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> (R<b>1</b> and R<b>2</b>), the gate voltage can be made to increase or decrease as a function of temperature, thereby compensating the drift of the gate threshold voltage with respect to temperature on an open loop basis. Determining the proper temperature compensation for each device requires several temperature cycles of up to four hours each. This is obviously a time-consuming procedure tying up expensive test equipment as well as an RF technician for many hours per amplifier. Moreover, in the end this does nothing to solve the other aspects of the gate drift problem.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The amplifier <b>200</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> solves the gate drift problem by providing a drain current or gate bias control circuit <b>201</b>, including drain current sensing resistor R<b>1</b> <b>204</b>, that senses the drain current Id <b>227</b> of Q<b>2</b> <b>228</b> and automatically adjusts the gate voltage Vg <b>229</b> to maintain drain current Id <b>227</b> independently of temperature, time, input drive, frequency, as well as from device to device variations. Q<b>2</b> <b>228</b>, like Q<b>1</b> <b>124</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> above, is in this example a 10W LDMOS or LDFET power transistor. With the circuit as shown, adjusting the potentiometer R<b>3</b> <b>208</b> from end to end will cause the drain current Id <b>227</b> to vary from 650 mA to 1.60 A and, once set, Id <b>227</b> will then remain essentially constant with respect to the above parameters. In this manner, a user may increase of decrease the setting of drain current Id <b>227</b> by adjusting the potentiometer R<b>3</b>. Assume a supply voltage of +20.0 VDC <b>202</b> and a forward drop over diode CR<b>1</b> <b>212</b> of 0.70 VDC. The cathode <b>213</b> of diode <b>212</b> will then be at a potential of 19.30 VDC. The purpose of diode <b>212</b> is to temperature compensate the base (B) to emitter (E) voltage (Vbe) of Q<b>1</b> <b>214</b>. In this example, Q<b>1</b> <b>214</b> has part number 2N2907 of NXP Semiconductors, also known as PN2907, and is a bipolar transistor intended for low power amplifying or switching applications. The wiper <b>209</b> of potentiometer R<b>3</b> <b>208</b>, which is connected to the base of Q<b>1</b> <b>214</b>, will then allow adjustment from +18.98 VDC to +19.17 VDC. With the wiper <b>209</b> of potentiometer <b>208</b> centered, the base will be at +19.07 VDC. Assuming a Vbe of Q<b>1</b> of 0.70 VDC, the emitter of Q<b>1</b> will then be at +19.77 VDC. For Q<b>1</b> emitter to be at +19.77 VDC, the drain of Q<b>2</b> must draw 1.15 A (1.15 A&#xd7;0.2 ohms=0.23 VDC=20 VDC&#x2212;19.77 VDC). For this to happen, a current of approximately 1 mA must and will flow from the collector (C) of Q<b>1</b> to develop sufficient voltage across resistor R<b>6</b> <b>226</b> to bring the gate of Q<b>2</b> <b>228</b> up to the voltage required to cause 1.15 Amps, Id <b>227</b>, to flow through its drain.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Should Q<b>2</b> <b>228</b> attempt to draw more current, the base to emitter voltage (Vbe) of Q<b>1</b> <b>214</b> will be lowered, causing less current to flow to R<b>6</b> <b>226</b>, causing the gate voltage to lower, thereby lowering the drain current Id <b>227</b> of Q<b>2</b>. The opposite is true should Q<b>2</b> attempt to draw less drain current.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Inductors L<b>1</b> <b>218</b> and L<b>2</b> <b>230</b> act as RF chokes preventing RF power from reaching the collector of Q<b>1</b> <b>214</b> or the supply voltage <b>202</b>. Capacitors C<b>1</b> <b>222</b> and C<b>2</b> <b>232</b> isolate the gate (G) and drain (D) of Q<b>2</b> <b>228</b> from a DC standpoint from the input and output matching circuitry, <b>224</b> and <b>234</b> respectively. Resistor R<b>5</b> <b>216</b> acting in concert with resistor R<b>6</b> <b>226</b> forms a voltage divider which prevents the collector (C) of Q<b>1</b> <b>214</b> from supplying excessive gate voltage to Q<b>2</b> during &#x201c;wake up.&#x201d; This initial &#x201c;wake-up&#x201d; transition or period may be in the context of the transistor operation or the overall circuit operation and may occur at initial start-up and/or at other periods during operation of the circuit or a circuit or system in which the amplifier is used. For instance, the overall circuit may be turned off or go into a &#x201c;sleep&#x201d; or &#x201c;stand-by&#x201d; mode of operation in power management to conserve energy and extend lifespan. The &#x201c;wake-up&#x201d; aspect of operation of either a transistor or a circuit is known by those skilled in the art of amplifier design and use.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents an optional thermal or temperature compensation circuit <b>300</b> for incorporation into the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as shown at connection nodes <b>301</b> and <b>302</b>. The exemplary circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> includes two resistors <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> (R<b>8</b>, R<b>9</b>) and a thermistor <b>308</b> (R<b>7</b>) that are added to provide the opportunity to intentionally change the drain current Id <b>227</b> of Q<b>2</b> <b>228</b> as a function of temperature. It is often desirable to increase the drain current Id <b>227</b> as the temperature increases in order to maintain a constant output power. With the values shown, and the ambient current set to 1.15 Amps, this would increase to approximately 1.50 Amps at +70 C. However, when the drain current is allowed to change according to temperature, the function of the control circuit varies slightly. Whereas in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> the control circuit's function is to draw a constant current at the drain, its function in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is to draw a constant current at the drain with respect to all parameters except for temperature. By allowing the drain current Id to vary according to temperature, a constant output can be maintained within a range of different temperatures. This advantage is not achieved in the first embodiment of the invention. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the gate bias control circuit <b>201</b> senses the drain current Id <b>227</b> of Q<b>2</b> <b>228</b> and automatically adjusts the gate voltage Vg <b>229</b> to maintain drain current Id <b>227</b> independently of temperature, time, input drive, frequency, as well as from device to device variations. Adjusting the potentiometer R<b>3</b> <b>208</b> causes the drain current Id <b>227</b> to vary from, e.g., 650 mA to 1.60 A and, once set, Id <b>227</b> will remain essentially constant. The temperature compensation circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is used to introduce a change to separately adjust and manipulate operation of transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>214</b> to manipulate the gate voltage of LDFET Q<b>2</b> <b>228</b> so as to force more or less current to flow across the drain current sense resistor R<b>1</b> <b>204</b>. This may be particularly useful in over-temperature situations when it is desirable to have greater current flowing during &#x201c;hot&#x201d; operation.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Although improved, the circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref> suffer the disadvantage of drawing the same drain current Id <b>227</b> whether or not there is any input RF power <b>220</b> present. To solve this disadvantage, the amplifier <b>400</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes an RF Level Detector, U<b>2</b> <b>434</b>, which senses the input RF power <b>420</b> and presents a corresponding DC voltage to an input of a comparator, U<b>1</b> <b>446</b>, which serves to turn on or shut off transistor Q<b>2</b> based on a threshold reference voltage. In this manner amplifier <b>400</b> avoids unnecessary current flow and resulting undesired effects. RF Level Detector U<b>2</b> <b>434</b>, in this example, is part number AD8314 as supplied by Analog Devices, Inc. and is a 50 dB dynamic range amplifier/conditioner used for transmitter power control and other applications. RF Level Detector U<b>2</b> <b>434</b> operates in the frequency range of 0.1 to 2.5 GHz and over a typical dynamic range of 50 dB. U<b>2</b> <b>434</b> is internally AC-coupled and has high sensitivity for control at low signal levels.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">RF IN <b>420</b> is connected to amplifier circuit <b>400</b> through capacitor C<b>1</b> <b>424</b> (e.g., 12 pF) to input matching network <b>428</b> and through capacitor C<b>3</b> <b>422</b> (e.g., 1.5 pF) to RFIn input of RF Level Detector <b>434</b>. This simplified arrangement is particularly useful in narrow band applications. In one alternative, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, RF IN <b>420</b> is connected to circuit <b>400</b> through coupler <b>421</b>, which taps off some of the power flowing in the main RF path for use in a lower power path such as to drive a pre-scaler or in this case a level detector <b>434</b>. Note that for narrow band applications the simplified arrangement of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, small value capacitor rather than coupler of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, has the advantage of significantly reducing board space particularly as the operating frequency is reduced. For example at 2 GHz and a dielectric constant of 3.5 and a board thickness of 20 mils, the coupler trace would be approximately 0.860&#x2033; in length and 0.140&#x2033; in width. At 400 MHz, the trace length would increase to 4.30&#x2033; with the same width. By comparison a 0402 capacitor occupies an area of 0.04&#x2033;&#xd7;0.02&#x2033;. The disadvantage of the simplified capacitor arrangement is that the amount of coupled energy becomes a function of frequency&#x2212;Zc=1/(2&#x3c0;&#xd7;F&#xd7;C). Since the F term (frequency) is in the denominator, the Zc decreases as frequency increases thereby increasing the coupled energy. With consideration of this trade-off, either arrangement may be used in the circuits of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-13</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, a recent transistor technology is that of Gallium Nitride Field Effect Transistor (GaNFET), such as transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>902</b>, which has among its advantages higher operating voltage, higher temperature operation, higher efficiency, and higher frequency operation than LDFETs. Both the GaNFET Q<b>1</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> and the LDFET Q<b>2</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> are positive sense with respect to the gate voltage in that a more positive (or less negative in the case of GaNFET) voltage on the gate results in higher drain current. While a typical gate voltage on a LDFET may be in the +1 to +2VDC range, the gate on a GaNFET will normally operate in the &#x2212;2 to &#x2212;1VDC range. This applies equally to GaAs FETs and JFETS for that matter. GaNFET transistors have similar gate drift problems as LDFETs, but as stated above they have the further complication of a negative gate voltage requirement. In many situations, such as in airborne applications, it is unusual to have a negative voltage available. To satisfy the negative voltage requirement, prior circuits such as <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> used a negative voltage driver IC such as the Maxim Semiconductor MAX881 (U<b>1</b>) <b>902</b>. The output <b>3</b> (NegOut) of this device is presented to diodes CR<b>1</b>-<b>4</b> <b>904</b> and potentiometer R<b>1</b> <b>906</b> connected in series. Much like the LDFET prior art as discussed above, prior GaNFET transistor circuits used a similar approach of adding or removing diodes to accomplish temperature compensation for the threshold voltage on an open loop basis. Again, one problem with this solution is that the temperature compensation procedure is very labor and equipment intensive. Another problem is that U<b>1</b> <b>902</b> includes a square wave oscillator which causes spurious responses on the output of GaNFET power transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>908</b>. In this example Q<b>1</b> <b>908</b> is a 25 W, RF Power GaNFET with part number CGH40025F as manufactured by Cree, Inc. There are many such devices available along with publicly available application notes expressing techniques concerning how to minimize such spurs.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, one of the advantages of the GaNFET amplifier <b>1000</b> over prior circuits is that it does not attempt to minimize the spurious responses caused by the negative voltage deriver IC by better decoupling or improved grounding or any of the other techniques shared in the application notes. Rather, amplifier <b>1000</b> eliminates the problem entirely by shutting down the oscillator <b>1040</b> once it is no longer needed. In general, the oscillator of negative voltage driver U<b>1</b> <b>1040</b> is only needed momentarily as a &#x201c;starter&#x201d; for a few milliseconds, i.e., long enough for transistor Q<b>2</b> <b>1010</b> to come to life. To avoid the undesired effect of the spurious oscillator signal of the negative voltage driver U<b>1</b> <b>1040</b>, the invention shuts down the driver after start up and relies on the RF output transistor Q<b>2</b> itself to maintain operating conditions. The RF on the drain of Q<b>2</b> <b>1010</b> generates and provides the negative supply for the transistor. Once the transistor Q<b>2</b> <b>1010</b> &#x201c;comes to life&#x201d; and self supplies the negative gate voltage then the negative voltage driver <b>1040</b> shuts down and in this manner the amplifier <b>1000</b> removes the spurious oscillator signal of the driver <b>1040</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Amplifier <b>1000</b> is connected to supply voltage <b>1002</b> (+20VDC) and receives RF IN <b>1004</b> which is connected to the gate of transistor Q<b>2</b> through capacitor <b>1006</b> and input matching network <b>1008</b>. In this example, transistor Q<b>2</b> <b>1010</b> is a GaNFET having part number GCH40025F, as described above. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, negative voltage driver U<b>1</b> <b>1040</b> as connected generates approximately &#x2212;5.0 VDC at output <b>3</b> (NegOut). This voltage then passes through Schottkey diode CR<b>3</b> having part number CDBU0130L, such as made by Discrete Semiconductor Products, to present &#x2212;4.6 VDC to the negative supply (input <b>2</b>) of operational amplifier U<b>2</b> <b>1044</b>. U<b>2</b> <b>1044</b>, as connected at node <b>1002</b>, then presents a regulated &#x2212;4.5 VDC to resistor R<b>6</b> <b>1024</b>. The key is to configure the circuit so that the level is more negative than the level required to shut down Q<b>2</b> <b>1010</b>. The gate bias circuit <b>1012</b> includes drain current sensing resistor R<b>1</b> <b>1014</b>, bipolar PNP transistor <b>1016</b> (connected to potentiometer R<b>3</b> <b>1020</b>), and resistor R<b>5</b> <b>1018</b> and operates much as does the LDFET gate bias circuit <b>201</b> described above except in the case of the GaNFET gate bias circuit the voltage increases to the value required by starting from a negative potential rather than from ground (as in the case of the LDFET bias circuit <b>201</b>). In both cases the sense is positive, i.e., increasing voltage on the transistor gate, in this case of transistor Q<b>2</b> <b>1010</b>, causes an increase in drain current, in this case drain current Id <b>1011</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The shutoff function is accomplished by a coupler <b>1046</b> which pulls a fraction of the RF power present at the drain of Q<b>2</b> <b>1010</b> and presents this power to the input of the negative voltage deriver <b>1048</b>, comprised of capacitors C<b>3</b> and C<b>4</b> and diode pair CR<b>2</b> (part number 2822), operating at the carrier frequency. This detected negative voltage is then presented to the negative supply (pin <b>2</b>) of U<b>2</b> <b>1044</b> through CR<b>4</b> <b>1050</b>. In addition, this negative voltage is connected to resistor R<b>12</b> which in conjunction with resistor R<b>11</b> are connected to pin <b>5</b> (SHDN) of U<b>1</b> <b>1040</b> and causes the oscillator section of U<b>1</b> to shut down. U<b>1</b> <b>1040</b> then in effect acts as a starter, i.e., it operates only long enough for the amplifier U<b>2</b> <b>1044</b> to begin delivering RF power and then automatically shuts off thereby eliminating spurs caused by its internal oscillator.</p>

In this regard, this circuit will perform similarly to a Class H amplifier except drain current is modulated rather that drain voltage. Class H amplifiers operate with infinitely variable supply rails. This is done by modulating the supply rails so that the rails are only a few volts larger than the output signal at any given time. Switching regulator power supplies are commonly used to create the tracking rails. The problem with Class H amplifiers is that switching regulators have notoriously low bandwidth, usually sufficient only for audio frequencies. The circuit of the invention on the other hand can operate well into the MHz range and is a far simpler and less expensive implementation.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In accordance with this alternative design, the exemplary 10K ohm resistor <b>1026</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> is replaced with a 100 K ohm resistor <b>1326</b> in the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>.

As a RF signal is applied to the RF input <b>1004</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>), this signal is amplified and a negative voltage is generated at the output of the dual diode detector CR<b>2</b>.

In this example, Q<b>3</b> <b>1406</b> is a device available from Cree, Inc. and having product number CGH40006P, which is a gallium nitride (GaN) high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) offering 28 VDC and up to 6 GHz operation. Gallium Nitride (GaN) HEMTs (High Electron Mobility Transistors) or GaN FETs or GaN MMICs (Monolithic, Microwave Integrated Circuit) (referred to herein collectively and interchangeably) are a relatively new generation of RF power transistor technology that offers the operating characteristics of higher power, higher efficiency and wider bandwidth when compared with GaAs- and Si-based technologies, e.g., LDMOS FETs. GaN HEMTs are depletion mode devices, meaning a negative gate voltage and gate-drain bias sequencing is required for proper operation. With any N-Channel depletion device, such as GaAs FET, GaN FET, or N-channel silicon junction FET, it is essential that the negative gate voltage arrives before the drain voltage. Otherwise the drain to source resistance is a very low value which will essentially short out the input power and likely cause damage to several circuit components including the depletion device.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The CGH40006, operating from a 28 volt rail, provides a general purpose, broadband solution to a variety of RF and microwave applications. GaN HEMTs provide high efficiency, high gain and wide bandwidth capabilities making them attractive for linear and compressed amplifier circuits in a variety of applications, including aviation, communication (including telecommunications), weather RF. Moreover, material characteristics associated with wide-bandgap III-nitride materials such as AlGaN/GaN HEMTs make them attractive for use in integrated circuits to perform reliably in operations at high temperature not readily possible for silicon- or GaAs-based devices. These high-temperature digital circuits provide improved and enabling technology for many applications including intelligent control and sensing for use in automotive, aviation, chemical reactor, and oil exploration systems.</p>

The MOSFET or MESFET saturates (pinches off) when Vds is greater or equal than/to Vgs&#x2212;Vtn. Negative Voltage deriver circuit <b>1414</b> includes U<b>2</b> <b>1415</b>, which is a negative voltage deriver, such as an oscillator, that also is a low dropout device&#x2014;i.e., its output voltage (at pin <b>5</b>) follows its input voltage within millivolts, though inverted and therefore negative.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">For example at a circuit input voltage of +5.0 VDC, U<b>1</b> output will be approximately +4.9 VDC and the output of U<b>2</b> <b>1415</b> will be approximately &#x2212;4.8 VDC. The negative rail of U<b>3</b> <b>1417</b> will then be about &#x2212;4.1 VDC assuming a diode drop across CR<b>5</b> <b>1416</b> of 0.7 VDC. As the input voltage is increased from 0 VDC, the output of U<b>1</b> <b>1410</b> closely tracks the input until the specified regulator output voltage of +5 VDC is reached.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Assuming a minimum threshold voltage of 2VDC for Q<b>1</b> <b>1404</b>, this device will therefore not begin turning on until an input voltage on the +Vin line reaches 5 VDC+Vth=+7 VDC and at 7 VDC no current through drain choke inductor L<b>1</b> <b>1408</b>. A threshold voltage of 4 VDC would increase this to +9 VDC. It is imperative that there is minimal current through Q<b>1</b> <b>1404</b> while in the linear state between fully off and fully on. This results in the minimum dissipation in this device which permits miniaturization, which is an important advantage to the invention. In the event it may be desirable to increase the apparent threshold voltage of Q<b>1</b>, a resistor can be placed between the gate and source as shown (R<b>1</b>) <b>1418</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">With an input voltage of +7VDC on the +Vin input line and assuming no drain current through Q<b>3</b> <b>1406</b>, and no voltage at R<b>3</b>, Q<b>2</b> <b>1420</b> will be saturated since in this situation there is actually more base current than collector current. The Q<b>2</b> <b>1420</b> collector voltage will be at about +6.8 VDC which through voltage divider R<b>6</b> (15Kohm)/R<b>7</b> (1Kohm) will result in a voltage at Pin #<b>3</b> of op-amp U<b>3</b> of +0.425 VDC and a voltage at input #<b>4</b> of U<b>3</b> of 4.575 VDC. This would result in an output voltage of the op amp of &#x2212;4.150 VDC which when applied to Q<b>3</b> <b>1406</b> through L<b>2</b> <b>1422</b> places this device well in to the pinch-off region&#x2014;therefore no drain current. Voltage divider R<b>6</b>/R<b>7</b> insures that Q<b>1</b> does not have power dissipated through it (thus no need for heat sink). Even in a barely on condition current is only 1-2 milliamps. The voltage divider also sets the maximum voltage out of op amp U<b>3</b> at &#x2212;1.5 V and never positive as a safeguard for Q<b>3</b> <b>1406</b>. This circuit ensures that Q<b>1</b> is well on before current flows through the drain of Q<b>3</b>. In this circuit Q<b>1</b> may be a small device avoiding the need for a heat sink thus resulting in desirable miniaturization. In addition, the circuit avoids the need for a coupler thus resulting in further miniaturization.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Drain current setting resistor R<b>3</b> <b>1407</b> is a sense resistor that sets the current through Q<b>2</b>. In addition, during fabrication, maintenance or repair, when Q<b>3</b> is not part of the circuit leads may be provided to connect the circuit to various GaN/GaAs devices. Leads across R<b>3</b> may be used to set current depending on the particular Q<b>3</b> device used. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, Q<b>3</b> is a GaN HEMT device available from Cree, Inc. of Durham, N.C. (www.cree.com) having part number CHP40006P. Parts are also available from Gain Microwave (www.gainmicrowave.com) and from Nitronex Corporation (www.nitronex.com).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Working backwards through the circuit and assuming a threshold pinch-off voltage of &#x2212;3.00 VDC for Q<b>3</b> <b>1406</b>, it can be shown that this device starts conducting at an input voltage of +16.2 VDC on the +Vin line. From 7 VDC to 16.2 VDC there is no current through Q<b>1</b>. This shows that Q<b>1</b> <b>1404</b> is well into its low impedance state before there is appreciable current through it&#x2014;again this being desired for minimal dissipation in this device.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Normal operation of Q<b>3</b> <b>1404</b> occurs with the gate at approximately &#x2212;2.0 VDC although this varies somewhat from device to device, temperature, frequency, and time. This corresponds to an input voltage on the +Vin line of approximately +24 VDC. For any voltage above +24 VDC the circuit performs as the others described in this application. Note that another desirable feature of this circuit is that at input voltage of +28 VDC, the highest voltage that can be applied to the gate of Q<b>3</b> is &#x2212;1.5 VDC. It is important that this voltage never reaches a positive value or Q<b>3</b> would likely be damaged or destroyed.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Operation of the negative deriving circuit <b>1414</b>, U<b>2</b> <b>1415</b> and associated components, operate similarly to the previously described circuits involving depletion mode devices with the exception that the output RF power is sampled via sampling circuit <b>1412</b>, comprising C<b>4</b> and R<b>8</b>, rather than a coupler as described elsewhere with respect to other circuits, e.g., coupler <b>506</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. This also contributes to the advantage of circuit miniaturization.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The above circuit is described in the context of a first scenario in which +V<sub>in </sub>is, for example, a battery source that slowly rises at turn on from 0 to 28 VDC. In an alternative scenario, an instantaneous 28 VDC source may be switched on or otherwise supplied. In this scenario, capacitor C<b>1</b> <b>1419</b> slows down to allow the negative voltage to come up. Value for C<b>1</b> in this example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is 1 &#x3bc;F but may be derived from time needed to allow negative voltage deriver circuit to come up. In cases in which the +Vin is applied instantaneously, C<b>1</b> <b>1419</b> causes a delay in the turn on of Q<b>1</b> <b>1404</b> so that the negative generator <b>1414</b> will have time to power up and generate the negative gate voltage before the drain voltage arrives. Upon shut down, CR<b>1</b> <b>1421</b> provides a rapid discharge path for C<b>1</b> <b>1419</b> so that Q<b>1</b> <b>1404</b> shuts off before the negative gate voltage collapses. This prevents Q<b>3</b> <b>1406</b> from having drain voltage without a negative gate voltage which could result in damage to this device during shut down. If the output of U<b>3</b> <b>1417</b> goes positive, the Q<b>3</b> would be damaged or destroyed as the GaN HEMT must always be negative. By using these techniques, the invention in essence &#x201c;domesticates&#x201d; Q<b>3</b> <b>1406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Optionally, an automatic drain current adjustment circuit may be added to the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> connecting between node <b>1424</b> and the input to base of Q<b>2</b>. For example, the emitter of an NPN bipolar transistor (not shown) may be connected through a resistor to node <b>1424</b> with the base of the BJT connected to a +5VDC source (resistor-diode-ground arrangement) the collector of the BJT is connected through a resistor to the input circuit to the base of Q<b>2</b> <b>1420</b>. In this manner, drain current may be set as a function of input power (sensed). For example, with low RFin and low RF out the node <b>1424</b> is not very negative and therefore can lower drain current.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In addition, features as described above in relation to other circuits may be used on connection with the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and those that follow. For instance, RF level detectors (<b>712</b>/<b>714</b>), adjusting means to set current (<b>716</b>), failure detection, damage prevention, etc. Likewise use of features described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-19</figref> may be used in connection with other circuits discussed above. For example, an opto-coupler may be used as the negative voltage generator U<b>2</b> <b>1415</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and for the negative voltage generator U<b>1</b> <b>1040</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. An exemplary opto-coupler is the opto-isolated photovoltaic Iso-gate MOSFET Driver available from Dionics, Inc. (www.dionics-usa.com) with part number DIG-12-06-250M.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Also, in comparing the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> (and those that follow) with that of FIG. <b>10</b>A/B, we see that the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> has the advantage of going directly into the gate of Q<b>3</b> <b>1406</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) rather than through resistor R<b>6</b> <b>1024</b> and into Q<b>2</b> <b>1010</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>). For example, R<b>6</b> <b>1024</b> makes the circuit too soft in that much over 1 milliamp from gate overwhelms and makes it less negative at R<b>6</b> and this may lead to loss of control of circuit. Preferably the circuit operates at &#x2212;2.0 V at 1 milliamp. For example, in one application the standard is around 2 milliamps and with the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> operation works for Q<b>3</b> <b>1406</b> up to 5 milliamps gate current. Also, the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> provides greater miniaturization in using Q<b>1</b> <b>1404</b>, which does not need a heat sink and replaces external sequencer not shown with respect to the circuits shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-13</figref>. Also, the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> and those that follow do not need two sequenced supplies for gate and drain but rather a single supply Vin for input into the internal sequencer, e.g., <b>1402</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, in this embodiment the present invention provides an improved N-Channel depletion device-based amplifier <b>1500</b> with a novel gate bias circuit <b>1501</b> (largely as discussed hereinabove in connection with other exemplary embodiments) and a novel sequencer circuit as shown in hatched line <b>1502</b>. The purpose of the sequencer <b>1502</b> is to ensure that the GaN device Q<b>4</b> <b>1506</b> is in pinch-off before the drain voltage is applied. If the drain voltage is applied before the gate voltage, Q<b>4</b> <b>1506</b> essentially acts as a short circuit and either it or the power supply or both will be destroyed. Since GaN transistor devices are N-Channel enhancement mode devices, this means that the gate voltage (Vgs) must be at the most negative specified voltage threshold or less (more negative). For this example, a negative gate voltage of &#x2212;3.8 Vdc or more negative is required to assure pinch-off for Q<b>4</b> <b>1506</b>. Bias sequencer circuit <b>1502</b> includes Q<b>1</b> <b>1504</b>, which is an enhancement mode P-Channel MOSFET with a minimum specified threshold voltage of &#x2212;1Vgs and a maximum of &#x2212;3Vgs. U<b>1</b> <b>1510</b> is a low drop-out regulator with a drop out voltage &#x3c;0.5 Vdc.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As Vin increases from 0 Vdc to +5 Vdc, the output of the low drop out regulator U<b>1</b> <b>1510</b> tracks the input within 0.5 Vdc. Therefore the Vgs of Q<b>1</b> <b>1504</b> is always &#x3c;&#x2212;0.5 Vdc so Q<b>1</b> is off during that period. When Vin reaches +7Vdc, Q<b>1</b> reaches its lower specified threshold voltage of &#x2212;1 Vgs due to the voltage dividing action of R<b>1</b> and R<b>5</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As Vin further increases, Q<b>1</b> <b>1504</b> will begin conducting. When the drain of Q<b>1</b> reaches approximately +1.4 Vdc, Q<b>2</b> <b>1505</b> turns on and pulls the gate of Q<b>1</b> more negative with respect to its source. Thus Q<b>2</b> <b>1505</b> provides regenerative feedback to Q<b>1</b> causing it to operate in a lower Rds region. This is desirable so as to minimize the dissipation in Q<b>1</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">At the upper Vgs threshold specification of &#x2212;3Vgs, Q<b>1</b> will begin turning on at a Vin of +11 Vdc. Similar to above when Q<b>1</b> begins conducting and its drain reaches +1.4 Vdc, it will be turn on harder due to the regenerative feedback action of Q<b>2</b> <b>1505</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">One very desirable feature of this circuit is that the switching transistor Q<b>1</b> <b>1504</b> conducts essentially no current during its transition between the On and Off states so as to minimize dissipation in this device as is required for circuit miniaturization. Therefore Q<b>4</b> <b>1506</b> must be in pinch-off during this transition&#x2014;which we will now prove.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">At Vin of 11 Vdc (the upper limit of threshold voltage for Q<b>1</b>) the non-inverting input (pin #<b>3</b>) to op amp U<b>3</b> <b>1517</b> will be at +1.19 Vdc. The output (pin #<b>1</b>) of U<b>3</b> <b>1517</b> will then attempt to go to &#x2212;4.98 Vdc but will be limited by the negative rail to actually go to approximately &#x2212;4.4 Vdc. This voltage is then applied to the gate of Q<b>4</b> <b>1506</b> through L<b>3</b>. Since the CGH4000P has a maximum pinch-off specification of &#x2212;3.8 VDC, it will be well into pinch-off. At the lower threshold voltage specification of Q<b>1</b> of &#x2212;1 Vgs, the output of U<b>2</b> will attempt to go to an even more negative voltage but will be again be limited to approximately &#x2212;4.4 Vdc so Q<b>4</b> will be well into in pinch-off in either case.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Normal operation of Q<b>4</b> occurs in the &#x2212;2 Vgs region which will require Vin=+21.5 Vdc which is well below the recommended +28 Vdd for the device. This means that once Vin exceeds +21.5 Vdc, the sequencer falls out of the circuit and will in no way interfere with the correct operation of Q<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">For the case in which Vin is applied instantly, C<b>1</b> <b>1519</b> prevents Q<b>1</b> <b>1504</b> from turning on until U<b>2</b> <b>1515</b> and associated circuitry is able to provide the required negative voltage. With the values shown, U<b>2</b> <b>1515</b> reaches &#x2212;5 Vdc in approximately two milliseconds whereas C<b>1</b> <b>1519</b> delays the turn on of Q<b>1</b> for about 20 milliseconds (mS).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">During power shutdown it is imperative that Q<b>1</b> shuts off before the negative gate bias to Q<b>4</b> is removed. This is accomplished by CR<b>1</b> <b>1521</b> which provides a low impedance path to C<b>1</b> <b>1519</b> so that Vgs of Q<b>1</b> <b>1504</b> will be removed within microseconds whereas C<b>8</b> will hold the negative gate voltage to Q<b>4</b> for approximately five mS.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">R<b>24</b> and C<b>12</b> offer an amplitude modulation input port <b>1526</b> which operates as follows. Q<b>4</b> must first be driven well into saturation&#x2014;by increasing the input RF drive by 6 dB (for example) beyond the one dB compression point (P1 db). Further, the drain current should be set well below its maximum recommended value&#x2014;for example 50%. While operating in this configuration, output RF power will now be determined by the drain current rather than by the input RF drive as is the usual case for amplitude modulated amplifiers. As the voltage to the modulation input port is increased (more positive), Vgs increases (less negative), the drain current then increases, and as a direct result the output RF power also increases. In this manner the amplitude of the output RF power is modulated by the signal at the modulation input port.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">This circuit will find significant application in advanced digital modulation applications which depend upon amplitude modulation. The advantage of this circuit is that it always operates in saturation as opposed to conventional AM amplifiers which operate in Class-A. The accompanying increase in efficiency will be very substantial. For example Class-A amplifiers have a maximum theoretical efficiency of 50% whereas saturated amplifiers can exceed 80%.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, a circuit <b>1600</b> is shown that is in essence the circuit <b>1500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> modified to replace the U<b>2</b>-based negative voltage deriver circuit <b>1514</b> with an Optically Coupled Negative Generator circuit <b>1614</b>. Circuit <b>1600</b> operates much as circuit <b>1500</b> with the difference that an optically coupled isolated voltage generator U<b>7</b> <b>1615</b> is substituted for the negative voltage generating oscillator <b>1515</b>. With the positive output pins (<b>5</b> &#x26; <b>7</b>) of U<b>7</b> <b>1615</b> grounded, a negative voltage is available on Pins <b>6</b> &#x26; <b>8</b>. Since this is a spur-free generator, there is no need to shut it off as in the previous circuits. The disadvantage is that the generator's output is in the microamp range so this circuit will operate only with GaN devices with very low gate current.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Now referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>, showing connecting points <b>17</b>B<b>1</b>-<b>17</b>B<b>3</b>, in this embodiment the present invention provides an improved N-Channel depletion device-based amplifier <b>1700</b> with a novel gate bias circuit <b>1701</b> (as discussed hereinabove in connection with other exemplary embodiments) and a novel sequencer circuit <b>1702</b> along with an Adaptive Current Control Circuit. The Adaptive Current Control Circuit includes U<b>4</b> <b>1703</b>, which along with its associated components adds several useful features to the control circuit. U<b>4</b> <b>1703</b> measures the input RF power and outputs a voltage which is approximately linear over its input power range of &#x2212;5 dBm to +5 dBm. The output of U<b>4</b> (pin #<b>5</b>) goes to an emitter follower Q<b>5</b> <b>1704</b> the collector of which acts as a variable current sink. As the input power is increased, the output voltage of U<b>4</b> <b>1703</b> increases which in turn causes Q<b>5</b> <b>1704</b> to sink more current. As this current is drawn from the junction of R<b>7</b>, R<b>8</b>, R<b>15</b> and the base of Q<b>3</b> <b>1705</b>, the voltage across the sense resistor R<b>6</b> is increased causing the drain current of Q<b>4</b> <b>1706</b> to increase. The numerous applications for the circuit, including the Adaptive Current Control Circuit which lowers drain current for greater efficiency, includes CDMA (code division multiple access) based and other RF and radio communication technologies.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Note that as resistors R<b>8</b>, R<b>15</b>, R<b>16</b>, R<b>17</b> are adjusted, an infinite number of RF input power versus drain current curves are made possible. See <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref> sample curves A through G. Curve A is the constant current configuration which operates as the circuits of the main patent. Curve B is especially interesting in that it causes the circuit to perform as an adaptable Class-A device&#x2014;i.e. the drain current of Q<b>4</b> <b>1706</b> changes as a function of the input RF power. The overall circuit therefore performs with the efficiency of Class-AB operation but with the linearity of Class-A. Traditional Class-A circuits draw the same current independently of input RF power resulting in much worse efficiency at low input levels.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">Curve C would result in some residual current to keep Q<b>4</b> &#x201c;alive&#x201d; with low or no input signals. This is often desirable as the GaN devices can go unstable with low drain current. Curves D and F are related, the difference being the steepness of the Pin versus Id slope. Curve F is essentially a switch turning on Q<b>4</b> <b>1706</b> only when input RF is present. Curve E is a combination of Curves C and D.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Now referring to the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, showing connecting points <b>18</b>B<b>1</b>-<b>18</b>B<b>4</b>, the negative voltage at the junction of CR<b>4</b>, CR<b>5</b>, C<b>8</b>, and U<b>3</b> <b>1802</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18B</figref>) is a rough measure of the output RF power. When this voltage is applied to R<b>19</b> <b>1804</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18A</figref>) a current is pulled from the emitter of Q<b>6</b> <b>1805</b> and ultimately from the junction <b>1807</b> of R<b>7</b>, R<b>18</b>, R<b>8</b>, and Q<b>3</b>. As the output power is increased, more current is drawn from the junction which in turn causes Id of Q<b>4</b> <b>1806</b> to increase. Note that this circuit requires a residual current as in Curve E set by R<b>8</b> lest the circuit will not start. R<b>18</b> sets the maximum Id since at some point Q<b>6</b> will saturate and no more current will be drawn from the above junction regardless of the level of output power.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Now referring to the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19A and 19B</figref>, showing connecting points <b>19</b>B<b>1</b>-<b>19</b>B<b>3</b>, circuit <b>1900</b> is a less sophisticated version of the Adaptive Current Control Circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref> but is also less costly and occupies less space leading to further miniaturization. Unlike the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>, circuit <b>1900</b> does not require a residual current thereby permitting it to act as a switch&#x2014;turning on Id only when input RF power is present. Curves A through G of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A and 20B</figref> can be approximated with this circuit but with somewhat less accuracy than with the circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A and 17B</figref>. CR<b>7</b> <b>1902</b> and C<b>10</b> <b>1903</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19A</figref>) detect the input RF level and convert this to a negative voltage which is applied to R<b>21</b> <b>1904</b>. This then draws current from the junction <b>1905</b> of R<b>7</b>, R<b>8</b>, R<b>22</b>, and Q<b>3</b> acting through Q<b>7</b>. Similar to above, R<b>22</b> <b>1906</b> sets the maximum current that can be drawn from this junction <b>1905</b> effectively setting the maximum Id. R<b>20</b> <b>1907</b> and CR<b>6</b> <b>1908</b> bias the base of Q<b>7</b> to approximately +0.7 VDC which puts the emitter of Q<b>7</b> very close to 0 VDC so that the detector can operate correctly at low levels of input RF power. CR<b>6</b> <b>1908</b> also temperature compensates the Vbe of Q<b>7</b>.</p>
