<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION AND PRIORITY CLAIM</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application is a divisional of co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/673,661, filed Sep. 29, 2003, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/414,133, filed Sep. 28, 2002. The entire text of each of the above-referenced disclosures is specifically incorporated by reference herein without disclaimer.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a dermal tissue transplantation system. More particularly, this invention relates to a system for obtaining, processing, collecting, and applying tissue samples for purposes of transplantation</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Traditional skin grafting is accomplished by taking a thin slice of dermal tissue from a donor site in order to cover a wound site, such as a burn area. In some instances, the slice of dermal tissue is meshed to expand its size, creating a meshed graft. Traditional devices used to harvest the tissue from the donor site include dermatomes, which function in many respects similar to a cheese slicer.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditional meshed grafting techniques have been shown to yield 90% viability at the donor site. A slightly lower viability rate occurs for non-meshed sheet grafts, mostly due to fluid accumulation under the sheet graft. Factors that lead to graft failure include poor circulation, unclean wounds, patient interference with the graft dressing, obesity, and smoking. Additionally, in at least approximately 10% of cases, infection at the donor site occurs. Although such donor site infections are not likely related to graft failure at the wound site, they still pose problems for both the patient and caregiver.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditional meshing techniques yield a most favorable expansion ratio of 6:1. (for example a 1 cm<sup>2 </sup>donor site can cover a 6 cm<sup>2 </sup>wound site). While greater ratios of 9:1 and 12:1 are certainly possible, there is also a significant delay in epithelialization with such ratios.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Micro grafting techniques, in which the donor tissue is actually minced in order to achieve a greater than 10:1 expansion ratio, are known in the art. Such techniques allow for a much greater coverage area from a small donor site. However, traditional techniques are cumbersome, and often the viability of the cells is compromised to such an extent that sometimes less than 50% of the cells are viable when applied to the wound site.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a simpler grafting procedure, improve micro-graft viability (&#x201c;take&#x201d;), reduce the bio-burden at the wound site by better preparation of the wound bed prior to grafting, improve the cosmetics of grafts as compared to meshed grafts, and reduce the size of the donor site.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Additional objects of the present invention include a significant reduction in the size of the donor site as compared to traditional mesh-graft procedures; minimizing scarring of the graft site as compared to traditional mesh-graft procedures; improvement of the pliability of tissue in the graft site; improvement of the cosmetic appearance of the graft site as compared to current methods; and improvement of graft &#x201c;take.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">It is still a further object of this invention to provide a grafting technique that does not extend the healing time as compared with traditional mesh-grafts, while also reducing the cost and time required to complete the procedure.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Although those of ordinary skill in the art will readily recognize many alternative embodiments, especially in light of the illustrations provided herein, this detailed description is exemplary of the preferred embodiment of the present invention as well as alternate embodiments, the scope of which is limited only by the claims that may be drawn hereto.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring now to the drawings, the details of preferred embodiments of the present invention are graphically and schematically illustrated. Like elements in the drawings are represented by like numbers, and any similar elements are represented by like numbers with a different lower case letter suffix.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the dermal tissue nano-grafting system <b>10</b> of the present invention comprises three main components: a tissue particle harvester assembly <b>20</b> for cutting tissue particles from dermal tissue; at issue particle collector <b>30</b> for receiving, separating and collecting the tissue particles; and a chambered dressing <b>40</b> for receiving the collected tissue particles and culturing the growth of a dermal tissue graft. The ideal size of the tissue collected is about 50-300 microns; with the median particle size about 100 microns. The tissue particle harvester assembly <b>20</b> excises tissue particles of an appropriate size range from a dermal tissue source. The tissue particle collector <b>30</b> receives the harvested tissue particle, collects and holds them in a proper environment to maintain their viability prior to seeding the particles in a chambered dressing <b>40</b>. The chambered dressing <b>40</b> of the present invention is a type of tissue culture device for growing dermal graft tissue in situ on a skin graft site. Exemplary devices that may be used for the chambered dressing <b>40</b> are described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,152,757, issued on Oct. 6, 1992 to Eriksson, entitled &#x201c;System For Diagnosis And Treatment Of Wounds&#x201d; and U.S. Provisional patent application Ser. No. 10/361,341, entitled &#x201c;Environmental Control Device For Tissue Treatment&#x201d; filed on Feb. 11, 2002, by Johnson, et al., the disclosures of which are incorporated by reference herein as though fully set forth.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the tissue particle harvester assembly <b>20</b> comprises a harvester housing <b>50</b>, a tissue cutting tool <b>90</b> and a drive means <b>160</b>. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the harvester housing <b>50</b> has a tissue opening <b>54</b> accessing an interior space <b>56</b>, into which a tissue-cutting tool <b>90</b> is received. As further exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>, the harvester housing <b>50</b> interfaces with the dermal tissue source <b>14</b> from which tissue particles are to be harvested, and holds the tissue cutting tool <b>90</b> in a proper position relative to, the dermal tissue <b>14</b>. The tissue opening <b>54</b> of harvester housing <b>50</b> serves as an orifice for pressing against and receiving a dermal tissue layer of the tissue source <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A proper position of the cutting tool <b>90</b> relative to the dermal tissue source <b>14</b> relates to the depth of penetration of the cutting tool <b>90</b> into the layers of the dermal tissue <b>14</b>. A proper positioning of the cutting tool <b>90</b> facilitates excising tissue particles of an appropriate size. The depth of penetration of the cutting tool <b>90</b> into the surface of the tissue <b>14</b> should range from about 0.01 mm to about 0.9 mm, and preferably should be about 0.1 mm+/&#x2212;0.05 mm, depending on the type of cutting tool <b>90</b> being used. The depth of penetration can be modified by a number of means known to one of ordinary skill in the art, including adjusting the proximity of the cutting tool to the tissue opening <b>54</b> in the housing <b>50</b>, and by adjusting the cutting aspect <b>118</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) of the cutting features <b>114</b> of the cutting tool <b>90</b>. The cutting aspect <b>118</b> of a cutting feature <b>114</b> is the reach of a cutting feature <b>114</b> beyond the cutting surface <b>94</b> of the tool <b>90</b>. The harvester housing <b>50</b> can include a depth adjustment means for adjusting the proximity of the cutting tool to the tissue opening <b>54</b> in the housing <b>50</b>. Again, such adjustment means are known to and practicable in the present harvester assembly <b>20</b> by the ordinary skilled artisan. For example, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, such adjustment means <b>58</b> can be made by moving an edge of the tissue opening <b>54</b> closer to, or farther away, from the cutting tool <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, a tissue cutting tool <b>90</b> has a cutting surface <b>94</b> and cutting features <b>114</b> which project from the cutting surface <b>94</b> and impinges on the tissue source <b>14</b> to cut or excise tissue particles of an appropriate size from the tissue <b>14</b> when the cutting tool <b>90</b> is rotated. A rotatable shaft <b>96</b> extends from the tool <b>90</b> along its axis of rotation <b>100</b>. The rotatable shaft <b>96</b> has a drive end <b>96</b><i>a </i>for engaging a drive means and a tool end <b>96</b><i>b </i>for mounting the cutting surface <b>94</b>. The cutting tool shaft drive end <b>96</b><i>a </i>is receivable by a drive means <b>160</b> (e.g., see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10B and 16A</figref> &#x26; <b>16</b>B) to impart rotation to the cutting tool <b>90</b>. The rotating drum type cutting tool <b>90</b><i>a </i>shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> has a tool end shaft <b>96</b><i>b </i>that extending from the tool <b>90</b> along the axis of rotation <b>100</b> opposite the drive end <b>96</b><i>a</i>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the drum of the tool <b>90</b> has it axis disposed coaxially with the axis <b>100</b> of the rotatable shaft <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The cutting surface <b>94</b> of a rotating drum type cutting tool <b>90</b> <i>a </i>can be practiced with any of a variety of different cutting features <b>114</b> selectable by the ordinary skilled artisan. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>, the cutting features are a plurality of sharpened fingers <b>114</b><i>a </i>inserted into L-shaped slots <b>113</b>, projecting from the cutting surface <b>94</b> spaced apart and in rows, forming a serrated blade <b>115</b>. Examples of other types of cutting features <b>114</b> practicable on the drum-type cutting tool <b>90</b> <i>a </i>include: &#x201c;TI&#x201d; type cutting features <b>114</b> <i>b </i>on a rotary drum type cutting tool (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>); &#x201c;scallop&#x201d; type cutting features <b>114</b> <i>c </i>with hypo-tubes on a rotary drum type cutting tool (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>); and &#x201c;square scallop&#x201d; type cutting features <b>114</b> <i>d </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) and &#x201c;round scallop&#x201d; type cutting features <b>114</b> <i>e </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>), both useful for the cutting surface of a rotary drum type cutting tool <b>90</b> <i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Not all tissue-cutting tools <b>90</b> practicable in the present harvester assembly <b>20</b> are rotary drum type cutting tools <b>90</b><i>a</i>. For example, rotating shaft cutting tools <b>90</b><i>b </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10-14</figref>) may be used. As exemplified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>, a rotating shaft cutting tool <b>90</b><i>b </i>comprises a rotatable shaft <b>120</b> having a drive end <b>122</b> for engaging the drive means <b>50</b> and a tool end <b>124</b> for mounting the tissue cutting surface <b>126</b> and cutting features <b>128</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> illustrate a rotating shaft-type tissue cutter tool <b>90</b><i>b </i>and harvester housing <b>130</b>, and the rotating shaft-type tool <b>90</b><i>b </i>installed in a type of tissue harvester assembly <b>20</b><i>b </i>and connected to a drive means <b>160</b>. The tool <b>90</b><i>b </i>has a side cutting bit feature <b>128</b><i>a </i>and is installable in a shear block type harvester housing <b>130</b>. Other configurations of rotating shaft-type tissue cutter tools <b>90</b><i>b </i>are practicable in the present harvester assembly <b>20</b><i>b</i>. Examples include: a fine scallop hypo-tube rotating shaft-type tissue cutter tool (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>); a course scallop hypo-tube rotating shaft-type tissue cutter tool (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>); a course scallop solid shaft-type tissue cutter tool (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>); and alternative side cutting bit shaft-type tissue cutter tools (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Other types of cutting tools <b>90</b> such as an end mill type cutting tool <b>90</b><i>c </i>(see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) are also practicable in the present invention. The rotating drum and shaft tissue cutting tools <b>90</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>90</b><i>b </i>noted above can have both a drive end <b>96</b><i>a </i>and a tool end <b>96</b><i>b</i>. However, an end mill type cutting tool <b>90</b><i>c </i>will have only a shaft drive end <b>96</b><i>a</i>. A rotating end-mill cutting tool <b>90</b><i>c </i>comprises a rotatable shaft <b>132</b> having a drive end <b>96</b><i>a </i>for engaging the drive means <b>160</b> and a tool end <b>96</b><i>b </i>for mounting a cutting drum <b>136</b>. The cutting drum <b>136</b> is cylindrical and has an axis disposed coaxially with the drive and tool shaft ends <b>96</b><i>a </i>and <b>96</b><i>b</i>. The tool end <b>96</b><i>b </i>is attached at one end of the cutting drum <b>136</b> and the other end of the cutting drum <b>136</b> mounts a tissue cutting surface <b>138</b>. The tissue-cutting surface can be constructed to have cutting features <b>114</b> similar to those practicable on the rotating drum type cutter <b>90</b><i>a </i>noted above. One of ordinary skill in the art is readily able to select from and adapt said cutting features <b>114</b> for incorporation onto the cutting surface <b>138</b> of a rotating end-mill cutting tool <b>90</b><i>c </i>of the present invention <b>10</b>. The drum <b>136</b> has an outer circumferential surface that is closely receivable in a width of the interior space of the end mill housing <b>140</b> associated depth alignment means <b>142</b>. The cutting drum <b>136</b> of the end mill tissue cutting tool <b>90</b><i>c </i>illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a tapered cylinder proximate its tissue cutting surface <b>138</b>. The benefit of this taper is that centrifugal force can facilitate the migration of excised tissue particles passing through the cutting surface <b>138</b> into the interior of the drum (shown in phantom) and up the interior walls and away from the cutting surface <b>138</b>. This will help to prevent clogging certain of the cutting features <b>114</b> with excised tissue particles.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Alternative cutting tools <b>90</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 and 17</figref>, may be utilized include a modified rough-cutting end mill <b>148</b> and a razor cutter with serrations <b>150</b>. Such a modified end mill <b>148</b> exhibits cutting characteristics of a typical end mill cutting tool as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, however the modified end mill <b>148</b> exhibits a cylindrical shape and an axis <b>100</b> disposed coaxially with the drive and tool shaft ends <b>96</b><i>a </i>&#x26; <b>96</b><i>b</i>, similar to the rotating shaft cutter of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The drive means <b>160</b> is typically a drive motor of some type (e.g., electric or pneumatic) for rotating the tissue-cutting tool in the harvester housing <b>50</b> &#x26; <b>140</b>. The drive means <b>160</b> may be integral to (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18A and 18B</figref>) or separate from (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>) the harvester housing <b>50</b> &#x26; <b>140</b>. A handle <b>162</b> may be connected or formed to the housing <b>50</b> in order for a user to more easily grasp and position the harvester assembly <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a port <b>170</b> may be provided within the cutter <b>90</b> to draw tissue that has been collected by the cutter <b>90</b> out of the housing <b>50</b>. While the port <b>170</b> has been shown in the center of the cutter <b>90</b> along its axis of rotation in this embodiment, it is to be understood that multiple mechanisms for removing tissue from the housing are envisioned and described further herein. A housing mounting <b>166</b> is provided for stability and support to the user during operation of the harvester <b>20</b>. Skid plates <b>164</b> are provided to ease in positioning of the cutter <b>90</b> at the tissue site, and to further aid in adjustment of the cutter <b>90</b> depth, especially when a shim stack <b>58</b>, or other adjustment means known in the art, are provided external of the cutter <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 20A</figref>, <b>20</b>B, and <b>20</b>C illustrate a tissue particle collector <b>30</b>, which may be comprised of a port <b>170</b> positioned within or near the drive means of the cutter <b>90</b>, and which may be accessible my a particle retriever <b>172</b>, such as a syringe. The particle retriever <b>172</b> may then be used to inject or otherwise instill the tissue collected into a nanograft cell <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Various mediums may be utilized to suspend the tissue within the tissue particle collector <b>30</b>, and subsequently the nanograft cell <b>40</b>. Such mediums may include, but are not necessarily limited to, saline.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Alternative embodiments of the tissue particle collector <b>30</b> for collecting tissue from the tissue particle harvester are illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-27</figref>. A separate flushing container <b>180</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21A</figref>, may be utilized to retrieve tissue from the cutter <b>90</b>. The cutter <b>90</b> is removed from the harvester housing <b>50</b>, and placed into the flushing container <b>180</b>. A cap <b>182</b>, or other cover, is screwed or otherwise secured to the container <b>180</b>. A liquid medium, such as saline, is then flushed through a port <b>184</b> or luer, which may be integrated with the cap <b>182</b>, or otherwise introduced into the container <b>180</b>, and is directed towards the inner diameter and outer diameter of the cutter <b>90</b> by jets <b>184</b> or channels within the container <b>180</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">An integral flushing container <b>190</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21B</figref>, allows for collection of tissue without removal of the cutter <b>90</b> from its housing <b>50</b>. In this embodiment, the cutter <b>90</b> has a solid filled core. A gasketed cap <b>192</b> is fitted over the integral flushing container <b>190</b>, which may be the housing <b>50</b> having a receptor for the gasket cap <b>192</b>, after tissue is cut from the donor site. The housing <b>50</b>, with the cutter <b>90</b> in place, is removed from the tissue particle harvester <b>20</b> and fluid, which may be saline, is injected into the flushing container <b>190</b> through a luer fitting <b>194</b>, or port. The flushing container <b>190</b> is manually agitated, by hand or by a mechanical agitator known in the art. After agitation, the tissue that has been cut by the cutter <b>90</b> is now suspended in the fluid which has been injected, at which point it may be drawn out of the integral flushing container <b>190</b> through the luer fitting <b>194</b> by means of a syringe or similar device known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An alternative embodiment of an integral flushing container <b>190</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21C</figref>. A core filled cutter <b>90</b> is utilized to remove tissue from the donor site. A cap <b>196</b>, which may be comprised of silicone or a material of similar physical characteristics is placed over the open-cutting face of the housing <b>50</b>. The housing may include a luer for injecting fluid, such as saline, which is then agitated by running the motor of the cutter <b>90</b>. The agitation results in suspension of the tissue cut by the cutter <b>90</b> in the fluid, which may then be drawn out by through the luer <b>194</b> by a syringe or similar device, for insertion into a chambered dressing <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Collection of tissue from the cutter <b>90</b> may also be accomplished by use of a bristled plunger <b>200</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. The bristled plunger <b>200</b> is insertable into the inner diameter of a cutter <b>90</b> having a hollow core. After collection of tissue by the cutter <b>90</b>, the plunger <b>200</b> is moved, manually or mechanically, into the inner diameter of the cutter <b>90</b>. Bristles <b>202</b> draw out the tissue that has been collected in the inner diameter of the cutter <b>90</b> as the plunger is retracted from the inner diameter of the cutter <b>90</b>. The plunger <b>200</b> may be retractable into an adjacent container (not shown) that may be filled with a fluid, such as saline, for suspension of the tissue collected from the cutter <b>90</b>. A luer (not shown) may be incorporated into the adjacent container for retrieval of the tissue suspended fluid by a syringe or similar device, and for injection of the fluid prior to tissue collection.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In a further alternative embodiment as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, a standard plunger <b>210</b> rides over the shaft <b>212</b> of the cutter <b>90</b> assembly. The shaft <b>212</b>, plunger <b>210</b>, and cutter <b>90</b> all rotate together during operation of the harvester assembly <b>20</b>. After tissue has been removed from the donor site by the cutter <b>90</b>, the plunger <b>210</b> is moved across the inner diameter of the cutter <b>90</b> towards a removable end cap <b>214</b>. The end cap <b>214</b> is removed from the harvester assembly <b>20</b> so the tissue may be removed or flushed out by means of a syringe or other process well known to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Still a further embodiment of the tissue particle collector <b>30</b> is the internal flushing channels <b>220</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24</figref>. An internal core <b>222</b> is positioned within the cutter <b>90</b>. The core <b>222</b>, which remains stationary during rotation of the cutter <b>90</b>, is toleranced tightly to the inner diameter of the cutter <b>90</b> while still allowing for free rotation of the cutter <b>90</b>. Tissue enters channels <b>222</b> through openings <b>224</b> in the cutter during operation of the cutter <b>90</b>. Fluid is flushed through the channels <b>222</b> during operation of the cutter into a collection chamber (not shown) for later removal to the wound site. It is to be understood that the fluid may also be flushed through the channels <b>222</b> when the cutter <b>90</b> is not being operated.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref> illustrates a spring-loaded plunger <b>230</b> that may be utilized to retrieve tissue particles from the cutter <b>90</b> after removal from the donor site. The spring-loaded plungers <b>230</b> are positioned within the recesses <b>232</b> of the cutting scoops <b>234</b> of a stationary core <b>236</b> of the cutter <b>90</b>. After collection of tissue from the donor site, the core <b>236</b> is moved radially, or alternatively axially, until the plungers <b>230</b> pop out and remove tissue particles from the recesses <b>232</b>. It is to be understood that the plungers <b>230</b> may be cam activated, or by similar mechanisms utilized by those skilled in the art, to extract tissue that has been collected within the recesses <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Tissue may be removed from the harvester <b>20</b> by means of a static internal screw <b>240</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26</figref>. Such a screw <b>240</b>, which may be described by those skilled in the art as a reverse Archimedes screw, is positioned within the inner diameter of the cutter <b>90</b>. As the cutter <b>90</b> rotates and draws tissues into the cutter openings <b>242</b>, the static internal screw <b>240</b> moves particles to one end of the cutter for collection by wiping the inner diameter of the cutter <b>90</b>. It is envisioned that the screw <b>240</b> may be inserted after the tissue has been collected in order to wipe the inner diameter of the cutter <b>90</b>, and move the tissue to one end of the cutter <b>90</b> for collection.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">It is to be understood that manual agitation may also be utilized to remove tissue that has been collected by the cutter <b>90</b>. The cutter <b>90</b> is removed from the harvester <b>20</b> and placed in a container holding fluid, such as saline or a similar fluid. The cutter <b>90</b> is spun within the container to remove particles into the fluid. The container may then be centrifuged to separate the tissue particles from the fluid or alternatively, the fluid may be passed through a filter to remove the tissue from the fluid.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">While the above description contains many specifics, these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as exemplifications of one or another preferred embodiment thereof. Many other variations are possible, which would be obvious to one skilled in the art. Accordingly, the scope of the invention should be determined by the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents, and not just by the embodiments.</p>
