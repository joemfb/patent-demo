<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a U.S. National Phase application under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 of PCT Application No. PCT/US2009/060762, filed Oct. 15, 2009, which claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119(e) from U.S. Ser. No. 61/196,848, filed Oct. 21, 2008.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The orexins (hypocretins) comprise two neuropeptides produced in the hypothalamus: the orexin A (OX-A) (a 33 amino acid peptide) and the orexin B (OX-B) (a 28 amino acid peptide) (Sakurai T. et al., Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585). Orexins are found to stimulate food consumption in rats suggesting a physiological role for these peptides as mediators in the central feedback mechanism that regulates feeding behaviour (Sakurai T. et al., Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585). Orexins regulate states of sleep and wakefulness opening potentially novel therapeutic approaches for narcoleptic or insomniac patients (Chemelli R. M. et al., Cell, 1999, 98, 437-451). Orexins have also been indicated as playing a role in arousal, reward, learning and memory (Harris, et al., Trends Neurosci., 2006, 29 (10), 571-577). Two orexin receptors have been cloned and characterized in mammals. They belong to the super family of G-protein coupled receptors (Sakurai T. et al., Cell, 1998, 92, 573-585): the orexin-1 receptor (OX or OX1R) is selective for OX-A and the orexin-2 receptor (OX2 or OX2R) is capable to bind OX-A as well as OX-B. The physiological actions in which orexins are presumed to participate are thought to be expressed via one or both of OX1 receptor and OX2 receptor as the two subtypes of orexin receptors.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Orexin receptors are found in the mammalian brain and may have numerous implications in pathologies such as depression; anxiety; addictions; obsessive compulsive disorder; affective neurosis; depressive neurosis; anxiety neurosis; dysthymic disorder; behaviour disorder; mood disorder; sexual dysfunction; psychosexual dysfunction; sex disorder; schizophrenia; manic depression; delirium; dementia; severe mental retardation and dyskinesias such as Huntington's disease and Tourette syndrome; eating disorders such as anorexia, bulimia, cachexia, and obesity; addictive feeding behaviors; binge/purge feeding behaviors; cardiovascular diseases; diabetes; appetite/taste disorders; emesis, vomiting, nausea; asthma; cancer; Parkinson's disease; Cushing's syndrome/disease; basophile adenoma; prolactinoma; hyperprolactinemia; hypophysis tumour/adenoma; hypothalamic diseases; inflammatory bowel disease; gastric diskinesia; gastric ulcers; Froehlich's syndrome; adrenohypophysis disease; hypophysis disease; adrenohypophysis hypofunction; adrenohypophysis hyperfunction; hypothalamic hypogonadism; Kallman's syndrome (anosmia, hyposmia); functional or psychogenic amenorrhea; hypopituitarism; hypothalamic hypothyroidism; hypothalamic-adrenal dysfunction; idiopathic hyperprolactinemia; hypothalamic disorders of growth hormone deficiency; idiopathic growth deficiency; dwarfism; gigantism; acromegaly; disturbed biological and circadian rhythms; sleep disturbances associated with diseases such as neurological disorders, neuropathic pain and restless leg syndrome; heart and lung diseases, acute and congestive heart failure; hypotension; hypertension; urinary retention; osteoporosis; angina pectoris; myocardinal infarction; ischemic or haemorrhagic stroke; subarachnoid haemorrhage; ulcers; allergies; benign prostatic hypertrophy; chronic renal failure; renal disease; impaired glucose tolerance; migraine; hyperalgesia; pain; enhanced or exaggerated sensitivity to pain such as hyperalgesia, causalgia, and allodynia; acute pain; burn pain; atypical facial pain; neuropathic pain; back pain; complex regional pain syndrome I and II; arthritic pain; sports injury pain; pain related to infection e.g. HIV, post-chemotherapy pain; post-stroke pain; post-operative pain; neuralgia; emesis, nausea, vomiting; conditions associated with visceral pain such as irritable bowel syndrome, and angina; migraine; urinary bladder incontinence e.g. urge incontinence; tolerance to narcotics or withdrawal from narcotics; sleep disorders; sleep apnea; narcolepsy; insomnia; parasomnia; jet lag syndrome; and neurodegenerative disorders including nosological entities such as disinhibition-dementia-parkinsonism-amyotrophy complex; pallido-ponto-nigral degeneration; epilepsy; seizure disorders and other diseases related to general orexin system dysfunction.</p>

<p id="p-0053" num="0204">Specific embodiments of the present invention include a compound which is selected from the group consisting of the subject compounds of the Examples herein or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0205">The compounds of the present invention may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as &#x201c;stereoisomers&#x201d; including racemates and racemic mixtures, enantiomeric mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. Additional asymmetric centers may be present depending upon the nature of the various substituents on the molecule. Each such asymmetric center will independently produce two optical isomers and it is intended that all of the possible optical isomers and diastereomers in mixtures and as pure or partially purified compounds are included within the scope of this invention. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of these compounds. When bonds to the chiral carbon are depicted as straight lines in the Formulas of the invention, it is understood that both the (R) and (S) configurations of the chiral carbon, and hence both enantiomers and mixtures thereof, are embraced within the Formula. For example, Formula I shows the structure of the class of compounds without specific stereochemistry. When the compounds of the present invention contain one chiral center, the term &#x201c;stereoisomer&#x201d; includes both enantiomers and mixtures of enantiomers, such as the specific 50:50 mixture referred to as a racemic mixtures.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0206">The independent syntheses of these diastereomers or their chromatographic separations may be achieved as known in the art by appropriate modification of the methodology disclosed herein. Their absolute stereochemistry may be determined by the x-ray crystallography of crystalline products or crystalline intermediates which are derivatized, if necessary, with a reagent containing an asymmetric center of known absolute configuration. If desired, racemic mixtures of the compounds may be separated so that the individual enantiomers are isolated. The separation can be carried out by methods well known in the art, such as the coupling of a racemic mixture of compounds to an enantiomerically pure compound to form a diastereomeric mixture, followed by separation of the individual diastereomers by standard methods, such as fractional crystallization or chromatography. The coupling reaction is often the formation of salts using an enantiomerically pure acid or base. The diasteromeric derivatives may then be converted to the pure enantiomers by cleavage of the added chiral residue. The racemic mixture of the compounds can also be separated directly by chromatographic methods utilizing chiral stationary phases, which methods are well known in the art. Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound may be obtained by stereoselective synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration by methods well known in the art.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0214">The utility of the compounds in accordance with the present invention as orexin receptor OX1R and/or OX2R antagonists may be readily determined without undue experimentation by methodology well known in the art, including the &#x201c;FLIPR Ca<sup>2+</sup> Flux Assay&#x201d; (Okumura et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 280:976-981, 2001). In a typical experiment the OX1 and OX2 receptor antagonistic activity of the compounds of the present invention was determined in accordance with the following experimental method. For intracellular calcium measurements, Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing the rat OX1 receptor or the human OX2 receptor, are grown in Iscove's modified DMEM containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 0.5 g/ml G418, 1% hypoxanthine-thymidine supplement, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 ug/ml streptomycin and 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS). The cells are seeded at 20,000 cells/well into Becton-Dickinson black 384-well clear bottom sterile plates coated with poly-D-lysine. All reagents were from GIBCO-Invitrogen Corp. The seeded plates are incubated overnight at 37&#xb0; C. and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Ala-6,12 human orexin-A as the agonist is prepared as a 1 mM stock solution in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and diluted in assay buffer (HBSS containing 20 mM HEPES, 0.1% BSA and 2.5 mM probenecid, pH7.4) for use in the assay at a final concentration of 70 pM. Test compounds are prepared as 10 mM stock solution in DMSO, then diluted in 384-well plates, first in DMSO, then assay buffer. On the day of the assay, cells are washed 3 times with 100 ul assay buffer and then incubated for 60 min (37&#xb0; C., 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) in 60 ul assay buffer containing 1 uM Fluo-4AM ester, 0.02% pluronic acid, and 1% BSA. The dye loading solution is then aspirated and cells are washed 3 times with 100 ul assay buffer. 30 ul of that same buffer is left in each well. Within the Fluorescent Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR, Molecular Devices), test compounds are added to the plate in a volume of 25 ul, incubated for 5 min and finally 25 ul of agonist is added. Fluorescence is measured for each well at 1 second intervals for 5 minutes and the height of each fluorescence peak is compared to the height of the fluorescence peak induced by 70 pM Ala-6,12 orexin-A with buffer in place of antagonist. For each antagonist, IC50 value (the concentration of compound needed to inhibit 50% of the agonist response) is determined. Alternatively, compound potency can be assessed by a radioligand binding assay (described in Bergman et. al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2008, 18, 1425-1430) in which the inhibition constant (K<sub>i</sub>) is determined in membranes prepared from CHO cells expressing either the orexin-1 (OX1) or orexin-2 (OX2) receptor. The intrinsic orexin receptor antagonist activity of a compound which may be used in the present invention may be determined by these assays.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0215">In particular, the compounds of the following examples had activity in antagonizing the rat orexin-1 (OX1) receptor and/or the human orexin-2 (OX2) receptor in the aforementioned assays, generally with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of less than about 50 &#x3bc;M. Many of compounds within the present invention had activity in antagonizing the rat orexin-1 (OX1) receptor and/or the human orexin-2 (OX2) receptor in the aforementioned assays with an IC<sub>50 </sub>of less than about 100 nM. Compounds of the present invention also have activity in the radioligand binding assay, generally with a Ki &#x3c;100 nM against the orexin-1 (OX1) and/or the orexin-2 (OX2) receptor. Additional data is provided in herein. Such a result is indicative of the intrinsic activity of the compounds in use as antagonists of orexin-1 (OX1) receptor and/or the orexin-2 (OX2) receptor. The present invention also includes compounds within the generic scope of the invention which possess activity as agonists of the orexin-1 (OX1) receptor and/or the orexin-2 (OX2) receptor.

<p id="p-0087" num="0238">As shown in Reaction Scheme I, cyclic ketones can undergo the Schmidt reaction to provide azepanones (A-1). A-1 can be protected by alkylation with benzyl bromide to afford A-2. Carboxylation of A-2 can be accomplished through treatment of the lithium enolate with methyl cyanoformate to generate A-3. Reduction of the ester and amide functionalities with lithium aluminum hydride can proceed to give A-4. Mitsunobu coupling with substituted phenols can furnish ethers A-5. Removal of the benzyl protecting group under hydrogenation conditions can produce amines A-6, which can undergo coupling with substituted benzoic acids using EDC to provide amides A-7.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0240">Reaction Scheme II illustrates an alternative method for the preparation of substituted amides B-2. Amines A-6 can be coupled with 2-iodobenzoic acids using EDC to provide B-1. Palladium-catalyzed cross coupling reaction of B-1 with organostannanes under Stille conditions can afford amides B-2.</p>
