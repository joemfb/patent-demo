<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to methods and compositions for the size-adjusted recombinant production of magnetic nanoparticles, particularly of nanoparticles derived of magnetotactic bacteria.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Magnetic nanoparticles typically comprise nanocrystals made of oxides (or to a lesser extent of sulfides) of the elements in the forth row of the periodic table (i.e. Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni). The ability to produce such magnetic nanoparticles is inevitable not only for the general understanding of magnetic properties in a nanometer regime but also for manifold technical applications ranging from magnetic resonance imaging, drug delivery, catalysts, and biosensing to nanoelectronics, semiconductor materials, and magnetic storage media (reviewed in Lu, A. et al. (2007) <i>Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. </i>46, 1222-1224). Importantly, the magnetic properties of these nanocrystals strongly depend on their dimensions, that is, on their size and shape. For example, larger nanocrystals having a size of &#x3e;35 nm in diameter have a permanent single magnetic domain (i.e. they are ferromagnetic), whereas smaller particles of &#x3c;25 nm in diameter exhibit superparamagnetic properties (i.e. they are not permanently magnetic at ambient temperature). In previous years, research has thus mainly focused on the production of &#x201c;size-adjusted&#x201d; magnetic nanoparticles having &#x201c;tailored&#x201d; magnetic and physicochemical properties.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Traditionally, magnetic nanoparticles are synthesized chemically through precipitation of the crystals from basic aqueous solutions. However, the production of particularly dimensioned nanocrystals via these synthesis routes is significantly hampered by the broad size distribution of the crystal populations obtained. More recently, the synthesis of nanocrystals has been directed to non-aqueous approaches generally resulting in the formation of crystals having not only an improved overall quality but also a narrower size distribution. Nevertheless, in most chemical syntheses reported so far only sub-gram to low gram quantities of monodisperse nanocrystals were obtained, not sufficient for many applications. Furthermore, only a fraction of such synthetic particles constitutes monocrystalline particles having defined magnetic properties. By varying the experimental conditions employed the size of the particles could be controlled to some extent. However, the typical maximal diameters of the resulting particles were only in the range of about 25 nm, which is too small for clinically relevant applications such as magneto-hyperthermic treatment of tumors (Jana, N. R. et al. (2004) <i>Chem. Mater. </i>16, 3931-3935; Park, J. et al. (2004) <i>Nature Materials </i>3, 891-895; Hergt, R. et al. (2005) <i>J. Magnetism Magnetic Materials </i>293, 80-86).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Alternatively, biogenic magnetic nanoparticles can be employed that are produced by magnetotactic organisms, predominantly magnetotactic bacteria. The ability of magnetotactic bacteria to orient in the Earth's magnetic field is based on the presence of specific organelles, the magnetosomes, which are membrane-enveloped monocrystalline crystals (i.e. crystals having a single magnetic domain) of a magnetic mineral that are arranged in chain-like structures within the cell. Magnetosomes display a variety of species-specific shapes within the single magnetic domain size range (reviewed in Bazylinski, D. A. and Frankel, R. B. (2004) <i>Nature Rev. Microbiol. </i>2, 217-230). In the prototypical <i>Magnetospirillum</i>, cubo-octahedral nanocrystals of the mineral magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) having a maximal diameter of 50 nm are synthesized within magnetosome membrane (MM) vesicles. The MM is a phospholipid bilayer of a distinctive biochemical composition. Different methods for both the cultivation of magnetotactic bacteria and the isolation of magnetosomes thereof are well established in the art (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,385,119 and 6,251,365; Heyen, U. and Sch&#xfc;ler, D. (2003) <i>Appl. Microbial. Biotechnol. </i>61, 536-544).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In <i>Magnetospirillum </i>(<i>M</i>.) <i>gryphiswaldense </i>approximately 20 magneto some membrane proteins (MMPs) were identified so far, which are supposed to be involved in magnetosome biomineralization. However, the individual functions of MMPs have remained largely unknown, and only few magnetosome proteins are currently characterized in greater detail. Based on the data available magnetosome formation appears a highly complex process with strict control over MM-vesicle differentiation and formation, iron transport as well as nucleation, growth, and assembly of the magnetite crystals into chain-like structures. In order to function effectively in magnetic orientation, crystal sizes have to be controlled precisely within the single magnetic domain range, as the magnetic properties of magnetic nanocrystals change drastically with the particle's dimensions (see above). In previous studies, it was shown that decreasing the iron concentration in the growth medium or an increase in oxygen pressure resulted in the formation of smaller magnetite nanocrystals than under normal growth conditions. However, changing such environmental parameters does not allow for a reliable and accurate control of crystal size and shape. Rather recently, the isolation of spontaneous <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>mutants producing smaller and aberrantly-shaped particles than wild-type cells (Hoell, A. et al. (2004) <i>Phys. B. </i>350, e309-e313; Ullrich, S. et al. (2005) <i>J. Bacterial. </i>187, 7176-7184) indicated that crystal dimensions are under genetic control as well. However, it is currently unknown how this regulation is achieved at the molecular level, and least of all what are the genetic factors the control of whose expression would enable the synthesis of &#x201c;size-adjusted&#x201d; magnetosomes.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Thus, there still remains a need for methods for producing magnetic nanoparticles that overcome the above-mentioned limitations. In particular, there is a need for methods enabling the reliable controlled production of monocrystalline particles having a (pre-determined) defined size suitable for a given application not only in high quantities but also in an easy-to-do and cost-efficient manner not requiring any sophisticated instrumentation and/or specific reactants.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Furthermore, there is also a need for corresponding monocrystalline magnetic nanoparticles having a defined size and thus displaying specific magnetic and/or physicochemical properties. In particular, there is a need for &#x201c;customized&#x201d; magnetic nanoparticles whose size and shape are specifically adapted for a particular use.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide such &#x201c;size-adjusted&#x201d; magnetic nanoparticles as well as methods for their production.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">These goals are accomplished by the recombinant magnetic nanoparticles and the method for producing the same as defined in the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The present invention is based on the unexpected finding that neither the deletion of the mamC gene encoding the most abundant magnetosome protein in <i>Magnetospirillum </i>(<i>M</i>.) <i>gryphiswaldense </i>nor the deletion of the entire mamGFDC operon (collectively encoding nearly 35% of all proteins associated with the magneto some membrane) did abolish magnetite biomineralization in this organism. Rather, cells lacking the mamGFDC operon produced magnetite crystals having only 75% of the wild-type size. However, the formation of wild-type-sized magnetite crystals could be gradually restored by the in trans complementation with one, two, or three genes of the mamGFDC operon, respectively, regardless of their combination, whereas the expression of all four genes resulted in crystals even exceeding wild-type size.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a first aspect, the present invention relates to a method for the recombinant production of magnetic nanoparticles, comprising:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0035">(a) providing one or more cells being capable of producing magnetic nanoparticles;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0036">(b) modifying in the one or more cells the expression of one or more genes involved in the formation of the magnetic nanoparticles;</li>

    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0038">(d) isolating the magnetic nanoparticles from the cultivated cells,
<br/>
wherein the magnetic nanoparticles have a defined size.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0039">The term &#x201c;magnetic nanoparticles&#x201d;, as used herein, denotes any particle having a size in the nanometer scale that exhibits magnetic properties (i.e. that orients in a magnetic field along the magnetic field lines). The particles may either be ferromagnetic or superparamagnetic or may show an intermediate characteristic. The term &#x201c;nanometer scale&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to a particle diameter of less than 1000 nm (i.e. 1 &#x3bc;m), preferably of less than 500 nm, and particular preferably of less than 200 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0040">More particularly, the term &#x201c;magnetic nanoparticles&#x201d; refers to particles comprising one or more magnetic (nano)crystals. In preferred embodiments, a magnetic particle according to the invention comprises only a single nanocrystal. Such particles are also referred to as being &#x201c;monocrystalline&#x201d; or &#x201c;monocrystals&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0041">Typical nanocrystals comprised in the magnetic particles used in the invention are made of one or more metal oxides and/or metal sulfides, preferably of the elements in the forth row of the periodic table (i.e. chrome, manganese, iron, cobalt, and nickel). In some embodiments, the magnetic nanocrystals are made of a single metal oxide or a single metal sulfide, preferably of an iron oxide such as magnetite (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) or an iron sulfide such as greigite (Fe<sub>3</sub>S<sub>4</sub>), with magnetite being particular preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">In other preferred embodiments, the magnetic nanoparticles further comprise an outer membrane surrounding the one or more nanocrystals. Within the scope of the present invention, such particles are also referred to as &#x201c;magnetosomes&#x201d;, particularly when used in connection with magnetotactic bacteria.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">Typically, the outer membrane of the magnetic nanoparticles described herein is a lipid bilayer membrane, preferably a phospholipid membrane that may comprise any combination of one or more naturally occurring or synthetic phospholipids such as phosphatidyl glycerole, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and phosphatidyl choline. The phospholipids may contain one or more fatty acids such as palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid, and oleic acid. In preferred embodiments, the phospholipid membranes comprise 35-40% (w/w) phosphatidyl glycerole, 50-55% (w/w) phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and 5-10% (w/w) phosphatidyl choline, with palmitic acid (15-20% (w/w)), palmitoleic acid (25-30% (w/w)), and oleic acid (45-50% (w/w)) being the main fatty acids present. Exemplary membrane compositions are also disclosed, e.g., in Gr&#xfc;nberg, K. et al. (2004) <i>Appl. Environ. Microbiol. </i>70, 1040-1050.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">The terms &#x201c;recombinant&#x201d; and &#x201c;recombinant production&#x201d;, as used herein, refer to the fact that the magnetic nanoparticles according to the invention are not chemically synthesized but generated by means of recombinant gene technology well established in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook, J., and Russel, D. W. (2001) <i>Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual </i>(3<i>rd ed</i>.). Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press). In other words, the magnetic nanoparticles of the invention are produced in host cells whose genome (i.e. the entirety of the cell's genetic information) comprises at least one modification compared to wild-type cells. Examples for such modifications include the insertion, deletion and/or substitution of one or more nucleotides within the host cell's genome (i.e. the chromosome(s) and any additional episomal genetic entities such as plasmids or phagemids), the introduction of additional copies of one or more genes into the host cell as well as, optionally, their stable integration into the genome, and the insertion or deletion of genetic elements (e.g., promoters, repressors, enhancers but also miRNAs, siRNAs, anti-sense RNAs, and the like) interfering with or promoting the expression of one or more host genes at transcriptional, post-transcriptional or translational level.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">The recombinant magnetic nanoparticles according to the present invention are characterized by a defined (i.e. pre-determined) size and thus by particular magnetic and physicochemical properties which are known to vary as a function of particle size. The term &#x201c;production of magnetic nanoparticles having a defined size&#x201d;, as used herein, is to be understood that the method for producing said particles is precisely controlled in order to enable the generation of specifically dimensioned particles that are, for example, ideally adapted for an intended application. In the present invention, precise control of the conditions is accomplished by modifying in the one or more target cells provided the expression of one or more genes involved in the formation of the magnetic nanoparticles. In preferred embodiments, the size of the magnetic nanoparticles produced varies directly depending on the type and/or the extent of the modification of gene expression performed (see below).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">The terms &#x201c;size&#x201d; and &#x201c;dimension&#x201d;, as used herein, are not solely to be interpreted literally (i.e. with regard to the length and width of the magnetic nanoparticles) but should also refer to the overall shape of the particles such as spherical or cubic, regular or deformed, and the like. Preferably, the size of the magnetic nanoparticles is expressed as the mean diameter of the particles, expressed in nm, resulting from the analysis of at least two, typically of at least ten, preferably of at least 20, and particularly preferably of at least 50 individual nanoparticles.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">In specific embodiments, the size of the magnetic nanoparticles according to the invention is 20 nm to 150 nm in diameter. However, it may also be possible to produce smaller and larger particles as well. In preferred embodiments, the size of the magnetic nanoparticles produced is 25 nm to 50 nm in diameter, for example particles having a size of 25-30 nm, 30-35 nm, 35-40 nm, 40-45 nm or 45-50 nm. In other preferred embodiments, the size of the magnetic nanoparticles is &#x3e;50 nm in diameter, for example at least 52 nm, at least 55 nm, at least 60 nm, at least 65 nm or at least 70 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">Since the method according to the present invention involves the use of genetically engineered target cells as a source for producing the magnetic nanoparticles, the size distribution of the particles may not be entirely uniform due to the genetic and/or physiological variations inherent to cellular populations. Rather, the size of the particles produced in a single assay may differ slightly within given limits depending on the reaction conditions used. In specific embodiments of the invention, the size of at least 50%, preferably of at least 80%, and particularly preferably of at least 90% of the magnetic nanoparticles produced (in a single assay) is within the range given by the mean diameter&#xb1;15%, preferably by the mean diameter&#xb1;10%, and particularly preferably by the mean diameter&#xb1;5%.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">The term &#x201c;providing one or more cells being capable of producing magnetic nanoparticles&#x201d;, as used herein, is to be understood to denote that the method according to the present invention requires the presence of particular host cells (herein also referred to as &#x201c;target cells&#x201d;), namely cells having the &#x201c;genetic competence&#x201d; to synthesize magnetic nanoparticles (i.e. bear in their genome the respective genes required for the formation of magnetosome).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">In specific embodiments of the invention, the one or more cells provided are magnetotactic bacterial cells. The term &#x201c;magnetotactic bacterial cells&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to any prokaryotic cells displaying a magnetotactic response, that is, they orient in a magnetic field along the magnetic field lines. Preferably, the one or more magnetotactic cells are derived (i.e. are members) of the genus <i>Magnetosprillum </i>such as <i>M. magneticum, M. magnetotacticum</i>, and <i>M. gryphiswaldense</i>, with the latter one being particularly preferred. Further examples of suitable magnetotactic bacteria include inter cilia the magnetotactic proteobacteria MV-1 and MC-1.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">The term &#x201c;one or more genes involved in the formation of the magnetic nanoparticles&#x201d;, as used herein, denotes any genes associated with the magnetotactic phenotype, that is, any genes coding for proteins participating in magneto some synthesis such as proteins regulating the formation of the membrane envelope or nanocrystal biomineralization. Preferably, the one or more genes encode magnetosome membrane proteins (MMPs) which associate with the magnetosome membrane and are supposed to be involved in the control of biomineralization. In particular preferred embodiments of the invention, the one or more genes are selected from the group consisting of the mamG, mamF, mamD, and mamC genes of <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>(cf. <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>MSR-1, Working Draft Sequence, GenBank Accession Number: CU459003) and functional equivalents thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">The term &#x201c;functional equivalent&#x201d;, as used herein, denotes any other gene than the four above-mentioned mam genes of <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>that encodes a protein having the same presumed cellular function as any of MamG, MamF, MamD, and MamC of <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>(i.e. an ortholog). Typically, such orthologs share a high degree of amino acid sequence similarity. Within the scope of the present invention, functional equivalent genes are understood to encode proteins having at least 30% or at least 40%, preferably at least 50% or at least 80%, and particularly preferably at least 90% amino acid sequence identity with any of MamG, MamF, MamD, and MamC of <i>M. gryphiswaldense</i>, as determined using the NCBI/BLAST program according to the default standard parameters (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/bl2seq/wblast2.cgi; Tatusova, T. and Madden, T. L. (1999) <i>FEMS Microbiol Lett. </i>174, 247-250). An example of such a functional equivalent gene, as defined herein, is the mmsF gene of <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>MSR-1 encoding another MMP (Richter, M. et al. (2007) <i>J. Bacteriol. </i>189, 4899-4910).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">The term &#x201c;modifying in the one or more cells the expression of one or more genes involved in the formation of magnetic nanoparticles&#x201d;, as used herein, refers to the fact that the one or more host or target cells used in the invention for synthesizing the magnetic nanoparticles bear in their genome at least one change as compared to wild-type cells resulting in a modified expression of any one or more genes involved in the synthesis of said particles such as genes encoding protein factors regulating the formation of the membrane envelope and/or nanocrystal biomineralization.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">The term &#x201c;modifying gene expression&#x201d;, as used herein, denotes any manipulation of a particular gene (or more than one genes) resulting in an altered expression level of said gene (or said genes), that is, the production of a different amount of corresponding mRNA and/or protein as compared to the expression of the wild-type gene (or genes). The term &#x201c;different amount&#x201d;, as used herein, includes both a higher amount and a lower amount than wild-type. In other words, a manipulation, as defined herein, may either enhance (i.e. activate) or repress (i.e. inhibit) the expression of a gene. The term &#x201c;repression&#x201d;, as used herein, includes abolishing the expression a gene (for example, by deleting the gene sequence). It is also within the scope of the present invention that a particular modification of gene expression affects a plurality of genes in a different manner. For example, it may be possible that such modification activates the expression of a first gene and concomitantly inhibits the expression of a second gene.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">The term &#x201c;genome&#x201d;, as used herein&#x201d; denotes the entirety of genetic information comprised in a host cell, that is, the chromosome(s) (which in bacteria is also referred to as the &#x201c;lineom&#x201d;) and any additional episomal genetic entities propagated in the host cells such as plasmids, cosmids, phagemids, artificial chromosomes, or the like. It is within the scope of the present invention that the one or more (host) cells provided comprise one or more genes involved in the formation of magnetic nanoparticles, whose expression is modified, wherein all said genes are encoded on the chromosome(s) or wherein all said genes are encoded on one or more episomal entities, or wherein at least one gene is encoded on the chromosom(s) and at least one gene is encoded on an episomal entity.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">Examples for such modifications affecting the expression of the one or more genes involved in the formation of magnetic nanoparticles, as defined herein, include inter alia the insertion, deletion and/or substitution of one or more nucleotides within the host cell's genome, the introduction of additional copies of one or more genes into the host cell as well as, optionally, their stable integration into the genome, and the introduction or deletion of genetic elements (e.g., promoters, repressors, enhancers but also miRNAs, siRNAs, anti-sense RNAs, and the like) interfering with or promoting the expression of one or more host genes at transcriptional, post-transcriptional or translational level. The term &#x201c;insertion, deletion or substitution of one or more nucleotides&#x201d;, as used herein, is to be understood that at least one nucleotide of a particular gene sequence whose expression is to be modified is altered by insertion, deletion and/or substitution, optionally giving rise to an change of the corresponding amino acid sequence as well. It is also within the scope of the present invention to alter the nucleotide sequence of regulatory elements controlling the expression of one or more genes involved in the formation of magnetic nanoparticles. Examples for such elements include inter alia promoters, transcriptional enhancers, repressors, and the like). Many genes involved in the formation of magnetic nanoparticles, particularly most MMPs, are arranged in polycistronic operon (herein also referred to as &#x201c;operable linkage&#x201d;, see below), that is, at least two genes (typically encoding functionally related proteins) are located adjacent to each other and are under the control of common transcriptional and/or translational regulatory elements such as a common promoter sequence. An example of such an operon is the mamGFDC operon of <i>M. gryphiswaldense</i>. Thus, it is also within the scope of the present invention, to modify the expression of such an operon, for example, by insertion, deletion and/or substitution of one or more nucleotides (including the insertion, deletion and/or substitution of one or more entire genes).</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">In specific embodiments of the inventive method, modifying the expression of the one or more genes involved in the formation of the magnetic nanoparticles comprises deleting in the one or more cells provided one or more of such genes. Preferably, the one or more genes that are deleted are selected from the group consisting of the mamG, mamF, mamD, and mamC genes of <i>Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense </i>and functional equivalents thereof. It is within the scope of the present invention to delete only a single gene, for example mamC (herein said deletion is also denoted &#x201c;&#x394;mamC&#x201d;), to delete any combination of two or three genes, for example mamFC (i.e. a deletion of both mamF and mamC), or to delete the entire mamGFDC operon. As used herein, the term &#x201c;deletion&#x201d; not only refers to the removal of an entire gene but also to the removal of a portion thereof sufficient to modify (e.g., to abolish) gene expression in order to render the encoded corresponding protein non-functional.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">In further specific embodiments, modifying the expression of the one or more genes comprises introducing into the one or more cells provided a nucleic acid molecule (preferably a DNA molecule) comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a genetic construct of one or more copies of any of the one or more genes involved in the formation of the magnetic nanoparticles. Thus, for example, it is also within the scope of the present invention to introduce a nucleic acid molecule as defined above in addition to deleting in the one or more cells one or more genes involved in the formation of the magnetic nanoparticles. Moreover, it is also within the scope of the present invention to introduce into the one or more cells provided two or more nucleic acid molecules, each comprising a nucleotide sequence encoding a genetic construct of one or more copies of any of the one or more genes involved in the formation of the magnetic nanoparticles.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">In particular embodiments, the one or more copies of any of the one or more genes encoded by the nucleotide sequence to be introduced in the one or more cells provided are operably linked to each other (i.e. they are arranged as a single &#x201c;functional&#x201d; unit, optionally under the control of common transcriptional and/or translational regulatory elements). In further embodiments, the nucleotide sequence to be introduced in the one or more cells provided is operably linked to a regulatory sequence in order to allow expression of the nucleotide sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0060">A nucleic acid molecule is referred to as &#x201c;capable of expressing a nucleic acid molecule&#x201d; or capable &#x201c;to allow expression of a nucleotide sequence&#x201d; if it comprises sequence elements which contain information regarding to transcriptional and/or translational regulation, and such sequences are &#x201c;operably linked&#x201d; to the nucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide. An operable linkage is a linkage in which the regulatory sequence elements and the sequence to be expressed (and/or the sequences to be expressed among each other) are connected in a way that enables gene expression. The precise nature of the regulatory regions necessary for gene expression may vary among species, but in general these regions comprise a promoter which, in prokaryotes, contains both the promoter per se, i.e. DNA elements directing the initiation of transcription, as well as DNA elements which, when transcribed into RNA, will signal the initiation of translation. Such promoter regions normally include 5&#x2032; non-coding sequences involved in initiation of transcription and translation, such as the &#x2212;35/&#x2212;10 boxes and the Shine-Dalgarno element in prokaryotes or the TATA box, CAAT sequences, and 5&#x2032;-capping elements in eukaryotes. These regions can also include enhancer or repressor elements as well as translated signal and leader sequences for targeting the native polypeptide to a specific compartment of a host cell.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0061">In addition, the 3&#x2032; non-coding sequences may contain regulatory elements involved in transcriptional termination, polyadenylation or the like. If, however, these termination sequences are not satisfactory functional in a particular host cell, then they may be substituted with signals functional in that cell.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">Therefore, a nucleic acid molecule of the invention to be introduced into the one or more cells provided may include a regulatory sequence, preferably a promoter sequence, and optionally also a transcriptional termination sequence. The promoters may allow for either a constitutive or an inducible gene expression. Suitable prokaryotic promoters are, for example, the <i>E. coli </i>lacUV5 and tet (tetracycline-responsive) promoters, the T7 promoter as well as any promoters derived of magnetotactic bacteria, preferably of <i>Magnetosprillum </i>spec. Particularly preferred examples include inter alia the mamGFDC promoter and the mamAB promoter of <i>M. gryphiswaldense</i>. Examples of promoters useful for expression in eukaryotic cells are the SV40 promoter or the CMV promoter.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0063">The nucleic acid molecules of the invention may also be comprised in a vector or other cloning vehicles, such as plasmids, phagemids, phages, cosmids or artificial chromosomes. In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid molecule is comprised in a vector, particularly in an expression vector. Such an expression vector can include, aside from the regulatory sequences described above and a nucleic acid sequence encoding a genetic construct as defined in the invention, replication and control sequences derived from a species compatible with the host that is used for expression as well as selection markers conferring a selectable phenotype on transformed or transfected cells. Large numbers of suitable vectors are known in the art, and are commercially available.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0064">In specific embodiments of the inventive method, the one or more genes comprised in the nucleotide sequence to be introduced into the one or more cells to be provided are selected from the group consisting of the mamG, mamF, mamD, and mamC genes of <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>and functional equivalents thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0065">In preferred embodiments, the nucleotide sequence encodes a genetic construct selected from the group consisting of the mamG, mamF, mamD, mamC, mamGF, mamGD, mamGC, mamFD, mamFC mamDC, mamGFD, mamGFC, mamGDC, mamFDC, and mamGFDC, genes of <i>Magnetospirillum gryphiswaldense </i>and functional equivalents thereof. Preferably, the nucleotide sequence encodes a genetic construct selected from the group consisting of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, SEQ ID NO: 8, SEQ ID NO: 9, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12, SEQ ID NO: 13, and SEQ ID NO: 14.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0066">Within the scope of the present invention, the nucleic acid molecule introduced may be propagated and maintained as an independent genetic unit or it may become stably integrated into the genome of the one or more cells by means of genetic recombination. Such recombination may either occur at random positions of the genome by non-homologous recombination or at specific positions of the genome by homologous recombination or via site-specific integrases.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0067">The nucleic acid molecule encoding a genetic construct of one or more copies of any of the one or more genes involved in the formation of the magnetic nanoparticles, particularly when comprised in a vector, can be introduced via various transformation, transduction or transformation methods all well known in the art (see, e.g., Sambrook, J., and Russel, D. W. (2001), supra) into a host (target) cell capable of expressing the nucleic acid molecule. Thus, the present invention is also directed to a host cell comprising a nucleic acid molecule as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">Host cells to be used in the invention may be any prokaryotic (i.e. bacterial or archeal) or eukaryotic cells being capable of producing magnetic nanoparticles. In preferred embodiments, the host cell is a magnetotactic bacterial cell, preferably members of the genus <i>Magnetospirillum</i>, with <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>being particularly preferred.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">After having modified the expression of one or more genes involved in the formation of magnetic nanoparticles the host cells disclosed herein are cultivated (propagated) under conditions allowing the formation magnetic nanoparticles which will clearly vary depending on the nature of the host cell employed. However, the skilled artisan is well aware of the growth conditions to be used in a particular case. Finally, the magnetic nanoparticles produced can be isolated from the host cells simply due to their magnetic behavior by applying a magnet to the host cell culture. Different methods for both the cultivation of magnetotactic bacteria and the isolation of magnetosomes thereof are well established in the art (U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,385,119 and 6,251,365; Heyen, U. and Sch&#xfc;ler, D. (2003) <i>Appl. Microbial. Biotechnol. </i>61, 536-544). The isolation of the magnetic particles from the host cells may comprise additional processing steps such as a selection of particular fractions of particles based on their magnetic properties, for example by applying to the particles magnetic fields of different field strengths.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">In a further aspect, the invention relates to recombinantly produced magnetic nanoparticles having a defined size of 20 nm to 150 nm in diameter, that is, engineered, particularly dimensioned particles generated by means of recombinant gene technology as defined herein (see above). For example, the particles may have a size of 25-30 nm, 30-35 nm, 35-40 nm, 40-45 nm or 45-50 nm in diameter. In specific embodiments, the size of the particles is &#x3e;50 nm in diameter, for example at least 52 nm, at least 55 nm, at least 60 nm, at least 65 nm or at least 70 nm. Preferably, the magnetic nanoparticle is monocrystalline (i.e. comprises only a single crystal). In some embodiments, the monocrystal consists of magnetite.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">In other preferred embodiments, the magnetic nanoparticle further comprises a phospholipid outer membrane and/or is derived of a magnetotactic bacterial cell, preferably of <i>Magnetospirillum </i>spec.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">In further preferred embodiments, the magnetic nanoparticles are produced by a method as disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">In a forth aspect, the present invention relates to uses of the recombinant magnetic nanoparticles disclosed herein. Specific embodiments of the invention relate to the use of such a magnetic nanoparticle as an analytical tool for the detection and/or separation of biomolecules. For example, it may be possible to generate &#x201c;functionalized&#x201d; nanoparticles being coated with particular binding domains having affinity for biomolecule and thus allow their isolations. The term &#x201c;coated&#x201d;, as used herein, also includes the modification of the membrane envelope surrounding the magnetic nanocrystals. Examples for such binding domains include inter alia oligo-dT stretches having affinity for poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNAs, avidin or streptavidin allowing the binding of biotinylated molecules but also specific binding domains such as antibodies or antibody-like molecules enabling detection and binding of particular antigens. Thus, magnetic nanoparticles of the invention may also be used as a drug carrier for targeting pharmaceuticals to particular cells or organs within an organism.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">In other embodiments, magnetic nanoparticles as defined herein are used as a contrast agent in magnetic resonance imaging. Further clinically relevant applications of the inventive nanoparticles include inter alia the magneto-hyperthermic treatment of cancerogenic tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0075">Other applications for using magnetic nanoparticles according to the invention are described, e.g., in Lu, A. et al. (2007), supra; and Lang, C. and Sch&#xfc;ler, D. (2006) In: <i>Microbial Bionanotechnology: Biological Self</i>-<i>assembly Systems and Biopolymer</i>-<i>based Nanostructures</i>. B. Rehm (ed). Wymondham: Horizon Bioscience, pp. 107-124.</p>

<p id="h-0010" num="0000">1.1. Bacterial Strains, Media and Growth Conditions</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0077">Liquid cultures of <i>Magnetospirillum </i>(<i>M</i>.) <i>gryphiswaldense </i>strain R3/S1 (Schultheiss, D. and Sch&#xfc;ler, D. (2003) <i>Arch. Microbial. </i>179, 89-94) were grown in modified FSM medium (Heyen, U. and Sch&#xfc;ler, D. (2003) <i>Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. </i>61, 536-544). Colonies of <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>were obtained on activated charcoal agar medium (ACAM) that was incubated micro-aerobically at 28&#xb0; C. (Schultheiss, D. and Sch&#xfc;ler, D., 2003, supra). Growth experiments were carried out under micro-oxidic conditions in 1-1 flasks containing 100 ml low- or high iron containing medium. Low-iron containing medium (LIM) essentially is FSM medium lacking yeast extract and ferric citrate, whereas for high-iron medium ferric citrate was added to 500 &#x3bc;M to LIM. To grow magnetite free cells (no magnetic response), <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>strains were passaged for three successive transfers in LIM. Optical densities and the magnetic response (Cmag) of <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>cultures were measured turbidimetrically at 565 nm on immotile cells inactivated by addition of formaldehyde (Fluka, Switzerland) to a final concentration of 0.074% prior the measurement (Sch&#xfc;ler, D. et al. (1995) <i>FEMS Microbiol. Lett. </i>132, 139-145). Magnetosomes were isolated as described previously (Gr&#xfc;nberg, K. et al. (2004) <i>Appl. Environ. Microbiol. </i>70, 1040-1050) from cultures grown under micro-oxidic conditions. For conjugation experiments, <i>Escherichia coli </i>strain S17-1 (Simon, R. et al. (1983) <i>Biotechnology </i>1, 784-791) was used as a donor and was cultivated as previously described (Sambrook, J., and Russel, D. W. (2001) <i>Molecular cloning: A laboratory manual </i>(3<i>rd ed</i>.). Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press).</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">1.2. DNA Techniques</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0078">DNA isolation, digestion, ligation and transformation essentially followed standard methods (Sambrook, J. and Russel, D. W. (2001), supra). The primers and plasmids used are listed in the following Tables 1 and 2. PCR products and vector inserts were sequenced using BigDye Terminator v3.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems, Darmstadt, Germany) on an ABI 3700 capillary sequencer. Sequence data were analyzed with Lasergene 6 (DNAstar Inc., Madison, Wis.) and MacVector 7.0 (Oxford Molecular Ltd., Oxford, United Kingdom) programs.</p>

1.3. Construction of &#x394;mamGFDC and &#x394;mamC Mutant Strains
</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0081">A <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>mutant lacking the mamGFDC cluster was generated using plasmid pDC2. For construction of pDC2, 670 bp of the mamGFDC-upstream sequence including the ATG-start codon of mamG was amplified by primer pair G/EcoRI-for and G/PstI_rev and 810 bp of the mamGFDC-downstream sequence including TGA-stop codon of mamC by primer pair C/PstI-for and C/XbaI_rev, respectively. Both amplification products were fused in a three-fragment ligation between the EcoRI and XbaI sites of plasmid pK19mobsacB to obtain pDC2. Plasmid pDC2 was introduced into <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>R3/S1 via conjugation from <i>E. coli </i>S-17 and clones having chromosomally integrated pDC2 were selected on kanamycin (Kan) containing ACAM medium. Since no double-crossovers mutants were obtained by sucrose selection due to instable sacB expression, 300 randomly selected colonies were replica-plated on ACAM medium (with and without Kan). Southern blotting on three clones that showed sensitivity to Kan confirmed deletion of the mamGFDC operon. One mutant clone, designated &#x394;GFDC, was selected for further studies.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0082">For generating a mamC mutant, the broad-host-range Cre-loxP antibiotic marker recycling system was used (Marx, C. J., and Lidstrom, M. E. (2002) <i>BioTechniques </i>33, 1062-1067) in order to test its usability in <i>M. gryphiswaldense</i>. Searches for lox sites (34 bp composed of a short core sequence between two inverted repeats) in the <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>genome sequence identified no site identical to the characteristic lox sequence, which might have been targeted by the Cre recombinase. The Cre recombinase of bacteriophage P1 catalyzes the site specific recombination between lox sites and in particular the in vivo excision of DNA regions flanked by co-directional loxP recognition sites (Palmeros, B. et al., (2000) <i>Gene </i>247, 255-264). Cre expression from plasmid pCM157 (Marx, C. J., and Lidstrom, M. E (2002), supra) in <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>was verified by means of RT-PCR. Cells expressing Cre did not show any apparent change in growth or magnetosome biomineralization, suggesting that Cre does not catalyze recombination between sequence sites inherent to the chromosome of <i>M. gryphiswaldense. </i></p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0083">For the mamC deletion construct, the regions immediately flanking mamC were amplified via PCR using the following primer pairs: AGmamCu_f/MunI and AGmamCu_r/NdeI-2 for the upstream region as well as AGmamCDd_f/ApaI and AGmamCd_r/SacI for the downstream region. The 1822 bp mamC-upstream fragment was inserted between the MunI and NdeI sites of pCM184 (Marx, C. J., and Lidstrom, M. E (2002), supra), which is upstream of a loxP flanked Kan resistance marker to yield pAG3. Sequencing of the 1450 bp mamC-downstream fragment revealed 204 bp downstream of the 5&#x2032; end an ApaI restriction site which is missing in the partial 35 kb sequence deposition (BX571797) of the magnetosome island used for primer construction. Subsequently, digestion of the 1450 bp mamC-downstream PCR product with ApaI and SacI yielded a 1246 bp fragment that was inserted downstream of the loxP flanked Kan resistance marker of ApaI/SacI digested pAG3, producing pAG4. Allelic exchange vector pAG4 was introduced into <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>strain R3/S1 bp conjugation from <i>E. coli </i>S-17 and transconjugants were selected on solid ACAM-medium containing Kan. Kan-resistant transconjugants were found at frequency of 2.2&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;6 </sup>per recipient cell. Several randomly selected clones were propagated for one passage in liquid medium and streaked out on solid medium without antibiotics. Colonies from those plates were screened by PCR for loss of mamC, which occurred at a frequency of 1.0&#xb7;10<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>. For one clone, designated &#x394;C::Kan, replacement of mamC by a loxP flanked Kan resistance marker was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. For excision of the Kan marker gene from clone &#x394;C::Kan, plasmid pCM157 was introduced via conjugation from <i>E. coli </i>S-17, and transconjugants were selected on tetracycline. After one passage on solid medium with tetracycline, 96% of the tetracycline-resistant &#x394;C::Kan derived clones were Kan sensitive. For one clone designated &#x394;C loss of the Kan gene was confirmed by Southern blot analysis. Plasmid pCM157 was cured from &#x394;C by transfer to medium lacking tetracycline. Excision of the marker by Cre leaves behind a loxP-scar at the position of the mamC gene.</p>

<p id="h-0014" num="0000">2.1. Construction of EGFP-Fusions for In Vivo Localization</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0084">The EGFP protein was fused by a His-(Gly)<sub>10 </sub>peptide linker to the C-terminus of MamG, MamF, and MamD, respectively. The egfp gene (primer CL21/CL22) was amplified from the pEGFP-N1 plasmid and cloned into the EcoRI site of the pBBR1MCS-2 to yield the plasmid pCL_EGFP expressing (Gly)<sub>10</sub>-EGFP. The amplified genes of mamC (primer CL13/CL14), mamF (CL9/CL10), and mamG (CL23/CL24) were cloned into the XhoI and NdeI restriction sites of pCL_EGFP in order to generate plasmids pCL_C-EGFP (MamC-His-(Gly)<sub>10</sub>-EGFP), pCL_F-EGFP (MamF-His-(Gly)<sub>10</sub>-EGFP), and pCL_G-EGFP (MamG-His-(Gly)<sub>10</sub>-EGFP), respectively. Despite various attempts and different and using different constructs no functional MamD-EGFP fusion could be generated. All plasmids were transferred into <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>R3/S1 via conjugation from <i>E. coli </i>S17-1.</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">2.2. Fluorescence Microscopy</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0085">Cell membranes were stained with the fluorescent dye FM4-64 (Molecular Probes) at a final concentration of 1.5 &#x3bc;M. Cells were imaged with a Leica DMI 6000B microscope equipped with a DFC 350FX camera and a 100&#xd7;HCX PL APO objective with a numerical aperture of 1.40. Pictures were captured and analyzed using a Leica Application Suite and ImageJ 1.36b software.</p>
<p id="h-0016" num="0000">2.3. Specific Location of MamC, MamF, and MamG at the Magnetosome Membrane</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0086">The MamGFDC proteins were previously identified in the magnetosome sub-proteome, however, it was unknown if their presence is confined to the magnetosome membrane, or if they are shared by other subcellular compartments. To address this question, translational EGFP-fusions of MamC, MamF and MamG were constructed. While no functional EGFP fusion to the MamD protein was obtained, the MamC, MamG, and MamF fusion proteins generated a linear fluorescence pattern of 1-3 &#x3bc;m in length, and had a slightly punctuate appearance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The fluorescence signal coincided with the typical position of the magnetosome chain predominantly at mid-cell and was mostly confined to the characteristic length of the magnetosome chain. No fluorescence signal was detected in either the cytoplasm or the cytoplasmic membrane, indicating that the MamG, MamF, and MamC proteins were exclusively targeted to the magnetosome compartment.</p>

<heading id="h-0018" level="1">Complementation Analyses, Effects on Crystal Size and Shape</heading>
<p id="h-0019" num="0000">3.1. Generation of Genetic Constructs</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0087">For genetic complementation of the &#x394;C and the &#x394;GFDC mutant strains, a series of pBBR1MCS-2-based plasmids, harboring full-length (pAS31) or deletion-containing variants of the mamGFDC cluster (pAS32-pAS44), were generated. Sequence deletions within the recombinant mamGFDC cluster were generated in plasmid pAS100 by restriction digestion. Then, the mamGFDC cluster variants obtained were cloned between XhoI and SacI sites of pBBR1MCS-2 for expression in <i>M. gryphiswaldense</i>. Construction of plasmid pAS100, harboring a 2941 bp XhoI-SacI fragment consisting of a 705 bp mamGFDC upstream sequence, the mamGFDC cluster (2077 bp) containing silent mutations, and a159 bp mamGFDC downstream sequence is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0088">For constructing the 2941 bp fragment primer annealing to the 5&#x2032; and the 3&#x2032; sequence region of mamC (5&#x2032; b/b*; 3&#x2032; c/c*), mamF (5&#x2032; d/d*; 3&#x2032; e/e*), and mamD (5&#x2032; f/f*; 3&#x2032; h/h*), within mamD (g/g*), within mamC (i/i*; j/j*), upstream of the mamG start codon (a), and downstream of the mamC stop codon (k) were deduced from the magnetosome island sequence deposition BX571797. Primer annealing within the mamGFDC cluster contained mismatches to generate silent point mutations which either created or removed a restriction site: primer b/b* and c/c* created a NaeI and a Eco47III site within mamG, primer d/d* and e/e* a PvuII and a PsiI site within mamF, primer f/f* and h created a NruI and a BfrBI site within mamD, primer g/g* removed a PvuII site contained in mamD, primer h* created an EcoRI site 18 bp upstream of mamC, primer i/i* and j/j* removed NaeI sites contained in mamC. Assembly of the 2941 bp XhoI-SacI sequence fragment was accomplished via four rounds of PCR. The first round resulted in ten sequence fragments: AB* (primer pair a/b*), BC* (primer pair b/c*), CD* (primer pair c/d*), DE* (primer pair d/e*), EF* (primer pair elf*), FG* (primer pair f/g*), GH* (primer pair g/h*), HI* (primer pair h/i*), IJ*(primer pair i/j*), JK (primer pair j/k). Next, the sequence fragments of the first PCR round were fused in three successive rounds of fusion PCR (Ho, S, N. et al. (1989) <i>Gene </i>77, 51-59) until two sequence fragments remained (AE* and EK) which were ligated between XhoI and SacI digested pSP72 to produce pAS100.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0089">Sequence deletions in modified variants of the mamGFDC cluster were created in pAS100 by parallel digestion with two restriction enzymes and subsequent re-ligation of the vector backbone. For instance, for excision of mamC, pAS100 was digested with EcoRI and recirculated producing pAS104, while for creating a large deletion with mamG pAS100 was digested with NaeI and Eco47111 producing pAS101. pBBR1MCS-2 based expression vectors containing single gene constructs were pAS32 (mamG), pAS33 (mamF), pAS34 (mamD), and pAS35 (mamC), vectors containing double gene constructs were pAS36 (mamGD), pAS37 (mamGC), pAS38 (mamFD), pAS39 (mamFC), and pAS40 (mamDC), and vectors containing triple gene constructs were pAS41 (mamGFD), pAS42 (mamGFC), pAS43 (mamGDC), and pAS44 (mamFDC). Vector pBBR1MCS-2 without insert was used as a negative control. Complementation constructs were introduced into the recipient mutant strains of <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>by means of biparental conjugation with <i>E. coli </i>S17-1 as a donor. Expression of single, double and triple complementation constructs was verified by reverse transcription PCR, demonstrating that the deletions within the mamGFDC operon do not inhibit transcription of genes located downstream in the operon.</p>

<p id="p-0087" num="0090">Transmission electron microscopy was performed either on a Zeiss EM 10 on unstained cells adsorbed on carbon-coated copper grids, or on a Zeiss EM 912, equipped with an integrated OMEGA energy filter operated in the zero loss mode, on thin sections.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0091">For thin sections, cells were fixed with 2.5% glutardialdehyde in 75 mM sodium cacodylate, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>(pH 7.0) for 1 h at room temperature. Post-fixation was performed for 1 h with 1% osmium tetroxide in a fixative buffer. Then, cells were stained en bloc with 1% uranyl acetate in 20% acetone for 30 min. Dehydration was performed with a graded acetone series. Samples were then infiltrated and embedded in &#x201c;Spurr's&#x201d; low-viscosity resin. Ultra thin sections were cut with a diamond knife and mounted on uncoated copper grids. The thin sections were post-stained with aqueous lead citrate (100 mM, pH 13.0).</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092">For crystal analysis, <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>cultures were grown at micro-oxidic conditions for 24 h at 28&#xb0; C. Crystal parameters (crystal size and shape factor) were measured from digitized TEM micrographs using ImageJ 1.36b and the plugin Watersheds<sub>&#x2014;</sub>514 developed by M. Pinchon and N. Bonnet, which allows the semi-automatic segmentation of particles from the images (http://helios.univ-reims.fr/Labos/INSERM514/ImageJ/). The twinned crystals which were occasionally observed (frequency of approximately 7%) were omitted from analysis because the segmentation algorithm often failed to detect the correct crystal edges. Mann-Whitney significance test (http://elegans.swmed.edu/&#x2dc;leon/stats/utest.html) was used to determine the significance of difference between crystal size and between shape factor distributions.</p>
<p id="h-0021" num="0000">3.3. Loss of MamC has Only Minor Effects on Magnetite Crystal Formation</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093">Cells of the &#x394;mamC mutant exhibited a magnetic reaction both under the microscope and in the light scattering assay, and had a dark-brown appearance virtually identical to the wild-type (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). In electron micrographs, magnetosomes were found arranged in chains having sizes and shapes very similar to those of the wild-type (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>). However, size measurements of 225 magnetosome particles from &#x394;mamC mutant cells revealed that mature magnetite crystals were on average slightly smaller compared to those of the wild-type (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, Tables 3 and 4). Complementation of the mutant strain by pAS35 restored the formation of magnetosome sizes close to the wild-type range.</p>

<p id="p-0092" num="0095">Analysis of solubilized magnetosome membrane proteins (MMPs) from the mutant by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting revealed the absence of the highly abundant 12.4 kDa MamC band from the resolved polypeptide pattern, which was otherwise virtually unchanged compared to the wild-type (data not shown). In electron micrographs, isolated magnetosome particles from the mutant appeared identical to wild-type magnetosomes with respect to the presence of an organic membrane layer, the inter-particle spacing, and their tendency to rearrange in chains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>) suggesting that the absence of MamC did not markedly affect the formation of a functional magnetosome membrane.</p>
<p id="h-0022" num="0000">3.4. &#x394;mamGFDC Mutant Strain Produces Magnetosome Crystals Having Only 75% of the Wild-Type Size</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0096">The unexpected finding that loss of the most abundant magnetosome protein MamC had only a minor effect on magnetosome formation prompted the generation of a deletion mutant lacking the entire mamGFDC operon, which was designated strain &#x394;GFDC.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0097">Cells of &#x394;GFDC exhibited a magnetic response if checked by microscopic observation. However, in contrast to the dark brown wild-type and &#x394;mamC mutant, colonies of strain AGFDC only had a slightly brownish color (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). TEM micrographs of mutant cells revealed the presence of small magnetosome crystals that frequently had a cuboidal shape, and were aligned in irregular, widely spaced chains (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, Table 3). Analysis of more than 220 crystals confirmed that the mutant crystal size distribution (CSD) is shifted towards smaller sizes (the Mann-Whitney probability value determined for CSD of wild-type and of &#x394;GFDC crystals is P=2.77E-8, indicating that the difference is statistically significant). For the mutant, crystals of 25-30 nm in size occurred at highest frequency, whereas crystals&#x3e;30 nm were of low abundance, accounting for only 24.3% in the analyzed population. In contrast, crystals of 35-40 nm in size were most abundant in the wild-type, thus crystals&#x3e;30 nm occurred at a significantly higher frequency of 77.5%. Maximum sizes of crystals without obvious crystal defects, such as twinning, were 41.5 nm in mutant cells, and 50.1 nm for the wild-type. In addition, mutant crystals showed more often anisotropic shapes (shape factor, SF) as only 37.4% of the crystals analyzed were equidimensional (SF&#x3e;0.94), whereas 50.8% of the wild-type crystals had a SF&#x3e;0.94.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0098">Complementation of strain AGFDC with plasmid pAS31 harboring the entire mamGFDC cluster increased the size of mature magnetite crystals to wild-type size range. CSD and SF distributions of wild-type and complemented mutant strain were almost similar (P&#x3e;1E-01), which substantiates that the effects on the AGFDC magnetosome crystals result from loss of the MamGFDC proteins (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, Tables 3 and 4).</p>

3.5 The Formation of Small Magnetosomes Cannot be Compensated by an Increased Iron Concentration
</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0100">One possible reason for the formation of smaller, growth-inhibited crystals could be a reduced flux of iron from the exterior into the magnetosome vesicles. Therefore, growth rates and magnetosome formation of the wild-type and the &#x394;mamC and the &#x394;mamGFDC mutant were compared at low (&#x2dc;1 &#x3bc;M) and high iron (&#x2dc;500 &#x3bc;M) concentrations (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0101">The formation of small magnetosomes could not be compensated by increased iron, as indicated by TEM and C<sub>mag </sub>measurements. Almost identical doubling times (3 h 40 min) were determined for the wild-type under both conditions, for &#x394;GFDC at 500 &#x3bc;M Fe, and for the &#x394;mamC mutant under low iron conditions, respectively. Even though strain AGFDC grew slightly faster at low iron, and growth of the &#x394;mamC mutant was slightly slower at 500 &#x3bc;M Fe, no substantial effect on growth caused by the deletion of mamC or mamGFDC genes was found. The development of magnetic responses after transfer to iron-sufficient conditions was similar in iron-starved wild-type and &#x394;mamC cultures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). Freshly inoculated cultures were nearly non-magnetic (C<sub>mag</sub>&#x3c;0.1), and magnetic responses increased within the first 3 h of cultivation to a level which remained almost unchanged during further growth, indicating that the dynamics of magnetite formation are unaffected in the &#x394;mamC mutant. Likewise, lack of the MamGFDC proteins did not affect the development of the magnetic response at high iron concentration. At low iron concentrations, however, magnetic response of the &#x394;mamGFDC cultures was close to detection limit during the first 10 h of cultivation, which might result from slower growth of crystals to sizes of permanent magnetic remanence. At non-limiting iron concentrations for magnetite formation, C<sub>mag </sub>values of &#x394;mamGFDC cultures were slightly lower than those of the wild-type due to the less regular chain arrangement and smaller crystal size.</p>
<p id="h-0023" num="0000">3.6. The &#x394;mamGFDC Mutant Forms Wild-Type-Like Magnetosome Membrane Vesicles</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0102">Another possible reason for the observed growth inhibition of magnetite crystals in the &#x394;mamGFDC mutant could be the formation of aberrantly shaped or sized membrane vesicles, which could constrain the growth of crystals by size limitation. Isolated &#x394;mamGFDC magnetosomes such as those from the wild-type were associated with an organic envelope (FIG. <b>3</b>BIII), suggesting that the formation of the magnetosome membrane was not prevented by the deletion. The structure of the magnetosome membrane prior to magnetite synthesis was analyzed by TEM of thin-sectioned iron-starved cells. Both empty and partially filled magnetosome vesicles were visible in micrographs of the mutant. These vesicles had the same spherical shape and bilaminar structure as in the wild-type (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Slightly elongated vesicles were occasionally observed, but these were present in both the mutant and the wild-type. In wild-type and in mutant cells the membrane layer had a thickness of approximately 6 nm. Size measurements of about 50 vesicles in mutant and wild-type cells revealed that they are of variable sizes, and the average width of mutant vesicles appeared slightly decreased compared to the wild-type (wild-type: d=44.9 nm, AGFDC mutant: d=40.3 nm) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). Statistical comparison of vesicle size distributions, however, revealed that the difference is below significance (P&#x3e;1E-2). In addition, in both strains the mean diameter of empty vesicles significantly exceeded the mean diameter of mature magnetite particles, suggesting that the growth of crystals is not limited by spatial constraints.</p>
<p id="h-0024" num="0000">3.7. The MamGFDC Proteins Act in a Cumulative Manner on Crystal Size</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0103">After confirming that the phenotype can be restored to wild-type level in the &#x394;mamGFDC mutant by in trans-complementation (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, Tables 3 and 4), the contributions of the individual mamGFDC genes with respect to the observed effects on crystal size and shape development were assessed by performing complementation assays. Instead of generating numerous different knockout mutants, 13 variants of the mamGFDC operon were constructed, which permitted the in trans expression of all individual genes of the operon as well as any combination of them in the &#x394;mamGFDC mutant. Comparison of crystal sizes from different complemented mutants with those produced by the wild-type and the &#x394;mamGFDC mutant showed in most cases that differences between CSDs are statistically significant, indicating that complementation had a measurable effect on crystal size.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0104">Strains complemented with only one of the four mamGFDC genes (strains &#x394;GFDC_G, &#x394;GFDC_F, and &#x394;GFDC_D) or with any two genes (strains &#x394;GFDC_GD, &#x394;GFDC_GC, &#x394;GFDC_FC, and &#x394;GFDC_DC) produced mature crystals larger than those in the &#x394;mamGFDC mutant, but smaller than those in the wild-type, suggesting that crystal size is not controlled by a single gene of the mamGFDC cluster (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, Tables 3 and 4). In contrast, strains complemented with any three of the four mamGFDC genes (strains &#x394;GFDC_GFC, &#x394;GFDC_GDC, and &#x394;GFDC_FDC) produced mature crystals of about wild-type size (P&#x3e;1E-03) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, Tables 3 and 4). Although the CSDs of strains &#x394;GFDC_C, &#x394;GFDC_FD, and &#x394;GFDC_GFD represent minor deviations from the general trend, these data strongly argue that restoration of wild-type-like crystal sizes requires at least three of the four MamGFDC proteins, almost independently of their combination. This suggests the MamGFDC proteins to act in a cumulative manner on crystals size. In contrast, no significant effect of individual MamGFDC proteins on crystal shape was detected, as differences between SFDs of wild-type, &#x394;mamGFDC mutant, and complemented mutant strains were mostly below significance (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, Tables 3 and 4).</p>

<heading id="h-0026" level="1">Summary/Discussion</heading>
<p id="p-0102" num="0105">In this study, the function of the abundant magnetosome membrane proteins (MMPs) encoded in the mamGFDC operon was analyzed by localization studies, deletion mutagenesis, and complementation analysis. Targeted mutagenesis was done by establishing an alternative mutagenesis approach utilizing the Cre-loxP system for antibiotic marker recycling (Marx, C. J., and Lidstrom, M. E (2002), supra) for generating the &#x394;mamC mutant strain. As most mam and mms genes are arranged in polycistronic operons, mutagenesis strategies require the construction of unmarked in frame deletions whose generation in magnetotactic bacteria has remained notoriously cumbersome due to difficulties in enforcing multiple double-crossover events. The present mutagenesis system was found to provide an advantage over the conventional techniques, and the exchange of the targeted locus by a selective marker allows selection against revertant growth. In addition, marker recycling by the site-specific Cre recombinase may enable the generation of strains bearing multiple genetic modifications with only a single selectable marker gene. In combination with the in trans-expression of mutant variants of entire operons, which circumvents the tedious chromosomal insertion of mutant alleles, this has proven a feasible strategy for genetic analysis in magnetotactic bacteria, whose genetic manipulation has remained cumbersome.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0106">Although the MamGFDC proteins were previously identified by co-purification with the magnetosome particles, it was not clear if their localization is confined to the magnetosome membrane (MM), or if they are shared by other cellular compartments, e.g. by contributing to the assembly of filamentous structures implicated in magnetosome chain organization. The in vivo localization experiments demonstrated that all three proteins analyzed by EGFP fusions are localized at mid-cell in a linear manner. Both the length and width of the fluorescence signal as well as its position and slightly punctuate appearance are consistent with the position of the magnetosome chain. In contrast to the magnetosome proteins MamA, MamJ, and MamK, which localize as filament-like structures traversing the cell (Komeili, A. et al. (2004) <i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. </i>101, 3839-3844; Komeili, A. et al. (2006) <i>Science </i>311, 242-245; Scheffel, A. et al. (2006) <i>Nature </i>440, 110-115), the localization of EGFP fused to either MamC, MamG, and MamF appears confined to the presumed position of the magnetosome chain. This is in agreement with the previous observation that an orthologous MamC protein (named Mam12), was exclusively located in the MM in <i>Magnetospirillum magnetotacticum </i>(Taoka, A. et al. (2006) <i>J. Bacteriol. </i>188, 3805-3812). Together with the results of mutagenesis studies these data argue that MamC, MamG, and MamF are specifically targeted to the magnetosome membrane, and suggest an involvement in the control of magnetite biomineralization rather then in magnetosome organization or general cell metabolism.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0107">Surprisingly, neither of MamC, MamG, MamF, and MamD, which together account for approximately 35% of all MMPs, appears essential for magnetite biomineralization. The loss of the most abundant magnetosome protein MamC only had a minor effect on the size of mature crystals. Even the absence of all four proteins did not entirely abolish magnetosome formation. However, the loss of MamGFDC had a significant effect on crystal size and chain organization, indicating that these proteins might have regulatory or accessory functions. The complementation study of the &#x394;mamGFDC mutant suggested that they have overlapping and partially redundant functions and may collectively act on the crystal size. One possible explanation for the unexpectedly weak phenotype of the &#x394;mamGFDC mutant might be the presence of a further mamF-like gene (mmsF) identified within the mms6 operon, which could have a redundant function and may partially compensate the loss of the mamF gene and even the entire operon.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0108">The data suggest that the mode of action of MamGFDC is correlated to the expression of these heterogeneous genes, and surprisingly the in trans-expression of additional copies of the entire mamGFDC operon in the wild-type yielded magnetite particles even larger then in the wild-type. In principle, there are several different factors that may affect the growth of magnetite crystals, such as the size and the shape of the vesicles, which spatially constrain crystal growth. It could have been envisioned, for instance, that the absence of four abundant integral membrane proteins accounting for as much as 35% of the total magnetosome-associated proteins would have a marked effect on the surface and curvature of magnetosome membrane vesicles. However, magnetosome vesicles of wild-type and &#x394;mamGFDC mutant cells had very similar sizes, shapes, and structures, and were, in both strains, on average larger than mature magnetite crystals. This argues against the idea that the smaller size of crystals in the mamGFDC mutant may simply be caused by a reduced vesicle size. However, the size determination from thin sections bears the risk of underestimation, as vesicles may not always been sliced exactly along their maximum widths but more peripherally or tangentially. Therefore, methods such as cryo-electrontomography might be used to determine the spatial dimensions from a statistical number of three-dimensional vesicles more precisely.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0109">Another possible explanation for the data observed would be a reduced flux of iron into the magnetosome vesicles. However, crystal growth inhibition was independent from the availability of iron in the medium, and the heterogeneous MamGFDC proteins lack any similarity to known transporters, which seems to argue against their direct involvement in iron transport into the MM vesicles. It has been suggested that magnetosome vesicles need to be &#x201c;activated&#x201d; for magneto some formation, for example by the action of the magnetosome protein MamA (Komeili, A. et al. (2004), supra). The observation that any combination of several different, unrelated proteins is capable of gradually restoring the mutant phenotype appears to argue against a similar role of MamGFDC proteins.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0110">Alternatively, the MamGFDC proteins might act on the growth of magnetite crystals by regulating the physico-chemical conditions with the interior of vesicles, such as the charge distribution at the inner surface of vesicles or the intravesicular pH and redox conditions. For example, it was shown that size and shape of crystals of <i>M. gryphiswaldense </i>are strongly affected by redox conditions during magnetite biomineralization, and an inhibition of crystal growth was observed under highly oxidizing conditions, resulting in small and imperfect particles resembling those in the &#x394;mamGFDC mutant strain (Heyen, U. and Sch&#xfc;ler, D. (2003) <i>Appl. Microbial. Biotechnol. </i>61, 536-544). Intriguingly, the selective expression of different magnetosome proteins resulted in distinct mean particle sizes that consistently differed by only a few nanometers, while the number of magnetosomes per cell was not affected. Thus, a further fine tuning of the MamGFDC gene expression might provide one strategy for the precise control of the particle size.</p>
