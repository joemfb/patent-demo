<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a semiconductor device and a manufacturing method thereof. In this specification, the semiconductor device refers to any device which can function with the use of semiconductor characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In recent years, there has been extensive production of semiconductor devices in which a thin film transistor (a TFT) is formed over a substrate such as a glass substrate which has an insulating surface and used as a switching element or the like. In the thin film transistor, an island-shaped semiconductor layer is formed over a substrate having an insulating surface by a CVD method, a photolithography process, or the like, and part of the island-shaped semiconductor layer is used as a channel formation region of the transistor (for example, see Reference 1: Japanese Published Patent Application No. H08-018055).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A schematic cross-sectional view of a thin film transistor is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, in the thin film transistor, an insulating layer <b>31</b> which serves as a base film is formed over a substrate <b>30</b>; a semiconductor layer <b>32</b> which includes a channel formation region <b>32</b><i>a </i>and impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c </i>each of which serves as a source region or a drain region is formed over the insulating layer <b>31</b>; an insulating layer <b>33</b> which serves as a gate insulating layer is formed over the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> and the insulating layer <b>31</b>; a conductive layer <b>34</b> which serves as a gate electrode is formed over the insulating layer <b>33</b>; an insulating layer <b>203</b> is formed over the conductive layer <b>34</b>; and wirings <b>204</b> electrically connected to the impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c </i>are formed over the insulating layer <b>203</b>.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In the structure illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>, since the wiring is electrically connected to the surface of the source region or the drain region, it has been necessary to form the semiconductor layer which serves as the source region or the drain region at the bottom of an opening. Therefore, it has been difficult to control etching in formation of the opening in the insulating layer. This is particularly serious when the semiconductor layer is formed of a thin film with a thickness of 50 nm or less.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention discloses a technique to solve such a problem and provides a technique of manufacturing a semiconductor device in which etching in formation of a contact hole can be easily controlled.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A semiconductor device of the present invention includes at least a semiconductor layer formed over an insulating surface; a first insulating layer formed over the semiconductor layer; a gate electrode formed over the first insulating layer; a second insulating layer formed over the gate electrode; and a conductive layer formed over the second insulating layer so as to fill an opening which is formed at least in the semiconductor layer and the second insulating layer and partially exposes the insulating surface. Note that the conductive layer is electrically connected to the semiconductor layer at the side surface of the contact hole which is formed in the semiconductor layer. In addition, the contact hole may be formed such that part of the surface of the semiconductor layer is exposed; that is, the top-view area of the opening formed in the semiconductor layer is smaller than that of opening formed in the second insulating layer, and the conductive layer and the semiconductor layer may be electrically connected to each other at the side surface of the contact hole which is formed in the semiconductor layer and at the surface of the semiconductor layer.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A semiconductor device of the present invention can be manufactured by forming a semiconductor layer over an insulating surface; forming a first insulating layer over the semiconductor layer; forming a gate electrode over the first insulating layer; forming a second insulating layer over the gate electrode; forming an opening which partially exposes the insulating surface at least in the semiconductor layer and the second insulating layer; and forming a conductive layer over the insulating surface and the second insulating layer so as to fill the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A semiconductor device of the present invention can be manufactured by forming a first insulating layer over a substrate; forming a second insulating layer over the first insulating layer; forming a semiconductor layer over the second insulating layer; forming a third insulating layer over the semiconductor layer; forming a gate electrode over the third insulating layer; forming a fourth insulating layer over the gate electrode; forming an opening which partially exposes the surface of the first insulating layer at least in the second insulating layer, the semiconductor layer, and the fourth insulating layer; and forming a conductive layer over the surface of the first insulating layer and the fourth insulating layer so as to fill the opening.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">A semiconductor device of the present invention can be manufactured by forming a first insulating layer over a substrate; forming a second insulating layer over the first insulating layer; forming a semiconductor layer over the second insulating layer; forming a third insulating layer over the semiconductor layer; forming a gate electrode over the third insulating layer; forming a fourth insulating layer over the gate electrode; forming a resist over the fourth insulating layer; forming a first opening which partially exposes the surface of the semiconductor layer at least in the fourth insulating layer using the resist as a mask; forming a second opening which partially exposes the surface of the first insulating layer and the surface of the semiconductor layer by etching at least the second insulating layer, the semiconductor layer, and the fourth insulating layer using the resist as a mask; and forming a conductive layer over the surface of the first insulating layer, the surface of the semiconductor layer, and the fourth insulating layer so as to fill the second opening. Note that the first opening can be formed by wet etching and the second opening can be formed by dry etching.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A semiconductor device of the present invention can be manufactured by forming a first insulating layer over a substrate; forming a second insulating layer over the first insulating layer; forming a semiconductor layer over the second insulating layer; forming a third insulating layer over the semiconductor layer; forming a gate electrode over the third insulating layer; forming a fourth insulating layer over the gate electrode; forming a resist over the fourth insulating layer; forming a first opening which partially exposes the surface of the semiconductor layer at least in the fourth insulating layer using the resist as a mask; etching the resist outwardly so as to enlarge the opening; forming a second opening which partially exposes the surface of the first insulating layer and the surface of the semiconductor layer by etching at least the second insulating layer, the semiconductor layer, and the fourth insulating layer using the resist as a mask; and forming a conductive layer over the surface of the first insulating layer, the surface of the semiconductor layer, and the fourth insulating layer so as to fill the second opening. Note that the first opening and the second opening can be formed by dry etching.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In the present invention, since it is not necessary to stop etching at the surface of a semiconductor layer, etching in formation of a contact hole can be easily controlled. Further, a source electrode or a drain electrode can be electrically connected to the semiconductor layer at the side surface of the contact hole which is formed in the semiconductor layer; thus, a semiconductor device in which deterioration of characteristics is suppressed can be easily manufactured.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">A semiconductor device described in this embodiment mode includes a thin film transistor <b>205</b> having an island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>32</b> which is provided over a substrate <b>30</b> with an insulating layer <b>31</b> interposed therebetween, a gate insulating layer <b>33</b> formed over the semiconductor layer <b>32</b>, and a conductive layer <b>34</b> which serves as a gate electrode and is provided over the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> with the gate insulating layer <b>33</b> interposed therebetween; an insulating layer <b>203</b> which is provided to cover the gate insulating layer <b>33</b> and the conductive layer <b>34</b>; and conductive layers <b>204</b> each of which serves as a source electrode or a drain electrode and is provided over the insulating layer <b>203</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref>). The semiconductor layer <b>32</b> includes a channel formation region <b>32</b><i>a </i>and impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c </i>each of which serves as a source region or a drain region. An insulating layer <b>36</b> is formed at an end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> which here is a section that is in contact with the channel formation region <b>32</b><i>a </i>below the conductive layer <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In the semiconductor device described in this embodiment mode, the insulating layer <b>203</b> and the impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c </i>of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> are etched to form contact holes (also referred to as openings) which reach an insulating layer <b>31</b><i>b</i>, and then, the conductive layers <b>204</b> are formed so as to fill the contact holes. That is, in this embodiment mode, the conductive layers <b>204</b> and the impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c </i>are electrically connected to each other at the side surfaces of the contact holes which are formed in the impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In this embodiment mode, since it is not necessary to stop etching at the surface of the semiconductor layer, the etching in formation of the contact hole can be easily controlled. Further, the source electrode or the drain electrode can be electrically connected to the semiconductor layer at the side surface of the contact hole which is formed in the semiconductor layer; thus, a semiconductor device in which deterioration of characteristics is suppressed can be easily manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The insulating layer <b>36</b>, which is formed at the end portion of the semiconductor layer, is not always necessary to be formed but is preferably provided to prevent a short circuit between the end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> and the conductive layer <b>34</b> which serves as a gate electrode and thus to prevent leak current from flowing. Therefore, the insulating layer <b>36</b> is formed at least at a side surface (an exposed section) of the channel formation region <b>32</b><i>a </i>of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b>. Note that the insulating layer <b>36</b> may of course be formed at other sections. In this embodiment mode, the insulating layer <b>36</b> is formed on the lower side (the substrate side) of the gate insulating layer <b>33</b> to be in contact with the gate insulating layer <b>33</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Next, an example of a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A to 1C</figref> will be described with reference to the drawings. Note that manufacturing steps which relate to the cross section taken along the broken line joining A and B in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A to 2D</figref>, <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>C, and <b>4</b>A and <b>4</b>B, and manufacturing steps which relate to the cross section taken along the broken line joining C and D in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2E to 2H</figref>, <b>3</b>D to <b>3</b>F, and <b>4</b>C and <b>4</b>D.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">First, the insulating layer <b>31</b> is formed over the substrate <b>30</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2E</figref>). In this embodiment mode, the insulating layer <b>31</b> has a two-layer structure of a first insulating layer <b>31</b><i>a </i>formed over the substrate <b>30</b> and the second insulating layer <b>31</b><i>b </i>formed over the first insulating layer <b>31</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">As the substrate <b>30</b>, a glass substrate, a quartz substrate, a metal substrate (for example, a ceramic substrate or a stainless steel substrate), a semiconductor substrate such as a Si substrate, or the like can be used. Alternatively, a plastic substrate formed of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), polyether sulfone (PES), acrylic, or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The insulating layer <b>31</b> can be formed of an insulating material such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride (SiO<sub>x</sub>N<sub>y</sub>, where x&#x3e;y&#x3e;0), or silicon nitride oxide (SiN<sub>x</sub>O<sub>y</sub>, where x&#x3e;y&#x3e;0), by a CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like. For example, a silicon nitride oxide film may be formed as the first insulating layer <b>31</b><i>a </i>and a silicon oxynitride film may be formed as the second insulating layer <b>31</b><i>b</i>. Alternatively, a silicon nitride film may be formed as the first insulating layer <b>31</b><i>a </i>and a silicon oxide film may be formed as the second insulating layer <b>31</b><i>b</i>. Providing the insulating layer <b>31</b> can prevent impurities such as alkali metals from diffusing from the substrate <b>30</b> and contaminating an element which is formed thereover.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Then, a semiconductor film <b>201</b> is formed over the insulating layer <b>31</b>. The semiconductor film <b>201</b> can be formed of an amorphous semiconductor film or a crystalline semiconductor film. As a crystalline semiconductor film, a film formed by crystallizing an amorphous semiconductor film formed over the insulating layer <b>31</b> using thermal treatment or laser light irradiation, or the like can be used. Note that silicon is preferable as a semiconductor material. Alternatively, silicon germanium or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The semiconductor film <b>201</b> has a thickness of 10 to 200 nm, preferably, approximately 10 to 50 nm, more preferably, approximately 10 to 30 nm. Note that in the case of forming the semiconductor film <b>201</b> with a thickness of 50 nm or less, the semiconductor film <b>201</b> may be formed with a thickness of approximately 10 to 50 nm by forming a semiconductor film with a thickness of 50 nm or more and then dry-etching the surface of the semiconductor film. As an etching gas for the etching, a chlorine-based gas such as Cl<sub>2</sub>, BCl<sub>3</sub>, or SiCl<sub>4</sub>; a fluorine-based gas such as CF<sub>4</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>, SF<sub>6</sub>, or CHF<sub>3</sub>; a mixed gas in which O<sub>2 </sub>gas, H<sub>2 </sub>gas, or an inert gas such as He or Ar is added as appropriate to a fluorine-based gas; or the like can be used. Note that before the dry etching is performed, the surface of the semiconductor film may be treated with dilute hydrofluoric acid to remove a natural oxide film formed on the surface of the semiconductor film and then the surface of the semiconductor film may be treated with ozone water or the like to form an oxide film on the surface of the semiconductor film.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">By forming the semiconductor film <b>201</b> as a thin film with a thickness of approximately 50 nm or less, failure in covering the surface of the semiconductor layer by the gate insulating layer can be reduced. Further, by forming the semiconductor film <b>201</b> as a thin film, further miniaturization of a TFT can be achieved. Moreover, even when the amount of an impurity element added to a channel formation region is increased in order to control the threshold voltage of a TFT, it is easier to manufacture a complete depletion type TFT by forming the semiconductor film <b>201</b> as a thin film, and thus, a TFT whose threshold voltage is controlled while keeping a good subthreshold swing can be manufactured.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">When a film formed by crystallizing or recrystallizing an amorphous semiconductor film by laser light irradiation is used as the semiconductor film <b>201</b>, an LD-pumped continuous wave (CW) laser (YVO<sub>4</sub>, second harmonic (wavelength of 532 nm)) can be used as a light source of the laser light. Although the wavelength is not specifically limited to the second harmonic, the second harmonic is superior to harmonics higher than that in terms of energy efficiency. When a semiconductor film is irradiated with CW laser light, energy is continuously applied to the semiconductor film. Therefore, once the semiconductor film is converted to a melted state, the melted state can be maintained. Further, by scanning the semiconductor film with CW laser light, a solid-liquid interface of the semiconductor film can be moved, and crystal grains which are long in one direction, which matches the direction of the movement, can be formed. A reason for using a solid-state laser is that compared to a gas laser or the like, a solid-state laser has more stable power output, so more stable treatment can be expected. Note that the laser light source is not limited to a CW laser. A pulsed laser with a repetition rate of 10 MHz or more can also be used. When a pulsed laser with a high repetition rate is used, if a pulse interval of the laser is shorter than the time it takes for a semiconductor film to solidify after being melted, the semiconductor film can be maintained in a melted state, and by moving the solid-liquid interface, a semiconductor film with crystal grains which are long in one direction can be formed. It is also possible to employ another type of CW laser or pulsed laser with a repetition rate of 10 MHz or more. For example, a gas laser such as an Ar laser, a Kr laser, or a CO<sub>2 </sub>laser can be used. A solid-state laser such as a YAG laser, a YLF laser, a YAlO<sub>3 </sub>laser, a GdVO<sub>4 </sub>laser, a KGW laser, a KYW laser, an alexandrite laser, a Ti:sapphire laser, a Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>laser, or a YVO<sub>4 </sub>laser can be used. Further, a ceramic laser such as a YAG laser, a Y<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>laser, a GdVO<sub>4 </sub>laser, or a YVO<sub>4 </sub>laser can also be used. A metal vapor laser such as a helium-cadmium laser or the like can be used. It is preferable to emit laser light from a laser oscillator using TEM<sub>00 </sub>(single transverse mode), since by doing so, the energy uniformity of a linear beam spot obtained on a surface that is irradiated can be increased. Further, a pulsed excimer laser can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, a resist <b>202</b> is formed as selected over the semiconductor film <b>201</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2E</figref>). Then, the resist <b>202</b> is used as a mask and the semiconductor film <b>201</b> is dry-etched to form the island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2B and 2F</figref>). Note that the resist <b>202</b> is used as a mask during etching, and a positive photoresist, a negative photoresist, or the like can be selected as appropriate and used for the resist <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As an etching gas for the dry etching, a fluorine-based gas such as CF<sub>4</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>, SF<sub>6</sub>, or CHF<sub>3</sub>; a mixed gas in which O<sub>2 </sub>gas, H<sub>2 </sub>gas, or an inert gas such as He or Ar is added as appropriate to the fluorine-based gas; or the like can be used. Preferably, a mixed gas containing CF<sub>4 </sub>and O<sub>2</sub>, a mixed gas containing SF<sub>6 </sub>and O<sub>2</sub>, a mixed gas containing CHF<sub>3 </sub>and He, or a mixed gas containing CF<sub>4 </sub>and H<sub>2 </sub>is used. Further, the etching is not limited to dry etching; wet etching may be used. In that case, the island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>32</b> can be formed by wet-etching the semiconductor film <b>201</b> using an organic alkaline aqueous solution typified by TMAH (tetramethylammonium hydroxide). Note that when TMAH or the like is used as an etchant, because etching is selective such that only the semiconductor film <b>201</b> is etched, etching can be performed without damaging the base insulating layer <b>31</b>. When a semiconductor layer formed over an insulating surface is separated into island shapes in this manner, elements can be separated from each other in the case where a plurality of thin film transistors and peripheral circuits are formed over the same substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The semiconductor layer <b>32</b> may be formed such that the end portion has a perpendicular shape or a tapered shape. The shape of the end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> can be selected as appropriate by changing the etching condition or the like. It is preferable to form the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> such that the taper angle of the end portion is 45&#xb0; or more and less than 95&#xb0;, and more preferably 60&#xb0; or more and less than 95&#xb0;. By making the end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> a shape almost perpendicular, a parasitic channel can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Then, the resist <b>202</b> formed over the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Next, an insulating layer <b>107</b> (hereinafter also referred to as the third insulating layer <b>107</b>) is formed to cover the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2C and 2G</figref>). The third insulating layer <b>107</b> is formed by a CVD method or a sputtering method, using a material such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, SiOF, SiOC, DLC, porous silica, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Further, the third insulating layer <b>107</b> is formed to a thickness so that the end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> can be sufficiently covered therewith. The thickness of the third insulating layer <b>107</b> is preferably in the range of 1.5 to 3 times larger than that of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> formed below the third insulating layer <b>107</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Next, the third insulating layer <b>107</b> is selectively etched by anisotropic etching mainly in a perpendicular direction to form the insulating layer <b>36</b> (hereinafter also referred to as the fourth insulating layer <b>36</b>) which is in contact with the side surface of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2D and 2H</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In the anisotropic etching mainly in a perpendicular direction of the third insulating layer <b>107</b>, the etching progresses gradually from the third insulating layer <b>107</b> formed in the region over the one surface of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> and over the insulating layer <b>31</b><i>b</i>. Note that the third insulating layer <b>107</b> with an almost uniform thickness is formed over the one surface of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> and over the insulating layer <b>31</b><i>b</i>. Therefore, by stopping the etching when the one surface of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> is exposed, the third insulating layer <b>107</b> can be left just in the region which is in contact with the side surface of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> and the periphery thereof. The left third insulating layer <b>107</b> corresponds to the fourth insulating layer <b>36</b>. Note that by making the end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> an almost perpendicular shape, the third insulating layer <b>107</b> can be easily left just in the region which is in contact with the side surface of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> and in the periphery thereof. That is, the fourth insulating layer <b>36</b> can be easily formed.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The etching method of the third insulating layer <b>107</b> is not particularly limited as long as anisotropic etching mainly in a perpendicular direction can be performed. For example, reactive ion etching (RIE) can be used. The reactive ion etching is classified depending on a plasma generation method into a parallel-plate type, a magnetron type, a dual-frequency type, an ECR type, a helicon type, an ICP type, or the like. As an etching gas used at this time, a gas which can provide high etching selectivity of the third insulating layer <b>107</b> with respect to other layers (such as the semiconductor layer <b>32</b>) is preferably selected. In the case of selectively etching the insulating film, a fluorine-based gas such as CHF<sub>3</sub>, CF<sub>4</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, NF<sub>3</sub>, or the like can be used, for example. Further, an inert gas such as helium (He), argon (Ar), or xenon (Xe); an O<sub>2 </sub>gas; or an H<sub>2 </sub>gas may be added as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The shape of the fourth insulating layer <b>36</b> can be changed by selecting the material for forming the thin film, the etching condition, or the like as appropriate. In this embodiment mode, the fourth insulating layer <b>36</b> is formed such that the perpendicular height from the bottom surface (the surface which is in contact with the insulating layer <b>31</b><i>b</i>) is almost the same as that of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b>. Further, the fourth insulating layer <b>36</b> is formed such that the surface thereof on the side which is not in contact with the side surface of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> is curved. Specifically, it is formed such that an appropriate curvature is provided and the surface is curved convexly with respect to the side surface of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> being in contact with. Of course, the present invention is not limited particularly thereto, and the fourth insulating layer <b>36</b> may have a shape having a corner instead of a rounded shape. Preferably, the corner portion of the fourth insulating layer <b>36</b> is made a gentle shape so that the coverage by a layer formed thereover (here, the insulating layer <b>33</b>) can be improved. Note that the etching condition means an amount of electric power which is applied to an electrode provided for a substrate, the temperature of the electrode provided for the substrate, the pressure in a chamber, and the like in addition to the kind of etching gas and a gas flow rate.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, the insulating layer <b>33</b> (hereinafter also referred to as the fifth insulating layer <b>33</b>) is formed over the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> and the fourth insulating layer <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3A and 3D</figref>). The fifth insulating layer <b>33</b> is formed by a CVD method or a sputtering method, using a material such as silicon oxide, silicon nitride, silicon oxynitride, silicon nitride oxide, aluminum nitride, or the like. Further, the fifth insulating layer <b>33</b> is formed to have a single layer structure or a stacked-layer structure of at least one of the above materials. The fifth insulating layer <b>33</b> is formed to have a thickness in the range of 1 to 50 nm, preferably 1 to 20 nm, and more preferably 1 to 10 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Note that a method for forming the insulating layer <b>36</b> is not limited to the one described in this embodiment mode, and the insulating layer <b>36</b> may be formed by performing plasma treatment in an atmosphere containing oxygen or wet oxidation to the end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b>. In such a case, preferably, after the insulating layer <b>33</b> is formed over the semiconductor layer <b>32</b>, the insulating layer <b>33</b> in a region which covers the end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> is removed and an exposed portion of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> is subjected to plasma treatment or wet oxidation to form the insulating layer <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In the case of wet oxidation, the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> is treated with an aqueous solution containing ozone, an aqueous solution containing hydrogen peroxide, an aqueous solution containing sulfuric acid, an aqueous solution containing iodic acid, or an aqueous solution containing nitric acid, and an oxide film formed at a portion where the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> is exposed can be used as the insulating layer <b>36</b>. The aqueous solution containing ozone, the aqueous solution containing hydrogen peroxide, the aqueous solution containing sulfuric acid, the aqueous solution containing iodic acid, or the aqueous solution containing nitric acid may contain acetic acid or oxalic acid.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Further, plasma treatment can be performed in an atmosphere containing oxygen, for example, a mixed gas atmosphere containing oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) and a rare gas (including at least one of He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe); a mixed gas atmosphere containing oxygen, hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), and a rare gas; a mixed gas atmosphere containing dinitrogen monoxide and a rare gas; or a mixed gas atmosphere containing dinitrogen monoxide, hydrogen, and a rare gas. For example, a mixed gas containing oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), and argon (Ar) can be used. In that case, a mixed gas containing oxygen with a flow rate of 0.1 to 100 sccm, hydrogen with a flow rate of 0.1 to 100 sccm, and argon with a flow rate of 100 to 5000 sccm may be used. Note that preferably the mixed gas with an oxygen:hydrogen:argon ratio of 1:1:100 is introduced. For example, oxygen with a flow rate of 5 sccm, hydrogen with a flow rate of 5 sccm, and argon with a flow rate of 500 sccm may be introduced.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Further, plasma treatment can be performed in an atmosphere containing nitrogen, for example, a mixed gas atmosphere containing nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) and a rare gas (including at least one of He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe); a mixed gas atmosphere containing nitrogen, hydrogen, and a rare gas; or a mixed gas atmosphere containing ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and a rare gas.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Note that the plasma treatment is performed in the above gas atmosphere using a plasma in which the electron density is 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or more and the electron temperature is 1.5 eV or less. More specifically, a plasma in which the electron density is 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or more and 1&#xd7;10<sup>13 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or less and the electron temperature is 0.5 eV or more and 1.5 eV or less is used. In the plasma, the electron density is high and the electron temperature in the periphery of an object to be treated (here, the semiconductor layer <b>32</b>) which is formed over the substrate <b>30</b> is low; therefore, the object to be treated can be prevented from being damaged by the plasma. Further, because the plasma has a high electron density of 1&#xd7;10<sup>11 </sup>cm<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>or more, an oxide film or nitride film formed by oxidizing or nitriding the object to be treated using the plasma treatment can have superior uniformity of film thickness and the like and can be denser, compared to a film formed by a CVD method, a sputtering method, or the like. Further, since the plasma has low electron temperature of 1.5 eV or less, oxidation or nitridation can be performed at lower temperature than conventional plasma treatment or thermal oxidation method. For example, oxidation can be performed sufficiently even when the plasma treatment is performed at temperature which is lower than the strain point of a glass substrate by 100&#xb0; C. or more. Further, as a frequency for producing plasma, a high frequency wave such as a microwave (e.g., a microwave with a frequency of 2.45 GHz) can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Next, the conductive layer <b>34</b> which serves as a gate electrode is formed over the gate insulating layer <b>33</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3E</figref>). In this embodiment mode, an example in which the conductive layer <b>34</b> is formed as a single layer is shown; however, the conductive layer <b>34</b> may of course have a structure in which two, three or more layers of conductive materials are stacked. Note that the conductive layer <b>34</b> can be formed by selectively etching a conductive layer which is formed so as to cover the gate insulating layer <b>33</b>, although this is not shown in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The conductive layer <b>34</b> can be formed using an element such as tantalum (Ta), tungsten (W), titanium (Ti), molybdenum (Mo), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), niobium (Nb), or the like, or using an alloy material or a compound material containing any of such elements as a main component. Alternatively, the conductive layer <b>34</b> can be formed using a semiconductor material typified by polycrystalline silicon doped with an impurity element such as phosphorus. For example, in the case where the conductive layer <b>34</b> has a stacked-layer structure including a first conductive layer and a second conductive layer, tantalum nitride may be used as the first conductive layer and tungsten may be used as the second conductive layer. Note that the conductive layer <b>34</b> is not limited to this combination. When the conductive layer <b>34</b> is formed with a stacked-layer structure, the conductive layer <b>34</b> can be provided by freely combining any of the materials described above.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Next, by using the conductive layer <b>34</b> as a mask and introducing an impurity element <b>121</b> into the semiconductor layer <b>32</b>, the impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c </i>and the channel formation region <b>32</b><i>a </i>into which the impurity element <b>121</b> is not introduced are formed in the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B and 3E</figref>). Note that in this embodiment mode, because the impurity element is introduced after the conductive layer <b>34</b> is formed so as to go across the island-shaped semiconductor layer <b>32</b>, the impurity element is introduced to regions of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> which are not covered with the conductive layer <b>34</b> to form the impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c</i>, and the channel formation region <b>32</b><i>a </i>into which the impurity element <b>121</b> is not introduced is formed in a region of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> which is covered with the conductive layer <b>34</b>.</p>

As an impurity element which imparts p-type conductivity, boron (B), aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), or the like can be used. For example, phosphorus (P) can be used as the impurity element <b>121</b> and introduced into the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> such that it is contained in the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> at a concentration of 1&#xd7;10<sup>18 </sup>to 1&#xd7;10<sup>21</sup>/cm<sup>3 </sup>to form the impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c </i>which have n-type conductivity. Further, low-concentration impurity regions (LDD regions), to which an impurity element is added at a lower concentration than that of the impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c </i>each of which serves as a source region or a drain region, may be formed between the channel formation region <b>32</b><i>a </i>and the impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c</i>. By providing a low-concentration impurity region, an electric field at an end of a drain can be reduced, and degradation caused by repetition of writing and erasing can be suppressed.</p>

An oxazole resin is, for example, photosensitive polybenzoxazole or the like. Photosensitive polybenzoxazole is a material which has a low dielectric constant (a dielectric constant of 2.9 at 1 MHz at room temperature), high heat resistance (according to results of thermogravimetry-differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA), it has a thermal decomposition temperature of 550&#xb0; C. at a rate of temperature increase of 5&#xb0; C./min), and a low water absorption percentage (0.3% at room temperature over 24 hours). Compared to a relative dielectric constant of polyimide or the like (approximately 3.2 to 3.4), an oxazole resin has a lower dielectric constant (approximately 2.9).

<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Next, a metal layer <b>1103</b> is formed on the exposed semiconductor layer <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12C</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The metal layer <b>1103</b> may be formed at least on the exposed semiconductor layer <b>32</b>. That is, the metal layer <b>1103</b> is formed on the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> in the region which does not overlap with the sidewall insulating layer <b>1101</b>. In this embodiment mode, the metal layer <b>1103</b> is formed so as to cover not only the exposed semiconductor layer <b>32</b> but also the sidewall insulating layer <b>1101</b> and the conductive layer <b>34</b>. The metal layer <b>1103</b> is formed of a material which reacts with the semiconductor layer to form silicide. For example, a metal element such as nickel (Ni), titanium (Ti), cobalt (Co), or platinum (Pt), or an alloy material containing such a metal element can be used. The metal layer <b>1103</b> is formed of such a material by a sputtering method, an evaporation method, a plating method, or the like. The thickness of the metal layer <b>1103</b> is needed to be selected as appropriate in accordance with the thickness of a silicide region to be formed. In this embodiment mode, a 10-nm-thick nickel layer is formed as the metal layer <b>1103</b>. Note that, if a natural oxide film has been formed on the exposed semiconductor layer <b>32</b> when the metal layer <b>1103</b> is formed, the metal layer <b>1103</b> is formed after the natural oxide layer is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">Next, the silicide regions <b>1102</b> are formed in part of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">By thermal treatment, reaction occurs in the region in which the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> and the metal layer <b>1103</b> are in contact with each other, whereby the silicide regions <b>1102</b> are formed. The silicide regions <b>1102</b> are formed by making part of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> which is in contact with the metal layer <b>1103</b> silicide. At this time, the high-concentration impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c </i>formed in the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> are reduced since part of the high-concentration impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c </i>is made silicide. In other words, the silicide regions are formed in part of the high-concentration impurity regions. For example, when a nickel film is formed as the metal layer <b>1103</b>, nickel silicide is formed as the silicide regions <b>1102</b>. In a similar manner, when a titanium layer, a cobalt layer, or a platinum layer is formed as the metal layer <b>1103</b>, titanium silicide, cobalt silicide, or platinum silicide is formed as the silicide regions <b>1102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">The thermal treatment can be performed using RTA or an annealing furnace. Specifically, the thermal treatment may be performed at temperatures of 300 to 700&#xb0; C., for 10 seconds to 1 hour, and preferably for 20 seconds to 30 minutes. In this embodiment mode, thermal treatment for 30 seconds at 550&#xb0; C. is performed to form the silicide regions <b>1102</b> made of nickel silicide.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12D</figref>, the silicide regions <b>1102</b> are formed to have a thickness less than that of the region of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> where the channel formation region <b>32</b><i>a </i>is formed. Specifically, in the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> in the regions which do not overlap with the sidewall insulating layers <b>1101</b>, the high-concentration impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c </i>are formed on the side which is in contact with the insulating layer <b>31</b><i>b </i>and the silicide regions <b>1102</b> are formed on the high-concentration impurity regions <b>32</b><i>b </i>and <b>32</b><i>c. </i></p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Note that the shape, thickness, and the like of the silicide region <b>1102</b> can be selected by appropriately controlling the thickness of the metal layer <b>1103</b> to be reacted, temperature of thermal treatment, period of time for thermal treatment, and the like. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref>, in the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> in the region which does not overlap with the sidewall insulating layer <b>1101</b>, either partially or entirely, the silicide region <b>1102</b> which is formed by making the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> from the top surface to the bottom surface silicide may be formed. The top surface here means the surface of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> on the side on which a metal layer for silicide reaction is formed and the bottom surface means the surface on the side which is in contact with the insulating layer <b>31</b><i>b</i>. Further, when the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> from the top surface to the bottom surface is entirely made silicide, the high-concentration impurity region is formed below the sidewall insulating layer <b>1101</b>. Note that the present invention is not particularly limited; part of the silicide region may extend to the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> in the region below the sidewall insulating layer <b>1101</b> (except the channel formation region <b>32</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Further, in the case where the metal layer which has not reacted remains after the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> and the metal layer <b>1103</b> are reacted with each other, the metal layer which has not reacted is removed. Although not shown in the drawing, the metal layer <b>1103</b> formed over the insulating layer <b>36</b>, the sidewall insulating layer <b>1101</b>, the conductive layer <b>34</b><i>b</i>, and the insulating layer <b>31</b><i>b </i>is removed. Further, in the case where the metal layer which has not reacted remains over the silicide regions <b>1102</b>, the remaining metal layer is also removed. For removal of the metal layer which has not reacted, wet etching or dry etching can be used. At this time, it is necessary for an etching gas or an etchant to provide high etching selectivity of the metal layer which has not reacted, with respect to other layers (e.g., the insulating layer <b>36</b>, the sidewall insulating layer <b>1101</b>, the conductive layer <b>34</b><i>b</i>, the insulating layer <b>31</b><i>b</i>, and the silicide regions <b>1102</b>). That is, it is necessary that the etching rate with respect to the metal layer is high and the etching rate with respect to other layers is low. For example, in the case where the metal layer <b>1103</b> is formed of nickel, the metal layer which has not reacted can be removed by wet etching using a solution in which hydrochloric acid (HCl), nitric acid (HNO<sub>3</sub>), and pure water (H<sub>2</sub>O) are mixed; for example, the mixture ratio of the solution can be set to HCl:HNO<sub>3</sub>:H<sub>2</sub>O=3:2:1.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In this embodiment mode, since the insulating layer <b>36</b> is formed so as to be in contact with the side surface of the end portion of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b>, etching of the side surface of the semiconductor layer <b>32</b> can be prevented upon removing the metal layer which has not reacted by etching.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In the case where the silicide region is formed, it is necessary that the silicide region and the conductive layer forming the gate electrode are not in contact with each other. This is because, if the silicide region and the gate electrode are in contact with each other, the gate electrode and the source or drain region are shorted and switching characteristics (an on/off ratio) cannot be obtained, so that operation as a semiconductor device cannot be provided. Therefore, in this embodiment mode, the width of the conductive layers <b>34</b><i>a </i>and <b>34</b><i>b </i>forming the gate electrode <b>34</b> is made smaller than that of the insulating layer <b>33</b> which serves as a gate insulating layer, so that the edge of the sidewall insulating layer <b>1101</b> and the edge of the insulating layer <b>33</b> are almost in alignment.</p>

Further, when the insulating film <b>111</b> is nitrided, the surface of the insulating film <b>111</b> is reformed, and moisture can be prevented from being absorbed into the insulating film. When the insulating film <b>111</b> is oxidized, the film becomes stronger, and release of an organic gas can be suppressed. In this embodiment mode, treatment with less plasma damage can be performed by using a high-density plasma apparatus. It is determined which of oxidization treatment and nitridation treatment is performed to the surface of the insulating film <b>111</b> by considering a material of the insulating film and effect as appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0155">The electroluminescent layer <b>112</b> is formed over the first electrode <b>110</b>. Although only one pixel is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, electroluminescent layers for R (red), G (green), and B (blue) are formed in this embodiment mode. In this embodiment mode, as the electroluminescent layer <b>112</b>, materials exhibiting light emission of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) are each formed as selected by an evaporation method using an evaporation mask. The materials exhibiting light emission of red (R), green (G), and blue (B) can be formed by a method of forming as selected with an evaporation method using an evaporation mask, or a droplet discharging method. In the case of a droplet discharging method, there is an advantage that materials of R, G, and B can be individually formed without using a mask. In this embodiment mode, materials exhibiting light emission of R (red), G (green), and B (blue) are each formed by an evaporation method.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0156">Before evaporation of the EL layer, it is preferable to remove moisture and the like by thermal treatment in an atmosphere in which an inert gas is a main component, an oxygen concentration is 5% or less, and a water concentration is 1% or less. In this embodiment mode, thermal treatment is performed at 300&#xb0; C. for one hour.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">Next, a second electrode <b>113</b> is formed using a conductive film over the electroluminescent layer <b>112</b>. The second electrode <b>113</b> may be formed using a material having a low work function (Al, Ag, Li, Ca, or alloy thereof such as MgAg, MgIn, AlLi, CaF<sub>2</sub>, or calcium nitride). Accordingly, a light-emitting element including the first electrode <b>110</b>, the electroluminescent layer <b>112</b>, and the second electrode <b>113</b> is formed.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0158">In the display device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, light from the light-emitting element is transmitted through the films that are formed between the substrate <b>101</b> and the first electrode <b>110</b> and is emitted from the first electrode <b>110</b> side in a direction indicated by an arrow.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0159">It is effective to form a passivation film so as to cover the second electrode <b>113</b>. The passivation film can be formed using an insulating film including silicon nitride, silicon oxide, silicon oxynitride (SiON), silicon nitride oxide (SiNO), aluminum nitride (AlN), aluminum oxynitride (AlON), aluminum nitride oxide (AlNO) containing more nitrogen than oxygen, aluminum oxide, diamond-like carbon (DLC), or nitrogen-containing carbon (CN). The passivation film can have a single layer structure of the insulating film or a stacked-layer structure combining the insulating films. Further, siloxane in which a skeleton structure is formed of bonds of silicon (S) and oxygen (O) may also be used. In siloxane, an organic group containing at least hydrogen (for example, an alkyl group or aromatic hydrocarbon) is used as a substituent. In addition, as a substituent, a fluoro group, or an organic group containing at least hydrogen and a fluoro group may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0160">In this case, a film with favorable coverage is preferably used as the passivation film. A carbon film, in particular, a DLC film is effectively used. Since the DLC film can be formed within a temperature range of room temperature to 100&#xb0; C. or less, the DLC film can be easily formed over the electroluminescent layer <b>112</b> having low heat resistance. The DLC film has a high blocking property with respect to oxygen, and thus, the electroluminescent layer <b>112</b> can be prevented from being oxidized. Accordingly, a problem that the electroluminescent layer <b>112</b> is oxidized during a subsequent sealing step can be prevented.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">Next, the substrate <b>101</b> including the light-emitting element and a sealing substrate are bonded to each other by a sealing material, and the light-emitting element is sealed. Since moisture is prevented from entering from a side-direction by the sealing material, degradation of the light-emitting element can be prevented and reliability of the display device can be improved. A region surrounded by the sealing material may be filled with a filler and may be filled with nitrogen or the like by sealing in a nitrogen atmosphere. Further, the filler can be dripped in a liquid state so as to fill the display device. This embodiment mode employs a bottom emission type, and it is not necessary to use a filler having a light-transmitting property. However, in the case of a structure in which light is extracted through the filler, the filler is needed to be formed by using a material having a light-transmitting property. As an example of the filler, a visible light curable, ultraviolet ray curable, or thermal curable epoxy resin can be given. The display device including the light-emitting element can be completed though the above steps.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">A drying agent is preferably provided in the EL display panel to prevent degradation of the element due to moisture. In this embodiment mode, the drying agent is provided in a concave portion that is formed on the sealing substrate to surround a pixel region, so that a thin shape is achieved. Further, by providing the drying agent also in a region corresponding to a gate wiring layer, a moisture absorbing area can be larger and moisture absorbing effect is enhanced. In addition, since the drying agent is formed over the gate wiring layer which does not emit light itself, light extraction efficiency is not lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">The treatment of sealing the light-emitting element is treatment for protecting the light-emitting element from moisture, and any of a method for mechanically sealing the light-emitting element by a cover material, a method for sealing the light-emitting element by a thermal curable resin or an ultraviolet ray curable resin, and a method for sealing the light-emitting element by a thin film having a high barrier property such as metal oxide or metal nitride is used. As the sealing substrate or the cover material, glass, ceramics, plastic, or metal can be used, and a material which transmits light is needed to be used in the case where light is emitted to a cover material side. The cover material and the substrate including the light-emitting element are attached to each other using a sealing material such as a thermal curable resin or an ultraviolet ray curable resin, and a sealed space is formed by curing the resin using thermal treatment or ultraviolet ray irradiation treatment. It is also effective to provide a moisture absorbing material typified by barium oxide in this sealed space. This moisture absorbing material may be provided on the sealing material, or over the partition wall or in the periphery of the light-emitting element so as not to block light from the light-emitting element. Further, the space between the cover material and the substrate including the light-emitting element can also be filled with a thermal curable resin or an ultraviolet ray curable resin. In this case, it is effective to add a moisture absorbing material typified by barium oxide in the thermal curable resin or the ultraviolet ray curable resin.</p>
