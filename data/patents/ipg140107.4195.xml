<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention generally relates to a display device. More specifically, the present invention relates to a display device, such as a liquid crystal television set or a liquid crystal monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Background Information</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A conventional display device, such as a liquid crystal television set, includes a cabinet and a liquid crystal module (see Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application Publication No. 2009-80229, for example). The liquid crystal module includes a rear frame, a liquid crystal panel, a metal bezel, a backlight and a plurality of fixing components. The liquid crystal module is disposed in the cabinet. The cabinet has a front cabinet and a rear cabinet. The liquid crystal panel is disposed in a front opening of the rear frame. The metal bezel has a substantially L-shaped lateral cross section and covers an outer peripheral edge of the liquid crystal panel. The metal bezel is fastened to an outer peripheral part of the rear frame. The backlight is disposed inside the rear frame. The fixing components have protruding tabs, respectively. The protruding tabs are integrally provided at a specific spacing around the outer peripheral part of the rear frame. The protruding tabs extending outward relative to the outer peripheral part of the rear frame. The fixing components are fastened with screws to bosses that are integrally formed on a rear face of the front cabinet.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">With the conventional display device, the fixing components of the liquid crystal module protrude outside the rear frame. Thus, there is the risk that the fixing components will contact with an assembly machinery or the like while the liquid crystal module is being conveyed in an assembly process, and be bent or broken. Furthermore, this ends up resulting in a lower yield for the liquid crystal module.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Also, the liquid crystal module is thin and does not stand much bending stress. Thus, if the liquid crystal module is subjected to an impact or a heavy load during its conveyance, then the liquid crystal module is deformed or malfunction.</p>

The bosses <b>7</b> of the front cabinet <b>1</b><i>a </i>are inserted through the communicating holes <b>12</b> of the bezel <b>5</b> into the recesses <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>, the upper outer peripheral part <b>3</b>A of the rear frame <b>3</b> is formed with a substantially U-shaped lateral cross section. The rear frame <b>3</b> further has two pairs of slits <b>16</b> that are aligned at a specific spacing from the front plate <b>3</b><i>a </i>to the outer peripheral plate <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the upper outer peripheral part <b>3</b>A. Each of the fixing components <b>6</b> is formed between respective one pair of slits <b>16</b>. The fixing components <b>6</b> are bent in an approximate L shape to form the recesses <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>, each of the fixing components <b>6</b> has a side plate <b>6</b><i>a </i>that extends in a depth direction of the rear frame <b>3</b> (i.e., rearward of the rear frame <b>3</b> relative to the front plate <b>3</b><i>a</i>), and a bottom plate <b>6</b><i>b </i>that is bent outward at a right angle from a rear edge portion of the side plate <b>6</b><i>a</i>. The rear frame <b>3</b> further has a plurality of reinforcing tabs <b>17</b>. The reinforcing tabs <b>17</b> are integrally formed with the rear frame <b>3</b> between the outer edge portions of the bottom plates <b>6</b><i>b </i>and the rear edge portions of the outer peripheral plate <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the rear frame <b>3</b>.

The bezel <b>5</b> is fastened to the outer peripheral parts <b>3</b>A to <b>3</b>D of the rear frame <b>3</b> with screws <b>20</b>, respectively, such that the bezel <b>5</b> covers the outer peripheral edge of the liquid crystal panel <b>4</b>. As a result, the liquid crystal module <b>2</b> is assembled. Then, the liquid crystal module <b>2</b> is grasped, and the bosses <b>7</b> are fitted loosely into the recesses <b>10</b>. Furthermore, the screws <b>8</b> are passed through the screw insertion holes <b>18</b> and the screw insertion holes <b>19</b> and fastened to the bosses <b>7</b>, which fixes the liquid crystal module <b>2</b> to the front cabinet <b>1</b><i>a</i>. Then, the rear cabinet <b>1</b><i>b </i>is attached to the front cabinet <b>1</b><i>a</i>, which forms the display device.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">With the display device, the fixing components <b>6</b> are provided in the recesses <b>10</b> that are provided at a specific spacing to the upper outer peripheral part <b>3</b>A of the rear frame <b>3</b>, and the fixing components <b>6</b> do not stick out beyond the outer peripheral plate <b>3</b><i>b </i>of the rear frame <b>3</b>. Thus, there is no risk that the fixing components <b>6</b> will be bent or broken by contact with the assembly machinery or the like in the course of the liquid crystal module <b>2</b> being conveyed in the assembly process. Therefore, the yield of the liquid crystal module <b>2</b> can be kept high.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Also, the fixing components <b>6</b> and the cell guide linking components <b>14</b> formed integrally on the cell guide <b>13</b> are fastened together on the bosses <b>7</b>. Thus, the liquid crystal module <b>2</b> can be adequately reinforced. Therefore, even if it should be subjected to an impact or a heavy load during its conveyance, there will be no deformation or malfunction of the liquid crystal module <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 5</figref>, the cell guide <b>13</b> further includes a pair of protrusions <b>22</b> protruding integrally from the outer peripheral edges of the cell guide linking components <b>14</b> toward the bezel <b>5</b>, respectively, and the bezel <b>5</b> further includes a pair of bent tabs (e.g., bent portion) <b>23</b> that are bent from the peripheral edge of the communicating holes <b>12</b> to the cell guide <b>13</b>. The protrusions <b>22</b> and the bent tabs <b>23</b> are made to overlap one another. Thus, the gap between the cell guide <b>13</b> and the bezel <b>5</b> can be blocked from the recesses <b>10</b>, and consequently, this prevents noise from penetrating between the cell guide <b>13</b> and the bezel <b>5</b>. Therefore, malfunction of the driver IC or other such electronic device disposed between these can be further prevented.</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">With the above embodiments, the pair of recesses <b>10</b> is formed in the upper outer peripheral part <b>3</b>A of the rear frame <b>3</b>. However, this is not the only option. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the recesses <b>10</b> can also be foimed in the lower outer peripheral part <b>3</b>B and the left and right outer peripheral parts <b>3</b>C and <b>3</b>D of the rear frame <b>3</b>, respectively. In this case, the fixing components <b>6</b> are also formed at corresponding locations to the recesses <b>10</b>, respectively, and are disposed inside the recesses <b>10</b>, respectively. Then, the fixing components <b>6</b> can be fastened with the screws <b>8</b> to the bosses <b>7</b>, which are also foimed at corresponding locations to the recesses <b>10</b>.</p>
