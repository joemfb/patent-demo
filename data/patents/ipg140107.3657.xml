<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An apparatus for providing and detecting information regarding a person, location, or object includes a power supply, a helicoil dipole antenna, a transmitter, a receiver configured to receive signals from remote transmitters at a designated frequency, a computer processor, and a memory device configured to store an identifier associated with the apparatus. Logic instructions embedded on the memory device are configured to compare an identifier decoded from received signals to the identifier associated with the apparatus. When the identifier decoded matches the identifier associated with the apparatus, the instructions decode a return frequency from the signal, and generate return signals. The return signals include the identifier associated with the apparatus, the transmitter is activated only when the transmitter transmits the return signals at the return frequency.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">There are often instances when a person or object cannot be found, such as a missing person or pet; a stolen automobile; and objects lost en route during shipping, among others. This can be especially true if the person or object is located in a building or underground. Additionally, in other situations, it is difficult to identify areas with overcrowding and traffic congestion during large gatherings and events, potentially preventing resources from being deployed where they are needed most for crowd and traffic control. In still other situations, it is difficult to detect and monitor the presence of particular substances or environmental conditions at a given location. Further, some systems for locating persons or objects use devices that are easily detected and removed, thereby thwarting recovery efforts.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Embodiments of systems and methods disclosed herein provide a rapid search and recovery/tracking system for persons and objects. In some embodiments, the system can include a small capsule used as a logistics tag that is hidden in or on a person or objects to track location of the person/object. In some form factors, the capsule is small enough to be ingested by a person, sewn into clothing, or implanted beneath a person's skin. A search platform communicates with the capsule and can include a phased array antenna that uses triangulation to locate the capsule. A unique identifier is associated with the person or object, and included in messages between the capsule and the search platform while the location of the capsule is being determined. The unique identifier associated with the capsule allows the search platform to discern messages from particular capsules from other capsules. A transmitter in the capsule can remain dormant until the capsule receives a message with the correct identifier to reduce the possibility of the capsule being detected electronically and removed. The message may also specify a return frequency to use when transmitting messages from the capsule to the search platform. In other embodiments, one or more capsules can be configured to provide information about an environment. The capsules can include one or more sensor devices, and sensed information can be provided to a search platform or control center. Other features and capabilities are described further with reference to the figures.</p>

<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> depicts a block diagram of an embodiment of capsule <b>108</b> that is suitable for use in system <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The term &#x201c;capsule&#x201d; as used herein may also refer to devices having form factors other than a pill-shape, such as a card, badge, or skin patch. Components used in capsule <b>108</b> may thus be configured to fit in a pill-sized object, an identification card, a skin patch, or other apparatus. A card may be similar to an identification card assigned to individuals, or may be affixed to an article of clothing, pen, computer, pager or personal digital assistant (&#x201c;PDA&#x201d;) or other items routinely worn or carried by an individual. Capsule <b>108</b> can also be small enough to fit in or on disguise packaging such as toothpaste tubes, fake lug nuts, jewelry, screws and other fasteners, rocks, simulated tree bark and plants, animals, insects, birds, building materials, equipment, ordinance, and shipping crates/boxes, among others. Capsule <b>108</b> may be encased in anti-tamper packaging, coatings, or other suitable technique/structure to help prevent reverse engineering and physical dissection. Additionally, encrypted logic may be used for signals between core components of capsule <b>108</b> to protect against reverse engineering and physical probing of active components.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In capsule <b>108</b>, duplexer <b>304</b> receives input signals via antenna <b>118</b> and transmits output signals from amplifier <b>302</b> via antenna <b>118</b>. Duplexer <b>304</b> provides the input signals to input filter <b>306</b>, which in turn provides the filtered signal to low noise amplifier (&#x201c;LNA&#x201d;) <b>308</b>, which outputs an amplified signal. The amplified signal is input to receiver <b>310</b>. In the example shown, receiver <b>310</b> includes a demodulator, a rake filter, and an analog to digital converter (&#x201c;ADC&#x201d;). Other suitable components may be included in receiver <b>310</b> in addition to, or instead of, the components shown. Receiver <b>310</b> provides a digital signal to decrypt and authenticate module <b>314</b>, phased locked loop (&#x201c;PLL&#x201d;) <b>316</b>, and encrypt code register <b>312</b>. Decrypt and authenticate module <b>314</b> receives a decryption code signal from encrypt code register <b>312</b> and sends an authentication signal to controller <b>318</b> and to address register <b>320</b>. Address register <b>320</b> sends a signal to comparator <b>324</b>. Address register <b>318</b> also sends signals to configuration register <b>322</b>. Controller <b>318</b> sends signals to comparator <b>324</b> and can receive signals from status sensors <b>326</b> that provide information regarding the person or object associated with the capsule. Controller <b>318</b> also receives signals from configuration register <b>322</b> and comparator <b>324</b>. The information from configuration register <b>322</b> can include an operating mode, a return data rate, and a return carrier frequency selection. The information from comparator <b>324</b> can indicate whether the information from the capsule has been authenticated, thus allowing the controller <b>318</b> to determine whether to issue signals to code work generator <b>328</b> to load and transmit an output message to the search platform <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">One or more status sensors <b>326</b> may be included in capsule <b>108</b> to provide information regarding the status of the person or object associated with the capsule <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, status sensors <b>326</b> may provide information regarding the missing person's heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, and/or other vital statistics. Other suitable information may be provided by status sensors <b>326</b>. For example, status sensors <b>326</b> can include a microphone to record voice or other sound data that is then transmitted to search platform <b>102</b>. Controller <b>318</b> may be coupled to a memory device that stores the recorded data until the data is transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Controller <b>318</b> may discern additional information using the history of the data provided by status sensors <b>326</b>. For example, if capsule <b>108</b> is removed from one person and implanted or swallowed by another person, controller <b>318</b> may detect the temporary drop in body temperature and/or absence of heart beat. Controller <b>318</b> may provide such information to search platform <b>102</b>, indicating that the capsule <b>108</b> may have been removed from one person and implanted in another, especially if the data resumes more typical readings for a living person. Knowledge of when a capsule <b>108</b> has been transferred to another person or object can facilitate recovery efforts by allowing appropriate resources to be deployed or different recovery tactics to be used.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Controller <b>318</b> sends load enable and transmit enable signals to code word generator <b>328</b>. The load enable and transmit enable signals may be set based on the wake-up threshold at pre-low-noise amplifier (LNA) received in the message from the search platform <b>102</b>. Note that the transmitter Controller <b>318</b> also sends a signal to programmable oscillator <b>332</b>. Code word generator <b>328</b> sends a signal to encryptor <b>330</b>, which sends a timing signal to binary phase shift keying (&#x201c;BPSK&#x201d;) modulator <b>334</b>. Local oscillator <b>338</b> sends a timing signal to programmable oscillator <b>332</b>. PLL <b>316</b> receives signals from local oscillator <b>338</b> and sends timing signals to BPSK modulator <b>334</b>. PLL <b>316</b> generates a signal that has a fixed relation to the phase of a &#x201c;reference&#x201d; signal and may generate stable frequencies, recover a signal from a noisy communication channel, and/or distribute clock timing pulses. Oscillator <b>332</b> sends signals to Coded/BPSK modulator <b>334</b>. Coded/BPSK modulator <b>334</b> can include a turbo coder before the BPSK modulation. Coded/BPSK modulator <b>334</b> sends signals to amplifier <b>302</b>. The timing signals allow coherency to be established for the data signals communicated between capsule <b>108</b> and search platform <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Decrypt and authenticate module <b>314</b> and encryptor <b>330</b> can use any suitable decryption/encryption technology such as private key/public key nonce (used once) and Design Encryption Standard (DES), among others. The size of the code can be based on the expected active life of power supply <b>340</b>, i.e., typically, the shorter the overall operating time, the shorter the encrypt/decrypt code required.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Components in capsule <b>108</b> can be capable of changing receive and transmit frequencies based on a command from the search platform, thereby helping prevent jamming of subsequent transmissions. Additionally, capsule <b>108</b> can generate undersampled downlink carrier signals at data rates that eliminate the requirement for a radio frequency (RF) emitting intermediate frequency stage. Eliminating the intermediate frequency state can help prevent transmissions from capsule <b>108</b> from being detected.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some embodiments, power supply <b>340</b> is activated when MEMS relay switch and/or logic switch <b>342</b> receives a signal from programming station <b>110</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Power supply <b>340</b> provides operating power to components in capsule <b>108</b> and may be implemented with a battery or other self-contained power source. Note that some implementations of capsule <b>108</b> can be ingested, in which case power supply <b>340</b> can be configured to operate over an average time period required to pass through an individual's digestive tract. An ingested or implanted capsule <b>108</b> may further be configured to communicate with search platform <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) even when the associated person or object is underground and/or enclosed in a concrete building. In such situations, power supply <b>340</b> can support 20 milliWatt transmission capable of reaching an aerial search platform <b>102</b> with a 2.3 meter diameter phased array antenna aperture up to 10,000 feet away despite attenuation from a body, concrete, or other potential substances surrounding the capsule <b>108</b>.</p>

Once deployed with a person or object, the capsule may receive one or more messages from the search platform in process <b>404</b>. The capsule matches the address in the message with the address in register <b>320</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) in process <b>404</b>. After matching the address and authenticating the message, capsule <b>108</b> decodes the message for return parameters, such as transmit data rate, operating mode, and return frequency in process <b>406</b>. The capsule transmits a message that includes the address along with other relevant data such as a decoding key, status of the person or object, an indicator of whether the capsule has been removed from the person or object to which it was assigned in process <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> depicts a data structure of an embodiment of an uplink message <b>500</b> transmitted by capsule <b>108</b> to search platform <b>102</b>. The configuration shown protects against false signals and provides unique addresses for up to seventeen billion individuals (or objects). Even when addresses are assigned to seventeen billion individuals, other relevant information such as status of the object or person can also be transmitted. The message can include 64 bits with the first thirty four bits including a unique return address, which is typically the same address associated with capsule <b>108</b>, however other suitable identifiers can be used. A variation of the address may be used to detect error, or manipulation with the system integrity. Each capsule <b>108</b> is typically independently addressable to reduce the number of transmissions required for identification to one. Further, capsules <b>108</b> typically use a unique transmit address to help prevent recording and retransmission past messages or mistaken identification of other capsules <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In the example shown, fourteen bits of message <b>500</b> corresponding to the biological status of the person or object to whom capsule <b>108</b> is assigned.

Cessation of the heartbeat may indicate unauthorized transfer of the capsule. The remaining sixteen bits can include data signal error correction information such as turbo codes and cyclic redundancy check information. Other suitable message lengths and fields of data can be used in message <b>500</b> in addition to or instead of the data fields shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.

In some embodiments, antenna <b>600</b> can be configured to transmit and receive over a broad range of frequencies, for example from 1 GigaHertz (GHz), which is low enough to transmit and receive through human tissue when capsule <b>108</b> is swallowed, to 6 GHz, which is sufficient to provide wide bandwidth for low probability of intercept and low probability of detection operation. For example, for applications where capsule <b>108</b> is ingested or implanted, antenna <b>600</b> can operate at channel frequencies around 1 MegaHertz (MHz) across 70 MHz of bandwidth, yielding a 7% spreading at 1 GHz. In other applications (e.g. surface patch and/or pill), capsule <b>108</b> and antenna <b>600</b> can be configured operate at channel frequencies around 10 MHz across 600 MHz of bandwidth, yielding a 10% spreading at 1 gHz. In further embodiments, capsule <b>108</b> and antenna <b>600</b> can be configured to operate at channel frequencies around 2 MHz across 70 MHz of bandwidth, yielding a 1% spreading at 6 GHz.</p>

The optimum frequency of dipole antenna <b>600</b> is a function of the length of the two transmitting elements <b>604</b>, <b>606</b>. The size of a dipole antenna may be measured by the length of the elements <b>604</b>, <b>606</b>, plus a center distance between elements <b>604</b>, <b>606</b>. The elements <b>604</b>, <b>606</b> of helicoil antennas <b>600</b> are wound in a spiral and are shorter than conventional dipole antennas with straight elements.

The multipath channels through which a radio wave transmits can be viewed as delayed echoes of the original transmitted wave, each with a different magnitude and time-of-arrival at the receiver <b>310</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Each multi-path component contains the original information, so the magnitude, phase shift and time-of-arrival of each component can be computed using channel estimation with channel state estimation.

Similarly, the second decoder <b>824</b> processes the LLRs of the received interleaved bits as well as the LLRs of the received parity bits of the second RSC encoder <b>806</b> to produce better estimates of the source bits as well as extrinsic information. The estimates from the second decoder <b>824</b> are used as a priori information by the first decoder <b>822</b> at the next iteration. Decoding algorithms can be based on the Maximum A-Posteriori algorithm, also known as the BCJR algorithm, the soft output Viterbi algorithm, or other suitable algorithm.</p>

<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In some embodiments, search platform(s) <b>102</b> can be included in one or more airborne platforms, such as aircraft, helicopters, lighter-than air vehicles, spacecraft, and/or satellites. Antenna <b>112</b> can include a phased array radar antenna with an embedded low noise amplifier and power amplifier coupled to receiver <b>906</b> and RF front end <b>918</b> to communicate with capsule <b>108</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). In applications where capsule <b>108</b> is swallowed or the person or object to which a capsule <b>108</b> is assigned is located in a building or underground, antenna <b>112</b> and capsule <b>108</b> can operated at frequencies around 1 (one) GigaHertz (GHz) to overcome attenuation effects of the human body, concrete reinforcing bars, and other substances that may attenuate the signals communicated between capsule <b>108</b> and search platform <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Positioning system interface <b>924</b> can be configured to communicate with a positioning system (not shown), such as a global positioning system (GPS), other type of satellite positioning system, or other source of data capable of indicating the location of search platform <b>102</b> in two or three-dimensional space. For example, search platform <b>102</b> may receive information from an inertial measurement unit (&#x201c;IMU&#x201d;). An IMU works by detecting the current rate of acceleration and changes in rotational attributes, including pitch, roll and yaw. This data is then fed into a guidance computer, such as processor <b>908</b>, which uses the data to calculate the current position. The IMU detects accelerations which are integrated by a guidance computer to deduce the position and velocity of the vehicle. Including an inertial measurement unit can increase the accuracy of the calculation of the location of the capsule <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Receiver/energy level detector <b>906</b> can be a bin receiver that subdivides a wide bandwidth signal into smaller bands or bins. The bins contain regions of signal energy and the receiver <b>906</b> measures the power in the various bins to locate regions of interest that have significant detectable power levels. In some embodiments, the wideband detection bandwidth is converted into a frequency domain snapshot using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in processor <b>908</b>. To focus on a particular narrow band signal of interest, a certain number of adjacent channels can be recombined into a narrowband time domain stream of data that can be further processed.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Filter bank <b>922</b> can sort signals from antenna <b>112</b> into segments of predetermined frequency. An input signal with a certain frequency will fall into a certain filter, and by measuring the output of the filters, the input signal frequency is estimated.</p>

Clock coherency can be used to increase the accuracy of determining the capsule location. In a first alternative, a clock on board the search platform <b>102</b> is designated as the master clock. A clock in capsule <b>108</b> is designated a slave to the master clock. Search platform <b>102</b> also downloads a clock strobe for upload of the return data or signal. The master/slave configuration allows the capsule to upload sixty-four (64) bits of data at one (1) megahertz. In another configuration, capsule <b>108</b> includes a fast PLL <b>316</b> that is constantly adjusted using the signal from local oscillator <b>338</b> to match in phase (and thus lock on) the frequency of a signal received from search platform <b>102</b>.

<p id="p-0066" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flowchart of an embodiment of method <b>1000</b> performed by an airborne search platform <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>). Process <b>1002</b> includes receiving an identifier such as an address associated with a capsule, the capsule being associated with a person, object or location. Process <b>1004</b> can include generating a search pattern to be executed by the search platform to determine the location of the capsule. In some embodiments, the location of the capsule may be fixed and known, in which case search platform <b>102</b> may execute a flight pattern over one or more capsules to receive relevant information from the capsule(s). Process <b>1006</b> can include generating and transmitting a message that includes the identifier while executing the search pattern. Some or all of the capsules in the area of the search platform may receive the signal and decode the identifier. When the identifier matches a particular capsule's own identifier, the capsule may respond with a message that supplies information relevant to the purpose of the capsule. For example, the message may include health status of a person or object to whom the capsule is assigned, and/or other information regarding the person/object and/or the environment surrounding the location of the capsule. The information may include alphanumeric data, voice data, video data, as well as any other suitable data in any suitable format that may be provided by the capsule. Process <b>1008</b> can include receiving and decoding the message signals from the capsule(s). The messages include the identifier of the capsule so the data in the message may be correlated with the person/object and/or location of the capsule.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0075">Process <b>1010</b> can include adjusting the search pattern according to the direction or angles from which the signals are received, as required. In some embodiments, after sufficient signals are received, the location of the person or object can be determined and provided to recovery crews, and/or information regarding the location of the capsule may be provided in process <b>1012</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0076"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows an embodiment of a data structure for messages <b>1100</b> transmitted by a search platform <b>102</b> to a capsule <b>108</b>. In the example shown, the signal includes one-hundred and four (104) bits of information, although other embodiments of message <b>1100</b> can include more or fewer bits. Fourteen (14) bits can be allocated to a wake up signal. The transmitter of the capsule may remain in a deactivated state to reduce probability of detection until these specific fourteen bits (14) are received in this location in the signal. The wake up bits can be used to allow the transmitter to become active when the capsule is ready to transmit a message.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0077">Message <b>1100</b> can further include an encryption code of thirty-two (32) bits. The encryption code may act as a key, enabling the capsule to decode the remaining information in message <b>1100</b> using public key/private key, DES, and/or other suitable security coding techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0078">Message <b>1100</b> can further include an 8-bit configuration code, with two bits used to indicate operation mode, two bits to indicate return data rate, and four bits to indicate a carrier frequency to be used to transmit return messages. For example, two bits representing the operation mode may be set as follows: normal operation (00), load forward address (01), load return address (10), or test (11).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0079">The return data rate can indicate the amount of data transferred in a given time via the return message(s). In the example shown, four different data rates may be specified including 10 kilo bytes per second (kbps) (00), 100 Kbps (01), 1 Mega bytes per second (Mbps) (10), and 10 Mbps (11). Other data rates may be specified in addition to or instead of the preceding examples.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0080">The return carrier frequency can specify the frequency at which return messages from capsule <b>108</b> are transmitted. In the example shown, 4 bits can be used to specify 16 different frequencies. The frequency selected can be based on the availability of frequencies that do not interfere with AM broadcasts, FM broadcast, television broadcast, aeronautical navigational aids, mobile phones, etc. One spectrum with the least interference is between 950 and 1100 MHz, but transmissions from capsule <b>108</b> can be frequency agile to avoid interference. For example, the return frequency can be specified as any distinct frequency between 950 and 1100 MHz in 10 MHz increments. Other suitable frequencies and increments between frequencies can be specified. Note also that a fixed return frequency can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0081">The forward address can be specified using 34 bits to provide 2<sup>34 </sup>or 17,179,869,184 distinct addresses. Thus, search platform <b>102</b> can distinguish between and communicate with over 17 billion capsules. Any other suitable number of bits can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0082">Message <b>1100</b> can further include a field for Error Detection and Correction codes (EDAC), and other data accuracy/error correction information. The example shown includes sixteen (16) bits that can be used to specify a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) polynomial (e.g., x<sup>16</sup>+x<sup>12</sup>+x<sup>5</sup>+1). Other suitable error correction/check technique can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0083">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, an embodiment of an antenna scan pattern <b>1202</b> and an aircraft search pattern <b>1204</b> to determine the location of a person or object using an airborne search platform <b>102</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>9</b>) is shown. A planar-array antenna <b>112</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>) can sweep a series of beams through a suitable scan pattern, such as left to right, back to forward, with overlapping beams. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, circular beam patterns <b>1300</b> can overlap by approximately 20% with beam patterns <b>1300</b> staggered horizontally by 50% to achieve full coverage of the area being scanned. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows circular beams <b>1400</b> overlapping 38% to compensate for uncertainties and errors in the antenna performance and signals received from capsule <b>108</b>. Other overlap percentages can be used depending on accuracy required and component performance.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0084">As antenna <b>112</b> sweeps the scan pattern, antenna <b>112</b> periodically transmits messages, such as message <b>1100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). The vehicle carrying the search platform <b>102</b> executes a search pattern <b>1204</b> through the area or region being scanned. If a capsule <b>108</b> with a matching address receives a message from platform <b>102</b>, capsule <b>108</b> can transmit a return message, such as message <b>500</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), to search platform <b>102</b>. The process of sending messages from the search platform <b>102</b> can be referred to as &#x201c;pinging&#x201d; the capsule <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0085">Upon receipt of a return message from capsule <b>108</b>, the aircraft carrying search platform <b>102</b> can alter search pattern <b>1204</b> toward the direction from which the return message was detected, as determined by antenna <b>112</b> and processor <b>908</b>. For example, if search platform <b>102</b> detects a return message from starboard side, the aircraft can alter its search pattern <b>1204</b> by turning toward the direction from which the return message was detected. If the message is received from the right-hand side, the aircraft turns to the right; if the signal was received from the left-hand side the aircraft can turn to the left. Any suitably shaped search pattern can be used, such as a series of eight straight paths connected by 45 degree turns to create an octagon around the capsule <b>108</b>. The shape and size of the search pattern can vary as required.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0086">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the dipole antenna <b>118</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>3</b>) in capsule <b>108</b> can have a region of blocked transmission <b>1502</b>, such as described and shown for angles less than 30 degrees in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. As the aircraft is executing the search pattern <b>1204</b>, the search platform <b>102</b> will not receive messages (represented by arrows <b>1504</b> radiating from capsule <b>108</b>) when search platform <b>102</b> is positioned plus or minus 30 degrees with respect to the elements of antenna <b>118</b>. Search platform <b>102</b> can ping capsule <b>108</b> repeatedly as the search pattern <b>1204</b> is executed. For example, search platform <b>102</b> can ping capsule <b>108</b> until it receives approximately a sufficient number of return messages are successfully received around some or all of search pattern <b>1204</b>. In some embodiments, search platform <b>102</b> uses Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) techniques to determine the location of capsule <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows a graph of antenna aperture diameter versus altitude and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> shows a graph of coverage area rate versus altitude. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, antenna diameter varies approximately exponentially from 225 centimeters at an altitude of 10000 feet to an antenna diameter of approximately 10 centimeters at 500 feet altitude. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, data for an aircraft traveling at 280 miles per hour is shown with coverage area rate varying exponentially from 2750 square kilometers per hour at an altitude of 10000 feet to 15 square kilometers per hour at 625 feet altitude. Coverage area rate is generally linearly proportional to speed of the aircraft.</p>

<p id="p-0084" num="0092">The data in Table 2 assumes a forward angled sweep pattern for TDOA determination while sweeping maximum ground footprint (from 45 degrees left to 45 degrees right, 45 degrees back to 45 degrees forward). The following example determines the number of capsules <b>108</b> that can be searched for a given configuration of search platform <b>102</b> and capsule <b>108</b>. Assume the antenna Sweep Period is Beamwidth (radians)&#xd7;(Altitude/Cos &#x3b1;)/(AC forward velocity), where &#x3b1; is the angle between the vertical axis of the aircraft and the antenna beam. Sweep Distance is 2&#xd7;Altitude. Sweep Rate is Sweep Distance/Sweep Period. Further assume aircraft speed is 280 mph (125.2 meters/second). Altitude is 10000 feet (3.048 Km); &#x3b2; is 45&#xb0;, where &#x3b2; is the angle between rightmost and/or leftmost to the nadir; Line (row) Sweep Dist is 6.1 km. Required Sweep Period is 3.67 seconds. Number of sweeps between +/&#x2212;45&#xb0; window is 13 (with 38.5% overlap). Pulse Repetition Frequency is 35 microseconds for speed of light. Assume 10 microseconds capsule turn around delay and 10 microseconds search platform processing delay. Data transfer delay for ping message size of 104 bits/10 Mbps is 10.4 microseconds. Data transfer delay for return message is 64 bits/100 kbps=640 microseconds. One pulse cycle=35+10+10+10+640=705 microseconds. Time to sweep beam across 13 rows&#xd7;705 microseconds=9,165 microseconds. Time to sweep beam across region (13 rows&#xd7;13 columns) is 9,165&#xd7;13 sweeps=119,145 microseconds. Margin at 280 mph=30.8&#xd7;, which is sufficient to search for 30 targets in a search region of 36 square kilometers. The Margin is typically the received signal signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) minus the required SINR=7.0 dB.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0093">In some embodiments, two airborne search platforms <b>102</b> may be used to improve the speed and accuracy of locating capsule(s) <b>108</b>. For example, two aircraft in communication with a capsule <b>108</b> can exchange and synchronize their respective altitudes, attitudes and Time Difference of Arrival signals. Using two airborne search platforms <b>102</b> instead of one may provide a more accurate location of a capsule depending on the location of the capsule(s) with respect to the two search platforms <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0094">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, a diagram of another embodiment of a system <b>1800</b> for locating one or more capsules <b>108</b> is shown with search platforms <b>102</b> implemented in satellites <b>1804</b>. For example, search platforms <b>102</b> can be implemented in the Iridium satellite constellation to locate/track people or objects carrying capsules <b>108</b>. An Iridium satellite with a 2 square meter aperture can typically determine the location of capsule <b>108</b> within 4 meters of circular error probability (CEP) once the Iridium has rotated 90 degrees about the capsule <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, capsules <b>108</b> may remain stationary and communicate information regarding the environment or other relevant information to search platforms <b>102</b> in satellites <b>1804</b>. Satellites <b>1804</b> and/or search platforms <b>102</b> can forward the information from capsules <b>108</b> to a ground station <b>1806</b> or other suitable facility for designated uses, such as search and rescue efforts, tracking people or objects, environmental monitoring, etc. Note that satellites <b>1804</b> may already include some of the components in search platform <b>102</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Accordingly, fewer components may be required in search platform <b>102</b> if the satellite <b>1804</b> already includes functionally equivalent components. System <b>1800</b> provides capability for finding and tracking people or objects carrying capsules <b>108</b> in any area of the world covered by satellites <b>1804</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0095">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, a diagram of another embodiment of a system <b>1900</b> for locating one or more capsules <b>108</b> is shown with search platforms <b>102</b> implemented in ground towers <b>1902</b> and/or aerostatic vehicles <b>1904</b>. Aerostatic vehicles <b>1904</b> may be dirigibles or other suitable lighter-than-air objects. Vehicles <b>1904</b> may be connected via tethers <b>1906</b> to ground hubs <b>1908</b> or other suitable location. Ground towers <b>1902</b> can be coupled to ground hubs <b>1908</b>, and ground hubs <b>1908</b> can be coupled to a control center <b>1910</b> via wired communication links <b>1912</b>. Tethers <b>1906</b> can include communication lines to transfer data between vehicles <b>1904</b>. Alternatively, wireless communication may be used between ground towers <b>1902</b>, vehicles <b>1904</b>, ground hubs <b>1908</b>, and control center <b>1910</b>. Ground hubs <b>1908</b> can be included in system <b>1900</b> when wired communication links <b>1912</b> are used, however in wireless implementations or if only one vehicle <b>1904</b> and/or tower <b>1902</b> are used, ground towers <b>1902</b> and vehicles <b>1904</b> may communicate directly with control center <b>1910</b>. System <b>1900</b> provides capability for monitoring people or objects carrying capsules <b>108</b> in a particular region covered by vehicles <b>1904</b> and ground towers <b>1902</b>. System <b>1900</b> is thus useful for determining when overcrowding or congestion occurs in crowds of people as well as vehicular traffic. System <b>1900</b> also allows the location of one or more people or objects in a crowd to be determined.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0096">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>, a diagram of an embodiment of a system <b>2000</b> for collecting data from one or more stationary capsules <b>108</b> is shown with search platforms <b>102</b> implemented in an airborne vehicle <b>2002</b>, such as an airplane, helicopter, satellite, or other spacecraft. Airborne vehicle <b>2002</b> can be programmed with knowledge of the location and address of capsules <b>108</b> to thereby gather data from specific locations without requiring address information from control station <b>2006</b>. Note that a ground-based tower or other platform can be used to host the search platform <b>102</b> in addition to or instead of airborne vehicle <b>2002</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0097">One or more capsules <b>108</b> may also be placed in a location, either overtly or covertly, to provide alphanumeric, audio, and/or video data from the location. Airborne vehicle <b>2002</b> can send a series of ping messages <b>1100</b> as it flies over capsule(s) <b>108</b>. The ping message may indicate the type of data that is requested as well as a return frequency, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0098">Capsule <b>108</b> can be configured to detect the presence and even the quantity of one or more substances at the location. For example, capsule <b>108</b> may be configured to detect and transmit the presence of water or another substance at surface or underground levels. When a group of capsules <b>108</b> are present, data can be correlated between capsules <b>108</b> to detect movement of a substance or direction of other changes in the environment. Capsules <b>108</b> can thus be used to detect the movement of ground water as well as substances in ground water, for example. Note that when capsules <b>108</b> are placed in three-dimensional space, whether above or below ground, a three-dimensional image or model may be created of the presence and movement of one or more substances.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0099">The term &#x201c;location&#x201d; unless specified otherwise, refers to a the singular or plural, including a linear or curvilinear group of locations, an area or a volume, as in a ground area including the beneath-ground volume associated therewith. In an example, &#x201c;location&#x201d; may refer to a location-within-a-location including a location within a predetermined curvilinear path or a location within a known or predetermined area of the earth's surface. In another example, &#x201c;location&#x201d; as used herein may also be interpreted to mean a predetermined area of the earth's surface and a pre-determined distance below the earth's surface. Thus, &#x201c;location&#x201d; may also be interpreted to mean a known location or set of locations within a three-dimensional volume.</p>
