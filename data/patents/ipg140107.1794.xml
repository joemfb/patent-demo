<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates generally to surgically implanted physiological shunt systems and related flow control devices. More particularly, the present invention relates to a position indicator and adjustment tool for such shunt systems having variable pressure settings for the one-way flow control valves controlling the flow of Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) out of a brain ventricle and preventing backflow of fluid into the brain ventricle.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A typical adult has a total of about 120-150 cc of CSF with about 40 cc in ventricles in the brain. A typical adult also produces about 400-500 cc/day of CSF, all of which is reabsorbed into the blood stream on a continuous basis.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Sometimes, the brain produces excess CSF. One common cause of the excess production of CSF is hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is a condition of excessive accumulation of CSF in the ventricles or brain tissue. Hydrocephalus can result from genetic conditions or from trauma to the brain.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Excessive accumulation of CSF, due to hydrocephalus or other causes, manifests itself as increased pressure within the brain. Whatever the cause, over time, this increased CSF pressure causes damage to the brain tissue. It has been found that relieving the CSF pressure is therapeutically beneficial. This is usually done by draining CSF from the ventricles.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Patients with hydrocephalus often continue to produce excess CSF, at least over some time period. Therefore, it is often desirable to continuously drain excess CSF to maintain normal CSF pressure in the brain. Excessive CSF accumulated in the ventricles of the brain is typically drained away from the brain using a shunt system.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Where hydrocephalus is a chronic condition, the shunt system typically drains the CSF into the patient's peritoneal cavity or into the patient's vascular system. Such shunt systems typically have a catheter implanted in the ventricle of the brain. The catheter is connected to a fluid control device which is in turn connected to a catheter which empties in to the patient's peritoneal cavity or into the patient's vascular system.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An example of a fluid control device is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,637,083 issued to William J. Bertrand and David A. Watson on Jun. 10, 1997 entitled &#x201c;Implantable Adjustable Fluid Flow Control Valve&#x201d;, the teaching of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The valve of the '083 patent is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref> generally labeled <b>10</b> (<b>20</b>). (Reference numbers in parentheses correspond to the reference numbers in the '083 patent. After the corresponding reference number to the '083 patent has been given once, no further reference to the '083 will be given although the connection to the '083 patent is intended to be implied throughout this description.) The valve <b>10</b> includes a an inlet connector <b>12</b> (<b>22</b>) and an outlet connector <b>14</b> (<b>24</b>). A elastomeric casing <b>16</b> (<b>30</b>) covers the inner workings of the valve <b>10</b>. A dome <b>18</b> (<b>60</b>) extends upward from the elastomeric casing <b>16</b>. Fluid flows through the valve <b>10</b> in the direction indicated by the arrow &#x201c;A&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Valve <b>10</b> includes a mechanism to control fluid flow through the valve <b>10</b>. The mechanism includes a magnet <b>20</b> (<b>120</b>) embedded within a base <b>22</b> (<b>122</b>). Rotating the base <b>22</b> changes the internal configuration of the mechanism. Changing the internal configuration of the mechanism produces a variety of pressure or flow characteristics for the valve. The base <b>22</b> may be rotated by magnetically coupling an external magnet <b>24</b> (<b>140</b>) to the valve's magnet <b>20</b> and rotating the external magnet <b>24</b>. Because magnet <b>20</b> is coupled to the external magnet <b>24</b>, when magnet <b>24</b> rotates, magnet <b>20</b> also rotates. As magnet <b>20</b> rotates, base <b>22</b> rotates and the internal configuration of the mechanism changes as described in detail in the '083 patent. As the internal configuration of the valve <b>10</b> changes, the pressure/flow characteristics of the valve <b>10</b> change.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In use, the valve <b>10</b> is subcutaneously placed on the patient's skull. The catheter going to the patient's ventricle in attached to inlet connector <b>12</b>. The catheter going to the patient's peritoneal cavity or vascular system is attached to outlet connector <b>14</b>. In this way, a direction of flow is established from the inlet connector <b>12</b> through the valve <b>10</b> to the outlet connector <b>14</b>. As stated above and described in detail in the '083 patent, changing the internal configuration of the mechanism by coupling the external magnet to the internal magnet and rotating the base produces a variety of pressure or flow characteristics through the valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A problem with current adjustable valves, such as the one described in the '083 patent is that once implanted, it is difficult to determine the setting of the valve. Further, it is difficult to adjust the setting of the valve. With some adjustable valves, x-ray images are used to determine the current state or post adjustment state of the valve.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Tools for determining and adjusting the setting of an adjustable valve are disclosed. These tools allow a medical professional to locate and non-invasively determine the setting of an implanted valve. After the valve has been located and the setting of the valve determined, the valve may be re-adjusted non-invasively.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">There are three tools: a locator tool, an indicator tool and an adjustment tool. The locator tool allows the physician to locate the adjustable valve of interest and align the locator tool with a specific orientation of the valve. The indicator tool indicates the current setting of the adjustable valve and confirms new settings of the valve after the new settings have been implemented. The adjustment tool interacts magnetically with the implanted adjustable valve to couple with a movable internal element to change the setting of the valve. The indicator tool and the adjustment tool physically cooperate with the locator tool to accomplish the respective functions of the tools.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In this invention a hand held indicator tool allows instant determination of the device setting with no requirement for using x-rays. This is accomplished in the present invention by providing a locator tool with an opening that allows tactile determination of the implanted valve's position and orientation. In the preferred embodiment, the indicator tool in this invention is keyed to the locator tool so that it can only be inserted in a correct orientation with respect to the locator tool that has previously been aligned with the valve. The &#x201c;keyed&#x201d; relationship minimizes the possibility of erroneous readings of the valve setting.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the current invention, the adjuster tool is inserted into the locator tool. The adjustment tool couples an external magnetic field to the magnet of the valve to switch the valve through a variety of pressure/flow characteristics. The adjuster tool rotates through a series of &#x201c;detents&#x201d; corresponding with setting positions on the valve. As the adjuster tool rotates, the user feels a click when the adjuster tool is aligned with a position of the valve as a positive tactile indication the user that a setting position has been reached. In the current invention, mechanical stops in the tool mirror mechanical stops inside the implanted valve at the range limit of rotating base of the valve. This helps prevent the user from improperly adjusting the valve.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the description of the invention herein and more particularly with reference to the drawings and the following detailed description. Throughout this disclosure, like elements, wherever named, are referred to with like reference numbers.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The invention comprises three tools, a locator tool <b>26</b>, an indicator tool <b>28</b> and an adjustment tool <b>30</b>. Although these tools are intended to be used cooperatively in a sequential way, it is clear and within the scope of the invention that they may also be used individually are in paired relationships as will be explained hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The locator tool is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-7</figref> generally labeled <b>26</b>. Locator tool <b>26</b> allows the physician to locate the adjustable valve <b>10</b> of interest and align the locator tool <b>26</b> with a specific orientation of the valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Locator tool <b>26</b> has a substantially planar deck <b>32</b> and a substantially cylindrical tube <b>34</b>. The outer edge <b>36</b> of deck <b>32</b> is attached to the inner surface <b>38</b> of tube <b>34</b>. Tube <b>34</b> has in inner diameter &#x201c;D&#x201d;. Tube <b>34</b> has an upper surface <b>40</b>. Deck <b>32</b> has a locator central axis <b>42</b>. Deck <b>32</b> has a locator central opening <b>44</b> extending entirely therethrough. In the preferred embodiment, locator central axis <b>42</b> extends through a portion of locator central opening <b>44</b>. In addition, locator central opening <b>44</b> has a shape as will be described below such that it allows an orientation to be ascribed to it. Deck <b>32</b> also has an arrow <b>46</b> or other means for pointing out the preferred direction of orientation of the locator tool <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Tube <b>34</b> preferably has a slot <b>48</b> on its inner surface <b>38</b> that extends into the material of tube <b>34</b> from the upper surface <b>40</b> downward at substantially a right angle to the plane of deck <b>32</b>. Slot <b>48</b> is intended to interact with the indicator tool <b>28</b> as will be described hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the preferred embodiment, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, tube <b>34</b> has a tab <b>50</b> that extends as part of &#x201c;wall&#x201d; of tube <b>34</b>. Tab <b>50</b> is formed between two side slots <b>52</b> and a bottom slot <b>54</b> that extend entirely through the material of tube <b>34</b>. Tab <b>50</b> preferably extends along tube <b>34</b> in a direction substantially perpendicular to the plane of deck <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A protrusion <b>56</b> extends inwardly from the bottom of tab <b>50</b> into the central portion of tube <b>34</b>. Because tab <b>50</b> is attached to the main body of tube <b>34</b> only at its upper dimension, tab <b>50</b> is biased to remain positioned within the dimensions of the &#x201c;wall&#x201d; of tube <b>34</b>. If protrusion <b>56</b> is pushed outwardly, for example with contact with the adjustment tool <b>30</b> as will be explained hereafter, tab <b>50</b> is biased to resist such displacement and to tend to move itself and protrusion <b>56</b> back to their original unstressed position.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an alternate embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>, the upper surface <b>40</b> of tube <b>34</b> has a series of indentations <b>58</b> located at certain locations around the upper surface <b>40</b>. The purpose of these indentations <b>58</b> will be explained in more detail hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An index <b>59</b> may be placed on the upper surface <b>40</b> of tube <b>34</b>. Index <b>59</b> visually indicates the settings of valve <b>10</b> when locator tool <b>26</b> is correctly oriented with valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In many adjustable valves, such as the valve <b>10</b> shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,637,083, the dome <b>18</b> of the valve <b>10</b> has a direction of orientation. For example, in the valve <b>10</b> shown in the '083 patent, the width &#x201c;W&#x201d; of the dome <b>18</b> is narrower transverse to the direction of fluid flow &#x201c;A&#x201d; than is the length &#x201c;L&#x201d; of the dome <b>18</b> along the direction of fluid flow &#x201c;A&#x201d; as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-3</figref>. This difference in dimensions allows the dome <b>18</b> itself to have a direction of orientation. In this case, the elongated dimension of the dome <b>18</b> is aligned with the direction of fluid flow &#x201c;A&#x201d; through the valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In use, the valve <b>10</b> is implanted under the patient's skin on the skull. The skin around the skull is relatively thin. Thus, the physician can palpate the valve <b>10</b> through the skin. By feeling the dome <b>18</b> and other physical characteristics of the valve <b>10</b>, the physician can identify the orientation of the dome <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Locator central opening <b>44</b> is slightly larger than and essentially the same shape as the dome <b>18</b> on the adjustable valve <b>10</b>. As a result, locator central opening <b>44</b> also has a direction of orientation that will correspond to the orientation of the dome <b>18</b>. Once the physician has palpated the dome <b>18</b> of the implanted valve <b>10</b> and determined its orientation, he sets the locator tool <b>26</b> over the dome <b>18</b>. The dome <b>18</b> will extend into the locator central opening <b>44</b>. Because the dome <b>18</b> and the locator central opening <b>44</b> have similar shape, by rotating the deck <b>32</b> about the locator central axis <b>42</b>, the physician will eventually bring the dome <b>18</b> and the locator central opening <b>44</b> into alignment. This will occur where the clearance between the locator central opening <b>44</b> and the dome <b>18</b> is minimized. When this alignment occurs, the locator tool <b>26</b> will be aligned with the valve <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). In this position, the arrow <b>46</b> will point in the direction of fluid flow through the valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">As described, in the preferred embodiment, the locator central opening <b>44</b> has a similar shape to the dome <b>18</b>. In particular, the locator central opening <b>44</b> has an elongated shape that corresponds to the shape of the dome <b>18</b>. Although this is the preferred shape of locator central opening <b>44</b>, other shapes may also be used. For example, if dome <b>18</b> has a different shape, cylindrical, circular, spherical, slot-shaped, diamond, triangular, rectangular or irregular, to name but a few of the many possible choices that will occur to those skilled in the art, locator central opening <b>44</b> would also have a corresponding shape. The key here is to have a shape for the locator central opening <b>44</b> that allows the locator tool <b>26</b> to be oriented to and aligned with the valve <b>10</b> in a precise predictable manner. Additionally, in the preferred embodiment, locator central opening <b>44</b> should allow the physician to palpate the implanted valve <b>10</b> through the locator central opening <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The indicator tool is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-13</figref> generally labeled <b>28</b>. The indicator tool <b>28</b> indicates the current setting of the adjustable valve <b>10</b> and confirms new settings of the valve <b>10</b> after the new settings have been implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Indicator tool <b>28</b> has two main parts: an indicator central body <b>60</b> and a compass <b>62</b>. Indicator central indicator central body <b>60</b> has an annular portion <b>64</b>. Annular portion <b>64</b>, in the preferred embodiment, is cylindrical with an outer diameter &#x201c;E&#x201d; that is slightly less than the inner diameter &#x201c;D&#x201d; of tube <b>34</b>. An indicator lip <b>66</b> extends outward from the upper surface <b>68</b> of indicator central body <b>60</b>. The outer diameter &#x201c;T&#x201d; of indicator lip <b>66</b> is larger than the inner diameter &#x201c;D&#x201d; of tube <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In the preferred embodiment corresponding to the embodiment of the locator tool <b>26</b> having a slot <b>48</b> on the inner surface <b>38</b> of tube <b>34</b>, central body <b>60</b> has a ridge <b>70</b> extending outward from its outer surface <b>72</b>. Ridge <b>70</b> extends upward from the bottom <b>74</b> of the central body <b>60</b> at substantially a right angle to indicator lip <b>66</b>. Ridge <b>70</b> is dimensioned to slide into slot <b>48</b> so that the interaction between slot <b>48</b> and ridge <b>70</b> will keep central body <b>60</b> from rotating with respect to the locator tool <b>26</b> in use as will be described hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In an embodiment corresponding to the embodiment of the locator tool <b>26</b> having indentations <b>58</b> described above, protrusions <b>76</b> extend downward from the underside <b>78</b> of lip <b>56</b>. These protrusions <b>76</b> are positioned to correspond to the indentations <b>58</b> on the upper surface <b>40</b> of tube <b>34</b>. In this way, when indicator tool <b>28</b> is used with locator tool <b>26</b> and the protrusions <b>76</b> are aligned with the indentations <b>58</b>, indicator tool <b>28</b> is precisely oriented with locator tool <b>26</b> and central body <b>60</b> is inhibited from rotating with respect to locator tool <b>26</b> as will be described hereafter.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Indicator central body <b>60</b> has a indicator central opening <b>80</b> extending around a indicator central axis <b>82</b>. A compass <b>62</b> is fixed in place in indicator central opening <b>80</b>. Compass <b>62</b> has a magnetized pointer <b>84</b> that rotates around a spindle <b>86</b> so that pointer <b>84</b> may align itself with magnetic fields it encounters.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Although the preferred embodiment has compass <b>62</b> fixed in central opening <b>80</b>, in another embodiment, indicator central body <b>60</b> has no central opening. In this embodiment, compass <b>62</b> may be attached directly to indicator central body <b>60</b> by means such as adhesives as will be clear to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">An index <b>88</b> is affixed to the upper surface <b>68</b> of indicator central body <b>60</b> around compass <b>62</b>. Index <b>88</b> indicates the possible positions of the mechanism of the adjustable valve <b>10</b> corresponding to the different settings of the valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In use, after the orientation of the valve <b>10</b> has been established by locator tool <b>26</b> as described above, the indicator central body <b>60</b> of indicator tool <b>28</b> is placed within tube <b>34</b> of locator tool <b>26</b>. Because the outer diameter &#x201c;E&#x201d; of the annular portion <b>64</b> of the indicator central body <b>60</b> is slightly smaller than and is conformal to the inner diameter of tube <b>34</b>, indicator central body <b>60</b> should pass into tube <b>34</b> until lip <b>56</b> contacts and rests upon the upper surface <b>40</b> of tube <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the preferred embodiment, ridge <b>70</b> will align with and interact with slot <b>48</b> to precisely orient indicator tool <b>28</b> with locator tool <b>26</b>. In the alternate embodiment, indicator lip <b>66</b> is rotated until protrusions <b>76</b> are in contact with the indentations <b>58</b> in locator tool <b>26</b>. In either configuration, locator tool <b>26</b> and indicator tool <b>28</b> are aligned and oriented with respect to the preferred orientation of valve <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>). Pointer <b>84</b> will then interact with the magnet <b>20</b> of valve <b>10</b> so that pointer <b>84</b> will align itself with the magnet <b>20</b> of valve <b>10</b>. This will cause pointer <b>84</b> to point to a spot on index <b>88</b>. Where the pointer <b>84</b> points to on index <b>88</b> indicates the position of the magnet <b>20</b> of the valve <b>10</b>. The position of the magnet <b>20</b> indicates the setting of the valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The adjustment tool is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref> generally labeled <b>30</b>. The adjustment tool <b>30</b> interacts magnetically with the implanted adjustable valve <b>10</b> to couple with the magnet <b>20</b> fixed to a movable internal element in valve <b>10</b> to change the setting of the valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Adjustment tool <b>30</b> has two main parts: an adjustment central body <b>90</b> and a magnet <b>92</b>. Magnet <b>92</b> performs the function of the external magnet <b>24</b> described above. Adjustment central body <b>90</b> has an adjustment annular portion <b>94</b> made up of an outer wall <b>96</b>, an inner wall <b>98</b> and an upper wall <b>100</b>. Adjustment annular portion <b>94</b> has an annular open area <b>102</b> between outer wall <b>96</b> and inner wall <b>98</b> and opposite upper wall <b>100</b>. In the preferred embodiment, outer wall <b>96</b> is cylindrical with an outer diameter &#x201c;G&#x201d; that is slightly less than the inner diameter &#x201c;D&#x201d; of tube <b>34</b>. An adjustment lip <b>104</b> extends outward from the upper edge <b>106</b> of adjustment central body <b>90</b>. The outer diameter &#x201c;H&#x201d; of adjustment lip <b>104</b> is larger than the inner diameter &#x201c;D&#x201d; of tube <b>34</b>. In the preferred embodiment, adjustment lip <b>104</b> is made of a clear material so that index <b>59</b> may be viewed through adjustment lip <b>104</b> when adjustment tool <b>30</b> is in place on locator tool <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Adjustment central body <b>90</b> has a series of indentations <b>108</b> near its bottom <b>110</b>. These indentations <b>108</b> are located a distance from adjustment lip <b>104</b> and configured so that the indentations <b>108</b> will interact with protrusion <b>56</b> on tab <b>50</b> when adjustment tool <b>30</b> is mated to locator tool <b>26</b> as described below. Indentations <b>108</b> are spaced around the periphery of adjustment central body <b>90</b> corresponding to the location of the settings of the valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Magnet <b>92</b> is fixed in place in within adjustment central body <b>90</b>. Magnet <b>92</b> has a north pole N and a south pole S aligned along an axis &#x201c;J&#x201d; of adjustment central body <b>90</b>. Axis J is aligned with a direction indicator which is preferentially in the form of an arrow <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In use, the orientation of the valve <b>10</b> is first established by locator tool <b>26</b> and indicator tool <b>28</b> as described above. Then, the adjustment tool <b>30</b> is used, as necessary or as desired, to change the position of the magnet <b>20</b> and consequently the setting of the valve <b>10</b>. This is done by first removing indicator tool <b>28</b> from locator tool <b>26</b>. Then, adjustment tool <b>30</b> is positioned above locator tool <b>26</b> with the arrow <b>112</b> aligned with the pressure level setting on index <b>59</b> determined by the indicator tool <b>28</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). Maintaining this alignment, the adjustment tool <b>30</b> is lowered toward the locator tool <b>26</b> until the adjustment central body <b>90</b> enters tube <b>34</b> and adjustment lip <b>104</b> contacts the upper surface <b>26</b> of tube <b>34</b>. At this time, protrusion <b>56</b> should interact with one of the indentations <b>108</b> on adjustment central body <b>90</b> that corresponds to the current setting of the valve <b>10</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In this position, magnet <b>92</b> couples with magnet <b>20</b> in valve <b>10</b>. Adjustment central body <b>90</b> is then rotated so that the arrow <b>112</b> points to the desired setting of valve <b>10</b> indicated on index <b>59</b>. Because magnet <b>20</b> is magnetically coupled to magnet <b>92</b>, as magnet <b>92</b> rotates with adjustment central body <b>90</b>, magnet <b>20</b> will also rotate and thereby move to the desired setting of valve <b>10</b>. As central body <b>90</b> rotates, protrusion <b>56</b> will be moved out of contact with the indentation <b>108</b> corresponding to the last setting of the valve and move against the outer surface outer wall <b>96</b> of central body <b>90</b>. When magnet <b>92</b> has moved to the next setting of the valve <b>10</b>, protrusion <b>56</b> should contact the next indentation <b>108</b> corresponding to the next setting of the valve <b>10</b>. The user should feel the protrusion <b>56</b> moving into or out of this indentation <b>108</b>. In this way, the user has tactile confirmation that the adjustment tool <b>30</b> has moved to and is aligned with a new valve setting. This process may be repeated as desired until the adjustment tool <b>30</b> has moved the magnet <b>92</b>, and correspondingly the magnet <b>20</b>, to the new ultimate valve setting.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">After the magnet <b>20</b> of valve <b>10</b> has been moved to a new setting, indicator tool <b>28</b> should be used again as described above to confirm that magnet <b>20</b> is in the desired position and that, therefore, valve <b>10</b> is at the desired valve setting.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In the described preferred embodiment, locator tool <b>26</b> is mechanically coupled to either indicator tool <b>28</b> or adjustment tool <b>30</b> through the interaction of tube <b>34</b> and either indicator central body <b>60</b> or adjustment central body <b>90</b>, respectively. In this embodiment, the hollow cylinder formed by tube <b>34</b> &#x201c;captures&#x201d; the cylindrical bodies of indicator central body <b>60</b> or adjustment central body <b>90</b> within the central portion of tube <b>34</b>. Although this is the preferred embodiment, it is clear that locator tool <b>26</b> may be mechanically coupled to either indicator central indicator central body <b>60</b> or adjustment central body <b>90</b> by other means. For example, a cylindrical tube <b>34</b> could be &#x201c;captured&#x201d; within a downward extending cylinder from indicator tool <b>28</b> or adjustment tool <b>30</b>. In this embodiment, there may also be slots <b>48</b> and ridges <b>70</b> or other alignment means to orient and align the indicator tool <b>28</b> with the locator tool <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Alternately, with respect to the interaction between the locator tool <b>26</b> and the indicator tool <b>28</b>, instead to the inner surface <b>38</b> of tube <b>34</b> and indicator central body <b>60</b> both being conformally cylindrical, the inner surface <b>38</b> and indicator central body <b>60</b> may have other conformal shapes that allow the two tools to be mated together and maintain a desired orientation. For example, the inner surface <b>38</b> of tube <b>34</b> may be square, rectangular, hexagonal, elliptic or any other shape. Indicator central body <b>60</b> would also have a corresponding conformal shape. In this way, when indicator tool <b>28</b> is mated with locator tool <b>26</b>, indicator tool <b>28</b> would be precisely located and oriented with respect to locator tool <b>26</b>. Other means may occur to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">All such means for mechanically coupling the locator tool <b>26</b> to either indicator central indicator central body <b>60</b> or adjustment central body <b>90</b> are intended to be within the scope of the invention. The key function of such mechanical coupling means is to ensure that the indicator central indicator central body <b>60</b> or adjustment central body <b>90</b> are aligned with the locator tool <b>26</b>. Further, whatever the design, it is a key function of the mechanical coupling means to ensure that the magnet <b>92</b> of the adjustment central body <b>90</b> is allowed to be magnetically coupled to and rotate the magnet <b>20</b> of the valve <b>10</b> in a controllable fashion.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Further, the interaction of slot <b>48</b> or protrusions <b>76</b> on tube <b>34</b> with ridge <b>70</b> or indentations <b>58</b> of indicator tool <b>28</b>, respectively, helps to align the indicator tool <b>28</b> with the locator tool <b>26</b>. Although this is the preferred method of aligning these tools, other ways of aligning the tools will occur to those skilled in the art in addition to the means for mechanically coupling locator tool <b>26</b> to indicator tool <b>28</b> described above, which provides an alignment of the locator tool <b>26</b> and indicator tool <b>28</b>. These additional means include, but are not limited to, reversing the placement of the slots and ridges or protrusions and detents on the respective tools. In addition, other means of mechanical alignment will occur to those skilled in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Further, another aid in aligning the locator tool <b>26</b> and the indicator tool <b>28</b> include visual indicators of position on the respective devices. Examples of these visual means to aid in aligning the respective tools include, but are not limited to aligning indicator marks, line, templates or the like on the respective devices.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In addition, locator tool <b>26</b> has been described in the preferred embodiment having a locator central opening <b>44</b> to allow the physician to palpate the valve <b>10</b> through the locator central opening <b>44</b>. Although this is the preferred embodiment, locator tool <b>26</b> may also not have a locator central opening <b>44</b>. In this embodiment, the physician would align the locator tool <b>26</b> with the valve <b>10</b> by other means. One such means could be determining the orientation of the valve <b>10</b> by palpating the valve <b>10</b> and then noting the direction of orientation on the patient's skin by a marking on the patient's skin. Locator tool <b>26</b> would then be aligned with the marking on the patient's skin.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In this description, the use of the tools has been described as being cooperative and substantially sequential. So for example, the locator tool <b>26</b> is used first to establish an orientation aligned with the valve <b>10</b>. Thereafter, the indicator tool <b>28</b> is used to indicated the current setting of the valve <b>10</b>. Then, the adjustment tool <b>30</b> is used, if needed, to move the valve <b>10</b> to a new setting. Finally, the indicator tool <b>28</b> is used again to confirm that the new setting is in fact the desired setting.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">It is within the scope of the invention to use the locator tool <b>26</b> and the indicator tool <b>28</b> without ever using adjustment tool <b>30</b>. In this embodiment of the invention, the information on the current setting of the valve <b>10</b> may be sufficient or may be used with some other means to change the setting of the valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">It is also within the scope of the invention to use the locator tool <b>26</b> and the adjustment tool <b>30</b> without using the indicator tool <b>28</b>. In this embodiment of the invention, the setting of the valve <b>10</b> would be determined by other means, such as by x-ray, or inferred. In any case, the setting of the valve <b>10</b> would be determined without using the indicator tool <b>28</b>. Thereafter, the adjustment tool <b>30</b> would operate as described above to change the setting of the valve <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Although a particular embodiment of the invention has been described in detail herein, it is to be understood that the description has been given for the purpose of illustrating the invention and not for limiting the invention to the embodiment specifically described. Various modifications or changes will occur to those skilled in the art. These changes or modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited, except as by the scope of the appended claims.</p>
