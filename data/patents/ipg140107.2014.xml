<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Surface materials of workpieces may be adversely affected by corrosive environments in various different industries. In the petroleum industry, corrosion of metallic surfaces by petroleum materials occurs at different stages of production and distribution. To reduce this corrosion, inhibitors have been utilized as a corrosion control method. There are various inhibitors which work in different ways, as well as various screening procedures used for the selection of inhibitors. Some inhibitors work by neutralizing active ions, others by reducing ion mobility and others by changing the ion transport numbers. In all cases the electrical conductivity of the corrosive fluid is altered, and various electrical parameters contributing to the overall corrosion mechanism will be affected. Accordingly, by using the corrosive fluid as an electrolyte in which two electrodes are immersed, and by measuring electrical characteristics of the electrolytic circuit, an indication of the level of corrosion which continues to occur may be derived. U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,776 describes a technique that utilizes the &#x201c;break point frequency&#x201d; (frequency at 45&#xb0; phase angle) in order to determine the effectiveness of a corrosion inhibitor in preventing corrosion of metallic surfaces using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the magnetic recording industry, one corrosion auditing technique uses a scanning electronic microscope (SEM) to visually evaluate overcoat materials. Such a visual technique is time consuming and can sometimes yield false positives.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another corrosion evaluation technique, used in the magnetic recording industry, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,512,382. Magnetic heads coated with diamond-like carbon films are tested by exposing the heads to a salt environment similar to that found in a production process. By comparing the sensor resistance values measured immediately following salt application and after exposure under different conditions (varying temperature, humidity and time), the susceptibility of the magnetic head to corrosion is determined.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Yet another solution, though not specifically for magnetic heads, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,806,849. The degradation level of a sample is determined by first dividing the sample into several zones using a grid. Impedance spectra are obtained from each area, and the degree of degradation is ranked based on the statistical distribution of the measured impedance values.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Embodiments of a method are described herein with reference to figures. However, particular embodiments may be practiced without one or more of these specific details, or in combination with other known methods, materials, and apparatuses. In the following description, numerous specific details are set forth, such as specific materials, dimensions and processes parameters etc. to provide a thorough understanding. In other instances, well-known manufacturing processes and equipment have not been described in particular detail to avoid unnecessarily obscuring the claimed subject matter. Reference throughout this specification to &#x201c;an embodiment&#x201d; means that a particular feature, structure, material, or characteristic described in connection with the embodiment is included in at least one embodiment of the invention. Thus, the appearances of the phrase &#x201c;in an embodiment&#x201d; in various places throughout this specification are not necessarily referring to the same embodiment. Furthermore, the particular features, structures, materials, or characteristics may be combined in any suitable manner in one or more embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Embodiments of a method are described for determining the relative abilities of an overcoat (e.g., carbon) to protect a workpiece (e.g., AlTiC substrate) from exposure to a corrosive environment (e.g., an acid or salt solution) that may cause damage to the workpiece. A method of evaluating the workpiece overcoat includes the use of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy to measure the electrochemical properties of the overcoated workpiece. Information extracted from the impedance data is used to determine the level of protection that is provided by the overcoat.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment, the evaluation method includes submerging the workpiece having an overcoat in an electrochemical cell comprising a corrosive fluid. A circuit path is established in the electrochemical cell using the workpiece as a working electrode and a reference electrode disposed in the corrosive fluid. An excitation signal is applied at one or more frequencies to the circuit path and then a normalized modulus of impedance value is determined at one or more time points.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">For ease of understanding the context of the present invention, embodiments are described in which the workpiece is a wafer composed of a ceramic aluminum titanium carbide (AlTiC) substrate with a carbon overcoat, out of which head sliders are formed for use in a magnetic recording disk Although embodiments of the present invention are described in the context of magnetic recording head wafers, it should be appreciated that embodiments of the present invention may also be used with optical disks, semiconductor wafers, photomasks, glass substrates, flat panel display surfaces, liquid crystal display surfaces or other types of workpieces.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates part of a head manufacturing process <b>100</b>, according to one embodiment of the present invention. In current disk drive systems that employ flying heads, a read/write head is used to read and write data on a magnetic recording disk or medium. The read/write head element is typically a part of or affixed to a larger body that flies over the disk and is typically referred to as a &#x201c;slider.&#x201d; Accordingly, the head may also be referred to as a head slider. The head sliders are fabricated as device arrays in wafer form, process <b>110</b>, using techniques that are well known in the art; according a detailed description is not provided herein. In one embodiment, the wafer substrate <b>220</b> may be composed of AlTiC on which the head sliders will be formed as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, multiple head sliders (e.g., <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>) are formed on the AlTiC substrate <b>200</b> having an overcoat <b>205</b> disposed thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the outer surface of the head slider wafers are coated with an overcoat material or protective film, operation <b>120</b>. In one embodiment, the overcoat is composed of diamond like carbon (DLC). Alternatively, the overcoat may be composed of other materials, for examples, alumina (Al<sub>2</sub>0<sub>3</sub>), Silicon (Si), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">After a wafer has been coated, the overcoat of the wafer may be tested for corrosion susceptibility using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, operation <b>130</b>, as described in more detail below. After testing, the wafer is sent to head gimbal assembly (HGA), operation <b>140</b>, in which the wafer is cut up to manufacture the individual head slider assemblies. In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, all wafers may be evaluated in-line before being sent to HGA. Alternatively, a sample of wafers may be selected for impedance spectroscopy testing off-line, operation <b>135</b>, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates one embodiment of an impedance spectroscopy measurement system and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a method evaluating a workpiece overcoat. Reference is made to both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> in discussion of the operation of the system and testing methodology. In one embodiment, impedance spectroscopy measurement system <b>300</b> includes a test cell <b>310</b>, a high frequency impedance analyzer <b>340</b>, and a computer <b>350</b>. It should be noted that although only a single test cell is discussed, multiple (e.g., N number of test cells) may be connected to FRA <b>340</b>. A workpiece <b>200</b> is submerged in electrochemical test cell <b>310</b> containing an aqueous electrolyte solution of corrosive fluid <b>330</b> in container <b>320</b>, block <b>410</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In one embodiment, the electrolyte solution <b>330</b> electrolyte solution is an 0.5 M H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4 </sub>solution. Alternatively, other corrosive solutions may be used. The submerged workpiece <b>200</b> operates as a working electrode (WE). A reference electrode (RE) lead <b>311</b> and a counter electrode (CE) lead <b>312</b> are submerged into the solution <b>330</b> in order to establish a circuit path in the electrochemical cell <b>310</b>, block <b>420</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. Once the setup is in place, an excitation signal at one or more frequencies is applied through the circuit path with FRA <b>340</b>, block <b>430</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In one embodiment, an open circuit potential may be obtained after allowing the workpiece to equilibrate in the electrolyte solution for a time period (e.g., 60 seconds). The excitation signal may have an amplitude of 5 millivolts (mV) and a frequency in a range of 1 Hertz (Hz) to 10 Hz. IT should be noted that the test parameters provide herein are only examples and, in alternative embodiments, other test parameters may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In block <b>440</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a modulus of impedance value is measured using FRA <b>340</b> and computer <b>350</b> at one or more time points (e.g., 60 points distributed logarithmically over a period of 100 seconds). In one embodiment, the measurements may be performed at standard ambient temperature and pressure. Impedance measurement software running on computer <b>350</b> may be used to display the measured impedance data, for example, in the form of a Bode plot. The Bode plot, which can be used for data comparison, plots the modulus of impedance (log|Z|) in &#x3a9;cm<sup>2 </sup>as a function of log (frequency) in Hz as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The Bode plot <b>500</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates a comparison of impedance spectra obtained from a bare AlTiC wafer (square data points <b>510</b>) and an AlTiC wafer coated with DLC (triangular data points <b>520</b>). The impedance modules vs. log (frequency) plot shows that a DLC coated AlTiC wafer has higher impedance moduli at frequencies equal to 10<sup>0.085 </sup>and 10<sup>2.313 </sup>Hz.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for each spectrum, the modulus of impedance, |Z| may be normalized in one embodiment, block <b>445</b>, by setting log(|Z|) at frequency=10<sup>4 </sup>Hz to unity, i.e., divide all log(|Z|) values by the value of log(|Z|) (frequency=10<sup>4 </sup>Hz). This step sets the ohmic resistance, which originates from the electrolyte, to approximately the same value in all tested workpieces. This will enable direct comparison of the measured impedance values. The following value from the plots after normalization are recorded and may be displayed to the user in operation <b>450</b>: log(|Z|) at frequency=10<sup>0 </sup>Hz. This frequency may be used in one embodiment because the ohmic effects (flat portion at high frequency in log(|Z|) vs. frequency plots) do not extend to this frequency in any of the workpiece samples plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. The ohmic portion of the plot is attributable to the electrolyte, not the workpiece itself. The frequency chosen is not at too low a value, thus the time required to make the measurement is sufficiently short. In alternative embodiments, the normalized impedance values are not displayed to the user. For example, software on computer <b>350</b> may automatically determine and identify an acceptable workpiece based on predetermined comparison metrics as discussed in further detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The overcoat on a workpiece that has a high value of log(|Z|) at 10<sup>0 </sup>Hz is considered to provide better protection than that of the other workpiece. For example, in one embodiment, a standard or reference normalized modulus of impedance value may be established through empirical data and used as a metric by which workpieces are compared against to determine if they are considered satisfactory. For example, the data plotted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> may indicated that log|Z|=1.8 ohm cm<sup>2 </sup>may be used as a standard, or reference, value in one embodiment. Of course, this value is only an example and would be based on workpiece parameters, experimental conditions, observations, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In one embodiment, to determine whether the overcoat is effective in preventing the workpiece from exposure to the electrolyte, the log|Z<sub>work piece</sub>| (at 10<sup>0 </sup>Hz) value is compared to the average log|Z<sub>substrate</sub>| (at 10<sup>0 </sup>Hz) of a reference workpiece that is the same as the tested workpiece but without the overcoat and tested in the same electrolyte solution, block <b>460</b>. This log|Z<sub>substrate</sub>| value is obtained from separate (e.g., prior) measurements and is to be used as a reference value. If log|Z<sub>work piece</sub>| of the tested workpiece is greater than the log|Z<sub>substrate</sub>| of the reference workpiece, then the overcoat is determined to be effective in protecting the substrate of the tested workpiece, block <b>470</b>. If log|Z<sub>work piece</sub>| of the tested workpiece is less than the log|Z<sub>substrate</sub>| of the reference workpiece, then the overcoat is determined to be ineffective in protecting the substrate, block <b>480</b>. The larger the difference between the log|Z| of the test workpiece and the reference value, the more effective the overcoat as a barrier.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The advantages of embodiments of the present invention over conventional solutions for corrosion auditing may include: 1) smaller measurement time and 2) lower cost. In one embodiment, the test cell <b>310</b> may be designed such that the corrosive solution and electrodes remain in place and only the workpiece <b>200</b> need to be changed, further reducing the sample preparation/mounting time.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">It should be noted that embodiments of the present invention are not limited to characterization of carbon coatings on AlTiC substrates. Embodiments of the present invention may also be used to characterize other types of workpieces having other types of overcoats. Examples of other types of overcoats and substrates include, but are not limited to, diamond-like carbon (DLC) film on Mg alloys, DLC on stainless steel (e.g., for biomedical applications), Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3 </sub>on aluminum alloys, chromium-, titanium-, aluminum- and zirconium nitride on stainless steel. The frequency value used to compare the sample quality should be adjusted accordingly, based on experimental observations. The frequency chosen should be away from any ohmic effects from the electrolyte, typically observed at high frequency. In an embodiment, the frequency chosen frequency is not too low as to significantly prolong the measurement time.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Moreover, the measurement of impedance characteristics of a workpiece are not limited to just evaluating the ability of an overcoat (e.g., carbon) to protect a workpiece from exposure to a corrosive environment. In addition to effectiveness in evaluating corrosion susceptibility, the impedance characteristics of a workpiece, such as log(|Z|) at 10<sup>0 </sup>Hz, can be related to other properties. For example, log(|Z|) at 10<sup>0 </sup>Hz may be correlated (at least qualitatively) to properties such as refractive index (n,k), Raman peak intensity and wear resistance of a workpiece.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In the foregoing specification, the present invention has been described with reference to specific exemplary embodiments thereof. It will, however, be evident that various modifications and changes may be made thereto without departing from the broader scope of the embodiments of the invention as set for in the appended claims. For example, although steps of embodiments of inventive methods may have been described in a specific order, one of skill in the art will understand that some of the steps described may occur simultaneously, in overlapping time frames, and/or in a different order from that described and claimed herein and fall within embodiments of the present invention.
