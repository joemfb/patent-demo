<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The display device on a mobile device, such as the computer monitor, or the screen on the laptop or phone, consumes large amounts of power. For instance, in some devices, the display may consume between thirty to forty percent of the total power consumption at any particular point in time. Imagine the power wasted to energize a display when the device is not being actively used. Power mismanagement is amplified on mobile devices which have a finite amount of battery power.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Energy savings can be achieved by turning the display off when a user is not actively interacting with the device. Device interaction is detected by the presence of keyboard or mouse events, for instance. Conversely, device non-interaction is detected by the absence of keyboard or mouse events. In conventional systems, a rudimentary power management system is implemented that defines a single and static timeout period, after which the display of the device is turned off. In essence, the device is monitored for the display timeout period, and if no interaction with the device has occurred during the period, the display is then turned off.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A short and aggressive display timeout can provide large energy savings, but can irritate the user by causing frequent interruptions during periods of light activity. On the other hand, a large and conservative timeout, while causing less annoyance, provides fewer opportunities for energy savings.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The static timeout period is suitable for devices dedicated to a single purpose, such as work computers that operate within a well defined mode of operation on a continual basis. As such, usage of the device is consistent over time, and so a static timeout period on average provides the least amount of annoyance to the user.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">However, for devices that operate within dynamically changing environments, the statically defined timeout period is insufficient for implementing a power management scheme. For instance, portable devices are used in various environments where the user places varying demand on the device. For instance, the user may at one time be at home and having the device plugged into an infinite power source, where power management of the device is not so critical. As such, a long timeout period that does not disturb the user would be appropriate. On the other hand, at another time the user may be traveling by air for a long stretch of time, in which power management of the device is very critical. If the timeout period is statically defined for home use of the device, that longer timeout period would be inappropriate for the user when traveling. That is, the user would quickly find out that the battery has drained because the display is constantly operating as if there were an infinite amount of power. Thus, even though the environment within which the device is being used is changing, the static timeout period has not changed with the environment.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Power management systems and methods of computing resources, such as those found on mobile devices are presented. In one embodiment, computer implementation of a method for context specific power management of a resource, comprises: defining a context within which a resource operates, wherein the context is defined by one or more parameters; tracking a usage history of the resource operating within the context to determine passive user feedback related to a plurality of timeout values; and determining a timeout value for a current operation of the resource within the context based on the usage history. The tracking phase can include: determining a last activity of the resource; conserving power dedicated to the resource when a corresponding timeout period has elapsed in relation to the last activity; tracking an annoyance period after the resource is sleeping; determining a positive feedback when a new activity occurs after the annoyance period has elapsed; and determining a negative feedback when the new activity occurs before the annoyance period has elapsed.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In one embodiment, determining a timeout value phase in the computer implemented method comprises: determining positive feedback in the usage history for a plurality of timeout values; determining negative feedback in the usage history for the plurality of timeout values; determining an annoyance value for each timeout value based on the positive feedback and the negative feedback; and determining a timeout value having an annoyance value between an upper threshold and a lower threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In some embodiments, for a new context, the computer implemented method further comprises: determining a pool of relevant contexts, each of which comprises at least one parameter also common to the new context; determining positive feedback in the usage history for the pool of relevant contexts for a plurality of timeout values; determining negative feedback in the usage history for the pool of relevant contexts for the plurality of timeout values; determining an annoyance value for each timeout value based on the positive feedback and the negative feedback; and determining a timeout value having an annoyance value between an upper threshold and a lower threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In one embodiment, a system includes a tangible, non-transitory computer-readable storage medium having stored thereon, computer-executable instructions that, when executed causes the computer system to perform a method, comprising: defining a context within which a resource operates, wherein the context is defined by one or more parameters; tracking a usage history of the resource operating within the context to determine passive user feedback related to a plurality of timeout values; and determining a timeout value for a current operation of the resource within the context based on the usage history. The tracking phase can include: determining a last activity of the resource; conserving power dedicated to the resource when a corresponding timeout period has elapsed in relation to the last activity; tracking an annoyance period after the resource is sleeping; determining a positive feedback when a new activity occurs after the annoyance period has elapsed; and determining a negative feedback when the new activity occurs before the annoyance period has elapsed. Parameters defining the context includes, but is not limited to, a group consisting of mobility, network connectivity, power, time of day, and geo-location. Power management of a resource may include managing power dedicated to a display in a computing device.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Reference will now be made in detail to the various embodiments of the present disclosure, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. While described in conjunction with these embodiments, it will be understood that they are not intended to limit the disclosure to these embodiments. On the contrary, the disclosure is intended to cover alternatives, modifications and equivalents, which may be included within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims.

The computer system or similar electronic computing device manipulates and transforms data represented as physical (electronic) quantities within the computer system memories, registers or other such information storage, transmission or display devices.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Embodiments described herein may be discussed in the general context of computer-executable instructions residing on some form of computer-readable storage medium, such as program modules, executed by one or more computers or other devices. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable storage media may comprise non-transitory computer storage media and communication media. Generally, program modules include routines, programs, objects, components, data structures, etc., that perform particular tasks or implement particular abstract data types. The functionality of the program modules may be combined or distributed as desired in various embodiments.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Accordingly, embodiments according to the present disclosure provide methods and systems to provide context specific power management of computing devices and components or resources associated with those computing devices. Where the discussion below refers to a single application, that discussion can be readily extended to multiple applications. As such, power management settings for a computing device and/or its components or resources of the device are dynamically adapted based on user context and a history of user feedback related to timeout values for a device operating within similar or related contexts.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Embodiments of the present disclosure illustrate &#x201c;power management&#x201d; of computing devices and/or elements or resources associated with those devices. As used throughout the application, a resource is a power consuming computing resource. For purposes of ease and illustration, the present disclosure discloses context specific power management within the context of a display in a mobile device. However, description of power management of a display is intended to be representative of power management of any device or resource consuming power, any computing device consuming power, or components, elements, or resources associated with any device or any computing device consuming power.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Resources on a computing device consume a significant amount of power. For instance, a display resource, such as a computer monitor, or the screen on the laptop or phone consumes a large percentage of the total operating power of the corresponding device. Energy saving can be achieved by turning off the display resource when a user is not actively with the specific display, or with the overall device. For instance, a timeout value refers to an amount of time during which if there is no activity detected from the user (e.g., absence of interaction of the user with the device, such as the absence of keyboard or mouse events), then the display is shut off, or put to sleep mode or hibernation.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">A large and conservative timeout value typically causes less disturbance to the user. However, a large timeout value, while causing less annoyance, provides fewer opportunities for energy saving. For instance, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a diagram of a timeline illustrating the power savings when a device has a large timeout value according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown, timeline <b>110</b> illustrates points of activity and inactivity with a device. A large timeout value of 20 minutes is associated with the device. At point A, the last activity is shown at time t=0 minutes. At point B, 20 minutes has elapsed from point A without any activity shown by the user with the device. As such, at point B, the display of the device has been put to sleep. Other elements or components of the device may also be put to sleep. At point D, the user interacts with the device, such as activating a button, mouse, keyboard, etc. At point D, new activity is shown to occur at time t=30 minutes. As such, the power savings &#x394;&#x2212;1 is approximately 10 minutes, between points B and D.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, a variable annoyance period of Z is shown between points B and C, and occurs after the device or resource of the device has been put to sleep. The annoyance period may be set to any time period (e.g., 5 seconds, 30 seconds, 50 seconds). The annoyance period is used to determine whether a user is annoyed with the current timeout value, as will be described, in part, in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>6</b>A and <b>6</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is a diagram of a timeline illustrating the power savings when a device has a shorter timeout value according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. A short and aggressive timeout value can provide larger energy savings, when compared to a large and conservative timeout value, but can irritate the user, especially by causing frequent interruptions during periods of light activity by the user with the device. As shown, timeline <b>120</b> illustrates points of activity and inactivity with the device. Similarly marked points in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref> and <b>1</b>B occur at the same time in both timelines <b>110</b> an <b>120</b> and can be used as points of reference. A short and aggressive timeout value of 2 minutes is associated with the device. At point A, the last activity is shown at time t=0 minutes. At point E, 2 minutes has elapsed from point A without any activity shown by the user with the device. As such, at point E, the display of the device has been put to sleep. Other elements or components of the device may also be put to sleep. At point D, the user interacts with the device, such that new activity has occurred at t=30 minutes. As such, the power savings &#x394;&#x2212;2 is approximately 28 minutes, between points E and D, which is significantly longer than &#x394;&#x2212;1 associated with a large timeout value.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In another example, point X in both <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> occur at 10 minutes after point A, which denotes the last activity on the device. Point X is associated with a user who is lightly using the device, such as interacting with the device after about 5 to 10 minutes. In the case where the device has a large, conservative timeout value of 20 minutes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, there is no energy savings due to activity by the user at point X, after 10 minutes of inactivity, since the device has not been put to sleep. Conversely, where the device has a short and aggressive timeout value of 2 minutes, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, there is some energy savings associated with activity of the user at point X. The device was put to sleep after 2 minutes, and as such, at point X, after 10 minutes of inactivity, there is a power savings &#x394;&#x2212;3 of approximately 8 minutes. This may be significant, especially if the device is a mobile device with limited power, and the user wishes to extend the life of the existing charge on the battery of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a block diagram of a power manager <b>210</b> capable of providing context specific power management of a resource according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In one embodiment, power manager is a computer system capable of providing context specific power management. In some embodiments, power manager <b>210</b> is local to the device and/or resource to which power is managed. In other embodiments, power manager <b>210</b> is located remotely from the device and/or resource to which power is managed. For instance, power manager <b>210</b> may remotely monitor usage history of a device and manage power to that device depending on the current context in which the device is operating.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, power manager <b>210</b> includes a context definer <b>220</b>. The context in which the device is operating describes the operating characteristics of the device as well as the environment in which the device is operating. The context of a device may change dynamically, especially as the device is moved from one location to another, and the use of the device changes. For instance, a user may be in a coffee shop working off a portable laptop, and is connected through a virtual private network (VPN) back to a work network. Given the current context, the demand on the device may be more intense assuming that the user is performing work through the VPN. A shorter timeout value may be appropriate to extend the useable life of the device. In another case, the same user may be in the same coffee shop using the portable laptop. However, instead of connecting to the VPN, the user is connected to the local Wi-Fi connection, and is casually surfing the internet. In this case, a larger timeout value may be appropriate.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Power manager <b>210</b> includes a usage history tracker <b>230</b>. The usage history of the device is tracked for the various contexts that are encountered and defined by the device. The usage tracker <b>230</b> monitors the user's experience in relation to the timeout value for a given context. Specifically, tracker <b>230</b> is able to determine whether the user is satisfied with the timeout value or annoyed with the timeout value. The user passively provides feedback indicating the user's experience with the timeout value through interactions with the device in relation to any timeout period or value. The expected user experience associated with a device (e.g., mobile device) may vary among users. For instance, a single model of a mobile device is carried by many users, each of which have different user experiences associated with their corresponding device. In addition, the expected user experience, even for a single user, may vary with time, the environment, or context in which the device is being used.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The timeout value calculator <b>240</b> is configured to determine the timeout value which provides the best tradeoff between energy saving and annoyance to the user for a given and current context in which the device is operating. In one embodiment, the timeout value is adaptable to the expectations of the user depending on the context and usage history of the device and user. Specifically, the timeout value is based on the user's tolerance to annoyance caused by the power management policy (e.g., period of annoyance setting, timeout value) for a given context. As such, the power manager <b>210</b> is able to dynamically adapt power management settings (e.g. for the display) based on the user context and the usage history of the device and user.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of a usage history tracker <b>230</b> included as an element of the power manager <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in one embodiment. Tracker <b>230</b> is configured to determine positive and negative feedback of a user relative to one or more timeout values of a device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In that manner, a timeout value can be determined for a current use of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Usage history tracker <b>230</b> includes an activity tracker <b>320</b>, which monitors for use of the device. That is, activity tracker <b>320</b> determines when the device is actively used, and when it is not actively used. In one embodiment, a time stamp is determined by tracker <b>320</b> whenever an event occurs. Periods of activity or inactivity can be determined by monitoring for any interaction of the user with the device. For instance, a keyboard or mouse event will trigger an activity by the user on the device. Other interactions with the device is contemplated within the scope of embodiments, such as movement of the device, touching the display, talking to the device, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Sleep manager <b>330</b> uses the information from the activity tracker <b>320</b> to determine when the device and/or resource associated with the device should be turned off or put to sleep. Specifically, depending on the timeout value currently associated with the device, the sleep manager <b>330</b> shuts off the device and/or resource after no activity has been detected over a timeout period or value.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Annoyance tracker <b>340</b> is configured to monitor for activity after the device and/or resource of the device has been put to sleep. Information from the annoyance tracker <b>340</b> provides feedback about the user's experience in relation to the current timeout value, as determined by feedback selector <b>350</b>. Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, a variable annoyance period of Z is shown and is monitored by the annoyance tracker. The annoyance period may be set to any time period (e.g., 5 seconds), and is used to determine whether a user is annoyed with the current timeout value. For instance, if the user quickly interacts with the device shortly after the device has been put to sleep, and within the annoyance period Z, this indicates that the user is actively engaged with the device, and is probably annoyed that the device was put to sleep. In some instances, it may even cost more power to turn on the device after being put to sleep, than if the device were left in an &#x201c;ON&#x201d; state. On the other hand, if the user does not interact with the device during the annoyance period after the device has been put to sleep, then this indicates the user is not actively engaged with the device, and probably is not annoyed that the device was put to sleep. In this manner, by tracking user activity with the device (e.g., keyboard and mouse interaction), the user passively provides feedback regarding whether he or she is content with the current setting of the timeout value.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a flowchart <b>400</b> of a computer-implemented process for context specific power management of a resource according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. For instance, in one embodiment, the process outlined in flowchart <b>400</b> is implemented by power manager <b>210</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> to dynamically adapt power management settings of a device based on user and device context and usage history for that contexts and/or related contexts.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In block <b>410</b> a context within which a device and/or a resource of the device operates is defined. The context may be defined by various resource associated parameters, such as network identity or connectivity, power source, power level, power settings, mobility, etc. The context may also be defined by various environmentally associated parameters, such as geo-location of the device, time of day, etc. as will be further discussed in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. In one embodiment, the process outlined in block <b>410</b> is implemented by the context definer <b>220</b> of the power manager <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In block <b>420</b>, a usage history of the device is tracked. More specifically, the usage history is tracked in relation to the context within which the device is operating. The usage history is used to determine passive user feedback related to a plurality of timeout values. For instance, positive and negative feedback is passively or indirectly delivered when the user is actively using the device. In one embodiment, the process outlined in block <b>420</b> is implemented by the usage history tracker <b>230</b> of the power manager <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In block <b>430</b> a timeout value for a current operation of the resource is determined based on the context within which the device is operating and the usage history associated with the context. More specifically, a current timeout value is determined based on previous user experiences with a plurality of timeout values for the same or related context. In one embodiment, the process outlined in block <b>430</b> is implemented by the timeout value calculator <b>240</b> of the power manager <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, a multi-dimensional graph <b>500</b> is shown illustrating a plurality of contexts within which a device may operate according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. As shown, a context is defined by three dimensions <b>503</b>, <b>505</b>, and <b>507</b>, each further defined by a corresponding parameter. Though three dimensions are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, it is contemplated that a context may be defined by one or more dimensions. As previously described, contextual dimensions may be defined by a resource and/or device configuration parameter (network identity, power source, mobility, power level, etc.), or an environmental parameter (location, date, time, etc.). Other dimensions or categories of dimensions are well suited for defining a context as envisioned in embodiments of the disclosure. Further, some parameters may be considered as a mixture between types or categories of dimensions.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Dimensions illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> include a geo-location dimension <b>503</b>, network connectivity dimension <b>505</b>, and power dimension <b>507</b>. Each context associated with the device may be defined by one or more of the dimensions. For instance, the geo-location dimension <b>503</b> defines the geographic location of the device, or the perceived or default location of the device. This may be obtained through global positioning satellite (GPS) operations, use of location associated with engaged cell towers, or any other suitable locating process. In some embodiments, it is not necessary to know the precise location of the device, but a general location, such as zip code, city, region, etc. Additionally, the location may be generally identified by category, defining whether the device is at &#x201c;home,&#x201d; &#x201c;work,&#x201d; another defined location, or an unknown &#x201c;other&#x201d; location. Each of the defined locations is associated with a value, such as a-1, a-2, a-3, etc. For instance, zip code 90210 may be a-1, and zip code 91108 may be a-2.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Further, the network identity or network connectivity dimension <b>505</b> defines the network to which the device is connected. For instance, the network identity dimension defines the internet protocol (IP) network that the device is engaging. The device may be physically be at home, but actually connected to a work network using VPN, and as such its correct context would be more reflective of a work environment than a home environment. In some embodiments the combination of IP address and a network gateway is used to identify the network identify. In some embodiments, the network identity is further classified into a public network (e.g., coffee shop network), secure network, &#x201c;home&#x201d; network, a &#x201c;work&#x201d; network, any other unknown &#x201c;other&#x201d; network, etc. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the network dimension <b>505</b> has at least three values: b-1, b-2, and b-3, which may correspond to a VPN network, a secure network, and a home network.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In addition, the power dimension <b>507</b> defines the power source to which the device draws power. For power management, it is important to know whether a device, such as a mobile device, is operating on alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) battery power, as its primary power source. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the power dimension <b>507</b> has two entries: c-1 and c-2, corresponding to AC or DC power.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Other dimensions are contemplated in embodiments of the disclosure. For instance, a dimension may include battery level. When using the battery, knowing the battery is critical, as power management decisions may change depending on the level of the remaining battery power. In another example, another dimension may include power settings, which define current power management settings of the device. For instance, a power setting may include the current display timeout value. Another dimension may include mobility, in which the mobility of the device is defined as being static or mobile, as well as incremental stages of mobility.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> is a table <b>550</b> illustrating usage history for each of a plurality of contexts for a device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. For instance, the context definer <b>220</b> and timeout value calculator <b>240</b> provide values that are included within table <b>550</b> for purposes of providing power management of a device and/or a resource associated with the device.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As shown in table <b>550</b> a plurality of contexts <b>560</b> (e.g., context-(<b>1</b>)-(N)) are defined by context characteristics <b>570</b>. Each context may be defined by one or more dimensions <b>1</b>-N, previously introduced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>. As examples, a context dimension may include geo-location, network identity, power source, mobility, etc. Each dimension may further be characterized by varying types. For instance, the geo-location dimension is defined by types a-1 through a-n, which may correspond to various zip codes, or other locations.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">As such, context-<b>1</b> as illustrated in rows <b>561</b>A-C is defined by various dimensions, such as, a-1, b-2, c-1, . . . , n-1; context-<b>2</b> as illustrated in row <b>562</b> is defined by various dimensions, such as, a-1, b-3, c-2, . . . , n-1; and context-n as illustrated in row <b>564</b> is defined by various dimensions, such as, a-5, b-4, c-1, . . . , and n-4. A variation of even one dimension's value will distinguish one context from other contexts.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Also shown in table <b>550</b> is usage history <b>575</b>. For each context, a usage history is monitored that illustrate the user's experience with the device, in relation to various timeout values. As power management is user specific, feedback from the user is obtained to learn and adapt power management strategies from past experiences. As shown, positive and negative feedback is provided for each context. That is, for each instance of a user experience with a timeout value is monitored and recorded.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">In one embodiment, each instance of the device being put to sleep is monitored for user experiences to determine positive and negative feedback. For example, an aggressive setting for the display timeout may cause annoyance to the user irritation to the user, and as such the user provides a feedback input by using the keyboard or the mouse to wake the display up as soon as it goes to sleep (or within a short-duration, e.g., 5 seconds). Such feedback are considered &#x201c;negative&#x201d; for the power management scheme. On the other hand, if the user does not wake up the display within that short period of time, it is considered a positive feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Total positive and negative feedback are recorded, and tagged with the context in which the feedback was provided. These feedback are then stored in a database called usage history or feedback history. Feedback history is monitored for each of the timeout values implemented within that context. For instance, for context-<b>1</b> as illustrated in row <b>561</b>A, positive feedback (<b>20</b>) and negative feedback (<b>10</b>) (corresponding to 33 percent negative feedback) for a sampled timeout value or period of 5 minutes is provided. Other feedback values may be provided for context-<b>1</b> (shown in rows <b>561</b>B and <b>561</b>C) for other timeout values. As another example, for context-<b>2</b> as illustrated in row <b>562</b>, positive feedback (<b>45</b>) and negative feedback (<b>5</b>) (corresponding to 10 percent negative feedback) for a sampled timeout value of 15 minutes is provided. Again, other feedback values may be provided for context-<b>2</b> (not shown) for other timeout values, if available. In still another example, for context-N, as illustrated in row <b>564</b>, positive feedback (<b>97</b>) and negative feedback (<b>3</b>) (corresponding to 3 percent negative feedback) for a sampled timeout value of 20 minutes is provided. Still other feedback values may be provided for context-N (not shown) for other timeout values, if available.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">A typical trend is shown in table <b>550</b>. For a given context, as the timeout value increases the percentage of negative feedback also conversely decreases. That inverse relationship will vary for every context, and will vary between users. For instance, for context-<b>1</b>, feedback is given for timeout values of 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and 20 minutes. Corresponding percentages of negative feedback is inversely proportional, such that for a timeout value of 5 minutes there is 33 percent negative feedback; for a timeout value of 10 minutes, there is 20 percent negative feedback; and for a timeout value of 20 minutes, there is 1 percent negative feedback.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> in combination illustrate the processes implemented for monitoring feedback for a given context under which a device is operating. The processes outlined in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are implemented by the usage history tracker <b>230</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In particular, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a flowchart <b>600</b>A of a computer-implemented process for monitoring positive and negative feedback of a user relative to one or more timeout values of a device according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In particular, the process of flow chart <b>600</b>A monitors activity by a user to determine the user experience in relation to a timeout value for a given context. In the performance of the process outlined in flowchart <b>600</b>A, the context is associated with a timeout value that indicates when to shut off or hibernate the device and/or resource of the device. The same or similar process in flowchart <b>600</b>A is performed to monitor for user feedback given any context within which the device is operating.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">At block <b>610</b>, a last activity of a device and/or a resource of the device is detected. The operation in block <b>610</b> is performed by activity tracker <b>320</b> in one embodiment. The last activity is also the first activity of the process outlined in flowchart <b>600</b>A, in one embodiment. Since the device is continuously monitored, any new activity becomes the last known activity and the process continually loops in operation.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">At block <b>620</b>, the operation timer is set to zero. Also, at block <b>625</b>, the operation timer is run to track the time. That is, the timer is refreshed so that a period of inactivity from the last known active event is monitored. This is important for purposes of determining when to put the device and/or resource of the device to sleep, as will be discussed in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>. In one embodiment, the sleep manager <b>330</b> manages the operating timer.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">At decision block <b>630</b>, it is determined if any new activity has occurred. In one embodiment, activity tracker <b>320</b> monitors for any new activity. If no new activity has occurred, then the process continues to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> at transition point A to determine whether the device should be put to sleep. On the other hand, if a new activity has occurred, then the process continues to decision step <b>635</b>, where it is determined if the device and/or the resource or element of the device is asleep. In one embodiment, the sleep manager <b>330</b> determines the activity of the device and/or resource. If not asleep, then the process loops back to block <b>620</b> to reset the period of inactivity. This situation is shown at point X in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">However, if it is determined that the device and/or the resource or element of the device is asleep at block <b>635</b>, then the process proceeds to decision block <b>640</b> to determine if an annoyance period has passed. The process in block <b>640</b> is performed by annoyance tracker <b>340</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, in one embodiment. As previously described, the annoyance period is variable and is used to determine whether a user is annoyed with the current timeout value. In one case, the annoyance period is set to 5 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">If the annoyance period has passed, then the process proceeds to block <b>660</b> where a positive feedback is determined. In one embodiment, the feedback selector <b>350</b> determines the type of feedback passively expressed by the user. Specifically, since the new activity occurred after the device and/or resource was put to sleep, and after the annoyance period has elapsed, then the user's new activity fell outside of the annoyance period, and the user was not annoyed. In that manner, it is determined that the user in this instance was satisfied with the current timeout value. In particular, in block <b>660</b>, the user's experience is labeled as positive feedback, which is then recorded in the usage history <b>575</b> by incrementing the positive feedback value in block <b>665</b>. Thereafter, the process loops back to block <b>620</b> to reset the period of inactivity.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">On the other hand, if the annoyance period has not passed, then the process proceeds to block <b>650</b> where a negative feedback is determined. Specifically, since the new activity occurred after the device and/or resource was put to sleep, but before the annoyance period had fully elapsed, then the user's new activity fell within the annoyance period, and the user probably was annoyed. In that manner, it is determined that the user in this instance was not satisfied with the current timeout value. In particular, in block <b>650</b>, the user's experience is labeled as negative feedback, which is then recorded in the usage history <b>575</b> by incrementing the negative feedback value in block <b>655</b>. Thereafter, the process loops back to block <b>620</b> to reset the period of inactivity.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, a flowchart <b>600</b>B is shown outlining a computer-implemented process for tracking an annoyance period after a device has been put to sleep according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. In particular, the process of flowchart <b>600</b>B monitors a period of inactivity of a device by a user to determine when to put a device and/or resource of the device to sleep, and further to set and track an annoyance timer. In the performance of the process outlined in flowchart <b>600</b>B, the context is associated with a timeout value that indicates when to shut off or hibernate the device and/or resource of the device. The same or similar process in flowchart <b>600</b>B is performed to monitor for periods of inactivity and to set and track an annoyance timer given any context within which the device is operating.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Beginning from transition point A, the process begins at decision block <b>670</b> in which it is determined whether a timeout period corresponding to the timeout value has passed according to the operation timer. In one embodiment, the sleep manager <b>330</b> monitors the operation timer to check if a period of inactivity has surpassed the timeout period. If the timeout period has not passed, then the process returns to block <b>625</b> to continue to track time and wait for any new activity. On the other hand, if the timeout period has passed, then the process proceeds to decision step <b>675</b> to determine if the device and/or the resource or element of the device is asleep. In one embodiment, the sleep manager <b>330</b> determines the activity of the device and/or resource. If already asleep, then the process proceeds to block <b>690</b> to track time in the annoyance timer. On the other hand, if not asleep, then the device and/or resource of the device is put to sleep at block <b>680</b> in order to conserve power dedicated to the device and/or resource. That is, power is conserved when a corresponding timeout period has elapsed in relation to the last activity. In one embodiment, the sleep manager <b>330</b> coordinates the sleeping operation.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In addition, once the device is put to sleep, embodiments of the present disclosure monitors a period of annoyance to receive information related to the user's experience with regards to any current implementation of a timeout value. In one embodiment, the annoyance tracker <b>340</b> sets and monitors any annoyance timer. As such, at block <b>685</b>, an annoyance timer is set to zero. That is, the annoyance period is monitored to check if the user interacts with the device during the short annoyance period, as previously discussed. In addition, at block <b>690</b>, time is tracked in the annoyance timer. Thereafter, the process returns to block <b>625</b> to continue to track time and wait for any new activity.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is a flow chart <b>700</b>A of a computer-implemented process for determining a timeout value when delivering context specific power management of a resource according to an embodiment of the present disclosure. The operations performed in flow chart <b>700</b>A provide a more detailed process for determining a timeout value in block <b>430</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and as such can be performed by the timeout value calculator <b>240</b>, in another embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The timeout value is determined for a given context within which the device is operating. The dynamic calculation of a timeout value takes into account changing conditions affecting the device, and as such embodiments of the present disclosure are able to adaptively adjust the timeout value according to current conditions. Specifically, embodiments of the present disclosure determine a current timeout value for a device based on the usage history of the device by a user within the same or similar contexts.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In block <b>710</b>, positive feedback is determined in the usage history for a plurality of timeout values. In particular, for a given context, user feedback is analyzed for every past timeout value used as a configuration of the device. As such, for every timeout value used positive feedback is noted. In one embodiment, the instances of positive feedback is counted. For example, referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, positive feedback for context-<b>1</b> is stored for various timeout values in rows <b>561</b>A-C.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In block <b>720</b>, negative feedback is determined in the usage history for a plurality of timeout values.

<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In block <b>730</b>, an annoyance value is determined for each timeout value. The annoyance value is based on the positive feedback and the negative feedback collected and analyzed for each timeout value. The annoyance value gives a degree of annoyance associated with the past use of the device (e.g., by a user) for a particular timeout value as applied within a given context.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In one embodiment, the annoyance value is determined by calculating the percentage of negative feedback instances in relation to all feedback instances (e.g., positive and negative feedback).

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">For instance, considering context-<b>1</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, the annoyance value is 33 percent for a timeout value of 5 minutes in row <b>561</b>-A, the annoyance value is 20 percent for a timeout value of 10 minutes in row <b>561</b>-B, and the annoyance value is 10 percent for a timeout value of 20 minutes in row <b>561</b>-C.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In block <b>740</b>, a timeout value is determined based on the annoyance values for each of the timeout values for a given context. In particular, the timeout value that is selected has an annoyance value that fits within a range of acceptable annoyance values. That is, the timeout value is associated with a fraction of negative feedback in the usage history that lies between two user configurable thresholds. For instance, the timeout value may have an annoyance value between an upper threshold and a lower threshold. The upper threshold denotes the highest tolerance level of the annoyance induced by power management (e.g., display power management) for a user. The lower threshold denotes the extent of the energy saving attainable. The timeout value is increased or decreased to balance the trade-off between energy savings and annoyance to the user for a given context. Selection of the timeout value is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a chart <b>800</b> illustrating the relationship of negative feedback to timeout values for a device configured to implement context specific power management of a resource according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

<p id="p-0092" num="0091">As shown, line <b>820</b> represents an upper threshold for an annoyance value. Also, line <b>830</b> represents a lower threshold for an annoyance value. The upper and lower thresholds may vary to adjust the tolerable range of acceptable annoyance values for a given user, device, contexts, combinations of the aforementioned, etc. As a result, a range of tolerable annoyance values that are acceptable lies between the upper threshold and the lower threshold. By plotting annoyance values for context-<b>1</b> for a plurality of timeout values, it is possible to determine timeout values with annoyance values that lie within the tolerable range between the upper and lower thresholds. For example, timeout values from about 11 minutes to 14 minutes have annoyance values within the tolerable range. As such, any timeout value from 11-14 minutes may be selected as the current configured timeout value for the device. For instance, an average of acceptable values may be selected in one embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, a flowchart <b>700</b>B is shown of a computer-implemented process for determining a timeout value for a new context when delivering context specific power management of a resource according to an embodiment of the present disclosure.

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In block <b>760</b>, positive feedback is determined in the usage history for a plurality of timeout values for the relevant contexts.
