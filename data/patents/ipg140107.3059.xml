<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;120 to U.S. application Ser. No. 12/154,481, now U.S. Pat. No. 7,999,186. The present application also claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Japanese Patent Application No. 2007-139350 filed on May 25, 2007, which is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to liquid ejecting apparatuses and signal transmission channels.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Signal transmission cables are used for carrying out transmission of signals between circuit boards of electronic devices. Among these cables, flexible flat cables (FFC), in which conducting wires are arranged in a flat manner having a predetermined spacing, are commonly used for reasons such as their thinness and flexibility. And sometimes, in order to increase the packaging density of the transmission lines, a plurality of flexible flat cables having a small number of conducting wires and narrow widths may be used superimposed on each other. (See, for example, JP-A-2003-112424 and JP-A-2006-309961.)</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">When using flexible flat cables superimposed on each other, ground lines may be arranged at positions in opposition to the transmission lines so as to implement shielding for the signal transmission lines. However, if a relative displacement is caused between the cables for some reason, the position of the ground lines will not be in opposition to the position of the signal transmission line, and a shielding effect may not be achieved satisfactorily.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The present invention has been devised in light of these circumstances, and it is an advantage thereof to enable a shielding effect to be achieved for transmission lines that transmit signals even when a relative displacement has been caused between superimposed cables.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A primary aspect of the present invention for achieving this advantage involves:

    </ul>
    </li>

<p id="p-0032" num="0037">Regarding the Configuration of the Printer <b>1</b></p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram for describing a configuration of a printer <b>1</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a perspective view for describing the printer <b>1</b>. Hereinafter, description is given with reference to these diagrams.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0039">The printer <b>1</b> is provided with a paper transport mechanism <b>20</b>, a carriage movement mechanism <b>30</b>, a head unit <b>40</b> mounted on a carriage CR, a detector group <b>50</b>, a control circuit <b>60</b>, an interface <b>61</b>, and a drive signal generating circuit <b>70</b>. Moreover, the head unit <b>40</b> has a head <b>41</b> on which is mounted a head controller HC. The control circuit <b>60</b> and the drive signal generating circuit <b>70</b> are mounted on a main substrate Base_M that is secured inside the printer <b>1</b>. A relay substrate Base_I for relaying signals from the main substrate Base_M is mounted on the carriage CR. And the main substrate Base_M and the relay substrate Base_I are connected by a relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC. Furthermore, the relay substrate Base_I and the head controller HC are connected by a head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0040">The printer <b>1</b> carries out printing of an image on a paper S based on print data obtained from a computer <b>110</b> via the interface <b>61</b>. In the printer <b>1</b>, the paper transport mechanism <b>20</b>, the carriage movement mechanism <b>30</b>, the head unit <b>40</b>, and the drive signal generating circuit <b>70</b> are controlled by the control circuit <b>60</b>. Under the control of the control circuit <b>60</b>, the paper transport mechanism <b>20</b> feeds the paper S up to a printable position, and transports the paper S by a predetermined transport amount in a transport direction. The carriage movement mechanism <b>30</b> uses a belt <b>31</b> and a carriage motor <b>32</b> for movement of the carriage CR and moves the carriage CR, to which the head unit <b>40</b> is attached, in a carriage movement direction. Moreover, detectors in the detector group <b>50</b> monitor the conditions inside the printer <b>1</b>. And the detectors output their detection results to the control circuit <b>60</b>. The control circuit <b>60</b> receives the detection results from the detectors, and controls the portions to be controlled based on these detection results. The head unit <b>40</b> includes the head controller HC, which includes piezo elements PZT as liquid ejecting sections.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0041">It should be noted that the control circuit <b>60</b> includes a storage section storing, for example, waveform data for generating a drive signal, which is discussed below. Furthermore, the control circuit <b>60</b> outputs pixel data SI, a latch signal LAT, a change signal CH, and a clock signal SCK for transmission, which are discussed below.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0042">The print data used by the printer <b>1</b> is data having a format that can be interpreted by the printer <b>1</b>, and has various types of command data and pixel data SI. Command data refers to data for instructing the printer <b>1</b> to carry out a specific operation. Examples of the command data include command data for directing paper-supply, command data indicating the transport amount, and command data for directing paper-discharge.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0043">The pixel data SI is data relating to the pixels of the image to be printed. Here, the pixels are squares in a virtual grid on the paper, and indicate a region in which a dot is to be formed. The pixel data in the print data is data relating to dots to be formed on the paper (for example, tone values) and is constituted by 2-bit data. That is, the pixel data SI includes a data value [00] corresponding to no dot, a data value corresponding to a small dot, a data value [10] corresponding to the formation of a medium dot, and a data value [11] corresponding to a large dot.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0044">Regarding the Structure of the Head <b>41</b></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a diagram for describing the structure of the head <b>41</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows a nozzle Nz, a piezo element PZT, an ink supply channel <b>402</b>, a nozzle communicating channel <b>404</b>, and an elastic panel <b>406</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0046">In the ink supply channel <b>402</b>, ink droplets are supplied from an unshown ink tank. Then, these ink droplets or the like are supplied to the nozzle communicating channel <b>404</b>. A drive pulse of a drive signal COM to be described later is applied to the piezo element PZT. When the drive pulse is applied, the piezo element PZT contracts in accordance with the signal of the drive pulse, and the elastic panel <b>406</b> is caused to oscillate. Then, an ink droplet of an amount corresponding to the amplitude of the drive pulse is ejected from the nozzle Nz.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0047">In this manner, 90 groups, each constituted by the nozzle Nz, the piezo element PZT, the ink supply channel <b>402</b>, the nozzle communicating channel <b>404</b>, and the elastic panel <b>906</b>, are lined up in a direction facing the paper plane in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, thereby forming a nozzle row. And the head <b>41</b> is a head provided with 10 nozzle rows of a first nozzle row A to a tenth nozzle row J.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0048">Regarding the Signals Used in the Head Controller HC</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0049">Next, description is given regarding a structure of the head controller HC while also describing the pixel data SI, the clock signal SCK for transmission, the latch signal LAT, and the change signal CH, which are used here.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram for describing a configuration of the head controller HC. As mentioned above, the head <b>41</b> used here has 10 nozzle rows. In the head <b>41</b>, a head controller HC<b>1</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is responsible for the ejection of ink from the nozzles of two nozzle rows (when distinguishing and using the head controllers separately, a number is added after the reference symbol &#x201c;HC&#x201d; for the head controller, and when referring to head controllers generally, &#x201c;HC&#x201d; alone is used as the reference symbol). Since the head <b>41</b> has 10 nozzle rows, there are five head controllers HC<b>1</b> to HC<b>5</b> mounted on the head <b>41</b>. Of these, representative description is given here using the configuration of the head controller HC<b>1</b>, which is for ejecting ink droplets from the first nozzle row A and the second nozzle row B. The configurations of the head controllers HC<b>2</b> to HC<b>5</b>, which are for ejecting ink droplets from the third nozzle row C to the tenth nozzle row J, are substantially the same configuration as this.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0051">The head controller HC<b>1</b> is provided with a first shift register <b>81</b>A, a second shift register <b>81</b>B, a first latch circuit <b>82</b>A, a second latch circuit <b>823</b>, a decoder <b>83</b>, a control logic <b>84</b>, and a switch <b>85</b>. And sections other than the control logic <b>84</b>, that is, the first shift register <b>81</b>A, the second shift register <b>81</b>B, the first latch circuit <b>82</b>A, the second latch circuit <b>82</b>B, the decoder <b>83</b>, and the switch <b>85</b>, are provided for each piezo element PZT. And since the piezo element PZT is provided for each nozzle Nz from which ink is ejected, each of these components is therefore provided for each nozzle Nz.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0052">The head controller HC<b>1</b> carries out control so as to cause ink to be ejected based on pixel data SI_AB from the control circuit <b>60</b> (when distinguishing and using separate sets of pixel data of the nozzle rows, the set of pixel data is expressed by adding the reference symbols of the nozzle rows after &#x201c;pixel data SI,&#x201d; for example, here the pixel data is for the first nozzle row A and the second nozzle row B and therefore this is expressed as &#x201c;SI-AB&#x201d;. It should be noted that when referring to pixel data generally, &#x201c;SI&#x201d; alone is used as the reference symbol). That is, the head controller HC controls the switch <b>85</b> based on the print data and selectively applies necessary components in a drive signal COM_A to the piezo elements PZT of the first nozzle row A (when distinguishing and using separate sets of drive signals, the drive signals are expressed by adding the reference symbol of the corresponding nozzle row after the reference symbol of the &#x201c;drive signal COM,&#x201d; for example, when expressing the drive signal to be applied to the first nozzle row A, this is expressed as drive signal COM_A. On the other hand, when referring to drive signals generally, &#x201c;drive signal COM&#x201d; is used). Furthermore, the head controller selectively applies necessary components in a drive signal COM_B to the piezo elements PZT of the second nozzle row B. The drive signals COM are described later.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0053">Here, the pixel data SI_AB is constituted by two bits, and is delivered to the head controller HC in synchronization with the clock signal SCK for transmission. The pixel data SI_AB is constituted by two bits and is determined for each nozzle Nz (for each piezo element PZT). In relation to the pixel data SI_AB, an upper-bit group is set in the first shift registers <b>81</b>A, and a lower-bit group is set in the second shift registers <b>81</b>B. The first shift registers <b>81</b>A are connected to the first latch circuits <b>82</b>A, and the second shift registers <b>81</b>B are connected to the second latch circuits <b>82</b>B. When the latch signal LAT from the control circuit <b>60</b> becomes high (H) level, the first latch circuit <b>82</b>A latches the upper bit of the corresponding pixel data SI_AB and the second latch circuit <b>82</b>B latches the lower bit of the pixel data SI_AB. Each set of pixel data SI_AB that has been latched by the first latch circuit <b>82</b>A and the second latch circuit <b>823</b> (the pair of the upper bit and the lower bit) is input to the decoder <b>83</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0054">The decoder <b>83</b> performs a decoding operation based on the upper bit and the lower bit of the pixel data SI_AB, and outputs switch control signals SW for controlling the switches <b>85</b>. Based on the pixel data SI_AB, the decoder <b>83</b> selects selection data q<b>0</b> to q<b>3</b> outputted from the control logic <b>84</b> and outputs these as the switch control signal SW. Furthermore, the control logic <b>84</b> outputs the selection data q<b>0</b> to q<b>3</b> with timings of the latch signal LAT and the change signal CH. Here, the selection data q<b>0</b> is selection data for no dot. That is, the selection data q<b>0</b> is selection data of the switch control signal SW in the case where no dot is to be formed on the paper S. The selection data q<b>1</b> is selection data for a small dot. That is, the selection data q<b>1</b> is selection data of the switch control signal SW in the case where a small dot is to be formed on the paper S. Similarly, the selection data q<b>2</b> is selection data for a medium dot, and the selection data q<b>3</b> is selection data for a large dot. And the control logic <b>84</b> outputs the selection data q<b>0</b> to q<b>3</b> at the same time through different signal lines.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0055">The switch control signals SW that are outputted from the decoders <b>83</b> are inputted to the switches <b>85</b>. The switches <b>85</b> are switches that turn on and off in response to the switch control signal SW, and apply the drive signal COM_A or COM_B to the piezo elements PZT during the on period. That is, the drive signal COM_A or COM_B from the drive signal generating circuit <b>70</b> is applied to the input side of the switches <b>85</b>, and the piezo elements PZT are connected to the output side of the switches <b>85</b>. Then, when the switch control signal SW is the data value [1] (H level), then the switch <b>85</b> becomes on and the drive signal COM_A or COM_B is applied to the piezo element PZT. And if the switch control signal SW is the data value [0] (L level), then the switch <b>85</b> becomes off, and therefore the drive signal COM_A or COM_B is not applied to the piezo element PZT. It should be noted that a bias voltage VBS_A or VBS_B is applied to the shared electrode side of the piezo elements PZT (here also, when distinguishing and using separate sets of bias voltages, the bias voltages are expressed by adding the reference symbol of the corresponding nozzle row after the reference symbol of the &#x201c;bias voltage VBS,&#x201d; and when referring to bias voltages generally, &#x201c;VBS&#x201d; is used as the reference symbol).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0056">The bias voltage VBS applies a constant voltage to the shared electrode sides of the piezo elements. If no drive signal was generated due to some reason, the voltage applied to the piezo elements would suddenly drop from the voltage of the drive signal to 0 (V). If this happened, the piezo elements PZT would rapidly undergo displacement and there is a risk that ink droplets would be ejected inadvertently. Thus, if a constant voltage is applied to the shared electrode sides, it is possible to prevent the voltage from dropping rapidly to 0 (V) even when no drive signal is generated due to some reason. And it is possible to prevent ink from being ejected inadvertently. It should be noted that the bias voltages used are matched to the drive signals respectively. As mentioned earlier, there are 10 kinds of drive signals. Accordingly, 10 kinds of bias voltages are prepared, these being VBS_A to VBS_J.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0057">Among the above-described signals, the clock signal SCK for transmission is one of the fastest transmitted signals of the pulse signals used in ink ejection control of the printer <b>1</b>. Accordingly, it is prone to becoming a noise source for the other signals. Furthermore, since it is a high frequency signal, it is easily affected by noise from other signals. Accordingly, shielding is preferably implemented for the transmission line of the clock signal SCK for transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0058">Furthermore, the pixel data SI is important data for indicating what size of ink droplet is to be ejected from the nozzles. Supposing the pixel data SI were to be adversely affected by noise from other signals, it would not be possible to form a proper image. Accordingly, shielding is preferably implemented also for the transmission line of the pixel data SI.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0059">Regarding the Drive Signals COM</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a diagram illustrating the drive signal COM that is generated by the drive signal generating circuit <b>70</b> and a control signal that is used during the formation of dots. As mentioned earlier, 10 kinds of drive signals (COM_A to COM_J) are used and since these drive signals have substantially the same function, description is given here using drive signal COM as a general representative term.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0061">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the drive signal COM is generated in a period T as a single unit that is marked by the timings of the rising edges of the latch signal LAT. The period T includes time sections T<b>1</b> to T<b>4</b> marked by the timings of the rising edges of the latch signal LAT or the change signal CH. Furthermore, the time sections T<b>1</b> to T<b>4</b> include drive pulses respectively, which are described later.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0062">The period T, which is a repetitive cycle, corresponds to a period of a time in which the nozzles move by a one pixel portion. For example, in a case of printing with a resolution of 720 dpi, the period T corresponds to a period for moving the nozzle by 1/720 inch. And a certain number of ink droplets are ejected within a single pixel by applying the drive pulses PS<b>1</b> to PS<b>4</b> of each time section contained in the period T to the piezo element PZT based on the pixel data SI, thereby enabling a plurality of tones to be expressed.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0063">The drive signal COM includes a first waveform portion SS<b>1</b> that is generated in the time section T<b>1</b>, a second waveform portion SS<b>2</b> that is generated in the time section T<b>2</b>, a third waveform portion SS<b>3</b> that is generated in the time section T<b>3</b>, and a fourth waveform portion SS<b>4</b> that is generated in the time section T<b>4</b> during the repetitive cycle. Here, the first waveform portion SS<b>1</b> includes the drive pulse PS<b>1</b>. And the second waveform portion SS<b>2</b> includes the drive pulse PS<b>2</b>, the third waveform portion SS<b>3</b> includes the drive pulse PS<b>3</b>, and the fourth waveform portion SS<b>4</b> includes the drive pulse PS<b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0064">The drive pulse PS<b>1</b>, the drive pulse PS<b>3</b>, and the drive pulse PS<b>4</b> are used when ejecting ink from the nozzles Nz, and all have the same waveform. Here, the drive pulse PS<b>3</b> is applied to the piezo element PZT when forming a small dot. And when forming a medium dot, the drive pulse PS<b>3</b> and the drive pulse PS<b>4</b> are applied to the piezo element PZT, and when forming a large dot, the drive pulse PS<b>1</b>, the drive pulse PS<b>3</b>, and the drive pulse PS<b>4</b> are applied to the piezo element PZT. The drive pulse PS<b>2</b> is a micro-vibration pulse for causing micro-vibration in a meniscus, and is applied to the piezo element PZT in the case where no dot is to be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0065">In order to carry out control in this manner, the selection data q<b>0</b> to q<b>3</b> is constituted by 4-bit data, with each bit made to correspond to the time sections T<b>1</b> to T<b>9</b> respectively. And the most significant bit of the selection data q<b>0</b> to q<b>3</b> indicates on/off of the first switch <b>85</b>A in the time section T<b>1</b>, and the second bit indicates on/off of the first switch <b>85</b>A in the time section T<b>2</b>. Similarly, the third bit indicates on/off of the first switch <b>85</b>A in the time section T<b>3</b>, and the least significant bit indicates on/off of the first switch <b>85</b>A in the time section T<b>4</b>. Consequently, the selection data q<b>0</b> for no dot is set to [0100] and the selection data q<b>1</b> for a small dot is set to [0010]. Similarly, the selection data q<b>2</b> for a medium dot is set to [0011] and the selection data q<b>3</b> for a large dot is set to [1011]. And the control logic <b>84</b> outputs each bit of the selection data q<b>0</b> to q<b>3</b> in a time series synchronized with timings prescribed by the latch pulse of the latch signal LAT and the change pulse of the change signal CH.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0066">The drive signals COM require power to drive <b>90</b> piezo elements PZT, and therefore these are signals having a large electric current compared to the other signals. Thus, they can be considered as signals that are prone to affect as noise the other signals that flow through the flexible flat cable. Accordingly, shielding is preferably implemented also for the transmission line drive signal COM.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0067">Other Signals Traveling on the Flexible Flat Cable</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0068">Here description is given regarding other signals that travel via the relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC or the head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0069">A temperature signal TH is a signal for sending temperature information obtained by an unshown temperature measuring instrument attached to the head <b>41</b>. With the temperature signal TH, temperature information of the head <b>41</b> is sent to the main substrate Base_M. In this manner, the temperature signal TH is a signal for sending temperature information and is sent less frequently compared to the aforementioned pixel data SI or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0070">An abnormal heating notification signal XHOT is a signal sent from an unshown abnormal heating alarm attached to the head <b>41</b>. When the head reaches a predetermined temperature or higher, this signal notifies the main substrate Base_M of the temperature abnormality. The abnormal heating notification signal XHOT is almost never outputted and the frequency of its usage is extremely small.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0071">A first power source VDD is a power source for supplying power to the head controller HC from the main substrate Base_M via the relay substrate Base_I. Furthermore, a second power source VDD<b>2</b> is a power source for supplying power from the main substrate Base_M to the relay substrate Base_I. The first power source VDD and the second power source VDD<b>2</b> are constant voltage power sources.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0072">Differential Signals</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0073"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> is a diagram for describing differential signals. In sending differential signals, the signal intended to be sent is sent as a positive differential signal and the signal intended to be sent is further sent by generating an inverted signal. Here, the signal intended to be sent is set as a positive differential signal and the inverted signal of the signal intended to be sent is set as a negative differential signal. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, (a) indicates the signal intended to be sent, (b) indicates the positive differential signal, and (c) indicates the negative differential signal.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0074">Then, after these differential signals are sent via the flexible flat cable, the original signal (the signal intended to be sent) is restored using the positive differential signal and the negative differential signal. Restoring to the original signal is carried out by subtracting the voltage of the negative differential signal from the voltage of the positive differential signal, then halving this voltage value ((d)).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0075"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> is a diagram for describing differential signals when noise is introduced during sending of the signals. Here, a positive differential signal ((b)) and a negative differential signal ((c)) are generated and sent via the cable in a same manner as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>. Suppose that when the signals are sent via the cable, a certain noise N is introduced. Since the positive differential signal and the negative differential signal are transmitted via the same cable, substantially the same noise is introduced.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0076">However, when the original signal is restored using the positive differential signal and the negative differential signal according to the above-described procedure, the noise that was introduced to both of these in a similar manner is offset by the aforementioned process of subtracting voltage values ((d)). By using differential signals in this way, the original signal intended to be sent can be restored even when noise is introduced during transmission of the signals.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0077">Since noise is removed in this manner, it is preferable that noise of the same waveform is introduced to the positive differential signal and the negative differential signal. Furthermore, since the original signal is restored using the positive differential signal and the negative differential signal, it is preferable that the transmission distances for both of these are equivalent and that there is no relative delay in the signal arrival for either of these. Accordingly, it is preferable that the transmission lines of the positive differential signal and the negative differential signal are in close positions in the flexible flat cable.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0078">It should be noted that hereinafter when indicating a differential signal using a reference symbol, &#x201c;+&#x201d; is appended to the positive differential signal of the differential signal and &#x201c;&#x2212;&#x201d; is appended to the negative differential signal. For example, when the pixel data SI is to be sent using differential signals, the positive differential signal of the pixel data SI is &#x201c;SI+&#x201d; and the negative differential signal is &#x201c;SI&#x2212;.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0079">Arrangement of Signal Transmission Lines</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0080"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a diagram for describing an arrangement of signal transmission lines in the relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0081">The relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC is constituted by a first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and a second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> superimposed on each other. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the two flexible flat cables are shown divided for convenience of illustration on paper but these are continuous. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a state in which these two flexible flat cables are arranged superimposed on each other. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the two flexible flat cables are superimposed so as to be in contact with each other, but the two flexible flat cables are not adhered to each other and the flexible flat cables maybe apart from each other. It should be noted that the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> corresponds to a first cable and the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> corresponds to a second cable.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0082">In the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b>, a total of 20 lines of bias voltage VBS transmission lines and drive signal COM transmission lines are lined up alternately from the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. And three ground lines GND are lined up to the right of the drive signal COM_I transmission line. Further to the right, two lines of the first power source VDD transmission lines are lined up. Then 14 lines of ground lines are lined up as a ground line group. A transmission line for the temperature signal TH is arranged to the right of the ground line group.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0083">In the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b>, a total of 20 lines of drive signal COM transmission lines and bias voltage VBS transmission lines are lined up so as to be alternating from the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. And one ground line GND is lined up to the right of the bias voltage VBS_I. Further to the right, transmission lines of differential signals for the change signal CH, the latch signal LAT, the clock signal SCK for transmission, and the pixel data SI_AB, SI_CD, SI_EF, SI_GH, and SI_IJ are lined up. And to the right of this, a ground line GND and an abnormal heating notification signal XHOT transmission line are lined up.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0084">By doing this, the transmission lines of the pixel data SI and the transmission lines of the clock signal SCK for transmission are arranged so as to be in opposition to a region that is covered by the ground line group. Furthermore, two more ground lines are set in the ground line group than the 12 transmission lines for the clock signal SCK for transmission and the pixel data SI. Accordingly, even if the relative positions of the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> become displaced within a range equivalent to a single transmission line, the transmission lines of the clock signal SCK for transmission and the transmission lines for the pixel data SI are positioned at a position in opposition to the region that is covered by the ground line group. The ground line group, which is constituted by ground lines lined up continuously, shields electromagnetic waves from the transmission lines that are in opposition to the region covering the ground line group. Thus, an excellent shielding effect for these transmission lines can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0085">Here, the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and the second relaying flexible flat cable are used superimposed on each other to connect the main substrate Base_M and the relay substrate Base_I. The relay substrate Base_I moves relative to the main substrate Base_M. And when this happens, along with the movement of the relay substrate Base_I, the superimposed flexible flat cables sometimes become displaced in the direction in which their transmission lines are lined up. Even in a case such as this, by using the above-described configuration, an excellent shielding effect can be achieved for the transmission lines in which voltages vary.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0086">In particular, in a case of large size printers or the like, the movement distance of the carriage CR is long and the length of the flexible flat cables becomes longer. When this happens, the signals traveling on the transmission lines become noise and there is a high possibility that they will have an adverse effect on other signals. Furthermore, there is a high possibility that the superimposed flexible flat cables will become displaced in the direction in which their signal lines line up during movement of the carriage CR. Even in a case such as this, an excellent shielding effect can be achieved for the transmission lines in which voltages vary as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0087">Furthermore, ground lines GND are arranged to the left of the transmission line for the clock signal SCK for transmission and to the right of the transmission lines for the pixel data SI_IJ. Accordingly, the shielding effect for the transmission lines of the clock signal SCK for transmission and the pixel data SI can be further increased.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0088"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a diagram for describing an arrangement of signal transmission lines in the head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0089">The head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC is constituted by a first head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>1</b> and a second head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>2</b> superimposed on each other. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the two flexible flat cables are shown divided for convenience of illustration on paper but these are continuous. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a state in which these two flexible flat cables are arranged superimposed on each other. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the two flexible flat cables are superimposed so as to be in contact with each other, but the two flexible flat cables are not adhered to each other and the flexible flat cables may be apart from each other. It should be noted that in this case the first head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>1</b> corresponds to a first cable and the second head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>2</b> corresponds to a second cable.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0090">In the first head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>1</b>, a total of 20 lines of drive signal COM transmission lines and bias voltage VBS transmission lines are lined up so as to be alternating from the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. And a ground line GND is lined up to the right of the transmission line for the bias voltage VBS_I. And lined up further to the right are two lines of the first power source VDD transmission lines and one line of the second power source VDD<b>2</b> transmission line. Then 15 lines of ground lines are lined up as a ground line group.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0091">In the second head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>2</b>, a total of 20 lines of bias voltage VBS transmission lines and drive signal COM transmission lines are lined up alternately from the left in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. And an abnormal heating notification signal XHOT transmission line is lined up to the right of the drive signal COM_I transmission line. To the right of this, a ground line GND, a change signal CH, and a latch signal LAT are lined up. And to the right of this is lined up one ground line GND. Further to the right, transmission lines of differential signals for the clock signal SCK for transmission and the pixel data SI_AB, SI_CD, SI_EF, SI_GH, and SI_IJ are lined up. And to the right of this, a ground line GND and a temperature signal TH transmission line are lined up.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0092">Here also, the transmission lines of the pixel data SI and the transmission lines of the clock signal SCK for transmission are arranged so as to be in opposition to a region that covers the ground line group. Furthermore, two or more ground lines are set in the ground line group than the 12 transmission lines for the clock signal SCK for transmission and the pixel data SI. Accordingly, even if the relative positions of the first head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>1</b> and the second head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>2</b> become displaced within a range equivalent to a single transmission line, the transmission lines of the clock signal SCK for transmission and the transmission lines for the pixel data SI are positioned at a position in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group. As described earlier, the ground line group, which is constituted by ground lines lined up continuously, shields electromagnetic waves from the transmission lines that are in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group. Thus, an excellent shielding effect for these transmission lines can be achieved.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0093">Furthermore, ground lines GND are arranged to the left of the transmission line for the clock signal SCK for transmission and to the right of the transmission lines for the pixel data SI_IJ. Accordingly, the shielding effect for the transmission lines of the clock signal SCK for transmission and the pixel data SI can be further increased.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0094">The first head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>1</b> and the second head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>2</b> are used superimposed on each other to connect the relay substrate Base_I and the head controller HC. Although the relay substrate Base_I and the head controller HC do not move relative to each other, a case is possible where the superimposed flexible flat cables are assembled displaced in the direction of their transmission lines during a manufacturing process of the printer. However, with the above-described configuration, a ground line group constituted by at least three ground lines is lined so as to be in opposition to the signal lines having voltage variation. Thus, even when the flexible flat cables become displaced within a range equivalent to one transmission line in the direction in which the transmission lines are lined up during a manufacturing process of the printer, they can be set such that the transmission lines of noise-source signals are in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0095">Also, a configuration of two flexible flat cables such as the above-described can also be used for connections between a head of a line head printer, where the head is lined up in a paper width direction of the paper, and the controller substrate. Although the head and the controller substrate do not move relative to each other in a line head printer, a case is possible where the superimposed flexible flat cables are assembled displaced in the direction of their transmission lines during a manufacturing process of the printer. In a case such as this, even when the flexible flat cables are undesirably assembled relatively displaced within a range equivalent to one transmission line in the direction in which the transmission lines are lined up during a manufacturing process of the printer, they can be set such that the transmission lines of noise-source signals are in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0096">Furthermore, in a line head printer where the heads are lined up in the paper width direction of the paper, a large number of signals have to be used since there is a large number of heads. Accordingly, there may be a case where more flexible flat cables are used further superimposed on each other, and if the ground lines are lined up as in the above-described embodiment in a case such as this, shielding can be achieved efficiently for the transmission lines in which voltages vary.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0097">Furthermore, here the transmission lines of the clock signal SCK for transmission and the transmission lines of the pixel data SI are arranged so as to be in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group, but it is also possible to arrange this such that the transmission lines of the drive signal COM are in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group. The amount of electric current for the drive signal COM is a larger amount of electric current compared to other signals that travel in the flexible flat cables and presents a risk as a noise source, but by configuring in this manner, the effect on other signals can be lessened.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0098">Furthermore, here, the positive differential signal and the negative differential signal are arranged to so as to be lined up continuously. This is because it is desirable to not produce any relative delay in the signal arrival for either of these by ensuring as much as possible that the transmission distances for the positive differential signal and the negative differential signal are equivalent. Also, it is considered that by arranging these lined up in close positions, even supposing that noise affects these signals, they will be affected by noise of substantially the same form. Since same-form noises are offset against each other in differential signals, it is preferable to arrange these lines in positions as close as possible so that even when noise is introduced, it is the same noise that is introduced.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0099">In the above-described embodiment, transmission lines in which voltages vary are arranged so as to be in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group, but a simpler embodiment where transmission lines in which voltages vary are arranged so as to be in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> is a diagram for describing a condition in which three ground lines are in opposition to a transmission line in which voltage varies. Furthermore, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> is a diagram for describing a condition when ground lines are displaced by approximately one line portion with respect to a transmission line in which voltage varies.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0101">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref>, a single transmission line sg in which voltage varies is positioned so as to be in opposition to a center of a ground line group constituted by three ground lines lined up. Here, the transmission line sg in which voltage varies is a transmission line of the clock signal SCK for transmission, a transmission line of the pixel data SI, or a transmission line of the drive signal COM, and is a transmission line for which shielding is preferable.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows a case where, due to some reason, the transmission line sg in which voltage varies has become displaced with respect to the ground line group within a range equivalent to a single transmission line. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> the single transmission line sg in which voltage varies is arranged so as to be in opposition to the center of the ground line group. Accordingly, even in a case where the ground line group has become displaced with respect to the transmission line sg in which voltage varies within a range equivalent to a single transmission line, the transmission line sg in which voltage varies is positioned in a position in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group. The ground line group, which is constituted by ground lines lined up continuously, shields electromagnetic waves from the transmission line that is in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group. Thus, by configuring in this manner, an excellent shielding effect can be achieved for the transmission line sg in which voltage varies.</p>

<p id="p-0099" num="0104">In the aforementioned embodiment, ground lines were arranged to the left and right of continuously lined up transmission lines in which voltages vary, thereby arranging the ground lines so as to enclose as a group a plurality of transmission lines in which voltages vary.

<p id="p-0100" num="0105">In this way, the ground lines GND are arranged so as to enclose the transmission line sg in which voltage varies, and therefore a better shielding effect can be achieved for the single transmission line sg.</p>

<p id="p-0101" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a diagram for describing an arrangement of ground lines with respect to a transmission line in which voltage varies according to a third embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0107">In a case where there is a large number of signals to be transmitted, or a case where it is desired to reduce the width in which transmission lines are lined in a single flexible flat cable, a greater number of flexible flat cables may be used superimposed on each other.

<p id="p-0103" num="0108">By configuring in this manner, a better shielding effect can be achieved for the transmission line sg in which voltage varies.

<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Other Embodiments</heading>
<p id="p-0104" num="0109">The aforementioned embodiments were described mainly using an example of a small-type printer <b>1</b>, but the aforementioned techniques can also be applied to a large-type printer having a wide paper width and a large movement range of the carriage CR. In a case where the movement range of the carriage CR is large in this manner, the superimposed flexible flat cables may become relatively displaced from each other during movement of the carriage CR, but even in this case, a shielding effect can be achieved for the transmission line in which voltage varies by applying the aforementioned techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0110">Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, the aforementioned techniques may be applied to a line head printer in which a large number of heads are arranged lined up in the paper width direction. In line head printers, a large number of signals have to be transmitted due to the large number of heads, and there is a tendency for there to be many transmission lines. When this happens, a greater number of flexible flat cables may be used superimposed on each other. And then the flexible flat cables may become relatively displaced from each other. However, by applying the aforementioned techniques, the ground lines can be arranged with excellent efficiency while achieving a shielding effect for the transmission line in which voltage varies.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0111">Furthermore, the above-described techniques are applicable to various industrial devices other than printing methods in which printing is carried out by ejecting ink onto paper or the like.

<p id="p-0108" num="0113">Regarding the Head</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0114">In the foregoing embodiments, ink was ejected using piezoelectric elements. However, the method for ejecting liquid is not limited to this. Other methods, such as a method for generating bubbles in the nozzles through heat, may also be employed.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">CONCLUSION</heading>
<p id="p-0110" num="0115">(1) The printer <b>1</b> according to the aforementioned embodiments includes a first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> (or a first head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>1</b>) and a second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> (or a second head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>2</b>). The first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> includes a ground line group in which ground lines are lined up continuously in a plurality of transmission lines lined up in a predetermined direction. The second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> is arranged in opposition to the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and has a plurality of transmission lines lined up in the predetermined direction. And the transmission lines in which voltages vary are arranged so as to be in opposition to a region that is covered by the aforementioned ground line group.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0116">By doing this, even if the relative positions of the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> become displaced in the direction in which the transmission lines are lined up, the transmission lines (SCK, SI, and COM in the foregoing embodiments) in which voltages vary can be positioned so as to be in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group. The ground line group, which is constituted by ground lines lined up continuously, shields electromagnetic waves from the transmission lines that are in opposition to the region covered by the ground line group. Accordingly, even if the relative positions of the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> become displaced for some reason, an excellent shielding effect can be achieved for the transmission lines in which voltages vary.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0117">It should be noted that the transmission lines of the latch signal LAT and the change signal CH may also be set in opposition to the ground line group as transmission lines in which voltages vary.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0118">(2) Furthermore, the number of the ground lines GND lined up continuously in the ground line group is at least three lines.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0119">By doing this, an arrangement can be achieved in which a ground line group constituted by three ground lines GND are caused to be in opposition to a single transmission line in which voltage varies. Accordingly, even if the relative positions of the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> become displaced within a range equivalent to a single transmission line, the transmission line, in which voltage varies, is positioned at a position in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group. Thus, even if the relative positions of the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> become displaced for some reason within a range equivalent to a single transmission line, an excellent shielding effect can be achieved for the transmission line in which voltage varies.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0120">(3) Furthermore, the number of the ground lines GND lined up continuously in the ground line group is at least two lines more than the number of the transmission lines in which voltages vary.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0121">By doing this, an arrangement can be achieved in which a ground line group constituted by ground lines GND of two more lines than the plurality of transmission lines is caused to be in opposition to the plurality of transmission lines, in which voltages vary. Accordingly, even if the relative positions of the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> become displaced within a range equivalent to a single transmission line, the transmission lines, in which voltages vary, are positioned so as to be in opposition to the region that is covered by the ground line group. Thus, even if the relative positions of the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> become displaced for some reason within a range equivalent to a single transmission line, an excellent shielding effect can be achieved for the transmission line in which voltage varies.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0122">(4) Furthermore, in the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> (or the second head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>2</b>), the ground lines GND are further arranged so as to sandwich the transmission lines in which voltages vary.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0123">In this way, the ground lines are arranged so as to sandwich the transmission lines in which voltages vary, and therefore a better shielding effect can be achieved for the transmission lines in which voltages vary.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0124">(5) Furthermore, a third relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>3</b> is further provided in opposition to a reverse side of a side of the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> in opposition to the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and in which a plurality of transmission lines are lined up in the predetermined direction, this being a third relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>3</b> in which transmission lines, in which voltages vary, are arranged so as to be in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0125">By doing this, the ground line group of the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and the ground line group of the third relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>3</b> are arranged so as to sandwich the transmission lines of the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b> in which voltages vary, and therefore a better shielding effect can be achieved for the transmission lines in which voltages vary. Furthermore, in a case where three or more flexible flat cables are superimposed on each other, the ground lines can be arranged very efficiently while achieving an excellent shielding effect for the transmission lines in which voltages vary.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0126">(6) Furthermore, the transmission lines, in which voltages vary, transmit differential signals that are constituted by a signal to be sent and an inverted signal of the signal to be sent.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0127">By doing this, even in a case when noise is introduced while signals are be transmitted via the flexible flat cable, the noise can be negated by using the differential signals, which enables the original signal that was intended to be sent to be easily restored.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0128">(7) Furthermore, the transmission line in which voltage varies transmits the clock signal SCK for transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0129">The clock signal SCK for transmission is one of the fastest transmitted signals of the pulse signals used in ink ejection control of the printer <b>1</b>. Accordingly, it is prone to becoming a noise source for the other signals. Furthermore, since it is a high frequency signal, it is easily affected by noise from other signals. However, since shielding is implemented for the transmission lines for the clock signal SCK for transmission as described above, the effect of noise of other equipment can be reduced. Furthermore, the clock signal SCK for transmission itself becomes less prone to effects from other signals, which enables an accurate clock signal SCK for transmission to be transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0130">(8) Furthermore, the head <b>40</b> for ejecting ink droplets is further provided, wherein the transmission lines in which voltages vary transmit drive signals COM to be applied to the head <b>40</b> for causing the liquid droplets to be ejected.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0131">The drive signal COM is a signal that is generated by current amplification in the drive signal generating circuit <b>70</b> and has a large amount of electric current compared to other signals that travel in the flexible flat cable. Accordingly, although it is prone to affect as noise the other signals traveling in the flexible flat cable, shielding can be implemented as described above for the transmission lines in which voltages vary, and therefore the effect of noise on other signals can be reduced. Furthermore, shielding is implemented for the transmission lines for sending the drive signals COM and therefore the drive signal COM itself becomes less prone to effects from other signals, which enables accurate drive signals to be transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0132">(9) Furthermore, the head <b>40</b> for ejecting ink droplets is further provided, wherein the transmission lines in which voltages vary transmit the pixel data SI as control signals for controlling whether or not the ink droplets are to be ejected.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0133">The pixel data SI is important data for indicating what size of dot is to be formed in the pixel. Supposing the pixel data SI were to be adversely affected by noise from other signals, it would not be possible to form a proper image. However, here shielding is implemented for the transmission lines for the pixel data SI as the transmission lines in which voltages vary, and therefore the effect of noise from other signals can be reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0134">(10) Furthermore, the main substrate Base_M, which connects one end of the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and one end of the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b>, and the relay substrate Base_I, which connects the other end of the first relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>1</b> and the other end of the second relaying flexible flat cable CR_FFC<b>2</b>, are substrates that move relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0135">In a case where the substrates move relative to each other in this manner, the superimposed flexible flat cables sometimes become displaced in the direction in which their transmission lines are lined up. In a case such as this, the transmission lines in which voltages vary can be positioned so as to be in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0136">(11) Furthermore, the connecting section of the relay substrate Base_I, which connects one end of the first head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>1</b> and one end of the second head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>2</b>, and the connecting section of the head controller HC, which connects the other end of the first head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>1</b> and the other end of the second head-connecting flexible flat cable HD_FFC<b>2</b>, are connecting sections that do not move relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0137">Even in a case where the substrates do not move relative to each other in this manner, displacement is possible in the direction in which their transmission lines are lined up in a process of assembling the printer. In a case such as this, the transmission line, in which voltage varies, can be positioned so as to be in opposition to the region that covers the ground line group.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0138">(12) Furthermore, it goes without saying that superimposed flexible flat cables (signal transmission channels), in which the ground lines and the transmission line, in which voltage varies, are arranged as described above, can also be used in other applications.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0139">Although the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been described in detail, it should be understood that various changes, substitutions and alterations can be made therein without departing from spirit and scope of the inventions as defined by the appended claims.</p>
