<heading id="h-0001" level="1">PRIORITY/CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention claims priority of provisional patent application Ser. No. 61/135,639, filed on Jul. 22, 2008, entitled &#x201c;HydraGluv&#x201d;; and is a continuation-in-part application of application Ser. No. 12/474,459, filed May 29, 2009, which is pending, and the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Athletes involved in strenuous aerobic exercise require 6-8 ounces of fluid every 20 minutes of aerobic activity. The most common systems for maintaining hydration include water bottles, stopping at water stations and backpack hydration systems. Water bottles are awkward to run with, require a grip (hence tightening the athlete's arms/shoulders) and result in more plastic bottles in landfills (when using disposable bottled water). Stopping at water stations interrupts the momentum of a person running or biking. Backpack water hydration systems are not comfortable during hot weather and result in considerable additional apparatus to adjust for the runner or biker.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Thus there exists a need for a hydration system that is simple to use and comfortable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A hydration system that overcomes these and other problem is worn on a user's arm. The system has a flexible sleeve, the lining of which may be a soft or a wicking material, integral with a pliable bladder or reservoir. The bladder has a number of water containing expandable ribs that allow the user to regulate the amount of fluid contained in the bladder. The bladder is adhered to the flexible wicking sleeve, and the combined system has a generally cylindrical to tapered cylindrical shape. The sleeve and bladder can be flat pieces which fold together and attach at the edges to form the tapering cylinder. A number of adjustable straps may be attached to the bladder. If present, the elastic straps extend around the bladder and are perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the bladder, and are adjustable by a hook and loop attachment. A cap is detachably connected to an opening of the bladder, the opening of which serves to put fluid into the bladder. A swivel joint may be attached to the cap and provides a fluid passageway between an interior of the bladder and an exterior of the bladder. A flexible drinking straw may extend from an exterior end of the swivel joint or the cap. Whether a swivel joint is used or not, the drinking straw or tube extends from a hand end of the bladder and withdraws water from the sleeve generally from the elbow end of the bladder. The point at which the user drinks water is at the end of the straw adjacent to the hand end, and water is extracted at a point adjacent to the elbow end.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This system has a flexible bladder that contracts as water is withdrawn, which minimizes air intake by the athlete. The draw tube terminates in the region of the bladder adjacent to the users elbow which allows for the maximum extraction of fluid, and allows the water to be consumed by lifting the hand toward the user's face, which automatically causes the user's elbow to be lower than his hand, and allows for extraction of the last liquid from the sleeve. The draw-down straps reduce the sloshing of liquid while exercising. The external end of the drinking straw is positioned between the user's thumb and forefinger, which minimizes extraneous motion for the athlete while running/biking and drinking simultaneously. The wrap-around bladder cushions the arm in case of a fall. The hydration system just slides over the user's arm, with the user's thumb sliding into the thumb loop and forefinger in the forefinger loop, and the user is ready to exercise. This hydration system is comfortable and easy to use.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The hydration system in one form has a tapering or conical shape which fits over a user's arm. When the flexible sleeve is flattened out, it thus has a generally trapezoidal shape, which when rolled and connected edge to edge forms a tapering shape. It has a bladder with water-containing compartments, with the bladder attached to a flexible sleeve which has a soft surface on the side in contact with the user's arm, and which has an &#x201c;elbow end&#x201d; which is worn adjacent to the user's elbow, and a &#x201c;hand end&#x201d; which is adjacent the user's hand when worn. A frame may be attached to the flexible sleeve, and has ribs which fit between the water containing compartments. The frame secures and stabilizes the bladder to the base layer.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Still other features and advantages of the presently disclosed and claimed inventive concept(s) will become readily apparent to those skilled in this art from the following detailed description describing preferred embodiments of the inventive concept(s), simply by way of illustration of the best mode contemplated by carrying out the inventive concept(s). As will be realized, the inventive concept(s) is capable of modification in various obvious respects all without departing from the inventive concept(s).

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The invention relates to a hydration system that is worn on a user's arm. The system has a flexible sleeve made of an elastic materiel. A bladder, made of a pliable material, has a number of expandable ribs with flat regions between the ribs. The bladder is attached or adhered to the flexible sleeve, and the bladder has a generally cylindrical to tapering shape. The outside of the bladder may be cylindrical and the inside tapering to fit the tapering shape of the typical forearm. A number of adjustable straps are attached to the bladder. The plastic straps extend around the bladder and are perpendicular to a longitudinal axis of the bladder. A cap is detachably connected to an opening of the bladder. A swivel joint may be attached to the cap and provides a fluid passageway between an interior of the bladder and an exterior of the bladder. A flexible drinking straw may extend from the swivel joint, through which water may be withdrawn. The flexible drinking straw may be at the hand end of the sleeve, in which case a tube is provided which extends from the hand end of the sleeve to an extraction point at the elbow end of the sleeve. Alternatively, the drinking straw may extend on the outside of the sleeve, from the hand end to the elbow end of the sleeve, with water being extracted from the elbow end in either case.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">This system has a flexible bladder that contracts when water is withdrawn via the drinking straw, which mitigates the user's air intake. The draw tube or the drinking straw terminates at the end of the bladder adjacent to the elbow of the sleeve bladder which allows for the extraction of the maximum of fluid. The draw-down straps reduce the sloshing of liquid while exercising. A drinking end of the straw is positioned at the hand end of the sleeve, and can be between the user's thumb and forefinger, which minimizes extraneous motion of the user when drinking from the hydration system. Having the water withdrawn from the elbow end of the sleeve and the drinking end of the straw at the hand end allows for ease in drinking, by raising the forearm to the user mouth, which automatically causes the water in the bladder to move by gravity to the elbow end, where the drinking straw or draw tube can pick it up.</p>

A pull valve is opened by pulling on the straw <b>22</b> and closed by pushing on the straw <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a cross sectional view of the hydration system <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> along the 2-2 plane in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. This view shows that the side edges of each expandable rib <b>14</b> are joined to the sleeve base, such as by being heat sealed, which could be the process by which the strap <b>16</b> is attached to the bladder <b>12</b>. The interior <b>34</b> of the bladder shows a tube <b>36</b> of the tubing system that connects the interior <b>34</b> of the bladder to the exterior of the bladder. The tubing system includes the tube <b>36</b>, the swivel joint <b>20</b> and flexible straw <b>22</b>. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is an optional bite valve <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a longitudinal cross section view of the hydration system of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. This view illustrates that the tube <b>36</b> terminates at the elbow end <b>38</b> of the bladder <b>12</b> instead of the hand end <b>40</b> of the bladder <b>12</b>. When the hydration system is worn by the user, the elbow end <b>38</b> is generally adjacent to the user's elbow and the hand end <b>40</b> is generally adjacent to the user's hand. When a user moves their hand to their mouth in order to drink, the liquid naturally falls to the elbow end <b>38</b> of the bladder <b>12</b>. This allows the maximum amount of liquid to be extracted from the bladder <b>12</b>. The bladder <b>14</b> may be made of separate compartments which are joined together so that liquid from any compartment may reach the tube <b>36</b> for withdrawal by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a top left perspective of one embodiment of a bladder <b>12</b> of a hydration system in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. This figure shows the bladder laid out flat, with strap loops <b>42</b> that hold the straps <b>16</b>. The bladder <b>12</b> is heat sealed along the edges <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a top left perspective view of a hydration system <b>10</b> in accordance with one embodiment of the invention. This view shows an alternative embodiment where the thumb loops <b>26</b> are in a separate thumb loop straw holder <b>50</b>. The thumb loop straw holder <b>50</b> has a hole <b>52</b> for the drinking straw <b>22</b>. The thumb loop straw holder <b>50</b> is attached to the straw by sliding the straw <b>22</b> through the hole <b>52</b>. The bite valve <b>30</b> is then placed over the tip <b>54</b> of the straw <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an alternative version of the invention, in which the hydration system <b>10</b> forms a tapering or frustoconical sleeve which fits on a users arm. This version provides a better fit for the user because most people's forearms are tapering, and thinner in diameter at the wrist than close to the elbow. In the version of the hydration sleeve shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the flexible sleeve <b>28</b> has attached to it a positioning frame <b>56</b> which has ribs <b>58</b> which fit between the expandable ribs <b>14</b> of the hydration sleeve <b>10</b>. The frame <b>56</b> fits over the bladder <b>12</b> and secures to the flexible sleeve <b>28</b> by Velcro strips <b>60</b>. The bladder is also secured in this embodiment by connecting pins, and other conventional forms of attachment are also possible. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a valve <b>60</b> which is positioned at the elbow and <b>38</b> of the hydration system <b>10</b>. Whether the drinking straw penetrates the bladder <b>12</b> at the elbow and <b>38</b> or the hand end <b>40</b>, the drinking straw <b>22</b> would pick up water from a position at the elbow and <b>38</b> of the hydration system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a view of the hydration system <b>10</b> in which the bladder <b>12</b> is positioned above the flexible sleeve <b>28</b>, but is not attached to it. The frame <b>56</b> is shown in an open position with ribs <b>58</b> and ready for securing the bladder <b>12</b> by sitting between the adjustable ribs <b>14</b>. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a drinking straw <b>22</b> with a bite valve <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a perspective view of the hydration system <b>10</b> with the frame <b>56</b> and Velcro straps <b>60</b>. The bladder <b>12</b> is ready to be attached to the flexible sleeve <b>28</b>, at which time the frame <b>56</b> would be secured over the bladder <b>12</b> and the Velcro straps <b>60</b> would extend around the users forearm and be secured by loops <b>62</b> or other similar structures.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a perspective view of the hydration system <b>10</b> of the invention strapped onto a user's forearm <b>64</b>, forming a tapering cylinder. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a perspective view of the hydration system <b>10</b> mounted on a user's forearm <b>64</b>, showing the Velcro straps <b>60</b> secured through loops <b>62</b>. In any of the system shown, the pickup point for water within the hydration system <b>10</b> would be at the elbow and <b>38</b> of the sleeve. The point at which the user draws in water would be at the hand end. This allows the user to perform a very natural motion of bringing his hand towards his mouth and sucking water out of a straw. When the users hand is at his mouth, it is very comfortable to have the elbow end of the hydration sleeve at a lower point than the hand. Being at a lower point than the hand allows the water in the hydration sleeve to flow by gravity to the elbow end of the hydration sleeve, for pickup by the straw or an internal tube.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The drinking straw <b>22</b> will thus run from the hand end of the sleeve to the elbow end of the sleeve. It can be internal to the sleeve or external to the sleeve. Thus the point at which the straw penetrates the sleeve can be at the hand end or at the elbow end of the sleeve. The flexible sleeve <b>28</b> can have a liner layer which can be separated or integral with the flexible sleeve. The liner layer provides a cushioning and insulating layer for the hydration sleeve, which helps in keeping the water inside the hydration sleeve from being heated by contact with the users form. The liner layer could be in two layers, one for cushioning and softness against the user's skin, and a separate layer providing insulative value between the user and the water. An insulating layer can also be provided on the side of the hydration sleeve which faces away from the user. This would aid in keeping the water at a cooler temperature than would be possible otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The frame <b>56</b> can have straps or panels which are resilient in nature in which stretch over the expandable ribs <b>14</b> of the bladder <b>12</b>. These would provide some resilient force to the expandable ribs, and serve to take up any slack as the water leaves the system and the volume of the bladder becomes smaller. These would also serve to assist in helping the user withdraw water from the bladder. An optional form of the device secures the hydration system <b>10</b> to the user using an integral loop which attaches to the user above the users elbow.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Thus there has been described a hydration system that is easy to use and comfortable. This hydration system has flexible bladder that draws a vacuum while drinking through a straw, which mitigates the user's air intake. The draw tube terminates at the elbow of the bladder which allows for the maximum extraction of fluid. The draw-down straps reduce the sloshing of liquid while exercising. The end of the straw is between the thumb and forefinger, which minimizes extraneous motion when drinking. The wrap around bladder cushions the arm in case of a fall. The hydration system just slides over the user's arm, with the user's thumb sliding into the thumb loop and forefinger into the forefinger loop, and the user is ready to exercise.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">While the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that many alterations, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alterations, modifications, and variations in the appended claims.</p>
