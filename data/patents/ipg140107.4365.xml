<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is the U.S. National Stage of PCT/FR2010/052016, filed Sep. 24, 2010, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to an infrastructure for a PMR professional radiocommunication network.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">PMR (Professional Mobile Radiocommunication) professional communication networks of the TETRA (Trans European Trunked Radio) or TETRAPOL type defined by the TETRAPOL industrial forums (http://www.tetrapol.com) or else of the P25 type defined by the Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) for the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officers (APCO) are independent mobile communication networks dedicated for the use of companies or administrations, particularly for ensuring public safety, industrial safety or for use in transport activities. PMR networks are largely utilized by public safety services (police forces and national police, for example) and emergency services, and also by many other user categories (public transport, airports, etc.). These are private networks that present a high level of security. Current PMR networks, based on the technologies cited above, are known as narrowband networks, characterized by a channel width on the order of about ten kilohertz (kHz).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The structure of professional radiocommunication networks is standardized. The latter are based on a mesh architecture that is common to all types of communication networks. Mobile terminals are connected to the network via wireless access points, called base stations.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">As represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the architecture of a PMR network <b>1</b> of the narrowband type usually comprises:

        <ul id="ul0003" list-style="none">
            <li id="ul0003-0001" num="0007">a radio relay <b>4</b> integrating a transmitter operating in radio transmission/reception and two or three layers:

                <li id="ul0004-0001" num="0008">a physical layer PHY;</li>
                <li id="ul0004-0002" num="0009">a MAC (Media Access Control) type layer;</li>

In particular, in the nominal operating state, applications <b>6</b> ensure the routing and switching of communication data between different terminals <b>7</b>.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0013">The site controller <b>2</b> aims to manage a predefined geographic site or area (known as a resilient area) that one wishes to resiliently protect (resilience is the capacity of the site to continue to operate in case of breakdown, for example of the central controller, the transport network or most of the entities (redundant) of the site). This area is composed of at least one radio relay and at least one cell.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0014">The radio relay <b>4</b> and access means <b>5</b> enable the terminals to have access to centralized communication applications <b>6</b> via a channel <b>8</b> allocated dynamically called trunked.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0015">Therefore, in nominal operation, mobile terminal <b>7</b> has access to centralized applications <b>6</b> that enable it to communicate with terminals attached to a group communication.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0016">However, if the communication channel <b>8</b> established between mobile terminal <b>7</b> and means <b>5</b> is interrupted (typically a loss of connections in difficult places to reach or a network loss), the PMR systems have a critical mission requirement. In this case, the PMR network must enable passage from a nominal operating state (channel <b>8</b>) to an isolated operating state (channel <b>9</b>). The controller <b>2</b> will detect the isolated operating state and must ensure a minimal operation of group communications from the site managed by controller <b>2</b>. Thus, in the case of an isolated operating state, terminals belonging to the same site have access via relay <b>4</b> to a series of basic applications <b>3</b>; This series of basic operation applications <b>3</b> obviously comprises fewer applications than the series of centralized applications <b>6</b> but must ensure vocal communications of groups of site terminals at a minimum.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0017">The evolution of telecommunications networks and the rise of high bandwidth encourage PMR network users to demand applications that are still more advanced, necessitating a higher bandwidth. Consequently, it is important to be able to make PMR networks evolve to the highest broadband widths corresponding to a long range mobile radiocommunication standard of the LTE (Long Term Evolution) or WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) type. These technologies enable very high speed communications such as LTE or WIMAX technologies, unlike 2G or 3G technologies where one distinguishes the circuit switched domains and the packet switched domains, now only having a single packet domain; thus, all services will be offered on IP (Internet Protocol), including those that were previously offered by the circuit domain such as voice, videotelephony, etc. However, it should be noted that requirements peculiar to public networks utilizing very high bandwidth wireless technologies such as LTE or WIMAX are very different from those of PMR networks. Thus, the critical mission and resilience (availability of the network even in case of loss of access to the site controller) concepts peculiar to PMR networks are not taken into consideration in LTE or WIMAX type very high speed technologies that further aim to affect as many users as possible with a high density of radio sites.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0018">Some technologies, such as TETRA, have evolved to TEDS (for TETRA Enhanced Data System) higher speeds in broadband with speeds on the order of some hundreds of kbits/s. However, this significant speed increase compared to narrowband networks only offers some new applications of the e-mail, Internet/Intranet access and low resolution video type. It follows that the progress made by broadband technologies is insufficient and unsuitable for the evolution of current applications and to the increasing needs of different users (typically, mobile video).</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0019">In this context, the invention aims to propose a professional radiocommunication network infrastructure operating in packet mode and enabling data transfer at very high speed while taking the characteristics of PMR networks into account.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0020">For this purpose, the invention applies to a professional radiocommunication network infrastructure operating in packet mode, said infrastructure comprising a site controller with a specified geographic area comprising at least one base station capable of ensuring radio transmission and reception with at least one user terminal located in at least one cell attached to said base station, said infrastructure being characterized in that the infrastructure also comprises centralized management means comprising:

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0031">When said infrastructure is found in a nominal operating state, the following is allocated to each user terminal situated in the specified geographic area and attached to said site controller:
<ul id="ul0011" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0011-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0012" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0012-0001" num="0032">a centralized access channel connecting said distribution gateway to said centralized application via said first attachment means, said user terminal being able to be attached to said first attachment means via said distribution gateway by means of a centralized data channel that is dynamically allocated to it, said centralized data channel passing through said centralized access channel;</li>
        <li id="ul0012-0002" num="0033">a local access channel connecting said distribution gateway to said local communication application via said second attachment means, said user terminal being able to be attached to said second attachment means via said distribution gateway by means of a local data channel that is dynamically allocated to it, said local data channel passing through said local access channel.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0034">When said infrastructure is in a local operating state in the course of which access to said centralized management means is interrupted, only said local access channel is allocated to each user terminal situated in the specified geographic area and attached to said site controller, said user terminal being able to be attached with said second attachment means via said distribution gateway by means of said local data channel that is dynamically allocated to it and passing through said local access channel.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0035">Thanks to the invention, the infrastructure according to the invention enables a PMR network user to have the view and impression of a global standard network. According to the nominal operating state, all standard services (centralized applications and possibly local applications) are available. According to the isolated operating state, all local services (local applications) are accessible: Thus the user has the impression of having access to a network utilizing very high bandwidth wireless technologies such as the full LTE or WIMAX standard technologies of the size of a site.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0036">To do this, one puts a network anchoring point down at the site level and makes the requirements (particularly resilience requirements in the context of a critical mission) of a PMR professional radiocommunication network infrastructure compatible with a broadband network operating exclusively in LTE or WIMAX type packet mode; It is possible to transfer very high speed data so as to be able to propose high-level functionalities to users, for example video transfers in streaming mode able to be used for police services. Radiocommunication networks such as LTE or WIMAX operate in any IP mode; Thus, unlike 2G or 3G networks where one distinguished the circuit switched domains and the packet switched domains, all services here are offered on IP, including those that were offered previously by the circuit domain such as voice or videotelephony.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0037">The infrastructure according to the invention is adapted to PMR network users since it meets the critical mission requirements encountered, for example during a loss of access to the centralized management means in locations difficult to reach. In fact, even if the centralized data channel is interrupted, the user terminals located in the specified geographic area (corresponding to the PMR network resilience area) covered by the site controller may communicate between each other via the local data channel by passing through the radio gateway and the second means of attachment to the packet network. Thus, this advantageous modality ensures communication between different user terminals of the same geographic area specified for managing a crisis situation.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0038">In a nominal operating state, two access channels are allocated to a terminal: a first access channel for the centralized application of the centralized management means and a second access channel for the local application of the site controller; The first channel may be utilized alone but one may also contemplate using the two access channels in a nominal operating state, the two access channels anyway being allocated to the terminal in the nominal operating state.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0039">It should be noted that several centralized application access channels may be utilized simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0040">The infrastructure according to the invention may also present one or more of the characteristics below, considered individually or according to all technically possible combinations:

        <li id="ul0014-0001" num="0041">said centralized management means comprise a database comprising data relative to the right of access of user terminals to said professional radiocommunication network;</li>
        <li id="ul0014-0002" num="0042">in said nominal state, each communicating user terminal situated in the specified geographic area and attached to said site controller is simultaneously connected to said centralized application via said centralized data channel and to said local communication application via said local data channel such that said user terminal only retains said local data channel when said infrastructure switches in its isolated state;</li>

<p id="p-0053" num="0129">When the user terminal <b>23</b> accesses in alternate mode centralized <b>25</b> applications and local <b>30</b> applications, terminal <b>23</b> is attached to the centralized attachment means PDN-GW <b>26</b> via the dynamically allocated centralized data channel <b>34</b> passing through centralized access channel A.

<p id="p-0054" num="0130">The presence of the pre-allocated access channel B will facilitate switching of the infrastructure <b>20</b> from the nominal state to a second operating state, known as the isolated state.</p>
