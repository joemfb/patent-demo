<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An ion source is disclosed including: a chamber disposed about a longitudinal axis and containing a gas, a magnetic confinement system configured to produce a magnetic field in a confinement region within the chamber, an electron cyclotron resonance driver which produces a time varying electric field which drives the cyclotron motion of electrons located within the confinement region, the driven electrons interacting with the gas to form a confined plasma. During operation, the magnetic confinement system confines the plasma in the confinement region such that a portion of atoms in the plasma experience multiple ionizing interactions with the driven electrons to form multiply ionized ions having a selected final ionization state.</p>

<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure is related to ion sources, and more particularly to high intensity ion sources.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Ion sources may be used to generate ion beams useful in a number of applications. For example, the beams may be used to bombard targets to drive nuclear reactions for the production of isotopes.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some ions sources ionize neutral targets via collisions with energetic electrons. Electron Cyclotron Resonant (ECR) plasma sources generate energetic electrons by exciting the cyclotron motion of the electrons within a magnetic field. The ECR plasma source is located in a vacuum chamber to control the gas that is ionized, and to reduce the pressure allowing the electrons to reach ionization energy.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A charged particle placed in a uniform magnetic field will gyrate around the magnetic field with a frequency given by the electron cyclotron frequency.</p>

<p id="p-0008" num="0007">If the magnetic field is not uniform, the electron still gyrates around the magnetic field, but the orbit and frequency become somewhat more complicated. ECR ion sources do not require a uniform magnetic field to operate. In fact, many of them operate in highly non-uniform magnetic fields. By applying an oscillating electric field, the cyclotron motion of the electrons can be excited. If the oscillating electric field is resonant with the electron cyclotron frequency and couples to the electron motion, the electrons will gain energy. The highest coupling would be an electric field that rotated about the magnetic field in the same direction as the electrons, and at the same rate. This electric field would look like a DC electric field in the frame of the electrons. Good coupling can also be obtained with a linear polarized electric field that oscillates perpendicular to the magnetic field. As the electrons gain energy they will collide with any gas within the source, ionizing the background gas. This forms plasma and creates more electrons that can ionize more background gas. This prior art process continues as the plasma density increases until losses are balanced with production.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In prior art devices, the balance occurs long before a powerful beam can be generated, and a powerful beam is what is needed to strike and transmute target material into such things as useful medical isotopes. Many isotopes are, in theory, thought to be useful, but heretofore their small obtainable quantities and short half lives, prevent their use.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The inventors have realized that a high intensity source of multiply charged ions in a selected ionization state may be provided. For example, some embodiments of the devices, systems and techniques described herein produce a high density beam of ions, useful in producing long and/or short half-live isotopes or for use directly (e.g. for the treatment of tumors). Some embodiments produce a beam of multiply ionized particles in selected final ionization state. Some embodiments produce a high density beam of ions that are highly ionized. Some embodiments produce a beam of multiply ionized He relatively economically.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Some embodiments use ion beams to transmute atoms and isotopes into useful isotopes that can not be produced in quantity by other means. Some embodiments enable production of isotopes, heretofore not available in useful quantities.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Some embodiments use ion beams to transmute isotopes, such as those produced in commercial nuclear power plants, into fuel that can be recycled into the reactor. Some embodiments provide a machine which can be sited adjacent a commercial nuclear power plant to transmute long half life isotopes, such as those produced in commercial nuclear power plants, into short half life isotopes which quickly decay into stable atoms without the requirement of transportation or burial.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an Ion beam generator <b>11</b> generates an ion beam and directs it to target <b>12</b> to cause a nuclear reaction, e.g. to transmute atoms in target <b>12</b> to produce a desired isotope. Ion beam generator <b>11</b> includes an ion source <b>10</b> of the type described herein, which produces a beam (e.g. a high intensity beam) including ions in a selected final ionization state. Ion beam generator <b>11</b> also includes a beam accelerator <b>13</b>, which accelerates the beam from source <b>10</b>, and directs it to target <b>12</b>. Optionally, ion beam generator <b>11</b> also includes a filter for filtering ions ion the beam, e.g. based on the charge or mass of the ions. In some embodiments, accelerator <b>13</b> acts as a filter. For example, a cyclotron accelerator will naturally separate ions having different ionization states.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">Beam accelerator <b>13</b> may be any suitable accelerator known in the art. In some embodiments, the accelerator system is a hybrid RFQ-DTL (Radio Frequency Quadrapole&#x2014;Drift Tube LINAC) system available for modification from various vendors. Other accelerator systems such as almost any LINAC or cyclotron could be used.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">A number of coupling methods can be used between ion source <b>10</b> and accelerator <b>13</b>. For high intensity beams, a magnetic lens system is advantageous. For low intensity beams, an electrostatic lens system is more economic, compact, and effective. Generally, using a magnetic lens allows for an easy way to implement a particle filter that will reject any He<sup>+</sup> within the beam where the selected final ion state is He<sup>++</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> shows a system <b>20</b> featuring ion beam generator <b>11</b>. Ion beam generator <b>11</b> bombards target <b>12</b> with ions to transmute atoms in target <b>12</b> to produce a desired isotope. The transmuted target undergoes chemical separation <b>15</b> to provide a pure sample of product isotope <b>16</b>. In some embodiments, product isotope <b>16</b> is an intermediate product, and undergoes decay <b>17</b> resulting in final product <b>18</b>. In some embodiments, the intermediate product is a relatively long lived radio-isotope in comparison to the final product isotope. In some embodiments, final product <b>18</b> is an isotope suitable for use in medical treatment or diagnostic applications, research applications (e.g. radio-marking), energy generation applications (e.g. as nuclear fuel), etc.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows a system <b>21</b> for treatment of nuclear waste <b>500</b>. Nuclear waste (e.g. commercial nuclear waste from power generation, research, or medical use) undergoes chemical separation <b>501</b>. Some long half life waste <b>502</b> not suitable for treatment is transferred to long term storage. Other waste is included in target <b>12</b>, which is bombarded with ions from ion beam generator <b>11</b>. In some embodiments, waste in target <b>12</b> is transmuted into a relatively short half life product <b>504</b> which undergoes decay <b>505</b> to become a stable product <b>506</b>, which may be easily disposed of. In some embodiments, waste in target <b>12</b> is transmuted to usable fuel <b>507</b>, and is thereby recycled.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref> shows a system for medical treatment. Ion beam generator <b>11</b> generates an ion beam which is directed by probe <b>600</b> to human or animal body <b>601</b> in order to treat tissue in the body. For example, in some embodiments, the ion beam is directed to a tumor <b>602</b> in body <b>601</b>. Some embodiments include producing accelerated particles useful in treating interior tumors and the like wherein the particles (such as H<sup>+</sup>, He<sup>++</sup>, C<sup>+4</sup>, C<sup>+6</sup>, or O<sup>+8</sup>) loose energy very slowly until at a certain energy state, substantially all of the particle's energy is transferred to the tumor.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, and <b>2</b>D are operational diagrams of ion producing systems using Helium (He) ions as an example. In order to understand the operation of the devices described herein, it is helpful to understand the issues in generating multiple charged ions. Although the ionization of helium is discussed, the basic conclusions apply to all atoms, even including hydrogen (H) and deuterium (<sup>2</sup>H) where a single electron is striped from the atom to produce a proton (p) or deuteron (d), respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">If an ion source uses electron impact to ionize neutral atoms, the ratio of charge states formed can be determined by the cross sections involved. In the case of helium, the cross section for production of He<sup>++</sup> is more than two orders of magnitude below the cross section for the production of He<sup>+</sup> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>). In general, prior art ionization processes produce around 1% He<sup>++</sup> and 99% He<sup>+</sup>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Changing the electron impact energy does not make a significant change in the production of He<sup>++</sup>. The best overall performance is obtained near the peak of the He<sup>++</sup> cross section, approximately 300 eV. Using saturation of states and some other known tricks, it is possible to generate a few percent He<sup>++</sup> with prior art devices.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">For generating highly ionized states of any other atom, the problem is made more difficult, by introducing more charge states, a greater variation in the cross sections, and more dependence of the cross sections on the electron energy. This can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, where the electron impact ionization for the first seven states of xenon (Xe) are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">It is difficult to obtain He<sup>++</sup> with a single electron collision. If more then one electron collision is used, the fraction of He<sup>++</sup> can be increased greatly because the cross section for production of He<sup>++</sup> from He<sup>+</sup> is significantly higher than for the direct production of He<sup>++</sup> from neutral He (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3C and 3D</figref>).</p>

<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In order to ionize atoms by multiple collisions to reach a selected final ionization state, it is necessary to confine the intermediate states long enough for them to undergo additional electron collisions. In the case of helium, where He<sup>++</sup> is the selected final ionization state, it is necessary to confine the He<sup>+</sup> long enough for it to undergo a second ionizing collision to form He<sup>++</sup>. In the case of other atoms, it is necessary to retain the ion long enough for it to undergo several ionizing collisions to reach the selected state of ionization.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">The systems described herein use a confining magnetic field to retain the ions for the time required to reach the selected ionization state. In some embodiments, an azimuthally symmetric axial minimum magnetic field configuration is used. In other embodiments, a &#x201c;true&#x201d; minimum magnetic field configuration is used. For production of many ion charge states (e.g. He<sup>++</sup>) the simpler axial minimum field configuration seems to be adequate. For production of highly charged states of some atoms, a &#x201c;true&#x201d; minimum magnetic field may be necessary.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows an exemplary ion source <b>10</b>. Ionization chamber <b>30</b> is arranged along longitudinal axis A. Within the ionization chamber <b>30</b>, a local axial minimum magnetic field is formed between two magnetic mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> (field lines indicated with dashed lines), preferably generated by superconducting magnets <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. The local axial minimum field is formed as central region of lower, substantially uniform magnetic field <b>40</b>, (field lines indicated with dashed lines). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows a plot of the magnitude of the fields <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>40</b> as a function of position along axis A for an exemplary field configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As will be described in detail below, uniform field region <b>40</b> provides several beneficial effects which allow for the efficient production of intense ion beams of ions in a selected, multiply ionized state. In embodiments featuring axial minimum configurations, mirror fields <b>32</b>, <b>34</b> and central field <b>40</b> may each be azimuthally symmetric about axis A.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, although superconducting magnets are used in some embodiments, they are not required for production of the mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> in every instance. In some embodiments, the coils of superconducting magnets are easier to adjust as the diameter of the wire can be smaller, leaving more room for field adjustment. Refrigeration systems, not shown, for superconducting magnets are commercially available.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">The central magnetic field <b>40</b> can be implemented using a central magnet <b>42</b>, which may include copper coils, superconducting coils, and/or fixed magnets. Magnet <b>42</b> may include a multi-pole magnet is used to generate a &#x201c;true&#x201d; minimum field configuration (as described below). In some embodiments, this may be implemented using fixed magnets, although electromagnets or other magnets could be used. A superconducting central magnet <b>42</b> is convenient when superconducting magnets <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are used, since the area must be cooled close to absolute zero.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">Exciter system <b>44</b> excites the electron cyclotron resonance of electrons in chamber <b>40</b>. In some embodiments, to produce ECR excitation, the exciter system <b>44</b> introduces microwave energy into the ionization chamber <b>30</b> directly. In typical embodiments the center field magnetic region <b>40</b> between the two magnetic mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> is substantially uniform (constant magnetic field) although a non-uniform magnetic field will operate. Preferably, the rear part <b>47</b> of the ionization chamber <b>30</b> includes a connection <b>48</b> to a gas source <b>50</b>, when a gas to be ionized is introduced into the system. In other embodiments, the gas can be introduced anywhere a convenient connection can be made. A perforated plate <b>52</b> separates the chamber <b>30</b> from a vacuum pump <b>54</b> to maintain a slight gas pressure within the chamber <b>30</b> and produce a beam <b>56</b> of the desired ions from the plasma <b>57</b> confined between mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">The ECR exciter system <b>44</b> provides an electric field that couples to the electron cyclotron motion of electrons in chamber <b>30</b>. Since the electron cyclotron frequency is generally high, the ECR drive tends to be in the microwave frequencies. For these frequencies, wave guides provide the most efficient coupling. ECR coupling, however, is not limited to wave guides, and can be accomplished in other ways, such as cavity mode excitation, optical drive, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">If a gyrotron, or other circular wave guide device, is used as an ECR source, good performance will typically be obtained when the rotation direction of the wave within the wave guide is matched to the rotation direction of the electrons in the magnetic field <b>40</b>. The position of the ECR drive output <b>55</b> and gas feed <b>48</b> can be optimized so that plasma is primarily produced between the two magnetic mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. In some embodiments, this increases the overall efficiency and minimizes the plasma production in the rear part <b>47</b> of the chamber <b>30</b>, which can simplify the microwave feed system.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The frequency and power in the ECR drive system <b>44</b> are related to the plasma density produced. Higher frequency and power both typically correspond to a higher plasma density. The optimal power and type of ECR source may be adjusted for each type of ion.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">The substantially uniform central magnetic field <b>40</b> between the two magnetic mirrors <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> will operate for a wide range of lengths. The optimal length may be readily determined experimentally for each ion, selected final ionization state, beam intensity, beam pulse length, and ECR power. Increasing the length of the central magnetic region <b>40</b> increases the region over which hot electrons are confined, and thus increases the potential for ionizing collisions. Making this region larger increases the ionization, but at the expense of increasing the time it takes to form a stable plasma. Optimally, a pair of superconducting magnets <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are used. Such magnets may not allow for significant variations in the length of the magnetic field <b>40</b>, because they are not easily relocated. For production of He<sup>++</sup>, this is typically not an issue. But for production of other highly charged ions, more easily movable magnets may be used to allow adjustment the magnetic fields.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In some embodiments, the central magnetic field <b>40</b> is chosen to match the ECR frequency of the microwave source <b>44</b>. The exact values of the mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are not critical to the operation of the system <b>10</b>, but may have a large impact on system efficiency. In some embodiments the rear mirror field <b>32</b> is higher then the front mirror field <b>34</b> (e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). A beam may be formed by allowing ions to leak out of the mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. By making the rear mirror field <b>32</b> higher than the front mirror field <b>34</b>, most of the ion losses, which form the multiply ionized particle beam <b>56</b>, are through the front mirror field <b>34</b>.

Using a higher value of the front field <b>34</b> increases the confinement of the ions and electrons, but can cause instabilities in the flow of the plasma <b>57</b>. Using a lower value field decreases the fraction of ions trapped between the mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>.

An adiabatic invariant remains invariant so long as the rate of change of the parameters is &#x201c;slow&#x201d;. &#x201c;Slow&#x201d;, means that the magnetic field and the perpendicular velocity change slowly over one cyclotron period. In typical embodiments of the magnetic mirrors described herein, this is generally an excellent approximation, except possibly during extraction of the beam <b>56</b>. The invariance of the magnetic moment indicates that if the particle moves from a region of small magnetic field to a region of large magnetic field, the perpendicular velocity must increase. By conservation of energy, this means that the parallel velocity must decrease. Thus, if a particle with a given perpendicular velocity moves from a region of low magnetic field to a region of sufficiently high magnetic field, the parallel (axial) velocity will go to zero, thereby stopping the particle. As is familiar to those skilled in the art, a more through analysis of the particle dynamics shows that, in fact the particle will be reflected.

the non-reflected particles can be visualized as a cone <b>58</b> in velocity space, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.
</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Generally magnetic mirrors fields, such as magnetic mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> leak. Particles in the loss cone <b>58</b> leak out of the front mirror field <b>34</b> (or the back mirror field <b>32</b>). Particles that are not in the loss cone <b>58</b> are eventually scattered into the loss cone <b>58</b>. The systems described herein, in various embodiments, rely on this scattering to move the particles into the loss cone <b>58</b> that will then pass through the front magnetic mirror field <b>34</b> and form a source of ions.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, during source operation microwaves are used to excite the ECR in the central region <b>40</b> in chamber <b>30</b> of the source. This generates hot electrons that ionize the background gas. For He<sup>++</sup> production, the preferred electron energy is around 200-300 eV. For other atoms, the preferred electron energy may easily be experimentally determined by the energy required to produce the desired charge state and/or the peak of the cross sections involved.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">Considering first the production of alpha particles (He<sup>++</sup>) the hot electrons generate mostly He<sup>+</sup> and some small amount of He<sup>++</sup>. Some of the generated He<sup>+</sup> is trapped between the magnetic mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> and undergoes a second collision forming He<sup>++</sup>. Gradually, the He<sup>++</sup> and He<sup>+</sup> are scattered into the loss cone <b>58</b> where they leak out, primarily through the front mirror field <b>34</b>, forming the beam <b>56</b> of He<sup>+</sup> and He<sup>++</sup>. Generally the description focuses around alpha particles (<sup>4</sup>He<sup>++</sup>), but the same discussions apply equally to helium-3 ions (<sup>3</sup>He<sup>++</sup>) or other doubly ionized ions.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">The plasma beam <b>56</b> of He<sup>+</sup> and He<sup>++</sup> in a ratio (determined as the ratio of the beam current of He<sup>++</sup> to total beam current) of up to 84% He<sup>++</sup> or more leaking from the front mirror field <b>34</b> is producible using an ECR system <b>44</b> only, is accelerated by a extractor <b>59</b> which may include a sequence of electrodes and focusing elements to form the particle beam <b>56</b>. In cases where it is desirable to transmit the beam <b>56</b> to a magnetic field free region, the extraction system can be designed to make sure that particles remain adiabatic until the particles are out of the magnetic field <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">If the plasma flow out of the magnetic field zone remains adiabatic, the mirror relations can be applied. As the particles travel from the high magnetic field to the low magnetic field, perpendicular energy is converted to axial (parallel) energy. This keeps the emittance of the beam <b>56</b> low during the particle extraction. A non-adiabatic extraction of the beam <b>56</b> results in perpendicular energy of the beam <b>56</b> being retained and the extracted beam <b>56</b> has larger emittance.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">There are four known major sources of particle losses in the plasma system <b>60</b> of the present invention. These are: recombination, charge exchange, radial diffusion, and loss cone scattering (axial diffusion).</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">In typical embodiments, Recombination is not a significant effect. Generally, the electrons in the plasma system <b>57</b> are at a very high energy. As a new electron is liberated in an ionizing collision, it rapidly gains energy. Therefore, recombination between the energetic electrons and the ions is not significant.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Charge exchange affects only the multiply charged ions. If an electron is transferred from He to He<sup>+</sup>, the result is the same number and composition of ions, that is, the He becomes He<sup>+</sup> and the He<sup>+</sup> becomes He. If an electron is transferred from He to He<sup>++</sup>, however, the result is two He<sup>+</sup> ions, so a He<sup>++</sup> ion was lost. In the case of the devices described herein, the ion energy can be sufficiently low that charge exchange is not a significant problem.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Radial diffusion is not an issue if the central magnetic field <b>40</b> is large. If the cyclotron orbit of an ion is small compared with the size of the ionization chamber <b>30</b>, radial diffusion is very slow and particles are scattered into the loss cone <b>58</b> faster than they diffuse radially.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In typical embodiments, scattering into the loss cone <b>58</b> is the primary loss method for particles. The system <b>10</b> requires this scattering process in order to generate the beam <b>56</b> from the plasma <b>57</b>. Loss cone scattering of He<sup>++</sup> is desirable as this forms the extracted ion beam <b>56</b>. Loss cone scattering of He<sup>+</sup>, however, is not desirable as it causes He<sup>+</sup> to enter the beam <b>56</b>, thus increasing the percentage amount of He<sup>+</sup> in the beam <b>56</b>. He<sup>+</sup> ions in the beam <b>56</b> can be separated from the He<sup>++</sup> ions using a mass ion filter <b>61</b>, but this decreases the beam intensity, increases the emittance, and decreases the overall beam efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">The hot electrons generated by the ECR source <b>44</b> have a non-isotropic distribution, with the perpendicular energy being much larger then the axial energy. Ions generated by the collisions with the electrons also have a non-isotropic distribution with more of the energy perpendicular to the magnetic field <b>40</b> than parallel. Given a mirror ratio near 2 (B<sub>mirror</sub>/B<sub>central</sub>), somewhat more than half the formed He<sup>+</sup> is confined by the mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>, and somewhat less than half the He<sup>+</sup> is not confined and leaves the mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> on the first pass. Some of the initially unconfined particles exit from the rear mirror field <b>32</b> and the rest exit from the front mirror field <b>34</b>. Depending on the particle densities and temperatures, geometric considerations, and some other parameters, the produced beam <b>56</b> will typically be between 50-90% He<sup>++</sup> and 50-10% He<sup>+</sup>. The exact ratio of He<sup>+</sup> to He<sup>++</sup> in the generated beam <b>59</b> depends on a complicated set of relations between gas density, ECR power, source geometry, and magnetic field geometry. The exact ratio can be determined experimentally and optimized to produce a desired beam ratio <b>56</b>. As noted above, beam ratios of 84% or greater have been experimentally demonstrated using devices of the types described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The ratio of highly multiply ionized particles can be increased by using an ICR (Ion Cyclotron Resonance) exciter system <b>62</b>, although for He<sup>++</sup>, it may not be needed. This system <b>62</b> uses antennae <b>68</b> in the chamber <b>30</b> between the mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> to emit at the radiation proper frequency to couple energy into the ion cyclotron resonance of He<sup>+</sup> ions, thus coupling energy into the perpendicular motion of the He<sup>+</sup> ions. In general, the axial (parallel) velocity of the particles remains unchanged by ICR excitation. Increasing the perpendicular energy pushes the driven particles out of the loss cone <b>58</b>. In some embodiments, by using ICR excitation, the scattering rate of He<sup>+</sup> into the loss cone <b>58</b> can be reduced to nearly zero.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">In reality, the He<sup>+</sup> ions cannot be kept out of the loss cone <b>58</b> indefinitely. Given sufficient time, particles will be scattered into the loss cone <b>58</b>. This scattering basically is converting some of the particle's perpendicular energy into parallel energy. The ICR excitation can then add more perpendicular velocity and push the particle back out of the loss cone <b>58</b> again, but eventually, the parallel energy will get sufficiently high that the particle will escape the mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">The goal is not to keep ions out of the loss cone <b>58</b> indefinitely, but rather just long enough to undergo a multiple ionizing collisions. When the system <b>10</b> is operated at a high plasma density, these multiple ionizing collisions occur faster than scattering into the loss cone <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">When the ICR excitation is used, the system <b>10</b> operates as follows. Microwaves excite the ECR in the central magnetic region <b>40</b> of the chamber <b>30</b>, which generates hot electrons. These electrons ionize the background helium gas producing mostly He<sup>+</sup> ions, but also some He<sup>++</sup> ions. The ICR system <b>62</b> excites the He<sup>+</sup> resonance in the central magnetic region <b>40</b>. The He<sup>+</sup> ions are trapped between the two magnetic mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> where a second collision with an electron causes a second ionization to produce He<sup>++</sup>. The ICR excitation does not couple to the He<sup>++</sup> ions, which have twice the cyclotron frequency. The He<sup>++</sup> ions are scattered into the loss cone <b>58</b> where they exit the chamber <b>30</b> as the ion beam <b>56</b>. In some embodiments, most of the He<sup>++</sup> exits via the front mirror field <b>34</b>, which is lower. In some embodiments, the height of the back mirror field <b>32</b> should be as high as possible, or at least higher than the front mirror field <b>34</b>. However, system <b>10</b> may operate even when front mirror field <b>32</b> is equal to or substantially equal to back mirror field <b>34</b></p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">In some embodiments, the ICR excitation causes the density of the plasma to increase until losses balance production. In the limit, where the ICR exciter <b>62</b> can hold the He<sup>+</sup> out of the loss cone <b>58</b> indefinitely, the plasma density will increase until the production of He<sup>+</sup> is equal to production of He<sup>++</sup>, which equals the rate that He<sup>++</sup> is scattered into the loss cone <b>58</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Most of the above examples have focused on helium. Helium has only two charge states so it is easy to see how system <b>10</b> can produce a high density ion beam <b>56</b> of He<sup>++</sup>. The same technique can also be used to produce multiply ionized ions in a selected final ionization state of almost any other atom, especially when the ICR system <b>62</b> is used. However, when working with other atoms (e.g. those with more than two ionization states), several issues are notable.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">First, depending on the ionization state and the atom required, it may be necessary to increase the electron energy of the ECR heated electrons. This can be done by increasing the power in the ECR source <b>44</b> and/or by decreasing the cooling effects on the electrons. Under the correct conditions one may obtain electron energies as high as 600 to 1000 keV. In order to obtain very high electron temperatures, it may be necessary or desirable to add a radially confining multipole field to the center region <b>70</b> of the magnet system, creating a &#x201c;true&#x201d; minimum magnetic field configuration. In some embodiments, a radially confining multipole magnet <b>72</b> (e.g. a hexapole, or higher order multipole magnet) may be used. This may have some real advantages if an ICR exciter system <b>62</b> is used. As described in more detail below, the higher order multipole magnet <b>72</b> localizes the field effects to the outer radial edge of the plasma <b>57</b> and leaves the central part of the plasma <b>57</b> (located proximal to axis A) unaffected. The &#x201c;true&#x201d; minimum magnetic field configuration provides a form of insulation between the plasma <b>57</b> and the wall <b>76</b> of the chamber <b>30</b> and makes it easier to obtain high temperature electrons.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0154">Second, if the ICR exciter system <b>62</b> is used, there is a question of what ICR frequency to use. When there are several ionization charge states available, so there will be several potential ICR exciter frequencies:</p>

In some embodiments, one frequency is chosen for excitation. Generally, exciting the lowest ionization state provides the most increase in production of any higher states. It is also possible to excite multiple states, or all states. For example if the desire was to produce O<sup>+8</sup>, useful in treating inoperable tumors, an ICR excitation system could be provided with multiple antennae that excite the ICR resonances of O<sup>+</sup>, O<sup>++</sup>, O<sup>+3</sup>, O<sup>+4</sup>, O<sup>+5</sup>, O<sup>+6</sup>, and O<sup>+7</sup>, thus preferentially holding all oxygen ions other than O<sup>+8 </sup>within the chamber <b>30</b>.

<p id="p-0157" num="0156">The system <b>10</b> includes a positive source <b>78</b> to bias the chamber <b>30</b> at high potential in order to accelerate the ions extracted. Therefore a number of insulators <b>80</b> are necessary to allow the system <b>20</b> to be biased at different voltages and to electrically isolate the chamber <b>30</b> to provide operator safety.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0157">There are a number of different ways to implement insulator systems. These include, but are not limited to the embodiments of system <b>10</b> shown in of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, <b>2</b>C, and <b>2</b>D. The configurations shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref> are just variations of each other with insulators <b>80</b> used to electrically isolate the vacuum pump <b>54</b>, the ECR source <b>44</b> and the atom source <b>50</b>. The system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref> is significantly different in that the entire outer wall <b>86</b> of the chamber <b>30</b> is biased at ground. An internal bias liner <b>88</b> is used to control the plasma bias and thus the extraction energy of the ions. In terms of fabrication, in some embodiments this may be somewhat more complicated, but may provide greater operator safety in that it is more difficult for an operator to come in contact with the high voltage. With an inner bias liner <b>88</b>, the liner <b>88</b> could be placed either inside or outside of the ICR antenna <b>90</b>. In some cases, it may be possible to use the ICR antenna <b>90</b> itself as a bias liner <b>88</b>, but if the bias liner <b>88</b> is placed inside the ICR antenna <b>90</b>, it must contain at least one slit to prevent shorting out the ICR drive.</p>

<p id="p-0160" num="0159">An external antenna design can be generalized to work with most antennas. In most cases an insulating chamber wall can be used.

<p id="p-0161" num="0160">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, an ICR exciter system <b>62</b> includes an RF drive system <b>96</b>, an antenna <b>90</b>, and a tuning system <b>100</b>. The goal is to generate an electric field that will couple to the ion cyclotron motion. An electric field rotating in the same direction as the ions provides the highest coupling, but other combinations such as linear or radial electric fields also work. Generally the ICR frequencies are in the RF range and the antenna <b>90</b> is fed from coaxial lines <b>102</b>. A capacitor/inductor network normally is used within the tuning system <b>100</b> to match the antenna <b>90</b> with the driver system <b>96</b>. In typical embodiments, the magnetic field in the region where the ICR exciter is applied should be relatively constant so that the cyclotron frequency of the ions is well defined. Central uniform field region <b>40</b> meets this requirement. Depending on how the antenna <b>90</b> is implemented and how the insulator system is implemented, the antenna <b>90</b> may be at high voltage. Coupling between the antenna <b>90</b> and RF drive system <b>96</b> can be provided using a transformer or capacitors in order to provide isolation between the systems.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0161">A number of different antenna systems such as antennae <b>90</b>, can be used for the ICR exciter <b>62</b> These include, but are not limited to: cavity excitation, capacitor plates, split-ring, and filer. Cavity excitation simply couples to the cavity mode of the chamber <b>30</b> using a loop (not shown) or some other type of exciter.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0162">The optimal antenna design may depend strongly on the specific ion and charge state desired. For production of multiply charged ions other than doubly charged ones, it may be desirable to drive the antennae at multiple frequencies.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0163">Capacitor plate antennas can be either linear (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>) or circular drive (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>). In the case of linear drive the two plates <b>104</b> and <b>106</b> are driven to generate an oscillating electric field. In the case of a circular drive, vertical plates <b>108</b> and <b>110</b> are driven 90&#xb0; out of phase with the horizontal plates <b>104</b> and <b>106</b>, generating a rotating electric field. In other embodiments, other phase angles may be used, thereby generating elliptical drive radiation. Note also that although the terms vertical and horizontal are used here for convenience to describe the relative positioning of the plates, the antenna plates may be oriented arbitrarily in chamber <b>30</b>. The exact structure of the plates is unimportant, other than that they provide an electric field perpendicular to the magnetic field <b>40</b>. In some embodiments, capacitor plate antenna (or other antenna type) may be used in exciter system <b>62</b> to produce output at multiple frequencies</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0164">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a split-ring antenna <b>111</b> consists of a coil of wire (or tubing to allow cooling) <b>112</b> wrapped around a Faraday shield <b>114</b>. The Faraday shield <b>114</b> prevents the helical electric field of the coil <b>112</b> from reaching the plasma <b>57</b>. The lengthwise slit <b>116</b> in the metal of the Faraday shield <b>114</b> allows a mostly linear component of the electric field to reach the plasma <b>57</b>, which couples to the ion cyclotron resonance. The actual electric field is more like radial arcs coming from the slit <b>116</b>, but this couples to ion motion with about the same efficiency as a linear drive system.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0165">In cases where an internal bias liner is used, e.g. as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, it is possible to use the Faraday shield <b>114</b> as a bias liner inside the ICR exciter system <b>62</b>. A variation of this arrangement, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2D</figref>, is to use a non-conducing vacuum wall insulator <b>80</b> and place the ICR antenna external to the chamber <b>30</b>, and use the Faraday shield <b>98</b> as a bias liner inside the chamber <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0166">An external antenna design can be generalized to work in most configurations. In most cases, the chamber <b>30</b> can include an insulating chamber wall <b>80</b> so that the ICR antenna <b>68</b> can be located in a region of ambient pressure, outside of the chamber <b>30</b>. A bias liner <b>98</b> containing one or more slits <b>116</b> (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) can be used inside the chamber <b>30</b> to control the plasma bias without interfering with the ICR excitation.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0167">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a filer antenna <b>124</b> contains a number of helical conductors, <b>126</b> and <b>128</b> shown, in which currents are driven. Depending on the type of filer, either a linear drive field or a rotating (i.e. circular or elliptical) drive field is generated. For a rotating drive field, as shown, there are actually two filers <b>130</b> and <b>132</b> that are constructed perpendicular to each other having helical conductors <b>126</b> and <b>128</b>, and <b>135</b> and <b>136</b>. The two filers are driven 90&#xb0; out of phase to generate a rotating electric field. A simple filer antenna would have only one of the two filers <b>130</b> or <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0168">In addition to the other variations in the ICR antenna systems <b>60</b> discussed above (cavity excitation, capacitor plates, split-ring, and filer) an untwisted filer antenna <b>140</b> can be used. As shown, untwisted filer antenna includes two filers <b>141</b> and <b>142</b>. In some embodiments a singe untwisted filer may be used. In this case, one of filers <b>141</b> and <b>142</b> would be omitted.</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0169">The bi-filer antenna <b>124</b> is basically a twisted set of current carrying wires. The wires on opposite sides of the plasma <b>57</b> carry current in opposite directions. These wires combine to generate a magnetic field in the center of the plasma <b>57</b>. As the current oscillates, the generated magnetic field oscillates, and induces an electric field in the center of the plasma <b>57</b>. A single filer antenna generates a linearly polarized excitation and the bi-filer antenna typically generates a rotating excitation field (circularly or elliptically polarized). Generally inductive antenna systems (such as the filers) have advantages over electrostatic antennas (such as capacitor plates). This is because the high density plasma <b>57</b> tends to screen out the electric field generated by electrostatic antennas, thus such antennae primarily couple to the plasma <b>57</b> only at the outer edge of the plasma <b>57</b>. Inductive antennae drive though an induced electric field that is generated by an oscillating magnetic field. The magnetic field can pass through the plasma <b>57</b> and thus the drive field is located everywhere in the plasma <b>57</b>, and generally is peaked on the axis of the chamber <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0170">Typically a filer antenna <b>124</b> has a twist in it to prevent charge separation in the plasma <b>57</b>. In the present invention, the twist is not needed. The short length of the source allows the particles at the end of the plasma <b>57</b>, where the drive field is weak, to provide neutralization, thus charge separation is not a large problem. Further neutralization is provided by plasma rotation, which prevents the antenna, such as bi-filer <b>124</b>, from driving only over one part of the plasma <b>57</b>. The plasma rotation is due to the slight non-uniformity of the plasma <b>57</b> as ions and electrons are lost at slightly different rates, resulting in a slight charge imbalance that equalizes these two loss rates (ambipolar potential). This charge imbalance gives rise to a radial electric field, which combined with the axial magnetic field gives rise to plasma rotation.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0171">The untwisted-filer antenna <b>140</b> has advantages that it will couple to the ions going both directions in the source. The twisted-filter antenna imposes a Doppler shift on the ICR drive field. This means the drive field couples to particles with a cyclotron frequency given by &#x3c9;&#xb1;k<sub>z</sub>v<sub>z </sub>(where the sign is determined by the direction of the antenna twist relative to the direction of ion cyclotron rotation, and k<sub>z </sub>is determined by the structure of the filer). The twisted-filer can be matched to particles going one direction in the device (say positive-z), but not the other direction, since the sign of the axial velocity will change. The untwisted-filer has k<sub>z</sub>=0, thus it will couple to particles going both directions in the device. This allows the ICR exciter to couple to more of the plasma.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0172">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref>, system <b>10</b> may be operated in resonant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>) or sub resonant (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>) ECR modes. In the resonant mode, ECR source <b>44</b> produces microwaves are resonant with the ECR motion of electrons the uniform field <b>40</b> (resonant zone <b>200</b> located between the two mirrors fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>). This zone corresponds to a cylindrical volume about axis A in region <b>70</b> of chamber <b>30</b>. This arrangement provides the highest coupling between the electrons and the microwaves.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0173">The general requirements on the uniformity of the central field for the resonant mode can be expressed as a relation between the electron confinement time and the electron de-correlation time.

If the electron motion is driven by an ECR drive generating a rotating electric field that rotates in the same direction as the electron, the electron can gain energy. If the drive frequency (&#x3c9;<sub>ECR</sub>) exactly matches the electron cyclotron frequency the electron will continue to gain energy until relativistic corrections to the electron motion become significant. In typical embodiments this is not a significant issue as relativistic corrections will be come significant when the electron energy becomes a significant fraction of the electron rest energy. (The electron rest energy is 512 keV and, for many embodiments, target electron energies are 200-300 eV for alpha particle production, and about 1 keV for production of C<sup>6+</sup>).

<p id="p-0176" num="0175">If the drive frequency does not exactly match the electron cyclotron frequency, then the electron will first gain energy then loose energy, and then gain it again.

</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0178">In some embodiments, the field is not completely uniform. In such a case, the cyclotron frequency can be replaced with an average cyclotron frequency experienced by the electron. Or more accurately an average value over all the electrons of the average cyclotron frequency experienced by each electron.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0179">Given these conditions we can express a sufficient condition on the uniformity of the field as the de-correlation time must be longer or on the order of the electron confinement time in the device. For the on resonant mode, when this condition is met, the field may be considered to be substantially uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0180">In some embodiments field <b>40</b> is uniform to 1% or less, 5% or less, 10% or less over a region extending axially 5 cm, 10 cm, 15 cm, 30 cm or greater, while the mirror-to-mirror distance is 60 cm.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0181">In some cases, operation in the resonant mode may result in too energetic electrons. For example, in the case of formation of He<sup>++</sup>, the peak of the cross sections for all formation methods is between 200-300 eV. Given sufficient power and coupling, electron temperatures well above 10 keV can be generated. These high energy electrons are not useful for the formation of the He<sup>++</sup>, and tend to produce unwanted X-rays. The electron temperature can be controlled by manipulating the microwave power, gas pressure, the length of the resonant zone(s) and electron confinement time.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0182">An alternative system, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, for controlling the electron temperature is to adjust the magnetic field in the central region <b>40</b> such that the ECR drive is detuned from the uniform field <b>40</b>. This is referred to herein as the sub-resonant mode. This mode restricts the microwave coupling to zones <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> localized on each end of the chamber <b>30</b> adjacent the mirror field zones <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> (in contrast to the large cylindrical volume in which coupling occurs in resonant mode operation). The lower the central field <b>40</b>, the smaller these zones <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> become. This method has the advantage that high microwave power in this configuration corresponds mostly to high electron (and plasma) density and not to high electron temperature. This method can be more efficient for production of low to moderate ionization states (such as He<sup>++</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0183">In this mode of operation there are two small ECR sections <b>180</b> and <b>182</b> located between the uniform field region and the magnetic mirrors. Particles are not in these zones long enough for de-correlation to be a significant issue. Electrons pass through the ECR zone, and depending on the phase of the particle relative to the ECR drive phase, the particle will gain or loose some energy in the zone. Because the phase at which the vast majority of electrons encounter both ECR zones is not correlated, they gain or loose energy each time they pass through the ECR zones. This leads to a stochastic heating process (similar to random walk) that leads to the gradual gain of energy (i.e. gradual as comparison to the resonant mode using similar operating parameters). For this process directly there are not requirements on the field uniformity of the central field, but the limitations on plasma stability still apply.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0184">In some embodiments with this configuration the relation between the central field and the ECR frequency is significant. If these two match too closely, then one cannot consider the electrons to leave the ECR zone, and the entire central region appears to be one large ECR zone that is off-resonance. If this is the case the performance of the system is very poor, as the energy gained by the electrons is limited by the relation given above. Further the de-correlation time is short, so the electrons gain and loose energy rapidly leading to poor confinement.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0185">If the central region corresponds to a magnetic field that is sufficiently far from the resonance condition, then the energy that can be gained or lost by an electron crossing the zone is limited by the relations above. Further, if the central region is sufficiently far from the resonant condition, other effects dominate the transit through the central region. This allows the electron phase to be effectively randomized between the two ECR zones. This reduces or eliminates the number of particles that are consistently poorly phased matched between the two zones.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0186">The ICR exciter system <b>62</b> can be used as there still will be a uniform magnetic field <b>40</b> in the center of the chamber <b>30</b>, but the ECR zones will be located only adjacent the zones of the mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. In such cases, the ICR frequency is decreased slightly to match the lower resonant field. An added advantage is the mirror ratios on the front and back mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are increased somewhat as the central field <b>40</b>&#x2032; is lowered.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> illustrates both resonant and sub resonant modes of operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> is a plot of total extracted beam current as a function be central magnetic field (at constant ECR drive frequency of 18 GHz) using small aperture. The sharp peak located at approximately 0.638 T corresponds to resonant mode of operation. The broad flat peak around 0.5 T corresponds to the sub-resonant mode of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0188">Note from the graph it may appear that the sub-critical mode of operation yields more current and thus may be better, but this can be misleading. The data was taken by varying only the central field, thus the mirror ratio, which is strongly tied to plasma production, is not constant across the graph. Also the beam composition is not plotted here so the ratio of He<sup>++</sup> to He<sup>+</sup> also varies along the graph.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0189">The region between 0.635 T and 0.56 T, neither mode fully applies. Clearly close of 0.63 T the electron de-correlation time is short, and the maximum energy obtained the electrons is too low for the formation of He<sup>++</sup>. As one approaches the 0.6 T, the ECR zones have moved out from the central region, toward the higher field, but the zones may be too large and too well correlated to lead to an efficient stochastic heating process.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0190"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> shows time-of-flight mass spectrometer data for the resonant mode of operation. The horizontal axis represents time; the data near 3.5 &#x3bc;s corresponds to He<sup>++</sup> and the data near 5.5 &#x3bc;s corresponds to He<sup>+</sup>. The vertical axis indicates the central magnetic field. Note the He<sup>++</sup> production is flat between 0.636 T and 0.639 T. This region corresponds to the electron de-correlation time being longer then the electron confinement time so electrons are lost before they can decelerate.</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0191">The uniform field region also has another advantage other then just coupling energy to the electrons or ions. In some embodiments, mirror devices are unstable to a number of instabilities driven by the curvature of the magnetic field. In particular, the shape of the field in the region between the uniform field and the magnetic mirror can be very unstable. In this region the combined drift of the particles in the curved magnetic field is given by</p>

that can lead to radial diffusion. When the magnetic field is curved toward the plasma (concave) the resultant drift causes outward transport and loss of the particles. This is often referred to as &#x201c;bad&#x201d; curvature. On the other hand, when the magnetic field is curved away from the plasma (convex) the resultant drift causes inward transport and confinement of particles. This is often referred to as &#x201c;good&#x201d; curvature.
</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0194">In a simple magnetic mirror, the particles spend much more of their time in the regions of &#x201c;bad&#x201d; curvature then in the regions with &#x201c;good&#x201d; curvature and this leads to rapid radial loss of particles.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0195">In the systems described herein, the uniform field regions greatly increase the stability of the plasma and provide for ion confinement time that is comparable to the time required to remove the second (or more) electron(s) to form ions in the selected final state.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0196">The increased stability is provided by a number of factors. First, the uniform sections have essentially no curvature so they decrease the overall time particles spend in the regions of &#x201c;bad&#x201d; curvature. There are thresholds associated with the instabilities that lead to transport. Clearly curved magnetic field driven instabilities will not grow if the average magnitude of the drifts are smaller then thermal transport drifts. Second, the uniform field region contains a large fraction of the plasma. This region provides a charge reservoir that damps out the change separation caused by the curved magnetic field drifts. Basically this allows charge to flow along the axis and neutralize the change separation caused by the &#x201c;bad&#x201d; curvature region. Third, the uniform region disconnects the two regions of &#x201c;bad&#x201d; curvature. Thus instabilities growing on one end of the device generally cannot couple to instabilities growing on the other side of the device due to inconsistent phase shifting by particles traveling from one side of the device to the other.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0197">In some embodiments, requirements on the field are on the order of 5-10% uniformity over the majority of region <b>70</b>. Stability may be more of an issue in the sub-critical mode because of the potentially higher mirror fields which reduces the threshold for instabilities.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0198">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 14A</figref>, in some embodiments, (e.g. for generation of very highly ionized ion species and/or for generation of very intense ion beams) it may be helpful to add a radial surface confinement magnetic <b>76</b> to the system <b>10</b>. Confinement magnet <b>76</b> produces radial confinement field <b>184</b> turns the axial minimum field configuration into a more complete minimum field confutation, by adding a generally increasing magnetic field as a function of radius. Note that a true minimum magnetic field configuration cannot be generated (such a static configuration would violate Maxwell's laws). Configurations referenced to in the art as &#x201c;true&#x201d; magnetic minimum configurations are just partial minimum magnetic fields. All of these types of configurations contain cusp regions where the field does not increase as a function of radius. The size, shape, and location of these regions distinguish these different minimum magnetic field configurations.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0199">The surface confinement magnetic field increases the confinement time of the electrons in the system <b>30</b>. This increases the electron density in the system <b>30</b>, as well as the electron temperature (energy), as the electrons are in the ECR drive field longer. Higher electron density corresponds to more ionizing collisions with neutrals and ions. Higher electron energy corresponds to the ability to generate higher ionization states. This is not useful for He<sup>++</sup>, but could used for creating highly ionized states of other atoms.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0200">In some embodiments, a hexapole fixed magnet system (not shown) is used to generate a &#x201c;true&#x201d; minimum magnetic field configuration. The hexapole magnets of alternating polarities create a field that penetrates radially well into the plasma <b>57</b>, and limits the microwave coupling region, as well as preventing the use of an ICR exciter system, because of the lack of a uniform magnetic field region.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0201">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14 and 14A</figref>, a higher order multipole field is used to produce a surface confinement field <b>184</b> that would only affect the edges <b>138</b> of the plasma <b>57</b>, allowing for a broad ECR coupling region and use of an ICR exciter. A higher order multipole field can be introduced using fixed magnets, but it can also be introduced using a series of current carrying wires <b>154</b>, located around the source area. In such a case, each wire <b>154</b> would carry current in the opposite direction to the adjacent wire <b>154</b>, giving rise to an adjustable multipole magnetic field <b>184</b>. The strength of the current in the wires <b>154</b> determines the multipole field <b>184</b>, which can be quite strong very close to the wires <b>154</b>, e.g. in region <b>185</b>. The wires <b>154</b> used to generate the multipole field <b>184</b> can be twisted or straight (as shown). The same wires <b>154</b> can be used to produce the multipole field <b>148</b> and act as the ICR antenna for the &#x201c;twisted&#x201d; or &#x201c;untwisted&#x201d; filers. In such an implementation, the wires <b>154</b> would carry a DC and an AC component to the current and thus establish both DC and AC components of the field <b>148</b>. In some embodiments, the number of wires <b>154</b> used for a multipole may be high (more than the eight pairs shown), new phases could be introduced in the ICR drive to increase the coupling efficiency, or some arrangement like every other wire <b>154</b> could carry an ICR drive signal.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0202">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, system <b>10</b> uses a microwave horn <b>55</b> to direct the microwaves for the ECR plasma production. In some embodiments, a higher efficiency can be obtained using a cavity system (not shown). The cavity both localizes the microwaves and the gas used in the system <b>10</b>. Localizing the microwaves is good in that it increases the microwave power density and thus the plasma density. Increasing the plasma density increase the number of ionizing collisions that can occur. It also reduces shielding and other problems from the microwaves.</p>
<p id="p-0204" num="0203">Localizing the gas decreases the amount of wasted feed gas, generally not a large expense, but less waste is less waste and some rare feed gases are relatively expensive. This also reduces arcing problems caused by high gas pressures in the chamber <b>30</b>. If the feed gas is localized in the cavity for the most part, it will not be in the antenna system, or the insulators. The lower the gas pressure can be kept outside the gas generator, the better for suppression of arcs.</p>
<p id="p-0205" num="0204">It is not necessary for the cavity to be fully closed in a gas tight sense. A number of holes can be placed in the wall as long as they are small compared to the wavelength of the microwaves. This will confine the microwaves, but allow evacuation of the gas. Limiting the holes in the wall controls the conductance to the rest of the vacuum system. This can be used to keep the gas pressure high in the cavity but low in the rest of chamber <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0206" num="0205">The gas source <b>50</b> can be operated using a wide variety of material feeds. In most cases these feed systems provide a neutral stream of particles from which to make a plasma and thus a beam.</p>
<p id="p-0207" num="0206">In the case of alpha production, helium gas is used as a working gas. In the case of most other gaseous materials they can be used as a working gas for the system. It does not matter if they are not simple atomic gasses. For example, if an oxygen ion source is desired, molecular oxygen can be injected into the source. The hot electrons will both dissociate the oxygen and ionize it.</p>
<p id="p-0208" num="0207">For materials that are not normally a gas there are several ways to inject the material into the source. One alternative is to inject a gas containing the desired material. For example, carbon could be injected using CO or CO<sub>2 </sub>as a working gas. In both cases, the plasma generated will contain both carbon and oxygen ions, thus the beam generated will contain both types of ions. The source may be followed by a mass filter to eliminate the undesired ions.</p>
<p id="p-0209" num="0208">An alternative would be to vaporize the substance into system <b>10</b>. In a case such as calcium, it would be possible to simply heat solid calcium to vaporize it using an oven. Materials could also be vaporized by e-beam. This type of source is well suited to production of materials with low melting points such as barium and calcium.</p>
<p id="p-0210" num="0209">A laser system can be used to oblate a target, giving rise to neutral material from which the plasma is formed. Such a system would fire a laser at a cooled target located in the chamber to produce neutrals. The prime choice for the target location would be in the region <b>70</b> between the two magnetic mirror fields <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>. In some embodiments, this location makes the optics some what difficult so placement to the rear of the system, near the peak of the rear mirror, has a number of advantages. Other placements are workable, but may require more laser power to generate sufficient neutral particles between the magnetic mirrors <b>32</b> and <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0211" num="0210">One way to inject material is to use sputtering. Here the exiting ECR source and magnetic mirrors may be used to generate a sputter source for almost any solid material. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10A and 10B</figref> the ECR source may be adjusted to make unconfined hot electrons at resonant zones <b>210</b> and <b>211</b> on both sides of the rear mirror. The non-trapped hot electrons generated on the front and back of the mirrors are not useful for generating plasma <b>57</b>. These electrons are not confined and typically are quickly lost. Further resonance zones <b>210</b> and <b>211</b> are typically very narrow so there is not sufficient time for the electrons to gain a lot of energy. However, in embodiments featuring a sputtering source, one can use the unconfined hot electrons on the back side of the mirror to form a sputter source. In such a case it would be desirable to tailor the magnetic field so the gradient is not so steep at zone <b>210</b> such that the resonance zone is sufficiently large to produce the desired plasma density.</p>
<p id="p-0212" num="0211">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11</figref>, <b>12</b>, and <b>13</b>, a sputter source <b>212</b> works by allowing the hot electrons to ionize small amounts of gas to form a plasma in the vicinity of rear resonance zone <b>210</b>. The sputter target is biased with a large negative bias (e.g. 1-4 kV). This negative bias draws ions from plasma formed and accelerates them to high energies. These ions then strike the sputter target <b>220</b> producing a number of neutral particles. These neutral particles then pass through the hot electrons in resonant zone <b>210</b>. Some fraction of them are ionized, attracted by the negative potential, impact on the target <b>220</b>, and sputter off more neutral particles. Some of the neutral particles pass through the hot electrons and become ionized in the trapped resonance zone <b>200</b> (in resonant mode) or zones <b>180</b> an <b>182</b> (in sub-resonant mode) and form part of the particle beam.</p>
<p id="p-0213" num="0212">The target material <b>220</b> does not have to be electrically conducting in order to make a sputter target. For example, carbon can be used as a target by simply placing it on a conducting surface <b>230</b>. The conductor <b>230</b> is biased to create the potential necessary to accelerate ions, but it is not necessary to bias the actual surface of target material <b>220</b>. Conductor <b>230</b> my be isolated from the walls of chamber <b>30</b> by an insulator <b>240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0214" num="0213">In some embodiments, sputter source <b>212</b> may include fluid cooling pipes. Any suitable cooling technique known in the art may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0215" num="0214">In some cases the target material <b>220</b> does not sputter well. This can be expressed as a sputter yield. The average number of neutral particles sputtered from the surface per single ion hitting the surface is the sputter yield. Materials that form good sputter targets have a yield greater then 1 (often significantly greater). If a material with a low sputter yield is desired, a carrier gas can be used to increase the yield. Generally heavy gasses such as xenon are desirable because they tend to have high sputter yields on most targets and cause minimal problems in the system. Some of the carrier gas will get ionized and find its way into the output beam, but this can be minimized by correct choice of the gas, geometrical arrangement, and/or filtered in the output beam.</p>
<p id="p-0216" num="0215">In some embodiments, the geometry of a sputter source <b>212</b> is important. It is necessary that ions from the plasma can be accelerated into the sputter target <b>220</b>, that neutral particles have a clear path into the plasma <b>57</b>, and that the source does not block key things such as the microwave access to the resonant zone. For example, sputter source <b>212</b> may fall into one of two geometrical configurations. These are a sputter target <b>212</b> located on axis A (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>) and one located in an annulus (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) or cone (as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>) around axis A.</p>
<p id="p-0217" num="0216">An ECR sputter source may be particularly well suited for generation of multiply changed ion beams from solid materials. As a practical example, there are applications for highly charged nickel ion beams. This source is particularly well suited to production of a nickel ion beam.</p>
<p id="p-0218" num="0217">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, in the case of an axially located target <b>220</b>, the sputter target covers a small area along the axis of the ion source. The ECR microwaves are allowed to flow around the target, and may even be injected off-axis to improve access.</p>
<p id="p-0219" num="0218">In some embodiments, one may alternatively generate a sputter source using ions from the main confined plasma. Biasing is used to attract ions from the confined plasma to a sputtering target. For example, the ions may be drawn backwards into a plate on the axis biased negative relative to the plasma. In such embodiments, it is not necessary to create an unconfined plasma. In some embodiments, this may have advantages for microwave access at high plasma density.</p>
<p id="p-0220" num="0219">The extraction system <b>59</b> passes the beam <b>56</b> through an extraction limiter <b>65</b>, forming the first electrode of the extraction system. The beam <b>56</b> is allowed to follow the magnetic field and expand as the magnetic field decreases. A focusing lens <b>64</b> is used to converge the beam into the final limiter, which forms the boundary between the ion beam source system <b>10</b> and the following systems (e.g. a beam filter or accelerator).</p>
<p id="p-0221" num="0220">By allowing the beam <b>56</b> to initially expand into a low field region then accelerating the beam to extraction energy, it is possible to transition the beam from the high field region magnetic field region <b>32</b>, <b>34</b>, and <b>40</b> to a low field region without increasing the beam emittance.</p>
<p id="p-0222" num="0221">In various embodiments, other suitable extraction systems and techniques known in the art may be employed.</p>
<p id="p-0223" num="0222">The vacuum system <b>54</b> can be implemented using almost any standard pumping system. The high vacuum pumps should provide a base pressure at least as low as 1&#xd7;10<sup>&#x2212;5 </sup>torr. During operation the gas or vapor from the atom source <b>50</b> can be bled into the system <b>10</b> at a higher pressure, providing high purity of the working gas.</p>
<p id="p-0224" num="0223">There are a number of potential applications for high energy alpha (<sup>4</sup>He<sup>++</sup>) or helium-3 (<sup>3</sup>He<sup>++</sup>) beams. The most immediate applications are the activation of target nuclei for the production of radio-isotopes. Due to short half-life and/or low production yield, it is necessary to use an intense beam in order to produce reasonable quantities of many of these radio-isotopes. Also, by using a target of very high purity, few undesirable products are made so post processing (e.g. chemical separation) for isotope purity is minimized.</p>

<p id="p-0233" num="0233">As noted above, for treatment of radioactive waste, there are at least two types of radioactive waste transmutation. The first is the production of useful products from waste material. Exemplary transmutations which may be accomplished using the devices and techniques described herein include:</p>
<p id="h-0078" num="0000"><sup>226</sup>Ra (&#x3b1;, n) <sup>230</sup>Th+n. (<sup>230</sup>Th is a source for <sup>213</sup>Bi.)</p>
<p id="h-0079" num="0000"><sup>232</sup>Th+&#x3b1;&#x2192;<sup>235</sup>U which is nuclear fuel.</p>
<p id="h-0080" num="0000"><sup>235</sup>U+&#x3b1;&#x2192;<sup>238</sup>Pu which is used in nuclear fuel cells as a heat source and is in short supply.</p>
<p id="h-0081" num="0000"><sup>231</sup>Pa+a&#x2192;<sup>233</sup>Np+n&#x2192;<sup>229</sup>Pa&#x2192;<sup>225</sup>Ac which is a medical isotope. The <sup>225</sup>Ac decay path is <sup>225</sup>AC-&#x3b1;&#x2192;<sup>221</sup>Fr-&#x3b1;&#x2192;<sup>217</sup>At-&#x3b1;&#x2192;<sup>213</sup>Bi-beta&#x2192;<sup>213</sup>Po-&#x3b1;&#x2192;<sup>209</sup>Pb-beta&#x2192;<sup>209</sup>Bi.</p>
<p id="p-0234" num="0234">Second, waste may be converted to a stable product. Exemplary transmutations which may be accomplished using the devices and techniques described herein include:</p>
<p id="p-0235" num="0235"><sup>251</sup>Cf+&#x3b1;&#x2192;<sup>253</sup>Fm+2n converts long lived Cf isotopes to short lived (approximately 3 days) Fm isotope, <sup>237</sup>Np+&#x3b1;&#x2192;<sup>239</sup>Am+n&#x2192;<sup>235</sup>Np&#x2192;<sup>231</sup>Pa&#x2192; . . . &#x2192;Pb.</p>
<p id="p-0236" num="0236">Another other issue in treatment of nuclear waste is stimulated fission reactions. In this case heavy radioactive nuclides are bombarded with alpha particles from a beam source of the type described herein. These nuclides undergo a stimulated fission reaction and fall apart into a number of lighter fragments. Generally the fragments are still radioactive, but have short half-lives and quickly decay to stable elements. Unlike many of the heavy nuclei, which are alpha and neutron emitters, these lighter ones are more likely beta and position emitters, which are easier to deal with. Intense (very intense) alpha beams are ideal for this type of application.</p>
<p id="p-0237" num="0237"><sup>99m</sup>Tc is a metastable nuclear isomer of <sup>99</sup>Tc, indicated by the &#x201c;m&#x201d;. &#x201c;Metastable&#x201d; means that <sup>99m</sup>Tc does not change into another element upon its decay. Instead <sup>99m</sup>Tc emits a 140 keV gamma ray that medical equipment can detect from a body into which it has been injected. Accordingly <sup>99m</sup>Tc is well suited for the role of a medical tracer because it emits readily detectable 140 keV gamma rays, and its half-life for gamma emission is 6.01 hours. Over 93% of it decays to <sup>99</sup>Tc in 24 hours. This short half life of the <sup>99m</sup>Tc allows for scanning procedures which collect data rapidly, but keep total patient radiation exposure low. <sup>99</sup>Tc is the ground state of <sup>99m</sup>Tc that eventually (half-life of 213 thousand years) emits a beta particle and decays to <sup>99</sup>Ru, which is stable.</p>
<p id="p-0238" num="0238"><sup>99m</sup>Tc usually is extracted from so called &#x201c;moo cows&#x201d;, <sup>99m</sup>Tc generators which contain <sup>99</sup>Mo. The majority of <sup>99</sup>Mo heretofore produced for <sup>99m</sup>Tc medical use comes from fission in nuclear reactors, and must be processed carefully to remove nuclear contaminates.</p>
<p id="p-0239" num="0239">20 million diagnostic nuclear medical procedures every year use <sup>99m</sup>Tc, approximately 85% of diagnostic imaging procedures in nuclear medicine use this isotope. Depending on the type of nuclear medicine procedure, the <sup>99m</sup>Tc is bound to different pharmaceutical that transports it to the required location. <sup>99m</sup>Tc is chemically bound to Sestamibi when it is used to image the blood flow, or lack thereof, in the heart. Since Exametazime, is able to cross the blood brain barrier, <sup>99m</sup>Tc is used with Exametazime so the <sup>99m</sup>Tc flows through the vessels in the brain to image cerebral blood flow. Imaging of renal function is accomplished by tagging <sup>99m</sup>Tc to Mercapto Acetyl Tri Glycine.</p>
<p id="p-0240" num="0240">Similarly, <sup>111</sup>In is a radionuclide with a half-life of 2.8049 days and with gamma ray emissions of 171.2 and 245.3 keV. In a chloride form, it is used as a bone marrow and tumor-localizing tracer; in a chelate form, as a cerebrospinal fluid tracer and in a trichloride form, is used in electron microscopy to stain nucleic acids in thin tissue sections. It decays by electron capture:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><sup>111</sup>In&#x2192;<sup>111</sup>Cd+&#x3b3;(171.2 keV)+&#x3b3;(245.3 keV)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Electron capture decay can be though of as a positron decay where the positron is destroyed in the nucleus by an captured electron. In this case the decay produces the gamma ray emissions of 171.2 and 245.3 keV sensed in the PET scan.
</p>
<p id="p-0241" num="0241">For many applications, due to short half-life and/or low production yield, it is necessary to use an intense alpha particle beam in order to produce reasonable quantities of <sup>99</sup>Mo or <sup>111</sup>In. Particles beams of the type described herein may be used to produce diagnostic or therapeutically effective doses of these materials. As used herein, the phrase diagnostic or therapeutically effective dose is to be understood to mean a dose sufficient to perform at least one diagnostic or therapeutic procedure is a human or animal patient.</p>
<p id="p-0242" num="0242">Advantageously, the devices and techniques described herein may be used to produce usable quantities of <sup>99</sup>Mo or <sup>111</sup>In without the use a nuclear fission reactor. Accordingly, production of dangerous radioactive byproducts may be reduced or eliminated. Also, by using beam targets of very high purity, few undesirable products are made so post processing for isotope purity is improved.</p>
<p id="p-0243" num="0243">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17A</figref>, <b>17</b>B, and <b>17</b>C one exemplary production process is to form a target <b>301</b> by placing a layer <b>190</b> of <sup>96</sup>Zr atoms on a copper strip <b>192</b> and then place a thin layer <b>194</b> of <sup>109</sup>Ag atoms on the layer <b>190</b> of <sup>96</sup>Zr atoms. The strip <b>192</b> is shown extending between a supply roll <b>196</b> and a take-up roll <b>198</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0244" num="0244">A beam from ion source <b>300</b> is accelerated by accelerator <b>310</b> to target <b>301</b>. In some embodiments, accelerators <b>310</b> functions in a pulse mode so after the beam is spread into a rectangular shape by the beam spreader <b>320</b>, either a pulse or more of alpha particles is directed at a rectangular area <b>330</b> of the strip <b>192</b> (in other embodiments, other beam shapes may be used). The target strip <b>301</b> is then indexed or moved continuously with respect to the beam. A cooling system can be used to cool the target <b>301</b>. For example coolant may be circulated via ports <b>350</b>. Any suitable cooling technique known in the art may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0245" num="0245">In some embodiments, alpha particles are accelerated to the target <b>301</b> at an energy of approximately 28 MeV to transmute a portion of the <sup>109</sup>Ag atoms of layer <b>194</b> into <sup>111</sup>In. Alpha particles passing through layer <b>194</b> will lose some energy in the process, and thereafter, a portion will impinge on layer <b>190</b> at an energy of approximately 16 MeV, transmuting a portion of the <sup>96</sup>Zr atoms or layer <b>190</b> into <sup>99</sup>Mo. The copper, <sup>109</sup>Ag, <sup>111</sup>In, <sup>96</sup>Zr, and <sup>99</sup>Mo are easy to separate chemically so the copper, <sup>109</sup>Ag and <sup>96</sup>Zr remaining are recycled, and the <sup>99</sup>Mo and <sup>111</sup>In are chemically separated and used for medical isotope purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0246" num="0246">Similar techniques may be used for targets with more that two layers of different target materials, or with a single layer of target material.</p>
<p id="p-0247" num="0247">Although embodiments are shown above with target <b>301</b> mounted on a roll, and other suitable target mount may be used. In some embodiments, target <b>301</b> may mounted on a plate (not shown). The target plate is placed in front of the beam to undergo reactions, after which the plate may be changed. In some embodiments, a target station would support more then one plate at a time. This allows a first plate to be exposed to the beam while another plate is changed out and a new plate made ready during the exposure of the first plate. This reduces beam down time. Further, using plates in this manner allows the exposed product, which may have a short half-life, to be taken out quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0248" num="0248">Note that in various embodiments, the systems and techniques described herein may also be used to produce beams of singly ionized ions. We can also use the source for production of singly charged ions. In some embodiments the system may selectively operable in several modes corresponding to different ion types and charge state outputs. In some embodiments, a single ion source may be used. Some embodiments may feature multiple ion sources. In some embodiments, multiple beams of various types may be generated from a single source, e.g. using charge or mass filtering techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0249" num="0249">While particular embodiments of the present invention have been shown and described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that changes and modifications may be made without departing from the invention in its broader aspects and, therefore, the appended claims are to encompass within their scope all such changes and modifications as fall within the true spirit and scope of this invention. All patents, published applications and articles mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety.</p>
