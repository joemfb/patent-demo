<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Not Applicable</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATEMENT RE: FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH/DEVELOPMENT</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Not Applicable</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to connector assemblies and, more particularly, to a connector assembly for interfacing pin connectors to multi-connector flexible cables.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electrical systems commonly include various circuits and assemblies that interconnect that form the overall system. Components of this system may be manufactured by different companies, or otherwise constructed in a modular form such that the different components may be removed, replaced or upgraded without the need to disassemble the whole system. Multi-connector cables are commonly used to communicate electrical signals, including power signals, information signals, clock signals, etc. between modules, and between electrical systems. In some cases the cables may have pin connectors affixed to one or both ends which engage mating connectors on another component. Such connectors may be mated to conventional cables by means of a corresponding female connector. However, repeated engagement and disengagement of such male and female pin connectors can cause pin damage, or otherwise bend the connectors such that connectivity may be jeopardized with the connector is exposed to vibrations or other severe environmental conditions, such as may occur in aerospace applications or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Faced with such problems, some producers have chosen to connect the individual pin conductors to conductive traces formed on the circuit board, which in turn are soldered to individual connectors of a multi-connector cable. This is a tedious process, though the end result may be a reliable connection. Moreover, soldering is an undesirable process, requiring tin/lead solder, flux and cleaning solutions, all of which can contain materials hazardous to operators and the environment, while creating more costs for management, making control of the processes more difficult, and requiring the proper treatment and disposal of hazardous materials.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In use, the cables may themselves fail over time and need to be replaced. In other cases, the integrity of the cable may simply be uncertain, and replacement of the cable may be a troubleshooting option that is preferable to replacing a complex and expensive circuitry component. However, the soldered connections between the cable and the circuit board make that option more difficult and tedious.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Accordingly, it is desirable to provide a connector assembly wherein the connecting cable can be in reliable electrical communication with the pin connectors, yet disconnectable and replaceable without the need to perform soldering or desoldering functions.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Further, it is preferable that such connector assembly allows the connecting cable to be readily replaceable as useful for maintenance demands, as trouble shooting requires, or as system modifications evolve to utilize different types of connective patterns.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably such a connector should also be able to withstand vibrations and other environmental conditions that might otherwise degrade connector performance over time.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">A connector assembly is provided for communicating electrical signals between a connector having a plurality of pins and a remote location. The assembly comprises a mounting board mountable on the pins and having a plurality of apertures for receiving and retaining the pins. The mounting board further includes a plurality of conductive patterns formed thereon, each conductive pattern extending from one of the pin apertures to an associated connector pad formed on the mounting board. A flexible cable having a plurality of conductors and connector pads is disposed adjacent the mounting board such that the cable connector pads are arrayed proximate the mounting board connector pads, in vertical registry therewith. A retaining member is connected to the mounting board for urging the flexible cable connector pads into electrical communication with the mounting board connector pads.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The mounting board connector pads are preferably arrayed along a peripheral portion of the board.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The retaining member may be formed to define a retaining ring connectible to the mounting board, and a resilient member disposed intermediate the ring member and the mounting board, for resiliently urging the flexible cable connector pads into electrical communication with the mounting board connector pads.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Alternately, the retaining member may define at least one retaining bar engaging to the mounting board, with a resilient member disposed intermediate the retaining bar and the mounting board.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In the presently preferred embodiment each of the connector pins is associated with a dedicated conductive pattern, a dedicated mounting board conductor pad, and a dedicated flexible cable connector pad. The flexible cable conductor defines a plurality of exposed connector pads contact areas.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In one embodiment the mounting board is formed as a circular disk which is in substantial vertical registry with the retaining ring. In another embodiment the mounting board is formed to be substantially D-shaped, defining a circular periphery portion and a straight periphery portion, the mounting board connector pads being arrayed along the straight periphery portion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The retaining member/retaining board/retaining ring, preferably define a plurality of receiving apertures, disposed in substantial vertical registry with corresponding apertures formed in the mounting board and formed in the flexible cable, to ensure that the mounting board connector pads and the flexible cable connector pads are arrayed in substantial vertical registry, and firmly retained in place.</p>

The connector pins extend into or through pin apertures <b>28</b> formed in rigid mounting board <b>25</b>, to communicate with traces <b>27</b>. The traces <b>27</b> extend from the pin apertures <b>28</b> to connector pads <b>31</b> formed on a periphery portion of mounting board <b>25</b>. Each of the mounting board connector pads <b>31</b> may define a raised contact area. In the illustrated embodiment, the mounting board <b>25</b> is formed as a circular disc.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Flexible cable <b>30</b> extends from the connector assembly <b>20</b>, e.g. to a remote connector adapted to receive and engage flexible cable connector <b>40</b>. A flexible cable <b>30</b> is formed of a plurality of individual conductors <b>29</b> extending therethrough, which terminate in flexible cable connector pads <b>39</b> (shown at <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). As with the mounting board connector pads, the flexible cable connector pads may include raised contact areas, which may define a flat raised surface or complementary shaped surfaces. Examples of such a flexible cable and mating substrate, with complementary connector pads, are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,691,509 to Balzano and U.S. Pat. No. 6,739,878, also to Balzano, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The cable connector pads <b>39</b> are disposed adjacent the mounting board connector pads <b>31</b>, to facilitate electrical communication therebetween. The flexible cable <b>30</b> may define an insulating ring <b>42</b> which supports the exposed flexible cable connector pads <b>39</b>, and extends about the upper surface of the mounting board <b>25</b>.

The mounting board <b>25</b> includes a plurality of traces <b>27</b>, extending from pin apertures <b>28</b> to connector pads <b>31</b>. As described above, the mounting board connector pads <b>31</b> are in electrical communication with the flexible cable connector pads <b>39</b>, when compressed by the retaining member <b>51</b>, formed as a flexible bar. As a result, reliable electrical communication is established between the connector pins <b>11</b> and the flexible cable conductors <b>29</b>, which can withstand substantial and repeated vibration and other demanding environmental conditions. Moreover, when trouble shooting or repair requires, the flexible cable <b>30</b> can be readily removed and replaced, without the need to engage or disengage pin connectors, and without the need to solder or de-solder the flexible conductors <b>29</b> to the pins or to the conductive traces extending from the pins.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the presently preferred embodiment, each of the pins <b>11</b> is connected to a dedicated trace <b>27</b>, a dedicated mounting board connector pad <b>31</b>, a dedicated flexible cable connector pad <b>39</b> and a dedicated flexible cable conductor <b>29</b>. However, it is to be understood that in certain cases signals may not be present on individual of the connector pins, or if present, may not need to be communicated to the remote location, depending upon a particular application. In other cases, signals on a pin may be communicated (jumped) to a plurality of the flexible cable conductors, where the same signal is intended to be communicated to multiple circuits. As such, the particular pattern for connecting the pins to the cable connectors, or for jumping signals from one cable connector to a plurality of cable connectors, is understood to be a matter of design preference, depending upon the needs of a particular application.</p>

<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As will be apparent from the above disclosure, the methodology for forming a connector assembly in accordance with the present invention typically proceeds as follows. A mounting board is perforated with an aperture pattern that conforms to the pin pattern of a pin connector. The apertures may be metalized to form conductive vias, which may extend to the upper surface of the mounting board. Alternatively, the apertures need not be metalized. In either case, the apertures are of such a size to closely conform to the pin diameters in order to retain the pins in place within the apertures. The pins are inserted into or through the mounting board sufficient to support and align the pins, while securing the retaining board in place. The mounting board is typically spaced from the connector body, and the length of the pins extending beyond the mounting board may be cut off, or otherwise removed.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A pattern of conductive traces are formed on the upper surface of the mounting board, extending from the pins to conductive pads formed along a periphery portion of the mounting board. The conductive traces may extend to and be in electrical communication with the pins and/or the conductive vias extending from the mounting board apertures.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A flexible cable is formed to include a pattern of exposed conductive pads on the first end of the cable, with each conductive pad being in electrical communication with a conductor extending through the flexible cable. One or both of the mounting board pads and the flexible cable pads may include raised surface areas, which, as previously noted, may be formed for complementary engagement, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,691,509 to Balzano or U.S. Pat. No. 6,739,878 to Balzano. However, it is to be understood that in some embodiments of the present invention the mounting board pads and the flexible cable pads may be formed to be substantially flush with the supporting surface, provided that the pads may be urged to into reliable electrical communication, as further described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The flexible cable will preferably include an insulating member, typically formed as a ring or a strip, extending from the cable, which supports the exposed cable connector pads and extends about or across some portion of the mounting board. Apertures or pins may be formed in or mounted on the mounting board, with corresponding apertures formed in the insulating member. The alignment of the apertures will result in orienting the mounting board connector pads and flexible cable connector pads in vertical registry. A resilient member may then be placed above the flexible cable pads and/or below the mounting board and a retaining member may be disposed adjacent the resilient member. The retaining member and the resilient member may be provided with apertures, formed in registry with the mounting board apertures. A screw or pins may be extended through the apertures to resiliently compress the mounting board pads and the flexible cable pads into contact to ensure electrical communication therebetween. In one embodiment, the retaining member may be formed as a pair of bars, with one bar placed on the upper surface of the resilient member and the second bar placed below the mounting board. The bars may be formed to include apertures to allow screws to extend therethrough, compressing the intermediate mounting board connector pads and flexible cable connector pads into reliable electrical communication.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The above description is given by way of example, and not limitation. Given the above disclosure, one skilled in the art could devise variations in various of the disclosed features, such as the arrangement of the mounting board, the construction of the retaining member or the type of connecting cable used. Such variations are understood to be within the scope and spirit of the invention disclosed herein.</p>
