<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The invention relates to a storage compartment and a method of assembling storage compartment. More particularly, the invention relates to storage compartment having a telescopic cover operable to facilitate the installation of the storage compartment into a tight space.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Storage compartments mounted to a structure such as the instrument panel assembly of an automotive vehicle are known. The storage compartment may include a base having a bottom wall, a pair of side walls, a front wall and a back wall. The bottom, side, front and back walls are interconnected so as to define a storage bin. The storage compartment may further include a tray disposed above the storage bin between respective side walls. The tray may be slidable between a first position and a second position. In the first position the tray covers the bottom wall, in the second position the tray is displaced from the front wall so as to provide access to the storage bin. In instances where the tray is covered, the cover is configured to be dimensioned so as to cover the tray when the tray is in the second position. Thus, mounting the storage compartment to a structure such as an instrument panel assembly may be difficult as there must be sufficient space to accommodate the cover.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">According to one aspect of the invention a storage compartment configured to attach to a structure is provided. The storage compartment includes a base. The base includes a support portion. The base may further include includes a bottom wall, a pair of side walls, a front wall and a back wall, the bottom, side, front and back walls interconnected so as to define a storage bin. The support portion is disposed on one of the pair of side walls.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The storage compartment further includes a cover. The cover is disposed above the base. The cover includes a first top portion, a second top portion, and a stop. The first and second top portions are displaceable with respect to each other along an axis so as to form a telescopic cover. The stop is configured to retain the second top portion in a fixed position with the first top portion after the first and second top portion are displaced relative to each other.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The first top portion is fixedly mounted to the support portion of the base. The second top portion is movable between a retracted position and an extended position, in the retracted position the second top portion is substantially disposed over the first top portion, in the extended position, the second back wall of the second top portion is displaced from the first top portion. Once the second top portion of the cover is moved to the extended position, the stop engages the second top portion so as to prevent the second top portion from moving to the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The storage compartment may further include a tray spaced apart from the bottom wall. The tray may be slidably disposed between each of the side walls. The tray is movable between a first position, wherein the tray covers the bottom wall, and a second position, wherein the tray provides access to the storage bin and is positioned underneath the cover.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to another aspect of the invention an instrument panel assembly is provided. The instrument panel assembly includes a slidable tray disposed over a base. The base includes a bottom wall, a pair of side walls, a front wall and a back wall. The bottom, side, front and back walls are interconnected so as to define a storage bin. The base may further include a support portion. The tray is slidable between a first position and a second position, in the first position the tray covers the bottom wall, in the second position the tray is displaced from the front wall and substantially behind the back wall so as to provide access to the storage bin.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The instrument panel assembly further includes a cover having a first top portion and a second top portion displaceable with respect to the first top portion. The first top portion includes a mounting portion and a stop. The mounting portion is fixedly mounted to the support portion of the base. The second top portion is movable between a retracted position and an extended position. In the retracted position the second top portion is substantially disposed over the first top portion, in the extended position, the second back wall of the second top portion is displaced from the first top portion so as to accommodate the tray when the tray is in the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to yet another aspect of the invention, a method of assembling an instrument panel assembly is provided. The instrument panel assembly includes a storage compartment having a slidable tray. The storage compartment includes a base having a bottom wall, a pair of side walls, a front wall and a back wall, the bottom, side, front and back walls interconnected so as to define a storage bin. The slidable tray is disposed above the storage bin and is movable between a first position and a second position. In the first position the tray covers the storage bin, in the second position the tray is displaced from the front wall so as to provide access to the storage bin.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The method of assembling the instrument panel assembly includes the steps of providing a cover having a first top portion and a second top portion displaceable with respect to the first top portion. The first top portion includes a mounting portion and a stop configured to prevent the second top portion from moving to the retracted position. The second top portion is movable between a retracted position and an extended position, in the retracted position the second top portion is substantially disposed over the first top portion, in the extended position, the second back wall of the second top portion is displaced from the first top portion so as to accommodate the tray when the tray is in the second position.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The method proceeds to the step of attaching the mounting portion to the support portion of the base so as to fix the first top portion to the base. The method proceeds to the step of extending the second top portion to the retracted position past the stop so as to provide a space to accommodate the slidable tray in the second position.</p>

Specifically, the stop <b>32</b> may be disposed on an exterior surface of one of the pair of first side walls <b>38</b>, the stop <b>32</b> being a generally resilient member and operable to engage a free edge <b>48</b> of one of the second side walls <b>44</b> so as to retain the second top portion <b>30</b> in the retracted position.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In operation, the stop <b>32</b> is biased inwardly with respect to an inner surface of the second side wall <b>44</b> when the cover <b>26</b> is in the retracted position. As the cover <b>26</b> is slid to the extended position, a free edge <b>48</b> of the second side wall <b>44</b> clears the stop <b>32</b> so as to allow the stop <b>32</b> to extend outwardly past the outer surface <b>50</b> of the second side wall <b>44</b>. Thus, the stop <b>32</b> prevents the second top portion <b>30</b> from moving forward back into the retracted position. It should be appreciated that the cover <b>26</b> may include a pair of stops <b>32</b>, one on each outer surface <b>50</b> of respective first side walls <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The stop <b>32</b> may include a ramp <b>52</b> having a sliding wall <b>54</b> and a contact wall <b>56</b>, the sliding wall <b>54</b> angled relative to the exterior surface of one of the pair of first side walls <b>38</b>. The sliding wall <b>54</b> is pressed inwardly with respect to the inner spaces of the cover <b>26</b> when the cover <b>26</b> is in the retracted position. When the cover <b>26</b> is moved to the extended position, the inner surface of the second wall slides against the sliding wall <b>54</b> of the stop <b>32</b>. The contact wall <b>56</b> is also pushed inwardly, and is free to fully extend past the outer surface <b>50</b> of the first side wall <b>38</b> once the second side wall <b>44</b> has moved past the contact wall <b>56</b>. The contact wall <b>56</b> is generally orthogonal to the exterior surface of one of the pair of first side walls <b>38</b> and protects outwardly so as to prevent the second side wall <b>44</b> from moving towards the retracted position.</p>
