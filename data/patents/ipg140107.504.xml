<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to drainage traps, and more particularly to flexible drainage trap assemblies including a flexible portion that has a substantially-smooth inner surface, and methods for constructing and installing such flexible drainage assemblies.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the plumbing industry, drainage traps are fixtures having a U-, J-, S-, or P-shaped portion and are used to trap fumes, gases, and odors within a drainage piping system. Most plumbing fixtures, such as bathroom sinks, kitchen sinks, bath tubs and water closets, include a drainage trap. A drainage trap may either be an integral part of the plumbing fixture or a separate fixture that can be releasably coupled to the plumbing fixture. In the present application, &#x201c;internal traps&#x201d; should be understood to be drainage traps that are an integral part of the plumbing fixture, and &#x201c;external traps&#x201d; should be understood to be drainage traps that can be releasably coupled to the plumbing fixture. It is to be appreciated that external traps are more common than internal traps, but in any embodiment described herein, external and internal traps can be substituted for each other.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Once the drainage trap is installed, water is flushed down the plumbing fixture, and the shape of the drainage trap allows a small pool of water to be retained within the drainage trap. The pool of water in the drainage trap functions as a seal that prevents the fumes, gases, and odors from escaping into the external living space in a building.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Various aspects of a flexible drainage trap assembly and related methods for installing a flexible drainage trap assembly according to the present disclosure are described. It is to be understood, however, that the following explanation is merely exemplary in describing the devices and methods of the present disclosure. Accordingly, any number of reasonable and foreseeable modifications, changes and substitutions are contemplated without departing from the spirit and scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a conventional rigid drainage trap <b>100</b>, which includes three parts: a tailpiece <b>10</b>, a trap <b>12</b>, and a discharge joint <b>14</b>. The tailpiece <b>10</b> and discharge joint <b>14</b> provide a connection to the discharge of a plumbing fixture (not shown) and the drainage pipe output (not shown), respectively. The trap <b>12</b> is shaped in such a way that it is operable to retain a pool of water, and may be configured in a variety of shapes, such as J-, P-, S-, and U-shape. These three parts of the rigid drainage trap <b>100</b> are assembled to form the rigid drainage trap <b>100</b>. In some embodiments, the J-trap <b>12</b> of the rigid drainage trap <b>100</b> includes a clean-out hole (not shown), which allows the water seal to be manually drained. The clean-out hole, however, also provides space for waste accumulation and bacteria growth.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The installation of the rigid drainage trap <b>100</b> between the discharge of the plumbing fixture and the drainage pipe output can be difficult. The alignment between the discharge of the plumbing fixture and the drainage pipe output can vary significantly because the plumbing fixtures can have a wide variety of designs. For example, bathroom sinks can be designed to be seated below or on the top of the counter. The difference in designs may lead to the plumbing fixtures having discharges in different positions, and, consequently, connecting the discharges of different plumbing fixtures to the drainage pipe output may require drainage traps of various dimensions. Furthermore, some plumbing fixtures have a plurality of discharges, such as a double kitchen sink.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">To improve the ease of installing drainage traps, some drainage traps <b>100</b> have been made more flexible by constructing the trap <b>12</b> using a flexible material. To connect such a flexible trap <b>12</b> to the tailpiece <b>10</b> and discharge joint <b>14</b> of the drainage trap <b>100</b>, hose clamps (not shown) are positioned around end portions of the flexible trap <b>12</b> and manually tightened. One disadvantage of the flexible trap <b>12</b> is that the hose clamps could be difficult to install if there is a lack of room around the plumbing fixture for handling tools to install the clamps. Moreover, another disadvantage of the flexible trap <b>12</b> is that it provides only limited flexibility due to the inherent shape of the flexible trap <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Some other drainage traps <b>100</b> have a corrugated portion. While the corrugated portion provides some flexibility, the uneven inner surface of the corrugated portion can trap and accumulate organic wastes. The accumulation of organic wastes can consequently lead to problems such as excessive bacteria and fungus growth and the clogging of the drainage trap.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b>, a flexible drainage trap assembly <b>200</b> includes a plumbing fixture connector <b>52</b>, a trap <b>54</b>, and a flexible discharge joint <b>56</b>. The trap <b>54</b> includes first and second end portions <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>, and a trap portion <b>74</b> between the first and second end portions <b>70</b> and <b>72</b>. When the flexible drainage trap assembly <b>200</b> is installed, the first and second end portions <b>70</b> and <b>72</b> have higher elevations relative to the trap portion <b>74</b>, which allows the trap <b>54</b> to retain a pool of water in the trap portion <b>74</b> by gravity.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The plumbing fixture connector <b>52</b> is coupled to the first end portion <b>70</b> of the trap <b>54</b>, and the flexible discharge joint <b>56</b> is coupled to the second end portion <b>72</b> of the trap <b>54</b>. The plumbing fixture connector <b>52</b> can be a tailpiece or an adapter that is operable to be connected to a discharge of a plumbing fixture (not shown) and provide a conduit from the plumbing fixture to the trap <b>54</b>. In some embodiments, the plumbing fixture connector <b>52</b> may include a combination of tailpiece and adapter. The flexible discharge joint <b>56</b> is operable to be connected to a drainage pipe output (not shown) and provides a conduit from the trap <b>54</b> to the drainage pipe output.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The flexible discharge joint <b>56</b> comprises a flexible hose <b>60</b> having a substantially smooth inner surface <b>64</b>. The substantially smooth inner surface <b>64</b> offers the advantage of not being susceptible to accumulating organic waste inside the flexible hose <b>60</b> since no grooves are exposed on its interior surface as found on typical corrugated piping. The flexible hose <b>60</b> can be made of any flexible material known in the art to impart flexibility to the discharge joint <b>56</b>, including any thermoplastic rubber, any engineered polymer, or any chemically treated materials capable of resisting chemicals such as chlorides and acids. The flexible hose <b>60</b> also may be resistant to organic gases and fungus attacks. In one exemplary embodiment, the flexible hose <b>60</b> is made from a polyvinyl chloride (PVC) compound.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In some embodiments, the outer surface of the flexible hose <b>60</b> may be configured to have a corrugated portion to further improve the flexibility of the flexible hose <b>60</b>. The flexible hose <b>60</b> may be reinforced by any suitable means known in the art to improve its strength. In the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b>, the flexible hose <b>60</b> is reinforced by a plurality of rings <b>66</b> extending radially and outwardly from the outer surface of the flexible hose <b>60</b>. In the illustrated embodiment, those rings <b>66</b> are disposed in a threaded pattern around the outer surface of the flexible hose <b>60</b>, however, other embodiments may include other types of reinforcement rings <b>66</b>. Additionally, the flexible hose <b>60</b> may be constructed such that it resiliently maintains its curvature once it is bent into a desired shape. In such embodiments, the external portion of the flexible hose <b>60</b> may be collapsible/expandable piping, similar to telescopic or corrugated piping or tubing, which maintains one or more bends imparted to it when left in place. However, the internal portion of the flexible hose <b>60</b> is smooth, as discussed above, and sufficiently flexible to submit to any bends held by the external piping while maintaining a substantially smooth internal surface throughout the length of the flexible hose <b>60</b>. Such a flexible hose <b>60</b> may be constructed from two separate materials comprising the internal and external portions, or these two portions may be integrally formed. Moreover, the internal and external portions maybe constructed from the same material, or they may each be from one or more different materials even if integrally formed. For example, the external portion may be metal or hard plastic, while the internal portion is a soft plastic, silicone or rubber. In such embodiments, the flexible tube <b>60</b> may be formed by disposing molten plastic, silicone or rubber within a hard external portion, and then allowing the molten material to cool therein leaving a substantially smooth internal surface along the length of the flexible tube <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A</figref>, <b>2</b>B, and <b>3</b>, the flexible discharge joint <b>56</b> further includes an elbow <b>58</b> connecting a first end <b>76</b> of the flexible hose <b>60</b> to the trap <b>54</b>, and a drainage connector <b>62</b> coupled to a second end <b>78</b> of the flexible hose <b>60</b> for connection to a drainage pipe outlet (not shown). The flexible hose <b>60</b> may be releasably coupled to the elbow <b>58</b> and drainage connector <b>62</b> using any connecting mechanism known in the art, including mechanical coupling, welding, chemical bonding, or pressure coupling, or even by a technique or mechanism later developed. In some embodiments, the elbow <b>58</b>, flexible hose <b>60</b>, and the drainage connector <b>62</b> may be integrally molded into one unitary part to substantially reduce or eliminate the risk of leakage and simplify the installation of the drainage trap assembly <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the illustrated embodiment, the elbow <b>58</b> has a central opening <b>80</b> defined therethrough, and an outer wall <b>82</b>. The outer wall <b>82</b> has a circumferential slot <b>84</b> defined therein, which is operable to receive the first end portion <b>76</b> of the flexible hose <b>60</b>. When the end portion <b>76</b> is fitted and received in the circumferential slot <b>84</b>, the friction between the outer wall <b>82</b> and the end portion <b>76</b> allows the elbow <b>58</b> and flexible <b>60</b> to be securely and hermetically coupled. As such, the elbow <b>58</b> and drainage connector <b>62</b> are coupled to the flexible hose <b>60</b> by pressure without any need of tooling, solvent, or cement. The pressure coupling of the elbow <b>58</b> and drainage connector <b>62</b> to the flexible hose <b>60</b> allows an installer to dismantle the discharge joint <b>56</b> as many times as desired by pulling them apart. These parts of the discharge joint <b>60</b> may be reassembled easily by pushing them together. In other embodiments in which the elbow <b>58</b>, flexible hose <b>60</b>, and the drainage connector <b>62</b> are integrally molded into one unitary part, the possibility of leakage is substantially reduced or eliminated, and the installation of the drainage trap assembly <b>200</b> is simplified. However, accessibility to the inside of certain portions may thereby be limited, thus leaving to the installer which embodiment better suits his needs.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In one exemplary embodiment of an installation, the flexible drainage trap assembly <b>200</b> is installed by first connecting the plumbing fixture connector <b>52</b> to the discharge of a plumbing fixture (not shown). Before connecting the discharge joint <b>56</b> to the drainage pipe outlet (not shown), the flexible hose <b>60</b> can be bent to adjust the orientation of the discharge joint <b>56</b> so that it matches the alignment of the drainage pipe outlet. Once the discharge joint <b>56</b> and the drainage pipe outlet are properly aligned, they can be connected to complete the installation. It is to be appreciated that the flexible drainage trap assembly <b>200</b> provides a high degree of adjustment during installation, thus accommodating various misalignments between plumbing fixture discharges and discharge pipes. In a particular embodiment, aligning the discharge joint <b>56</b> and the drainage pipe outlet may require disassembling the discharge joint <b>56</b> and cutting away a piece of the flexible hose <b>60</b> to make it shorter. The discharge joint <b>56</b> is then reassembled and aligned before being connected to the drainage pipe outlet. In another embodiment, the drainage pipe outlet may be too distant from the drainage trap assembly <b>200</b> and the flexible hose <b>60</b> can be replaced with a longer hose. In either such embodiment, the quick-connectability of the flexible hose <b>60</b> to other components as described above allows for quick, on-site adjustments to be made during installation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a flexible drainage trap assembly <b>300</b> includes a plumbing fixture connector <b>90</b>, a trap <b>92</b>, a drainage joint <b>94</b>, and a flexible hose <b>96</b>. Similar to the trap <b>54</b> as discussed above, trap <b>92</b> comprises first and second end portions <b>98</b> and <b>99</b>, and a trap portion <b>102</b> between the first and second end portions <b>98</b> and <b>99</b> that is operable to retain a pool of water in the trap portion <b>102</b> by gravity. The trap <b>92</b> is connected to the plumbing fixture connector <b>90</b> by the flexible hose <b>96</b>. A first end <b>104</b> of the flexible hose is coupled to the plumbing fixture connector <b>90</b>, and a second end <b>106</b> of the flexible hose <b>96</b> is coupled to the first end portion <b>98</b> of the trap <b>92</b>. The second end portion <b>99</b> of the trap <b>92</b> is coupled to the discharge joint <b>94</b>. The plumbing fixture connector <b>90</b> and discharge joint <b>94</b> are operable to be connected to a discharge of a plumbing fixture (not shown) and a drainage pipe output (not shown), respectively. The plumbing fixture connectors <b>90</b> can include a tailpiece, an adapter, or a combination of both.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Like the flexible hose <b>60</b> described above, the flexible hose <b>96</b> includes an inner surface (not shown) that is substantially smooth, and can be made of any flexible material known in the art to impart flexibility to the drainage trap assembly <b>300</b>. In the embodiment shown in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the flexible hose <b>96</b> also includes a plurality of rings <b>108</b> extending radially and outwardly from the outer surface of the flexible hose <b>96</b>. As before, these rings <b>108</b> may be in a thread-like pattern or they may be individually formed on the hose <b>96</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is another embodiment of the drainage trap assembly <b>300</b>, which includes two plumbing fixture connectors <b>90</b>, each being connected to the first end portion <b>98</b> of the trap <b>92</b> by a flexible hose <b>96</b>. The plumbing fixture connectors <b>90</b> are operable to be connected to the discharge of the same plumbing fixtures <b>110</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, or to the discharges of two different plumbing fixtures (not shown). In the exemplary embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, one of the plumbing fixture connectors <b>90</b> is connected to a first discharge <b>132</b> of the double sink <b>110</b>, and the other plumbing fixture connector <b>90</b> is connected to the discharge of a waste disposal unit <b>130</b>, which receives waste from the second discharge <b>134</b> of the double sink <b>110</b>. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is another exemplary embodiment, in which one of the plumbing fixture connectors <b>90</b> includes a T-adapter <b>138</b>. The T-adapter <b>138</b> allows the referenced plumbing fixture connector <b>90</b> to be connected to both the first discharge <b>132</b> of the double sink <b>110</b> and a second plumbing fixture (not shown) such as a dishwasher.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some embodiments, the first end portion <b>98</b> of the trap <b>92</b> comprises a Y-fitting <b>112</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, which in turn includes first and second joint portions <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> for connection to the flexible hoses <b>96</b>. The first ends <b>104</b> of the flexible hoses <b>96</b> are mounted on the plumbing fixture connectors <b>90</b>, and the second ends <b>106</b> of the flexible hoses <b>96</b> are mounted on the first and second joint portions <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> of the Y-fitting <b>112</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, B, and C, the Y-fitting <b>112</b> includes threads <b>118</b> on the outer surface of the first and second joint portions <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. As the second ends <b>106</b> of the flexible hoses <b>96</b> are disposed over the first and second joint portions <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>, the wall of the flexible hoses <b>96</b> conforms to the contour of the threads <b>118</b>, which allows the threads <b>118</b> to engage the plurality of reinforcement rings <b>108</b>. As such, the flexible hoses <b>96</b> are threadably connected to the joint portions <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. It is to be appreciated that other securing mechanisms known in the art or later developed can also be implemented in the embodiments described herein to secure the flexible hoses <b>96</b> to the joint portions <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. Moreover, such threaded connection of a flexible hose constructed as disclosed herein may also be used in other embodiments of trap assemblies, such as the earlier embodiments discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The Y-fitting <b>112</b> also includes at least one sealing member <b>120</b> extending radially and outwardly from the outer surface of the first and second joint portions <b>114</b> and <b>116</b>. The sealing member <b>120</b> cooperates with the inner smooth surface of the flexible hose <b>96</b> to provide a substantially water-proof seal. The sealing member <b>120</b> may have various cross-sectional profiles depending on the application and design of the drainage trap assembly <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, a trapezoidal profile as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> provides the optimal seal against leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">It is to be appreciated that the securing mechanism and the sealing mechanism described above can be implemented in any embodiments described herein in accordance with the principles of the present disclosure. For example, in some embodiments, the first end portion <b>98</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> may include threads <b>118</b> for mounting and securing the second end <b>106</b> of the flexible hose <b>96</b> as described above. In some other embodiments, the first end portion <b>98</b> also may include a sealing member <b>120</b> to provide a substantially water-proof seal. Furthermore, although the threads <b>118</b> are illustrated on the exterior of the Y-fitting <b>112</b>, in other embodiments, the threads <b>118</b> may be within the Y-fitting <b>112</b> and formed at the same pitch as threaded rings formed on a flexible hose. In such embodiments, the flexible hose may threadably engage the Y-fitting <b>112</b>, while a seal <b>120</b> may be provided within the Y-fitting to contact an end of the flexible hose.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the first and second joint portions <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> are aligned at angles &#x3c6; and &#x3c3; relative to the longitudinal axis of outlet portion <b>150</b> of the Y-fitting <b>112</b>, respectively. The angles &#x3c6; and &#x3c3; are the same in some embodiments, and different in other embodiments. The angles &#x3c6; and &#x3c3; are acute angles (less than 90 degrees), and in some embodiments, the angles &#x3c6; and &#x3c3; are preferably between 25 to 65 degrees. In some particular embodiments, the most preferred angles &#x3c6; and &#x3c3; are 45 degrees. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, an exemplary embodiment of the plumbing fixture connector <b>90</b> is shown to include first and second ends <b>122</b> and <b>124</b>, which have first and second longitudinal axes <b>126</b> and <b>128</b>, respectively. The first and second ends <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> are bent relative to each other such that the first and second axes <b>122</b> and <b>124</b> form an acute angle &#x3b8;. In some embodiments, the angle &#x3b8; is preferably between 15 to 45 degrees. In some particular embodiments, the most preferred angle &#x3b8; is 32 degrees. The bent plumbing fixture connector <b>90</b> and the angular alignment of the joint portions <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> of the Y-fitting <b>112</b> allow for improved alignment between these two components, which in turn. reduces the stress on the connections between the plumbing fixture connectors <b>90</b> and the flexible hoses <b>96</b>, and the flexible hoses <b>96</b> and the joint portions <b>114</b> and <b>116</b> of the Y-fitting <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Also, in some embodiments, a longitudinal axis of the first joint portion <b>114</b> and the longitudinal axis of the outlet portion <b>150</b> define a first plane, a longitudinal axis of the second joint portion <b>116</b> and the longitudinal axis of the outlet portion <b>150</b> define a second plane, and the first and second planes are different. In some embodiments, a longitudinal edge of the first joint portion <b>114</b> extends parallel to the longitudinal axis of the first joint portion <b>114</b>, and a longitudinal edge of the second joint portion <b>116</b> extends parallel to the longitudinal axis of the second joint portion <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The first end <b>122</b> of the plumbing fixture connector <b>90</b> can be coupled to the first end <b>104</b> of flexible hose <b>96</b> using any coupling mechanism know in the art. In some embodiments, the first end <b>122</b> may include the threads <b>118</b> as described above for securing the flexible hose <b>96</b>. Additionally, in some embodiments, the first end <b>122</b> also may include the sealing member <b>120</b> as described above for providing a substantially water-proof seal.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, in one exemplary embodiment, the flexible drainage trap assembly <b>300</b> is installed by assembling the plumbing fixture connectors <b>90</b>, flexible hoses <b>96</b>, trap <b>92</b>, and the discharge joint <b>94</b>. The plumbing fixture connectors <b>90</b> are loosely coupled to the first and second discharges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> of the double sink <b>110</b>. For example, the plumbing fixture connectors <b>90</b> and the first and second discharges <b>132</b> and <b>134</b> may be threadably coupled.
