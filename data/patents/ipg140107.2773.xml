<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates a method of treating demyelination diseases. In particular the method involves the administration of atypical antipsychotics, such as quetiapine or a structural analog thereof, to treat demyelination diseases, for example multiple sclerosis, in a subject in need thereof.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Myelin sheaths, which cover many nerve fibers, are composed of lipoprotein layers formed in early life. Myelin formed by the oligodendroglia in the CNS differs chemically and immunologically from that formed by the Schwann cells peripherally, but both types have the same function: to promote transmission of a neural impulse along an axon.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Many congenital metabolic disorders (eg, phenylketonuria and other aminoacidurias; Tay-Sachs, Niemann-Pick, and Gaucher's diseases; Hurler's syndrome; Krabbe's disease and other leukodystrophies) affect the developing myelin sheath, mainly in the CNS. Unless the biochemical defect can be corrected or compensated for, permanent, often widespread, neurologic deficits result.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Demyelination in later life is a feature of many neurologic disorders; it can result from damage to nerves or myelin due to local injury, ischemia, toxic agents, or metabolic disorders. Extensive myelin loss is usually followed by axonal degeneration and often by cell body degeneration, both of which may be irreversible. However, remyelination occurs in many instances, and repair, regeneration, and complete recovery of neural function can be rapid. Recovery often occurs after the segmental demyelination that characterizes many peripheral neuropathies; this process may account for the exacerbations and remissions of multiple sclerosis (MS). Central demyelination (ie, of the spinal cord, brain, or optic nerves) is the predominant finding in the primary demyelinating diseases, whose etiology is unknown. The most well known is MS. Other diseases include, for example, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (postinfectious encephalomyelitis), adrenoleukodystrophy, adrenomyeloneuropathy, Leber's hereditary optic atrophy and related mitochondrial disorders and human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) infection-associated myelopathy.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS). In pathology, the disease is characterized as scattered demyelination lesions, axonal loss and damage in both the brain and spinal cord (Lassmann, 2005), which results in a multiplicity of neurological deficits. Current therapies for managing patients with MS primarily target the inflammatory aspect of the disease (Zamvil and Steinman, 2003) and are only partly effective and limited by side effects. Recent studies suggest that glutamate-mediated cytotoxicity (excitotoxicity) (Stover et al., 1997; Barkhatova et al., 1998; Smith et al., 1999; Pitt, 2000), oxidative stress (Gilgum-Sherki et al., 2004) and mitochondrial damage (Andrews et al., 2005), may play vital roles in the pathogenesis of MS.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Remyelination is generally accepted as a regular event in MS lesions (Prineas et al., 1993; Raine et al., 1993); however, it is insufficient for myelin repair and axons remain demyelinated in MS patients (Prineas et al., 1993; Lovas et al., 2000). Possible explanations for this include failure of recruitment or survival of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), disturbance of differentiation/maturation of OPCs, and loss of capability of myelin forming (Wolswijk et al., 1998; Chang et al., 2003). Therefore, effective interventions for MS should not only prevent disease progression, but also promote remyelination.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic which has good efficacy and tolerability and which is useful in the treatment of schizophrenia. The use of quetiapine for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (Goldstein, 2004) and substance abuse (Brown, 2004) has also been proposed.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs), such as clozapine and quetiapine, have been widely used for treating a range of severe psychiatric disorders (Thanvi et al., 2004; Gao et al., 2005) and mental symptoms in neurological diseases (Baum et al., 2003; Bosboom et al., 2004; Altschuler et al., 2005; Carson et al., 2006). Neuroprotective effects of APDs have recently been highlighted in both in vitro and in vivo studies as new features of their therapies. In 1993, Farber and colleagues reported that the neurotoxicity produced by dizocilpine, an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist, in the rat retrosplenial cortex could be significantly decreased by clozapine pre-treatment (Farber et al., 1993). A subsequent study showed that olanzapine had the same effect in preventing MK-801-induced neurotoxicity (Farber et al., 1996). Other groups also reported that pre-treatment with clozapine or olanzapine blocked the neuronal vacuolization and significantly attenuated the expression of Fos-like protein in the rat retrosplenial cortex induced by dizocilpine (Fujimura et al., 2000; Hashimoto et al., 2000).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It has been demonstrated that quetiapine and olanzapine could attenuate the immobilization stress-induced decrease in the expression of BDNF in rat hippocampus (Xu et al., 2002; Luo et al., 2004), and modulate the short- and long-term behavioral consequences of chronic administration of dl-amphetamine in rats (He et al., 2005). In vitro studies also supported that the APDs clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, and risperidone can reduce the PC 12 cell death caused by serum withdrawal or the addition of hydrogen peroxide, &#x3b2;-amyloid peptide, or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+). These protective effects may be related to the regulation of expression of the low affinity NGF receptor p75 and SOD1 in PC2 cells by the drugs (Bai et al., 2002; Wei et al., 2003, Qing et al., 2003). Results from a clinical trial indicated that atypical drug treatment markedly increased the levels of plasma NGF in schizophrenia patients compared with never-treated patients or the patients treated with typical agents (Parikh et al., 2003).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the present application, using an established de- and re-myelination model, it has been shown that quetiapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug (APD) decreases the demyelination induced by cuprizone and promotes mature oligodendrocyte resettlement in demyelinated areas during the remyelination process in mouse brain. Specifically, in the present study, it was demonstrated that: (1) co-administration of quetiapine attenuates cuprizone-induced demyelination; (2) feeding with cuprizone causes spatial memory impairment in mice that is reversed by quetiapine treatment; (3) quetiapine alleviates the activation and accumulation of oligodendrocyte progenitors responding to demyelination; (4) quetiapine does not alter the depletion of mature oligodendrocytes in the demyelinated area; and (5) during the remyelination process, quetiapine treatment promotes repopulation of mature oligodendrocytes in lesions.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Accordingly the present invention includes a method of treating a demyelination disease comprising administering to a subject in need thereof, an effective amount of a compound selected from quetiapine and analogs of quetiapine, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs thereof, said compound being effective for the attenuation of demyelination in said subject.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention also includes a use of a compound selected from quetiapine and analogs of quetiapine, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs thereof, to treat a demyelination disease, said compound being effective for the attenuation of demyelination in said subject. Further, the present invention includes a use of a compound selected from quetiapine and analogs of quetiapine, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs thereof, to prepare a medicament to treat a demyelination disease, said drug being effective for the attenuation of demyelination in said subject.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In an embodiment of the invention, the demyelination disease is multiple sclerosis.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Quetiapine attenuates demyelination and reverses memory impairment induced by cuprizone. During the remyelination, quetiapine promotes mature oligodendrocyte repopulation in demyelinated lesions. This is the first time the effects of quetiapine on demyelination and remyelination have been looked at. Due to the complicated pathogenesis of MS, current immunomodulation treatments have limited effects on preventing demyelination and promoting remyelination. By taking advantage of the neuroprotection, the effects on oligodendrocyte regulation, and cognitive dysfunction management, atypical antipsychotic drugs, such as quetiapine, are candidates for treating patients with demyelination disorders, such as, multiple sclerosis.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Quetiapine is an atypical antipsychotic drug widely used in treating neuropsychiatric disorders. Previous studies have demonstrated that quetiapine provides neuroprotective effects, following various insults to animals or cells in cultures. In vitro data indicates that quetiapine selectively promotes neural stem cell differentiation into oligodendrocyte lineage and facilitates myelin forming. To examine the effects of quetiapine on demyelination and remyelination in vivo, young C57BL/6 mice were exposed to cuprizone intoxication (0.2% w/w in chow) for 5 weeks with continuous treatment of quetiapine (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.) or vehicle (water). Compared to vehicle treatment, demyelination in the brain was significantly decreased in quetiapine-treated mice. This reduction of demyelination is correlated to decrease in oligodendrocyte progenitor cell accumulation. Quetiapine also improves the working memory impairment caused by cuprizone treatment in mice. When cuprizone is removed from the diet, remyelination occurs spontaneously. During the remyelination process, quetiapine treatment dramatically increases mature oligodendrocyte resettlement in demyelinated areas; which is possibly facilitated by oligodendrocyte progenitor proliferation and differentiation. This data indicates that quetiapine will have beneficial effects on both de- and re-myelination, meaning that quetiapine and its analogs will be a candidate for treating demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS).</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Accordingly the present invention includes a method of treating a demyelination disease comprising administering to a subject in need thereof, an effective amount of a compound selected from quetiapine and analogs of quetiapine, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs thereof, said compound being effective for the attenuation of demyelination in said subject.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The present invention also includes a use of a compound selected from quetiapine and analogs of quetiapine, and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, solvates and prodrugs thereof, to treat a demyelination disease, said compound being effective for the attenuation of demyelination in said subject.

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The compound is one that is effective for the attenuation of demyelination in a subject. By &#x201c;attenuation of demylination&#x201d; it is meant that the amount of demyelination in the subject as a result of the disease or as a symptom of the disease is reduced when compared to otherwise same conditions and/or the amount of remyelination in the subject is increased when compared to otherwise same conditions. By &#x201c;reduced&#x201d; it is meant any measurable or detectable reduction in the amount of demyelination or in any symptom of the demyelination disease that is attributable to demyelination. Likewise, the term &#x201c;increased&#x201d; means any measurable or detectable increase in the amount of remyelination which will also manifest as a reduction in any symptom of the demyelination disease that is attributable to demyelination. In an embodiment of the invention, attenuation of demyelination in a subject is as compared to a control. Symptoms attributable to demyelination will vary depending on the disease but may include, for example but not limited to, neurological deficits, such as cognitive impairment (including memory, attention, conceptualization and problem-solving skills) and information processing; paresthesias in one or more extremities, in the trunk, or on one side of the face; weakness or clumsiness of a leg or hand; or visual disturbances, eg, partial blindness and pain in one eye (retrobulbar optic neuritis), dimness of vision, or scotomas.</p>

Illustrative organic acids that form suitable salts include mono-, di-, and tricarboxylic acids such as glycolic, lactic, pyruvic, malonic, succinic, glutaric, fumaric, malic, tartaric, citric, ascorbic, maleic, benzoic, phenylacetic, cinnamic and salicylic acids, as well as sulfonic acids such as p-toluene sulfonic and methanesulfonic acids. Either the mono or di-acid salts can be formed, and such salts may exist in either a hydrated, solvated or substantially anhydrous form. In general, the acid addition salts of the compounds are more soluble in water and various hydrophilic organic solvents, and generally demonstrate higher melting points in comparison to their free base forms. The selection of the appropriate salt will be known to one skilled in the art. Other non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts, e.g. oxalates, may be used, for example, in the isolation of compounds, for laboratory use, or for subsequent conversion to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt. In an embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is a chloride, maleate, fumarate, citrate, phosphate, methane sulphonate or sulfate salt. In another embodiment of the invention, the pharmaceutically acceptable salt is a fumarate salt, for example a hemi-fumarate salt.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The term &#x201c;pharmaceutically acceptable basic addition salt&#x201d; as used herein means any non-toxic organic or inorganic base addition salt of any acid compound of the invention. Acidic compounds that may form a basic addition salt include, for example, those having a acidic hydrogen, for example, C(O)OH. Illustrative inorganic bases which form suitable salts include lithium, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or barium hydroxide. Illustrative organic bases which form suitable salts include aliphatic, alicyclic or aromatic organic amines such as methylamine, trimethylamine and picoline or ammonia. The selection of the appropriate salt will be known to a person skilled in the art. Other non-pharmaceutically acceptable basic addition salts, may be used, for example, in the compounds of the invention, for laboratory use, or for subsequent conversion to a pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The formation of a desired compound salt is achieved using standard techniques. For example, the neutral compound is treated with an acid in a suitable solvent and the formed salt is isolated by filtration, extraction, recrystallization or any other suitable method.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The term &#x201c;solvate&#x201d; as used herein means a compound of the invention wherein molecules of a suitable solvent are incorporated in the crystal lattice.

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Cuprizone-induced Demyelination/Remyelination and Administration of Quetiapine</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">To test whether quetiapine can protect mouse brain from cuprizone-induced demyelination, 8-week old mice were fed a diet of milled LabDiet&#xae; rodent chow (PMI nutrition international LLC, Brentwood, Mo., USA) containing 0.2% cuprizone for 5 weeks (w/w) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo., USA) as previously described (Morell et al., 1998). Animals showed no severe side effects of this treatment. The study included the following 4 groups (6-8 animals/group): group 1: control, fed with regular chow (con); group 2: pre-administrated with quetiapine (10 mg/kg/day in drinking water) for 1 week, then followed by 5 weeks of quetiapine administration with normal diet (que); group 3: fed for 5 weeks on a cuprizone-containing diet (cup) with regular tap water for drinking; group 4: pre-administrated with quetiapine (10 mg/kg/day in drinking water) for 1 week, then followed by 5 weeks of quetiapine treatment with cuprizone administration (cup+que).</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">To study the effect of quetiapine on the remyelination process, an additional two groups (6-8 animals/group) of mice were treated with 0.2% cuprizone in milled chow for 6 weeks, and then returned to a cuprizone-free diet (Matsushima and Morell, 2001). Upon resumption of the cuprizone-free diet, mice were fed with either vehicle (water) or quetiapine (10 mg/kg/day in water, que) for 2 weeks.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">Behavioral Testing</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Locomotor Activity Test</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">One day before the end of these experiments, spontaneous motor activity was measured using a locomotion detection system equipped with photo-beams. Mice were individually placed in a transparent cage (40&#xd7;40&#xd7;25 cm) for 6 minutes, after 1 min adaptation, the frequency of photo-beam interruptions by the mouse in the following 5 min was recorded as the number of total movements (horizontal and vertical) (Bushnell et al., 1986).</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">Y-maze Spontaneous Alternation</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Immediately after the locomotor activity test, spatial working memory was assessed by recording spontaneous alternation behavior in a Y-maze comprised of three 30-cm compartments marked as A, B, and C arms. Spontaneous alternation behavior is based on the natural tendency of rodents to explore a novel environment. In a Y-maze, mice tend to explore the maze by systematically entering each arm. For efficient alternation, mice are required to know which arms have already been visited. Therefore, alternation behavior can be regarded as a measure involving spatial working memory. A mouse with an impaired working memory cannot remember which arm it has just visited, and thus shows decreased spontaneous alternation (Wietrzych et al., 2005). Each mouse was placed at the end of one arm and allowed to move freely through the maze during an 8-min period. The total number and series of arm entries were recorded visually. The number of overlapping entrance sequences (e.g., ABC, BCA) was defined as the number of alternations. The effect was calculated as the percentage of alternation according to the following formula: Percent alternation=(number of alternations)/(total number of arm entries-2)&#xd7;100 (Wall et al., 2002). Total entries were scored as an index of ambulatory activity in the Y-maze, and mice showing scores below six entries would be excluded.</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Tissue Preparation and Immunohistochemical Analysis</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">At the end of their treatment period, mice were anaesthetized with pentobarbital sodium at 50 mg/kg and perfused intracardially with 0.01 M PBS followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and the brains were post-fixated overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde. Brain tissues were then rinsed 3 times with 0.01 M PBS and cryoprotected in 30% sucrose at 4&#xb0; C. for one day and frozen at &#x2212;80&#xb0; C. for immunostaining. Serial coronal sections were dissected between levels 1 to &#x2212;1 mm bregma, as defined in the mouse brain atlas of Franklin and Paxinos (Franklin and Paxinos, 1997). Demyelination was evaluated in frozen sections (30 &#x3bc;m) of the corpus callosum using Luxol fast blue with periodic acid-Schiff reaction. Floating frozen sections (30 &#x3bc;m) were incubated with 0.3% of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>in 0.01 M PBS for 30 min at room temperature (RT) for quenching endogenous peroxidase activity, then blocked with 10% goat serum/PBS or 10% rabbit serum (for MBP staining) for 1 hour at RT, and then incubated overnight with the primary antibody(s) diluted in the blocking solution. After rinsing, the sections were incubated with the appropriate biotin-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.) for 1 hour at RT. Sections were then developed with the avidin biotin complex kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, Calif.) and the antibodies were visualized with DAB chromogen (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo.).</p>

The rabbit polyclonal NG2 antibody (1:200; Chemicon, Temecula, Calif.) was used as a marker for oligodendrocyte progenitors (Nishiyama et al., 1996).</p>
<p id="h-0015" num="0000">Image Analysis</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">For GST-pi and NG2 quantification, three digital pictures from the coronal section from each animal (including the middle line and the two edges of the corpus callosum in each section) were examined.

Results are expressed as the average of at least 6 mice per group. For MBP staining analysis, three digital pictures from the coronal section (including cerebral cortex) of each animal were examined, at least 6 animals of each group.

<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In the present study, it was found that 0.2% cuprizone administration for 5 weeks markedly impaired spontaneous alternation behavior in the Y-maze and increased the total number of entries in Y-maze arms.

Brain sections were then stained by MBP immunostaining for myelin protein and LFB-PAS histology for myelin lipid. Sections from the 5-week cuprizone treatment group showed a significant demyelination in MBP staining; in contrast, sections from the group co-administrated with quetiapine and cuprizone showed less demyelination (35% reduction) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2.A-D</figref>). LFB-PAS staining showed the same trend as MBP staining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3.A-D</figref>).

<heading id="h-0023" level="1">Quetiapine Alters Progenitor Proliferation in Response to Demyelination</heading>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In response to demyelination and the depletion of mature oligodendrocytes, NG2+ oligodendrocyte progenitor cells rapidly accumulated within the demyelinating corpus callosum and differentiated into star-like morphology (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4.E</figref>) (Morell et al., 1998; Arnett et al., 2001); whereas, quetiapine co-administration dramatically decreased the number of NG2+ cells within the demyelinated areas (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4.A-D</figref>). While not wishing to be limited by theory, this result suggests that the reduction of demyelination could inhibit the accumulation of NG2+ cells. NG2+ cells were dramatically decreased after 2 weeks recovery from cuprizone treatment. Quetiapine had little effect on this change (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4.F</figref>, G).</p>

<heading id="h-0025" level="1">Quetiapine Treatment Accelerated the Repopulation of Mature Oligodendrocytes During Remyelination</heading>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">After 5 weeks of treatment, cuprizone induced a remarkable loss of mature oligodendrocytes in the corpus callosum, which is partly due to apoptosis (Mason et al., 2000, Arnett et al., 2002). To examine oligodendrocial loss, GST-pi, a mature myelinating oligodendrocyte marker, was stained. In both the cuprizone and cup+que groups, GST-pi+ cells almost totally vanished in the corpus callosum, which indicated that quetiapine did not reverse the loss of mature oligodendrocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5.A-D</figref>). Remyelination occurs when cuprizone is withdrawn from the diet and results in new mature oligodendrocytes present in the demyelinated lesions (Mason et al., 2000). In an in vitro study on neural progenitor cell cultures, quetiapine promoted the proliferation and differentiation of oligodendrocytes. To study if quetiapine treatment could also promote oligodendrocyte remyelination from demyelinated lesions, the GST-pi+ cells in the corpus callosum of mice that recovered from demyelination for 2 weeks were examined. The GST-pi+mature oligodendrocytes were dramatically increased in the quetiapine-treated mice (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5.E-F</figref>)</p>
<p id="h-0026" num="0000">Discussion</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">Feeding cuprizone for 5 weeks to young adult mice induces a reproductive and obvious demyelination. When cuprizone is removed, an extensive remyelination takes place within a few weeks (Blakemore et al., 1973). Compared to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an inflammatory demyelination model, the cuprizone model has a simpler immunological response with the absence of T cells (Bakker et al., 1987; Hiremath et al., 1998). Therefore, the cuprizone model is thought to be an ideal model for studying de- and re-myelination processes with less immunity response involved.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Based on this model, it was found that quetiapine treatment significantly ameliorates cuprizone-induced demyelination in mouse brain, either by LFB-PAS staining (Pappas et al., 1981) or MBP immunostaining (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>). As a response to demyelination, OPCs accumulate and display star-like morphology in demyelinated lesions (Mason et al., 2000). In the present study, the accumulation of OPCs was also decreased in the cup+que group, accompanied by the reduction of demyelination (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). This result demonstrates that alleviating demyelination also inhibits the accumulation of OPCs. While not wishing to be limited by theory, the difference in demyelination might be due to a delay in the loss of myelin-producing oligodendrocytes in quetiapine-treated mice, but GST-pi+ mature oligodendrocytes were almost absent in mice with either cuprizone treatment or co-administrated with quetiapine (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). It seems that demyelination and the loss of mature oligodendrocytes are not coincident at this time point, as previously addressed by McMahon and colleagues (McMahon et al., 2001). A possible explanation is that although a large number of GST-pi+ mature oligodendrocytes are lost through apoptosis during demyelination (Mason et al., 2000), a few mature oligodendrocytes may still survive with down-regulation of the GST-pi gene (Tansey et al., 1997) and, therefore, cannot be detected by GST-pi staining, which contributes to the absence of GST-pi cells (McMahon et al., 2001).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Again, while not wishing to be limited by theory, it is assumed that feeding cuprizone results in a decreased activity of cytochrome oxidase and a disturbance of energy metabolism in the mitochondria (Suzuki et al., 1969; Wakabayashi et al., 1978); that it decreases the activities of SOD (Ljutakova et al., 1985) and monoamine oxidase (Kesterson et al., 1971) and, thereby, induces oligodendrocyte apoptosis and demyelination. Recent studies have addressed inflammatory cytokines such as interferons (Mana et al., 2006; Lin et al., 2006, Gao et al., 2000) and tumor necrosis factor-&#x3b1; (TNF-&#x3b1;) (Arnett et al., 2001; McMahon et al., 2001), and growth factors like PDGF (Murtie et al., 2005; Woodruff et al., 2004), FGF2 (Armstrong et al., 2002) and IGF-1 (Mason et al., 2000; Mason et al., 2003) that are also involved in the de- and re-myelination processes. Other studies reported that quetiapine and other APDs were able to suppress apoptosis (He et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2004; Jarskog et al., 2006), protect cells against oxidative stress (Wang et al., 2005) and NMDA medicated excitotoxic injury (Farber et al., 1993; Farber et al., 1996), and up-regulate neural growth factor expression (e.g., NGF, GDNF, BDNF) (Xu et al., 2002; Parikh et al., 2003). Thus, it is hypothesized that these aspects of APDs (including quetiapine) may contribute to the protection of myelin from demyelination.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Studies show that about 40-60% of MS patients suffer cognitive impairment (Penman et al., 1991; McIntosh-Michaelis et al., 1991; Rao et al., 1991), including memory, attention, conceptualization and problem-solving skills, and information processing (Petersen et al., 1989). Among these, memory deficits, especially the long-term memory and working memory, are most typically involved (Grant et al., 1984; Beatty et al., 1988). In the cuprizone model, it was found that the decline of working memory impairment, displayed in the Y-maze test, was reversed by quetiapine treatment (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). Animal studies have also shown that quetiapine could reverse memory deficits induced by phencyclidine (He et al., 2006) and kainic acid (Martin et al., 2005).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">As a first report about memory impairment in a cuprizone model, it is hypothesized that memory impairment is associated with demyelination lesions and, thereby, the cuprizone model may be applied as an MS model, not only for demyelination studies, but also for evaluating demyelination-related memory deficits. When the challenge of cuprizone is terminated, remyelination occurs spontaneously.</p>
