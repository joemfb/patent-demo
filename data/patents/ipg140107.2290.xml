<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Coffee preparation, that is, the process of producing a beverage using the coffee bean, typically requires four basic steps be performed: (i) the raw coffee beans are roasted; (ii) the roasted coffee beans are ground; (iii) the ground coffee beans are brewed, i.e., mixed with hot water for a period of time; and (iv) the liquid coffee beverage is separated from the unwanted grounds. Additional steps may include, for example, adding milk, sweetener, flavorings, and/or other additives to the brewed liquid. Typically in much of the world, the roasted coffee beans are purchased by the user, who then performs the remaining steps. Various coffee brewing systems are known in the art, ranging from personal brewers such as drip coffee makers and French presses, to large commercial systems used for producing a dizzying array of flavored espresso-based beverages.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Ground coffee may be brewed in a number of different ways that may be categorized into four basic methods (as discussed in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_preparation). The four methods are (1) boiling, for example placing ground coffee into a cup and pouring hot water over the grounds, allowing the grounds to settle; (2) steeping, for example, placing ground coffee into a French press and waiting a few minutes before depressing the filtered plunger and pouring the brewed liquid into a cup; (3) filtration, for example drip brewing wherein the ground coffee is placed in a filter holder and hot water drips onto the coffee grounds into a carafe or the like; and (4) pressure methods, for making espresso wherein hot water typically between 91&#xb0; C. and 96&#xb0; C. is forced under a pressure of between eight and nine atmospheres through a lightly packed matrix or &#x201c;puck&#x201d; of finely ground coffee.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The different brewing methods have various disadvantages. For example, boiling and steeping methods require some time, typically 4-7 minutes, to produce an optimally flavored beverage. Filtration methods may be quicker, but do not produce the full bodied coffee that many consumers prefer, and/or may require more coffee grounds to produce an acceptable flavor. Espresso may be relatively quick, but requires relatively high pressures (8-9 atmospheres). Moreover, the high pressures are typically produced by steam, and the relatively high temperatures and pressures produce a very strong and distinctive flavor that some consumers may not prefer.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Similar considerations apply to other brewable beverages, such as teas and the like, which may be similarly brewed.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">There is a need, therefore, for a system and method for brewing coffee and other beverages that retains the benefits associated with brewing coffee grounds that are suspended in the heated water, with the rapid brewing associated with pressure brewing methods.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is important to consumers and producers alike, to be able to produce a consistent, high-quality brewed beverage, for example a coffee beverage. The quality of a brewed coffee depends on a number of different and often related parameters. The quality of a brewed coffee will typically depend on both the amount of coffee soluble components in the brewed liquid, and which of the coffee soluble components are present. If the coffee is under-brewed, for example, certain of the desirable flavor and aroma components may not be obtained from the coffee bean, resulting in an inferior product. Conversely, if the coffee is over-brewed, certain undesirable bitter soluble components may be dissolved in the liquid, again resulting in an inferior product. Conventionally, the quality of a brewed coffee liquid is characterized by measuring the total dissolved solids in the brewed beverage, and determining the percent of available solubles that were extracted from the coffee. However, the rate of extraction is not constant, so prior art quality determinations are made on the final brewed product. It may be difficult or inconvenient to obtain these parameters in the final product, which is typically provided to the end user, and may include flavorings or other additives at the time of dispensing.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In prior art brewing apparatus, objective evaluation of the quality of the brewed product is typically only obtained, if at all, periodically, for example daily, weekly, monthly or the like. Therefore producers of coffee products may not have timely notification if an adjustment to the brewing cycle, or maintenance of the brewing apparatus, is needed. It would be particularly advantageous to be able to automatically monitor and adjust the quality of the brewed product, so that the &#x201c;gold cup&#x201d; standard can be consistently achieved, thereby satisfying customer expectations and building brand loyalty.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In prior art brewing apparatus it is also difficult or impossible to identify whether particular blends or brands of coffee are being used with the apparatus, which may be important when the apparatus is provided to customers based on an expectation that a particular coffee brand will be used.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">For these and additional reasons, it would be beneficial to have brewing apparatus with a means for regularly monitoring the quality of a brewed beverage without having to analyze the final brewed product.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A particular embodiment of a brewing system in accordance with the present invention will now be described with reference to the figures, wherein like numbers indicate like parts. One or more of the present inventors is also an inventor for related and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/038,195, filed on Mar. 1, 2011, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference, in its entirety. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a perspective environmental view of a brewing system <b>100</b> in accordance with the present invention, having a hopper <b>102</b> disposed at a top of the system <b>100</b>, and holding a carafe <b>90</b> in the dispensing area <b>104</b>. A beverage selection and/or control panel <b>106</b> is shown generally above the dispensing area <b>104</b>. It is contemplated that the hopper <b>102</b> may define a plurality of selectable compartments containing different brewable materials, for example different types or species of coffee beans. For example, the beverage selection panel <b>106</b> may give users the option to select a beverage size (e.g., 12, 16, or 20 ounces), among beverage choices (e.g., regular coffee, decaffeinated coffee, tea), and/or among flavoring or other additive options (e.g., creamer, sweetener, syrup flavors). The beverage selection panel <b>106</b> may also allow selection of a parameter of the brewed beverage (e.g., strength), and/or provide feedback regarding a quality of the brewed beverage.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The brewing system <b>100</b> may be suitable for brewing various brewable materials, such as ground coffee, tea, or the like. Although the following discussion may refer specifically to coffee brewing systems in places, it will be understood that the teachings of the present invention may similarly be applied to other brewing systems, including tea brewing systems.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> shows a top view of the brewing system <b>100</b> with the hopper <b>102</b> and certain other portions removed to expose internal components. In this embodiment the brewing system <b>100</b> includes a brew group controller <b>110</b>, a power supply <b>112</b>, an optional flavoring controller <b>116</b> and a water heater/reservoir <b>114</b>. A grinder assembly <b>120</b> comprising two grinders <b>122</b>, <b>124</b> is positioned to receive product, for example coffee beans, from the hopper <b>102</b>. The brewable product from the grinder assembly <b>120</b> is expelled through a shared chute base <b>126</b>, and a chute assembly <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">A brew group <b>130</b>, shown in more detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, is plumbed to receive hot water from the reservoir <b>114</b> and configured to receive brewable product from the grinding assembly <b>120</b>. The brew group <b>130</b> includes a cylindrical brewing chamber <b>132</b>, currently formed with a cylindrical sleeve disposed in a block assembly <b>131</b>. The brewing chamber <b>132</b> is positioned to receive coffee grounds from the grinder assembly <b>120</b>. In a currently preferred embodiment the brewing chamber defines a cylindrical volume between 2 inches and 3.5 inches in diameter, and a height between 2.5 inches and 5.0 inches. However, the brew group including brewing chamber <b>132</b> may readily be scaled to other sizes.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A sliding arm assembly <b>134</b> is slidably disposed over the brewing chamber <b>132</b>, and is configured to push spent grounds or other brewed material off of the block assembly <b>131</b>. In this embodiment the sliding arm assembly <b>134</b> includes a C-shaped arm <b>134</b>A that extends across the width of the brewing chamber <b>132</b>. The lower transverse edges of the C-shaped arm <b>134</b>A are beveled. The arm <b>134</b>A is drivably attached to a drive arm subassembly <b>134</b>B. The drive arm subassembly <b>134</b>B is movable linearly by an actuator <b>134</b>C such that the C-shaped arm <b>134</b>A is controllably movable across the upper surface of the block assembly <b>131</b>. In the current embodiment, the actuator <b>134</b>C comprises an electric motor-driven worm gear system with a toothed belt (not shown) that drivably engages the drive arm subassembly <b>134</b>B.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Although not required for the present invention, the actuator <b>134</b>C, and the piston actuators discussed below, are preferably configured with encoders (not shown) to enable precise positioning of the various elements. In a current embodiment rotational sensors/encoders are provided on the drive motors, and linear sensors/encoders are provided on the drive shafts, to enable precise positional control. Exemplary sensors are Hall-effect sensors with magnets.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A novel aspect of the illustrated sliding arm assembly <b>134</b> is the flexibility of the assembly, which provides a very reliable and effective mechanism for removing spent coffee grounds, as discussed below. In particular, the drive arm subassembly <b>134</b>B slides along an upper surface of the actuator <b>134</b>C, and includes a spring-loaded hinged connection <b>134</b>D.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The operation of the brew group <b>130</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A-6E</figref>, which illustrate the brew group <b>130</b> in isolation with a portion of the brew chamber <b>132</b> cut away, at various stations in the brew cycle. It is contemplated that the operation of the components of the brewing system <b>100</b> will be automatically controlled by the controller <b>110</b> and related systems, in response to the specific beverage request entered by a user from the beverage selection panel <b>106</b>. Alternate means for entering a beverage request are also contemplated, for example using remote beverage entering system that is in signal communication with the brewing system <b>100</b>, wirelessly (e.g., using RF, Bluetooth&#xae;, or the like) or using a card reading system, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows the brew group <b>130</b> in position to receive brewable material, for example ground coffee from the grinder assembly <b>130</b>. The lower piston assembly <b>150</b> sealingly engages the brewing chamber <b>132</b>, positioned near the lower end of the chamber <b>132</b> by the second linear actuator <b>156</b>. The upper piston assembly <b>140</b> is positioned upwardly away from the brewing chamber <b>132</b> by the first linear actuator <b>146</b>, and pivoted to the load position above. Brewable material from the grinder assembly <b>120</b> is received into the brewing chamber <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the upper piston assembly <b>140</b> is moved to the brewing position to sealingly engage an upper end of the brewing chamber <b>132</b>. As the upper piston assembly <b>140</b> is moved downwardly, it pivots to a vertical orientation or brew position. It is contemplated that the vertical position of the lower piston assembly <b>150</b> may also be adjusted, for example to accommodate the selected beverage size. For example, if a &#x201c;small&#x201d; or &#x201c;8-ounce&#x201d; beverage was selected, the lower piston assembly <b>150</b> may be moved upwardly in the brewing chamber <b>132</b>. Valves (not shown) are positioned to close liquid egress from the brewing chamber <b>132</b>, and to fluidly connect the heated water reservoir <b>114</b> to the water supply tube <b>151</b>. This initiates the flow of hot water through the lower piston assembly <b>150</b> and into the brewing chamber <b>132</b>. Preferably the water pressure is maintained at a desired value to optimize brewing quality and/or speed. Preferably a nominal pressure in the range between 10 and 100 psig is maintained, and more preferably in the range of 20-60 psig for coffee or in the range of 10-50 psig for other brewable product such as tea.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">When the desired amount of water and the desired pressure has been provided, the water supply may optionally be stopped to provide a desired time for brewing. It will be appreciated by persons of skill in the art that the pressurized brewing chamber <b>132</b>, although lower in pressure than espresso makers, will nevertheless accelerate the brewing process as compared to prior art systems wherein the brewing chamber is not pressurized. In the current embodiment, the pressurized water supply from the heater/reservoir is regulated to provide a desired pressure. It is contemplated that the regulated pressure may be between 10 and 100 psig.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In a first embodiment or mode of operation of the system <b>100</b>, the water flow is resumed (or maintained) and a dispensing valve (not shown) is opened to initiate the flow of brewed beverage through the upper piston assembly channels <b>140</b>C, <b>143</b>C to the dispensing tube <b>141</b>, and then ultimately dispensed to the cup, carafe, or other container <b>90</b>. In an alternative second mode of operation, the lower piston assembly <b>150</b> is moved upwardly through the brewing chamber <b>132</b>, to cause the brewed liquid flow through the upper piston assembly <b>140</b> and to the dispensing tube <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref> shows the brew group <b>130</b> wherein the lower piston assembly <b>150</b> has been moved upwardly part way through brewing chamber <b>132</b>. In the first mode of operation, one or more valves (not shown) redirect the flow to a drain that is preferably plumbed into the system <b>100</b>. In the second mode of operation, the upward movement of the lower piston assembly <b>150</b> dispenses the brewed liquid. In either case, the now spent brewed material is compressed between the upper piston assembly <b>140</b> and the lower piston assembly <b>150</b>, such that a significant portion of the water is removed.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, the upper piston assembly <b>140</b> is moved upwardly to disengage from the brewing chamber <b>132</b> and pivots to the load position. The lower piston assembly <b>150</b> is moved upwardly such that the piston is approximately flush with the upper surface of the block assembly <b>131</b>. The compressed spent grounds are therefore positioned to be removed, and the upper piston assembly <b>140</b> is moved out of the way of the sliding arm assembly <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6E</figref> shows the sliding arm assembly <b>134</b> after sliding the C-shaped arm <b>134</b>A over the brewing chamber <b>132</b> to remove the spent grounds. The system <b>100</b> may include an internal repository or chute for the spent grounds, or may be positioned over an external repository positioned to receive the grounds. The sliding arm assembly <b>134</b> may then be retracted, to return to the ready position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">From the above description, it will be appreciated that the currently preferred system provides for a liquid flow through the brewing chamber <b>132</b> that is initiated with heated water entering through the lower piston assembly <b>150</b> at the bottom of the brewing chamber <b>132</b>, and brewed liquid exiting through the upper piston assembly <b>140</b>. Although not preferred, it will be apparent to persons of skill in the art that with straightforward changes, the present invention may be practiced with the liquid flow proceeding in the opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a conventional Coffee Brewing Control Chart <b>60</b>, attributed to Dr. E. E. Lockhart. The Control Chart <b>60</b> relates the soluble concentration or strength <b>62</b> in a brewed coffee liquid (a measure of the total dissolved solids in the liquid) to the soluble yield or extraction <b>64</b> from the coffee that generated the coffee liquid. Under this Control Chart, a coffee liquid having less than 1.15% soluble concentration will have a &#x201c;Weak&#x201d; flavor, and coffee having greater than 1.35% soluble concentration will have a &#x201c;Strong&#x201d; flavor. If less than 18% of the solubles are extracted from the brewed coffee then the flavor of the coffee liquid will be &#x201c;Underdeveloped,&#x201d; but if more than 22% of the solubles are extracted from the brewed coffee then the flavor will be &#x201c;Bitter.&#x201d; Therefore, the Control Chart defines an &#x201c;Ideal&#x201d; flavor region within these bounds. The diagonal curves indicate particular &#x201c;brewing formulas,&#x201d; i.e., the ratio of ground coffee (e.g., in ounces) to water brewed (e.g., in gallons). The line <b>66</b>, for example, corresponds to a ratio of 7.5 oz of coffee to one gallon of water. Lines to the right and below line <b>66</b> indicate progressively lower coffee-to-water ratio formulae, and lines to the left and above line <b>66</b> indicate progressively higher coffee-to-water ratio formulae.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Therefore, if the brewing formula is known, and the total dissolved solids (&#x201c;TDS&#x201d;) in the brewed liquid is known, the beverage location on the on the Control Chart <b>60</b> can be precisely determined. It should be appreciated that the Control Chart provides a guideline for producing a high quality coffee beverage, and that the preferred coffee liquid strength and extraction parameters are not necessarily in the center of the &#x201c;Ideal&#x201d; box in the Control Chart. In practice, it may be desirable to determine the strength and extraction parameters that are optimal for a particular coffee blend, e.g., a preferred location on the Control Chart <b>60</b>, and then to control the brewing cycle parameters to target those optimal values. It will also be appreciated that personal preferences may differ. For example, one person may prefer a beverage that is nearer the top of the &#x201c;Ideal&#x201d; box, whereas another user may prefer a beverage relatively lower in the &#x201c;Ideal&#x201d; box.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">It will be appreciated, as alluded to above, that the strength and extraction of a brewed beverage may be controlled or modified through different parameters in the brewing process, for example by adjusting one or more of (i) the coffee to water formula, (ii) the brewing time, (iii) the water temperature, (iv) the water pressure, (v) the grind size, etc. The optimal strength and extraction targets will also generally be dependent on the particular blend or brand of coffee. Although the Control Chart <b>60</b> is specifically directed to brewing coffee, it is contemplated that very similar methods may be used to characterize the quality of other brewed liquids, for example particular teas.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">One difficulty in using the Control Chart <b>60</b> in an automated brewing system such as the system <b>100</b>, is that the strength or TDS in the brewed liquid in the Control Chart is the final or batch value at the end of the brewing cycle. This batch value is typically inconvenient or difficult to obtain.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> illustrates a simplified block diagram of the brewing system <b>100</b>, showing the hopper <b>102</b>, water reservoir <b>114</b>, grinder assembly <b>120</b>, and brew group <b>130</b> described above. An inline sensor or sensor array <b>200</b> is fluidly connected to the dispensing tube <b>141</b>, such that the brewed liquid flows by or through the sensor array <b>200</b>. (As used herein, a sensor array may include a single sensor or a plurality of sensors.) The sensor array <b>200</b> measures properties of the brewed liquid at a particular inline location along the flow path, as the brewed liquid flows from the brew group <b>130</b> towards the dispensing container <b>90</b>. The sensor array <b>200</b>, therefore, will produce a time-dependent output showing the measured property of the liquid stream as it flows by the sensor array <b>200</b>. In a current embodiment the sensor array <b>200</b> is located along the fluid path shortly downstream of the brew group <b>130</b>, although other locations are also contemplated, including at the brewed liquid dispensing station.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The sensing array <b>200</b> provides specific data regarding qualities of the brewed liquid that may be used, for example, to monitor the quality of the beverage. The data provides feedback that may be used to initially configure particular settings of the system <b>100</b>, and/or to monitor each brew to provide feedback that may be used to adjust brew parameters to maintain optimal product quality.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A controller <b>210</b>, which in this embodiment includes a programmable processor <b>212</b>, a memory module <b>214</b>, a plurality of data input ports <b>216</b>, a control signal generator <b>218</b>, and a program interface module <b>220</b>, is in signal communication with the sensor array <b>200</b>. The controller <b>210</b> may additionally be in signal communication with other components of the brewing system, as indicted by the dashed lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The sensor array <b>200</b> produces unsteady or time-dependent signals preferably over the entire period that the brewed liquid passes through or by the sensor array <b>200</b>. The signals represent a measured property of the brewed liquid. The unsteady signals are transmitted to the controller <b>210</b>. Additional data may also be transmitted to the controller <b>210</b>, for example data from other system components such as the grinder <b>120</b>, water supply <b>114</b>, etc. For example, temperature sensors (e.g., a brewing chamber temperature thermocouple) may provide information that is useful for interpreting data from the sensor array <b>200</b>. Similarly, the current grinder setting may be transmitted to the controller <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a particular embodiment external data may also be provided to the controller <b>210</b>. For example, the coffee blend and/or brand may be provided using a reader (e.g., barcode or RF system, etc.) that obtains data from coffee packaging, and transmits the data to the controller <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The controller <b>210</b> processes the received data, and uses the data to generate control signals to adjust one or more brewing parameters to achieve a desired and consistent brew quality. For example, the grind time (i.e., quantity of ground coffee), grind size, hot water temperature, brewing pressure, and brew time are all potentially adjustable parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The controller <b>210</b> may further include a communications port <b>94</b>, for example with wired or wireless connection to a network (not shown), such that sensor array <b>200</b> data and related information (e.g., TDS/strength, brewing formula, extraction, etc.) and the state of various brew parameters may be reported out. For example, the quality of each brewed beverage (e.g., strength and extraction) may be reported and recorded, to verify that the desired quality is consistently maintained in the &#x201c;gold cup&#x201d; box of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates graphically output data from an embodiment of the sensor array <b>200</b> that includes a TDS meter, for example a conductivity meter calibrated to indicate the level of total dissolved solids in the fluid stream. In this example the individual curves relate the measured TDS <b>302</b> as a function of time <b>304</b> as measured by the sensor array <b>200</b> during the beverage dispensing cycle. The curves show the measured results for different brewing formulas, wherein the quantity of ground coffee deposited into the brewing chamber <b>132</b> was varied. In this exemplary graph, curve <b>306</b> shows the unsteady TDS measurement using 14.9 g of coffee, curve <b>308</b> shows the unsteady TDS measurement using 18.5 g of coffee, curve <b>310</b> shows the unsteady TDS measurement using 22.5 g of coffee; curve <b>312</b> shows the unsteady TDS measurement using 26.0 g of coffee, and curve <b>314</b> shows the unsteady TDS measurement using 29.7 g of coffee, all with a predetermined amount of water.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">It will be appreciated that the batch value of the TDS in the brewed liquid can be determined by suitably integrating the flow-weighted measured TDS over time. For example, if the flow rate is constant during the dispensing cycle measurement, then the batch TDS will be the average of the measured TDS during the dispensing cycle. It is contemplated that the sensor array <b>200</b> may further include a temperature sensor. The temperature can affect the measured TDS when a conductivity sensor is used, and therefore for improved accuracy the conductivity measurement for TDS may be adjusted to account for temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">It will also be appreciated that the shape of the time-dependent curves, or &#x201c;coffee signature&#x201d; data, provides additional information regarding the coffee and the brewed coffee liquid. The shape of the curves provides information regarding the rate that the solids are dissolved from the coffee matrix. This coffee signature data may be used to guide which of the various parameters in the brewing cycle should be adjusted to improve the quality of the brewed liquid. For example, in order to move the system towards a desired point on the Control Chart <b>60</b>, the system may elect to either add more coffee to the brewing formula, or may adjust to a finer grind of the coffee. An automated optimization strategy may be readily determined heuristically and then programmed into the controller <b>210</b> for subsequent brews. It will be appreciated that the heuristic formulation may be developed independently for different coffee blends, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">It is also contemplated that the coffee signature data may be used to determine the specific type, blend, or brand of coffee present in the system <b>100</b>. For example, data from the sensing array <b>200</b> may be used to distinguish between different coffee bean species such as coffea Arabica (commonly referred to as &#x201c;Arabica&#x201d;) and coffea canephora (commonly referred to as &#x201c;Robusta&#x201d;), and to identify subvarieties, types, and particular blends of coffee. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates TDS curves from the sensor array <b>200</b>, wherein curve <b>320</b> is for one coffee blend, and curve <b>322</b> is for another different coffee blend. The brewing parameters and brewing formula were the same for both curves <b>320</b>, <b>322</b>. The data from the sensing array <b>200</b> may therefore be used to identify the blend of coffee being used. Identifying the blend of coffee may further be used to customize and optimize the brewing parameters for the particular coffee blend (for subsequent brew cycles).</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In a particular embodiment, the memory module <b>214</b> is provided with a database of coffee signature curves, or family of curves, and the processor <b>212</b> compares the measured coffee signature data with the database of curves, to identify the coffee blend, and/or to determine if the coffee blend is in a particular group or family.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In addition, identifying the coffee blend may be important to ensuring that the intended blend or brand of coffee is used in a particular brewer apparatus. In some business models for providing coffee in commercial settings, for example, a coffee vendor may provide the brewing equipment at little or no cost, relying on the sales of consumables to make the business model work. The ability to identify that the coffee being used in the brewing equipment is from the vendor is important in such situations.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The time-dependent data may also be used to identify and provide diagnostic information if maintenance is required. For example, the time-dependent data may indicate that the ground coffee is not achieving the desired particle size, indicating maintenance or adjustment of the grinders may be needed.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As noted above, the taste preferences of users will vary. Most users will prefer a brewed coffee, for example, to be within the &#x201c;Ideal&#x201d; box in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, but the preferred location within that box may be different from person to person. It is contemplated, as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, that the user may input <b>92</b> a desired beverage from the control panel <b>106</b> of the brewing system. The input may include a mechanism for selecting within a range a desired brewing parameter. For example, a user may select a level of &#x201c;strength,&#x201d; to adjust the target TDS in the brewed liquid. In another example, the control panel <b>106</b> may display a chart such at the Control Chart <b>60</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and allow the user to select a two-dimensional location on the Control Chart <b>60</b> for a brewed coffee beverage. The controller <b>210</b> will then take the user input, and adjust the brewing parameters to achieve the target quality. Because the sensor array <b>200</b> is disposed inline with the brewed liquid, the brewing system <b>100</b> may also be configured to report or display to the user (e.g., on the control panel <b>106</b>) the measured results, for example displaying measured TDS and/or temperature, or displaying the location on the Control Chart <b>60</b> based on the sensor array output and the brewing parameters.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The disclosed apparatus and method is new and unique in that it describes, for a beverage dispensing system, a method and apparatus to sense and measure the continually varying time-based signature of physical characteristics in the brewed liquid stream. The resulting signature provides: a) a means for predicting the end-item in-the-cup beverage quality; b) a means for monitoring in-process beverage production and means of adjustment, or correction of beverage quality; c) a means for monitoring system <b>100</b> performance and maintenance needs; d) a means for protecting brand integrity, such as with a coffee roaster or gourmet tea producer; and e) a means for providing system <b>100</b> calibration, either manually, or automatically.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">It is contemplated that one or more visible and non-visible light wavelength sensors, along with temperature sensors in several locations may be used to provide both means for monitoring beverage properties, e.g., temperature. In particular, one or more near-infrared sensors have been found useful. Other suitable sensors contemplated include acoustic sensors.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Multiple sensors of the same type, for example, two near-infrared sensors, can be employed in the array to provide redundancy and improved signal-to-noise characteristics. Additionally, if multiple visible light sensors are employed, they may, or may not, be of the same wavelength, if it is desired to observe different brew-stream characteristics. In its current embodiment, temperature sensors are also placed to monitor the equipment temperatures, such as the brew chamber <b>132</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">For example, the present method may include the following steps:</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">1) The brewed liquid stream is configured to pass through, or by, the sensor array <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">2) The system electronics capture the output of the sensor array <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">3) The time-based signature is then analyzed and/or correlated, via signature comparison, numerical algorithm, look-up table, or the like, to known, or desired, beverage quality standards (such as a refractometer or total dissolved solids) for the end-batch.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Additional features and advantages of particular embodiments of the present invention include:</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">a. Prediction of in-the-cup beverage quality to the consumer. The brewing system <b>100</b> provides a means for verifying that a consistent &#x201c;Gold Cup&#x201d; standard beverage or the like has been produced, and may be configured to transmit results from the sensor array <b>200</b> to alert others if maintenance is required, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">b. Enables in-process monitoring and means of adjustment to maintain in-cup-beverage quality.
