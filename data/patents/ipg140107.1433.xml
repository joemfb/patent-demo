<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A reclosable bag includes first and second side edges and a double zipper, which includes first zipper with first side seal adjacent the first side edge and second side seal adjacent the second side edge. The double zipper includes second zipper having third side seal adjacent the first side edge, and fourth side seal adjacent to the second side edge. One of the first side seal and third side seal has an end that is spaced closer to the second side edge than the other. A method for providing a sensory indication of double sealing in a reclosable bag includes closing a mouth by pressing opposing fingers against first and second zipper closures and moving opposing fingers linearly across the closures until there is a sensory indication of an end seal for each of the first and second zipper closures at different linear locations.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure concerns reclosable zipper arrangements for plastic bags. In one preferred implementation, this disclosure concerns a double zipper having a double audible feature.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Thermoplastic bags for the storage of items typically include closure arrangements comprising interlocking closure elements or profiles attached to an inner surface of a bag wall.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Various zipper closures have been developed. One example is a double zipper, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,137,736, incorporated herein by reference. In U.S. Pat. No. 7,137,736, first and second closure mechanisms are disposed on the internal sides of first and second bag walls. The closure mechanisms are parallel and spaced between about 0.1 inch and 0.3 inch apart.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Improvements in zipper closure arrangements are desirable.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A reclosable bag is provided including a bag surrounding wall defining an enclosure. The bag surrounding wall includes a closed bottom, an open mouth opposite of the closed bottom, a first side edge extending from the mouth to the bottom, and a second side edge opposite of the first side edge extending from the mouth to the bottom. An openable and reclosable double zipper is integral with the bag surrounding wall and is adjacent to the mouth. The double zipper includes a first openable and reclosable zipper closure adjacent to the mouth. The first zipper closure has a first side seal adjacent to the first side edge and a second side seal adjacent to the second side edge. The double zipper also includes a second openable and reclosable zipper closure between the first zipper closure and the closed bottom. The second zipper closure has a third side seal adjacent to the first side edge, and a fourth side seal adjacent to the second side edge. At least one of the first side seal and third side seal has an end that is spaced closer to the second side edge than the other of the first side seal and third side seal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another aspect, a method for providing a sensory indication of double sealing in a reclosable bag includes providing a bag including a bag body with a bottom, an open mouth, and an openable and reclosable double zipper for opening and closing the mouth. The double zipper includes a first openable and reclosable zipper closure adjacent to the mouth, and a second openable and reclosable zipper closure between the first zipper closure and the bottom. The method further includes closing the open mouth by pressing opposing fingers against the first and second zipper closures and moving opposing fingers linearly across the first and second zipper closures until there is a sensory indication of an end seal for each of the first and second zipper closures at different linear locations.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In another aspect, a method of making a reclosable bag includes providing an openable and reclosable double zipper including a first openable and reclosable zipper closure and a second openable and reclosable zipper closure. The method includes securing the double zipper to opposing bag walls of a bag body so that the first zipper closure is adjacent an open mouth, and the second zipper closure is between the first zipper closure and a closed bottom. The first and second zipper closures are also secured between a first side edge and a second side edge. The method further includes providing a first side seal adjacent to the first side edge for the first zipper closure, providing a second side seal adjacent to the second side edge for the first zipper closure, providing a third side seal adjacent to the first side edge for the second zipper closure, and providing a fourth side seal adjacent to the second side edge for the second zipper closure. The method further includes making at least one of the first side seal and third side seal to have an end that is spaced closer to the second side edge than the other of the first side seal and third side seal.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A. Some Problems with Existing Arrangements</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">When closing a reclosable bag, the user wants to know that the bag is actually closed. That is, the user wants to know that the zipper has fully engaged across the open mouth of the bag. An audible click or a tactile snap aids in informing the user that the reclosable zipper is actually closed. One general way to obtain a good audible click or tactile snap is to have stiff locking members with adequate clearance of the lock tips within the design. Too much clearance, however, can result in leakers at the end.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the case of a double zipper, there are two sets of locks to produce the audible click or tactile snap when closed. The bag end seal is generally in the same position on each lock. This results in the locks closing at the same time and producing only a single click or snap. Hearing only a single click does not inform the user that both of the zippers in the double zipper have been closed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">B. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref></p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> illustrate embodiments of a zipper closure arrangement designed to address the problems of the prior art. In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the reclosable zipper arrangement is a double zipper having at least 2 locking mechanisms, but in other arrangements, could have more than 2. The double zipper is sliderless, in that it operates to open and close without the use of a zipper slider (i.e., it is &#x201c;slider free.&#x201d;)</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The zipper arrangement has a non-uniform side weld on the bags, so that one or more of the reclosable locking mechanisms has a wider side seal on one end (or both ends) than at least one of the other reclosable locking mechanisms. The audible click and/or tactile snap that results when a user closes a reclosable bag occurs at the end seal when the last fraction of an inch of the reclosable zipper is locked together creating a completely closed bag. Having a non-uniform side seal so that individual zipper locking mechanisms are completely closed at different linear points along the bag length will result in individual and distinct clicks and/or snaps at different linear points along the length of the zipper. The user will hear these distinct clicks and/or feel the tactile snap and be informed that the bag is closed tightly through this sensory indication.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one example of a packaging arrangement in the form of a resealable, flexible bag is shown at <b>10</b>. The bag <b>10</b> can be a polymeric package, such as a plastic bag having a resealable closure mechanism <b>12</b>, for example, a double zipper <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The bag <b>10</b> includes a bag surrounding wall <b>16</b> or bag body defining an enclosure <b>18</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). In the embodiment shown, the bag surrounding wall <b>16</b> includes first and second opposed walls or panel sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) typically made from a flexible, polymeric plastic film. With some manufacturing techniques, the first and second walls <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> are heat sealed together along a first side edge <b>24</b> and a second side edge <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The surrounding wall <b>16</b> includes a closed bottom <b>28</b>, which may be formed by a fold line <b>30</b> of the polymeric plastic film. In other embodiments, the bottom <b>28</b> may be formed by another heat sealed edge, sealing the first and second panel sections <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> together. In the embodiment shown, the fold line <b>30</b> comprises the bottom edge <b>32</b> of the bag <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Access is provided to the interior <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of the bag <b>10</b> through a mouth <b>36</b> at a top edge <b>38</b> of the bag <b>10</b>. In the embodiment shown, the mouth <b>36</b> extends the width of the bag <b>10</b>. In the embodiment shown, the first side edge <b>24</b> extends from the mouth <b>36</b> to the bottom <b>28</b>, while the second side edge <b>26</b> extends from the mouth <b>36</b> to the bottom <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The resealable closure mechanism <b>12</b> is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> adjacent to the mouth <b>36</b> of the bag <b>10</b>. As mentioned above, in this embodiment, the reclosable closure mechanism <b>12</b> is embodied as double zipper <b>14</b>. The double zipper <b>14</b> is openable and reclosable and is integral with the bag surrounding wall <b>16</b>. By the term &#x201c;integral&#x201d; it is meant that the double zipper <b>14</b> can be either a separately made part that is then permanently secured to the bag surrounding wall <b>16</b>; or, the double zipper <b>14</b> can be a one piece extrusion with the bag surrounding wall <b>16</b>. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the double zipper <b>14</b> is shown as a separately made piece that is then secured to the bag surrounding wall <b>16</b> by techniques such as heat sealing or adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Use of the double zipper <b>14</b> allows for selective opening and closing or sealing of the bag <b>10</b> across the mouth <b>36</b> to secure the contents of the interior <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The double zipper <b>14</b> can be one of the variety of closure mechanisms. By the term &#x201c;zipper&#x201d; or &#x201c;zipper closure mechanism&#x201d; or &#x201c;resealable closure mechanism&#x201d;, it is meant a structure having opposite interlocking or mating profiled elements that under the application of pressure will interlock and close the region between the profiles. Examples of zipper type closure mechanisms are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,450,686; 4,240,241; 4,246,288; or 4,437,293, each of which is incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">One example embodiment of double zipper <b>14</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. By the term &#x201c;double zipper&#x201d;, it is meant at least 2 zippers that are spaced close enough together that the zipping operation to open or close the zippers may be accomplished with a single passage of the fingers across the double zipper <b>14</b>. That is, opposing fingers may be pressed against opposing sides of the double zipper <b>14</b> and slid across the double zipper <b>14</b> from one of the side edges <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to the other of the side edges <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, and this action will close the zippers. The double zipper <b>14</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> includes elongated first closure profile <b>46</b> and an elongated second closure profile <b>48</b>. Typically, the closure profiles <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> are manufactured separately from each other. This manufacturing may be done by extrusion, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Still in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first closure profile <b>46</b> illustrated includes a sealing flange or bonding strip <b>50</b>, a base strip <b>52</b>, a first zipper profile member <b>54</b>, a second zipper profile member <b>56</b>, and an upper flange <b>58</b>. This embodiment includes optional gripper ridges <b>60</b> extending from the upper flange <b>58</b>. A plurality of optional gripper ridges <b>60</b> are shown extending therefrom, but none or only a single gripper ridge <b>60</b> can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The first zipper profile member <b>54</b> extends from the base strip <b>52</b> by way of a stem <b>62</b>. At a free end of the stem <b>62</b>, that is, at the tip of the first closure member <b>54</b>, is a head <b>64</b>. The head <b>64</b> is wider than the stem <b>62</b>, such that it forms first and second shoulders <b>66</b>, <b>67</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In this embodiment, the second zipper profile member <b>56</b> includes a pair of legs <b>68</b>, <b>69</b> extending from the base strip <b>52</b>. At the ends of each leg <b>68</b>, <b>69</b> is an inwardly protruding foot <b>70</b>, <b>71</b>. In this embodiment, each foot <b>70</b>, <b>71</b> is angled generally inwardly in a direction toward the base strip <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Turning now to the second closure profile <b>48</b>, it includes a sealing flange <b>74</b>, a base strip <b>76</b>, a first zipper profile member <b>78</b>, a second zipper profile member <b>80</b>, and an upper flange <b>82</b>. In this embodiment, the upper flange <b>82</b> includes an optional plurality of gripper ridges <b>84</b>, which are aligned relative to the gripper ridges <b>60</b> on the upper flange <b>58</b> so that they nest with each other. As can also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, in this embodiment, the upper flange <b>82</b> has a free end <b>86</b> that extends longer and beyond a free end <b>59</b> of the upper flange <b>58</b>. These features of the gripper ridges <b>60</b>, <b>84</b> and the free end <b>86</b> extending farther than the free end <b>59</b> help to provide a reclosable closure mechanism <b>12</b> that is easier to grasp and manipulate.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Still in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the first zipper profile member <b>78</b> includes a pair of legs <b>88</b>, <b>89</b> extending from the base strip <b>76</b>. Each of the legs <b>88</b>, <b>89</b> has a foot <b>90</b>, <b>91</b>. In this embodiment, each foot <b>90</b>, <b>91</b> is shown extending from its respective leg <b>88</b>, <b>89</b> and angled generally in a direction toward the base strip <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">A first zipper closure <b>94</b> comprises one of the zippers of the double zipper <b>14</b>, and the first zipper closure <b>94</b> is formed by releasable interlocking of the first zipper profile member <b>78</b> and the first zipper profile member <b>54</b>. In particular, the head <b>64</b> of the first zipper profile member <b>54</b> is releasably snapped in place between the legs <b>88</b>, <b>89</b>. Each foot <b>90</b>, <b>91</b> is engaged against the first and second shoulder <b>66</b>, <b>67</b>. This forms a selectively resealable and openable closure.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The second zipper profile member <b>80</b>, in this embodiment, is shown as a stem <b>96</b> extending from the base strip <b>76</b>. At the end of the stem <b>96</b> is a head <b>98</b>. The head <b>98</b> is wider than the stem <b>96</b>, and forms first and second shoulders <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>. The combination of the second zipper profile member <b>80</b> and the second zipper profile member <b>56</b> forms a second zipper closure <b>104</b>. In particular, the head <b>98</b> snaps between the legs <b>68</b>, <b>69</b>, and each foot <b>70</b>, <b>71</b> engages against the shoulders <b>100</b>, <b>101</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In an optional embodiment, the double zipper <b>14</b> may have certain portions of the zipper profile members <b>54</b>, <b>56</b>, <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> colored in order to create a special visual effect. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, it can be seen that the legs <b>88</b>, <b>89</b> of the first zipper profile member <b>78</b>, as well as the legs <b>68</b>, <b>69</b> of the second zipper profile member <b>56</b> are shaded to indicate color. This may assist the user in learning that the double zipper <b>14</b> is closed.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The double zipper <b>14</b> includes the first zipper closure <b>94</b> and the second zipper closure <b>104</b>. In this embodiment, the first zipper closure <b>94</b> is adjacent to the top edge <b>38</b> and the mouth <b>36</b>. The second zipper closure <b>104</b> is located between the first zipper closure <b>94</b> and the bottom <b>28</b>. The geometry of the first and second zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b> may be changed, depending upon the application.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In this embodiment, the first and second zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b> are spaced sufficiently close such that a single operation of pressing the fingers across the bag <b>10</b> will close both zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b>. The zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b>, however, are not spaced so close together that the user cannot tell that there are 2 closures. In preferred embodiments, the first zipper closure <b>94</b> and the second zipper closure <b>104</b> are spaced about 0.134+/&#x2212;0.10 inches apart from each other, as measured on center of each zipper closure <b>94</b>, <b>104</b>. That is, when the first zipper closure <b>94</b> is measured from the center of the stem <b>64</b> to the second zipper closure <b>104</b> at the center of the stem <b>96</b>, this distance will be about at least 0.124 inch and no greater than 0.144 inch apart from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Each sealing flange <b>50</b>, <b>74</b> is attached to a respective opposing bag wall <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> at attachment locations <b>51</b>, <b>75</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) through appropriate techniques. Such techniques can include heat sealing or adhesive. As mentioned above, it is also possible to extrude the first closure profile <b>46</b> and second closure profile <b>48</b> with the same material as the bag wall <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first and second closure profiles <b>46</b>, <b>48</b> are designed to engage with one another to form the double zipper <b>14</b>, including the first zipper closure <b>94</b> and second zipper closure <b>104</b>. The first and second zipper profile members <b>54</b>, <b>56</b> extend from the base strip <b>52</b> a first distance. The first and second zipper profile members <b>78</b>, <b>80</b> extend from the base strip <b>76</b> a first distance. These first distances are sufficient to allow mechanical engagement or interlocking, between the profile member <b>54</b> and profile member <b>78</b>, as well as the profile member <b>56</b> with the profile member <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The first and second zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b> are sealed along the first and second side edges <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> in a way that ensures there will be no leakage at this point. Such sealing may include ultrasonic crushing, as one example. Other techniques may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Turning again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first zipper closure <b>94</b> has a first side seal <b>110</b> adjacent to the first side edge <b>24</b>. The first zipper closure <b>94</b> has a second side seal <b>111</b> adjacent to the second side edge <b>26</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it can be seen how the first side seal <b>110</b> defines an end <b>112</b> that is at or adjacent to the first side edge <b>24</b>. The first side seal <b>110</b> also includes a remote end <b>113</b> that is spaced closer to the second side edge <b>26</b> than the end <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The second side seal <b>111</b> includes an end <b>116</b> that is at or adjacent to the second side edge <b>26</b>. The second side seal <b>111</b> also includes a remote end <b>117</b> that is spaced closer to the first side edge <b>24</b> than the end <b>116</b>. As such, the first side seal <b>110</b> is defined between end <b>112</b> and remote end <b>113</b>, while second side seal <b>111</b> is defined between end <b>116</b> and remote end <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The second zipper closure <b>104</b> has a third side seal <b>120</b> adjacent to the first side edge <b>24</b>. The second zipper closure <b>104</b> has a fourth side seal <b>121</b> adjacent to the second side edge <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The third side seal <b>120</b> has an end <b>122</b> at or adjacent to the first side edge <b>24</b>. The third side seal <b>120</b> also includes a remote end <b>123</b> that is spaced closer to the second side edge <b>26</b> than the end <b>122</b>. As such, the third side seal <b>120</b> is defined between the end <b>122</b> and the remote end <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The fourth side seal <b>121</b> includes an end <b>126</b> at or adjacent to the second side edge <b>26</b>. The fourth side seal <b>121</b> also includes a remote end <b>127</b> that is spaced closer to the first side edge <b>24</b> than the end <b>126</b>. As such, the fourth side seal <b>121</b> is defined between end <b>126</b> and remote end <b>127</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, at least one of the first side seal <b>110</b> and third side seal <b>120</b> has its remote end <b>113</b>, <b>123</b> that is spaced closer to the second side edge <b>26</b> than the other of the remote end <b>113</b> of the first side seal <b>110</b> and remote end <b>123</b> of the third side seal <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the remote end <b>123</b> of the third side seal <b>120</b> is spaced closer to the second side edge <b>26</b> than the remote end <b>113</b> of the first side seal <b>110</b> is spaced to the second side edge <b>26</b>. In other words, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the remote end <b>123</b> extends inwardly along the double zipper <b>14</b> farther than the remote end <b>113</b> of the first side seal <b>110</b>. In practice, what this means is that the second zipper closure <b>104</b> will complete its closing operation before the first zipper closure <b>94</b> completes its closing operation, since the second zipper closure <b>104</b> ends at remote end <b>123</b> before the first zipper closure <b>94</b> ends at remote end <b>113</b>. That is, the end <b>113</b> of the first zipper closure <b>94</b> is along a different linear location than the end <b>123</b> of the second zipper closure <b>104</b>. By stating that the ends <b>113</b>, <b>123</b> are along &#x201c;different linear locations&#x201d; it is meant that as an imaginary line perpendicular to both the first zipper closure <b>94</b> and second zipper closure <b>104</b> moves from one side edge <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to the other side edge <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>, the imaginary line will cross one of the ends <b>113</b>, <b>123</b> before the other of the ends <b>113</b>, <b>123</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this embodiment, the second zipper closure <b>104</b> is also shorter than the first zipper closure <b>94</b>. When the second zipper closure <b>104</b> completes its closing operation, it will result in sensory feedback, for example, an audible sound, such as a click. It may also result in tactile feedback, such as a feeling a snap or a give in material as the opposing closures mate or interlock. The click will have a sound level of at least 50 decibels, for example, about 60-70 decibels. Similarly, the first zipper closure <b>94</b>, when it completes its closing operation, there will be an audible click of at least 50 decibels, preferably about 60-70 decibels. The user will hear or feel first and second separate and successive, and distinct audible clicks or snaps at different linear points along the double zipper <b>14</b>, and know that the double zipper <b>114</b> is closed because the user heard both the second zipper closure <b>104</b> and the first zipper closure <b>94</b> click closed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Still in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, in this embodiment, at least one of the second side seal <b>111</b> and fourth side seal <b>121</b> has its remote end <b>117</b>, <b>127</b> spaced closer to the first side edge <b>24</b> than the other of the remote ends <b>117</b>, <b>127</b> of the second side seal <b>111</b> and fourth side seal <b>121</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, it can be seen that the remote end <b>127</b> is spaced inwardly along the double zipper <b>114</b> further in than the remote end <b>117</b> of the second side seal <b>111</b>. As explained above, this difference in lateral spacing of the remote end <b>127</b> versus the remote end <b>117</b> results in sensory feedback, such as an audible click and/or a tactile snap for the second zipper closure <b>104</b> before the first zipper closure <b>94</b> adjacent to the second side edge <b>26</b>, when closing the double zipper <b>114</b> from a direction of the first side edge <b>24</b> to the second side edge <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the third side seal end <b>123</b> is spaced closer to the second side edge <b>26</b> than the first side seal end <b>113</b>. Further, in the preferred embodiment, the fourth side seal end <b>127</b> is spaced closer to the first side edge <b>24</b> than the second side seal end <b>117</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an alternative embodiment of bag <b>10</b>&#x2032; with double zipper <b>14</b>&#x2032;, in which the first side seal end <b>113</b> is spaced closer to the second side edge <b>26</b> than the third side seal end <b>123</b>. In addition, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the second side seal end <b>117</b> is spaced closer to the first side edge <b>24</b> than the fourth side seal end <b>127</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the first zipper closure <b>94</b> is shorter than the second zipper closure <b>104</b>. As a user closes the double zipper <b>14</b>&#x2032; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the user will hear the audible click (and/or feel the tactile snap) of the first zipper closure <b>94</b> before the click/snap of the second zipper closure <b>104</b>.

<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 4</figref>, each of the ends <b>112</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>126</b> are shown at and even with or approximately even with its respective side edge <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>. In other embodiments, however, any one of these ends <b>112</b>, <b>116</b>, <b>122</b>, and <b>126</b> can be spaced apart from the respective side edge <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For example, in the embodiment of bag <b>10</b>&#x2033; having double zipper <b>14</b>&#x2033; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, at least one of the third side seal <b>120</b> and first side seal <b>110</b> is spaced away from the first side edge <b>24</b>. At least one of the fourth side seal <b>121</b> and second side seal <b>111</b> is spaced away from the second side edge <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the third side seal <b>120</b> having end <b>122</b> is spaced apart or away from the first side edge <b>24</b>, while the fourth side seal <b>121</b> with end <b>126</b> is spaced away from the second side edge <b>26</b>. It should be noted that the region <b>133</b> of the second zipper closure <b>104</b> between the end <b>122</b> and the first side edge <b>24</b> is sealed closed, and cannot open.

<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Each of the first side seal <b>110</b>, second side seal <b>111</b>, third side seal <b>120</b>, and fourth side seal <b>121</b> defines a length between its respective end and remote end that is at least 1/16 inches, no greater than &#x215c; inches, and typically &#x215b;-&#xbc; inches.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">C. Methods</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A method of making the reclosable bag <b>10</b> includes providing an openable and reclosable double zipper, such as double zipper <b>14</b>. The double zipper <b>14</b> includes first zipper closure <b>94</b> and second zipper closure <b>104</b>. The double zipper <b>14</b> is secured to the opposing walls <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> of the bag body <b>16</b>, such as the surrounding wall <b>16</b>, so that the first zipper closure <b>94</b> is adjacent to the open mouth <b>36</b>, and the second zipper closure <b>104</b> is between the first zipper closure <b>94</b> and the closed bottom <b>28</b>. Further, the first and second zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b> are between the first side edge <b>24</b> and second side edge <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Next, the first side seal <b>110</b> is provided adjacent to the first side edge <b>24</b> for the first zipper closure <b>94</b>. The second side seal <b>111</b> is provided adjacent to the second side edge <b>26</b> for the first zipper closure <b>94</b>. The third side seal <b>120</b> is provided adjacent to the first side edge <b>24</b> for the second zipper closure <b>104</b>. The fourth side seal <b>121</b> is provided adjacent to the second side edge <b>26</b> for the second zipper closure <b>104</b>. These side seals <b>110</b>, <b>111</b>, <b>120</b>, <b>121</b> may be created by ultrasonics, such as ultrasonic crushing, to ensure that the first closure <b>94</b> and second closure <b>104</b> do not leak at edges <b>24</b>, <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">There is a step of making at least one of the first side seal <b>110</b> and third side seal <b>120</b> to have an end <b>113</b>, <b>123</b> that is spaced closer to the second side edge <b>26</b> than the other end <b>113</b>, <b>123</b> of the first side seal <b>110</b> and third side seal <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Preferably, the method includes making at least one of the second side seal <b>111</b> and fourth side seal <b>121</b> to have an end <b>117</b>, <b>127</b> that is spaced closer to the first side edge <b>24</b> than the other remote end <b>117</b>, <b>127</b> of the second side seal <b>111</b> and fourth side seal <b>121</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The step of providing the double zipper <b>14</b> includes providing the first and second zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b> to be spaced no more than 0.144 inches apart from each other. Preferably, securing the double zipper <b>14</b> to the opposing walls <b>20</b>, <b>22</b> includes heat sealing the double zipper <b>14</b> to the opposing walls <b>20</b>, <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">A method for providing a sensory indication of double sealing in the reclosable bag <b>10</b> includes providing the bag <b>10</b> with bag body having surrounding wall <b>16</b>, bottom <b>28</b>, open mouth <b>26</b>, and openable and reclosable double zipper <b>14</b> for opening and closing the mouth <b>26</b>. The double zipper <b>14</b> includes the first openable and reclosable zipper closure <b>94</b> adjacent to the mouth <b>36</b>, and the second openable and reclosable zipper closure <b>104</b> between the first zipper closure <b>94</b> and the bottom <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Next, there is a step of closing the open mouth <b>36</b> by pressing opposing fingers against the first and second zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b> and moving opposing fingers linearly across the first and second zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b> from one side edge <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> to the other side edge <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> until there is a sensory indication of an end seal for each of the first and second zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b> at different linear locations.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, the method of closing the mouth can include simultaneously pressing the first and second zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b> between opposing fingers and sliding the fingers across the first and second zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b> from either the first side edge <b>24</b> to the second side edge <b>26</b> (or from the second side edge <b>26</b> to the first side edge <b>24</b>) until hearing the first and second separate, distinct, and successive audible clicks, at different linear locations along the double zipper <b>14</b>, with each click having at least 50 decibels. Or, as another example, the sensory indication can be receiving tactile feedback, such as feeling a snap, or release of tension, or give in material, as the opposing zipper closures mate.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In particular, for example, the step of closing the mouth and sliding the fingers across the first and second zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b> includes closing the first and second zipper closures <b>94</b>, <b>104</b> by mating the first zipper profile member <b>54</b> with the first zipper profile member <b>78</b>, and mating the second zipper profile member <b>56</b> with the second zipper profile member <b>80</b>. Eventually, one of the first zipper closures <b>94</b> and second zipper closures <b>104</b> will complete its mating or interlocking before the other. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 3</figref>, the second zipper closure <b>104</b> will complete its interlocking, mating, or closing before the first zipper closure <b>94</b>. When this happens, there will be the first audible click and/or tactile snap produced as the second zipper closure <b>104</b> terminates at either remote end <b>123</b> or remote end <b>127</b>. After this first audible click and/or tactile snap, the first zipper closure <b>94</b> will complete its mating, interlocking, or closure as it encounters either remote end <b>113</b> or remote end <b>117</b>, to result in the second audible click.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">To open the double zipper <b>114</b>, the upper flange is <b>58</b>, <b>82</b> are grasped, and pulled apart from each other. As they are pulled apart, the first zipper profile member <b>54</b> is pulled from interlocking or mating with the first zipper profile member <b>78</b>, and the second zipper profile member <b>56</b> is pulled apart from interlocking or mating with the second zipper profile member <b>80</b>. This opens the mouth <b>36</b> and provides access to the interior <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The above represents example principles of the disclosure. Many embodiments can be made.</p>
