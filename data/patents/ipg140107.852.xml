<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation-in-part of U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/686,198, filed Jan. 12, 2010 and incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to internal combustion engines and, more particularly, to supplying supplementary fuel to an engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Many small internal combustion engines are supplied with a combustible charge of air and fuel using a carburetor. A typical carburetor includes a body at least partially defining a liquid fuel chamber, an air and fuel mixing passage, and one or more fuel passages in communication between the fuel chamber and the air and fuel mixing passage. The fuel passages communicate with the mixing passage between an air inlet at an upstream end and an air-and-fuel mixture outlet at a downstream end. Typically, a choke valve is disposed in the air and fuel mixing passage near the upstream end to control a quantity of air flowing into the mixing passage during engine cold starting and warm up. A throttle valve is disposed in the air-and-fuel mixing passage near the downstream end to control a quantity or flow rate of the air-and-fuel mixture flowing out of the mixing passage to the operating engine.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A method according to one implementation includes controlling supply of supplementary fuel through a supplementary fuel supply passage in a carburetor for an engine. An electromechanical valve is provided in fluid communication with the supplementary fuel supply passage. The electromechanical valve is powered as engine intake vacuum peaks.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to another implementation, a system supplies supplementary fuel through a carburetor to an engine, and includes a supplementary fuel supply passage between a carburetor fuel chamber and a carburetor air-and-fuel mixing passage, and an electromechanical valve normally closing the passage. The system also includes a magneto device including a flywheel with a magnet group and a lamstack having a first leg carrying a coil, wherein the flywheel magnet group and the lamstack first leg are configured such that the electromechanical valve is powered to open the passage by current created by the magnet group rotating past the lamstack first leg as engine intake vacuum peaks.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a further implementation, a combustion engine includes an engine block defining a cylinder, and intake and exhaust passages in fluid communication with the cylinder, a crankshaft rotatably carried by the engine block, and a piston disposed in the cylinder and coupled to the crankshaft for translation within the cylinder to open and close the intake and exhaust passages. The engine also includes a carburetor including a fuel chamber, an air-and-fuel mixing passage in fluid communication with the intake passage, a primary fuel supply passage between the fuel chamber and the air-and-fuel mixing passage, a supplementary fuel supply passage between the fuel chamber and the air-and-fuel mixing passage, and an electromechanical valve normally closing the supplementary fuel supply passage. The engine further includes a magneto device including a flywheel coupled to the crankshaft, a magnet group carried by the flywheel, a lamstack including a first leg carrying a coil to power the electromechanical valve with current to open the supplementary fuel supply passage by the magnet group rotating past the lamstack first leg as vacuum peaks through the intake passage of the engine block.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">According to yet another implementation, a carburetor includes a body defining an air and fuel mixing passage and carrying a throttle valve disposed in the mixing passage, the body also defining a main fuel supply passage in fluid communication with the mixing passage at a location upstream of the throttle valve and a supplementary fuel supply passage in fluid communication with the mixing passage at a location downstream of the throttle valve. The carburetor also includes a fuel metering assembly carried by the body and including a cover coupled to the body and a diaphragm disposed between the cover and the body and partially defining a fuel metering chamber, wherein the cover includes a first passage in fluid communication with the fuel metering chamber, a second passage in fluid communication with the supplementary fuel supply passage, and a valve seat therebetween. The carburetor further includes an electromechanical valve carried by the cover and including a valve in a normally closed position against the valve seat of the cover of the fuel metering assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to an additional implementation, a cover for a metering chamber of a carburetor having an air-and-fuel mixing passage includes a generally planar portion arranged to be coupled to a body of the carburetor, and a flange extending generally transversely from the generally planar portion and including at least a portion of a supplementary fuel supply passage.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to still another implementation, there is provided a method of controlling supply of supplementary fuel through a supplementary fuel supply passage in a carburetor for an engine. The method includes supplying supplementary fuel during engine cranking, and further supplying supplementary fuel after engine cranking and during engine warmup until engine temperature meets engine temperature criteria and engine speed meets engine speed criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">According to a further implementation, there is provided a system to supply supplementary fuel through a carburetor to an engine. The system includes a supplementary fuel supply passage between a carburetor fuel chamber and a carburetor air-and-fuel mixing passage. The system also includes an electromechanical valve normally closing the passage and powerable to open the passage by current created in a valve power coil by a magnet group rotating past a lamstack leg around which the valve power coil is wound. The system further includes a power and control module including a thermal switch to cut off supply of current to the electromechanical valve when engine temperature exceeds a high temperature value.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Referring in more detail to the drawings, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> illustrate a carburetor <b>20</b> that may be used to provide a combustible charge of an air and fuel mixture to an engine (not shown). For example, the engine may be any suitable two-stroke engine, which may include a single cylinder engine with up to about 75 cc displacement for hand-held equipment such as hedge trimmers, grass trimmers, and chainsaws. Of course, other engine sizes may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">But whatever the application, the carburetor <b>20</b> generally may include a main body <b>22</b>, a fuel pump assembly <b>24</b> for pumping liquid fuel, and a fuel metering assembly <b>26</b> for at least partially controlling the flow rate of liquid fuel in the main body <b>22</b>. The carburetor <b>20</b> may be similar in many respects to that described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,293,524, which is assigned to the assignee hereof and is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The main body <b>22</b> may be composed of any suitable material, for example, of cast aluminum or the like. The main body <b>22</b> provides structural support for the aforementioned assemblies <b>24</b>, <b>26</b> and various other components and passages as will be described in further detail herein below. Externally, the main body <b>22</b> may carry a fuel inlet fitting <b>30</b> for connection to a fuel tank (not shown), and may also carry a fuel outlet fitting (not shown) for discharging purged fuel and any fuel vapor and air and returning them to the tank.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Internally, and referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the main body <b>22</b> has an air and fuel mixing passage <b>34</b> with an air inlet <b>36</b> that may be in communication with an atmospheric air source such as an air filter (not shown) and an air and fuel mixture outlet <b>38</b> that may be in communication with an intake passage or manifold of the engine (not shown). The air and fuel mixing passage <b>34</b> may include a venturi <b>40</b> downstream of the inlet <b>36</b> and upstream of the outlet <b>38</b>. A throttle valve <b>42</b> is received in the mixing passage downstream of the venturi <b>40</b> and may be mounted on a throttle shaft <b>44</b> extending transversely through the passage <b>44</b> and journalled for rotation in the main body <b>22</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the fuel pump assembly <b>24</b> may have a flexible membrane or diaphragm <b>46</b> received and sealed between an upper face of the main body <b>22</b> and a lower face of an upper cover <b>48</b>. The diaphragm <b>46</b> defines part of a pump chamber <b>50</b>, and part of a pulse chamber <b>52</b> to which pressure and vacuum pulses in a crankcase of the operating engine (not shown) are introduced through a pulse passage <b>54</b> (shown fragmented) to flex or actuate the diaphragm <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The pump assembly <b>24</b> may use vacuum and pressure pulses from an engine crankcase to move the diaphragm <b>46</b> back and forth. Flexing of the diaphragm <b>46</b> toward the pulse chamber <b>52</b> expands the volume of the pump chamber <b>50</b> to create a vacuum therein to draw liquid fuel from a fuel tank (not shown) through the fitting <b>30</b>, a fuel inlet passage <b>56</b> including a one-way check valve <b>58</b> therein, and into the pump chamber <b>50</b>. In contrast, flexing of the diaphragm <b>46</b> toward the pump chamber <b>50</b> compresses the volume of the chamber <b>50</b> to pressurize the liquid fuel for delivery from the pump chamber <b>50</b> through a fuel outlet passage <b>60</b> including a one-way check valve <b>62</b> and a screen <b>64</b> therein, to the fuel metering assembly <b>26</b>. The check valves <b>58</b>, <b>62</b> may be integral portions of the diaphragm <b>46</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, at the bottom of the carburetor <b>20</b>, the fuel metering assembly <b>26</b> has a flexible membrane or metering diaphragm <b>68</b> received and sealed between a lower face of the main body <b>22</b> and a cover <b>70</b>. The metering diaphragm <b>68</b> defines part of a fuel metering chamber <b>72</b> on one side of the metering diaphragm <b>68</b> and an atmospheric air chamber <b>74</b> on its other side. The air chamber <b>74</b> communicates with the atmosphere outside of the carburetor <b>20</b> through a passage <b>76</b> in the cover <b>70</b>. A metering valve <b>66</b> is opened and closed to control the admission of fuel to the fuel metering chamber <b>72</b> by movement of the metering diaphragm <b>68</b>. The metering diaphragm <b>68</b> is operably connected to the metering valve <b>66</b> by a lever <b>78</b>. The lever <b>78</b> is coupled at one end to the metering valve <b>66</b> and at another end cooperatively coupled to a projection <b>80</b> attached to the center of the metering diaphragm <b>68</b> and between its ends the lever <b>78</b> is pivotally mounted on a support shaft <b>82</b>. The metering valve <b>66</b> is yieldably biased to its closed position by a spring <b>84</b> bearing on the lever <b>78</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The force of the metering spring <b>84</b> against the metering lever <b>78</b> holds the metering valve <b>66</b> against its seat and prevents fuel from entering the metering chamber <b>72</b>. The metering diaphragm <b>68</b> may be composed of a flexible convoluted material to allow for sufficient movement. As the engine runs, fuel is drawn from the metering chamber <b>72</b> into the carburetor mixing passage <b>34</b>. This causes the metering diaphragm <b>68</b> to advance and contact the metering lever <b>78</b>. The pressure of the metering diaphragm <b>68</b> against the lever <b>78</b> overrides the force imposed by the spring <b>84</b> on the metering valve <b>66</b>. The fuel pressure from the pump chamber <b>50</b> is then great enough to overcome the spring pressure on the metering valve <b>66</b> and fuel flows into the metering chamber <b>72</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the metering assembly <b>26</b> also includes a supplementary fuel supply assembly, which includes the cover <b>70</b> and an electromechanical valve <b>86</b> coupled in fluid communication to the cover <b>70</b>. The cover <b>70</b> may be constructed in any suitable manner and composed of any suitable material. For example, the cover <b>70</b> may be cast from aluminum. The cover <b>70</b> includes a generally planar portion <b>88</b> coupled in any suitable manner to the carburetor body <b>22</b>, and a flange <b>90</b> extending generally transversely from the generally planar portion <b>88</b>. The flange <b>90</b> includes a supplementary fuel supply passage <b>92</b>, which may include a first portion <b>94</b> in fluid communication with a valve inlet passage <b>96</b> that extends through a portion of the flange <b>90</b> and is in fluid communication with the metering chamber <b>72</b>. The supplementary fuel supply passage <b>92</b> may also include a second portion <b>98</b> in fluid communication with a valve outlet passage <b>100</b> that extends through a portion of the flange <b>90</b> and is in fluid communication with the air and fuel mixing passage <b>34</b> of the carburetor <b>20</b>. A valve seat <b>102</b> may be located between the first and second portions <b>94</b>, <b>98</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The electromechanical valve <b>86</b> includes a housing <b>104</b> that may be coupled to the flange portion <b>90</b> of the cover <b>70</b> in any suitable manner, a coil <b>106</b> disposed in the housing <b>104</b>, and a valve member <b>108</b> operatively coupled to the coil <b>106</b> and slidingly disposed in the passage <b>92</b> of the cover <b>70</b> to a normally closed position wherein a forward portion of the valve member <b>108</b> seats against the valve seat <b>102</b>. A spring <b>108</b> may be disposed, for example, between a rearward end of the valve member <b>108</b> and a corresponding portion of the housing <b>104</b> to bias the valve member <b>108</b> toward the seat <b>102</b>. The valve <b>86</b> is operable to open and close fluid communication between the inlet and outlet passages <b>96</b>, <b>100</b> of the cover <b>70</b> to initiate supply and terminate supply of supplementary fuel through the supplementary fuel supply passage <b>92</b> in the carburetor main body. The valve <b>86</b> may be a carburetor solenoid, which is generally known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and the description and drawings of the solenoid described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,264,230 is hereby incorporated by reference herein. In other embodiments, the valve <b>86</b> may be any suitable device to allow, block, or otherwise control flow of fluid. For example, the valve <b>86</b> may include solenoid devices, servo devices, piezoelectric devices, or any other device suitable for use in a carburetor.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In addition to the supplementary fuel supply apparatus and path, those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that a low speed fuel supply apparatus and path may also be used. For example, one or more low speed fuel passages <b>112</b> may open into the mixing passage <b>34</b> upstream and/or downstream of the throttle valve <b>44</b>, for example when the valve <b>44</b> is in its idle or closed positions. The low speed fuel may be supplied from the metering chamber <b>72</b> via a branch passage <b>114</b> in communication with the port(s) <b>112</b>, via an adjustable low speed fuel regulating needle valve <b>116</b> and a check valve <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Moreover, when the supplementary fuel supply apparatus is not used to supply fuel, such as when the throttle valve <b>44</b> is opened, liquid fuel may be supplied from the fuel metering chamber <b>72</b> through a primary fuel supply apparatus and path. The primary fuel supply apparatus may include a high speed fuel nozzle <b>120</b> carried by the body <b>26</b> and opening into the mixing passage <b>34</b>, a check valve <b>122</b> carried by the nozzle <b>120</b>, and a branch passage <b>124</b> via an adjustable fuel regulating needle valve <b>126</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, an engine <b>200</b> includes a cylinder block <b>202</b> defining a cylinder <b>204</b>, and an intake port or passage <b>206</b> and an exhaust port or passage <b>208</b> in fluid communication with the cylinder <b>204</b>. The engine <b>200</b> also includes a spark plug <b>210</b> coupled through a cylinder head <b>212</b> and being disposed partly within the cylinder <b>204</b>. The engine <b>200</b> further includes a piston <b>214</b> disposed in the cylinder <b>204</b> and coupled to a crankshaft <b>216</b> for translation in the cylinder <b>204</b> to open and close the intake and exhaust passages <b>206</b>, <b>208</b>. The crankshaft <b>216</b> may be rotatably carried by the engine block <b>202</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The engine <b>200</b> additionally may include a power and control module (PCM) <b>218</b>. The PCM <b>218</b> may be a multi-functional device, for example, to power the electromechanical valve <b>86</b> of the carburetor <b>20</b>, to produce engine ignition spark to ignite the combustible charge, and/or to control at least some functionality of at least the carburetor <b>20</b>. The PCM <b>218</b> may include a magneto device that may include a flywheel <b>220</b> coupled to the crankshaft <b>216</b> and carrying a magnet group <b>222</b> and an oppositely disposed counterweight <b>224</b>. The magnet group <b>222</b> may include poles <b>221</b>, <b>223</b> and a permanent magnet M disposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The PCM <b>218</b> may further include a lamstack <b>226</b> disposed adjacent the periphery of the flywheel <b>220</b>. The lamstack <b>226</b> may be a ferromagnetic part comprised of a stack of flat, magnetically-permeable, laminate pieces typically composed of steel or iron. The lamstack <b>226</b> may have a generally E-shaped configuration that includes a base <b>228</b> and a trio of legs extending from the base <b>228</b>. The trio includes a first leg <b>230</b> carrying an auxiliary or valve power coil <b>232</b> to power the electromechanical valve <b>86</b> of the carburetor <b>20</b>, a second leg <b>234</b> carrying a charge coil <b>236</b> for charging an ignition capacitor and/or an electronic processing device if desired, and a third leg <b>238</b> carrying a transformer <b>240</b> including a pair of closely-coupled windings <b>242</b> and <b>244</b> to create high voltage ignition pulses that are sent to the spark plug <b>210</b> via an ignition lead <b>246</b> for developing spark energy to initiate combustion.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The PCM <b>218</b> may also provide an engine crankshaft angular position and/or speed signal for use by the control module using hall-effect sensors (not shown) located in the PCM <b>218</b> and triggered by the rotating flywheel magnets in proximity to the PCM <b>218</b>. In other words, crankshaft position may be observed using the hall-effect sensors or by observation of charge coil voltages induced from the rotating flywheel magnet(s) instead of or in addition to a separate crankshaft position sensor. Such signals may be used in determining engine speed and/or other engine timing.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The PCM may provide the required power for the valve <b>86</b> and any sensors, in addition to its own internal power needs. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the engine <b>200</b> is illustrated in a compression stroke wherein the piston <b>214</b> is moving toward the cylinder head <b>212</b> such that the intake passage <b>206</b> is closed and the exhaust passage <b>208</b> is partially open but being closed. Reciprocation of the piston <b>214</b> causes the crankshaft <b>216</b> to rotate and, thus, the flywheel <b>220</b> is rotating counterclockwise such that the magnet group <b>222</b> is approaching the first leg <b>230</b> of the lamstack <b>226</b>. As the flywheel <b>220</b> rotates and the magnet group <b>222</b> passes by the lamstack legs <b>230</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>238</b>, an electric current is induced in the corresponding coils <b>232</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>. More particularly, the valve power coil <b>232</b> is positioned so that the magnet group <b>222</b> is generally aligned with the corresponding lamstack leg <b>230</b> in synchronization with a maximum or peak vacuum through the intake passage <b>206</b>. Accordingly, the valve <b>86</b> can be opened in synchronism with the timing of supplying the air-and-fuel mixture into the intake passage <b>206</b> and, thus, no battery for powering the valve <b>86</b> is required. Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that engine intake vacuum is synonymous with a maximum negative pressure below atmospheric pressure in the engine intake, or a greatest sub-atmospheric pressure in the engine intake, or a minimum absolute pressure in the engine intake.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> illustrates plots of current through the electromechanical valve <b>86</b>, vacuum through the intake passage <b>206</b>, an electromechanical valve control signal, and ignition spark. The position of the piston and flywheel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> approximately corresponds to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, wherein electromechanical valve current just begins to fluctuate due to the magnetic flux induced in the coil <b>232</b> by the approaching the first pole <b>221</b> of the magnet <b>222</b> group nearing the lamstack leg <b>230</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, there is shown a schematic circuit diagram illustrating exemplary components of the PCM <b>218</b>, including the valve power coil <b>232</b>, the charge coil <b>236</b>, the transformer <b>242</b>, and a control circuit <b>250</b>. It should be understood that numerous changes, including the addition, omission and/or substitution of various electrical components, could be made to this diagram as it is merely intended to provide a general overview of one possible implementation. The control circuit <b>250</b> may be implemented on a printed circuit board (PCB) or other circuit medium known to skilled artisans, and may be potted or otherwise hermetically sealed within a housing.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The control circuit <b>250</b> may use a number of different electrical components including, in this embodiment, an ignition capacitor <b>252</b>, and a switching device <b>254</b> to discharge the ignition capacitor <b>252</b> for spark generation. The circuit <b>250</b> may also include a first thermal switch that may include a thermistor <b>256</b> and a transistor <b>258</b> to interrupt current flow to the valve <b>86</b> so as to terminate supplementary fuel supply when engine temperature exceeds a certain value, for instance, a high temperature value. Similarly, the circuit <b>250</b> may further include a second thermal switch that may include a thermistor <b>260</b> and a transistor <b>262</b> to initiate or continue current flow to the valve <b>86</b> so as to ensure supplementary fuel supply when engine temperature falls below another certain value, for instance, a low temperature value.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Accordingly, in the exemplary embodiment, supplementary or enrichment fuel supply may be varied by employing the thermal switches, which represent high and low temperature values or setpoints. Other embodiments may include employing a microprocessor, which can include an analog-to-digital converter for sensing actual temperature with a thermistor, converting a signal received from the thermistor to a temperature value, and cross-referencing the converted temperature value with electromechanical valve opening durations stored in memory. A cross-referenced valve opening duration corresponding to the actual temperature can then be used in powering the electromechanical valve. This latter embodiment permits use of more than two temperature setpoints for use in varying supplementary fuel supply, over an entire engine temperature range.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The transistors <b>258</b>, <b>260</b> may include solid state devices, for example, pairs of high voltage bipolar transistors connected in a Darlington arrangement for high current gain. The switching device <b>254</b> may be a high current solid state switching device, such as a silicon controlled rectifier (SCR) or some other type of thyristor, and may be designed to discharge the ignition capacitor <b>252</b>. In this embodiment, the switching device <b>252</b> is part of an energy discharge path that also includes the primary winding <b>244</b>, the ignition capacitor <b>252</b>, and ground.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The ignition circuit also includes an electronic processing device <b>264</b> that may execute various electronic instructions pertaining to a variety of tasks, such as ignition timing control, valve control, etc. The electronic processing device <b>264</b> may be a microcontroller, a microprocessor, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or any other suitable type of analog or digital processing device known in the art. In the illustrated embodiment, the electronic processing device <b>264</b> is a microcontroller to process and store data and/or information like electronic instructions and variables. The processing device <b>264</b> may execute instructions that provide at least some of the functionality for the apparatus described herein. As used herein, the term instructions may include, for example, control logic, computer software and/or firmware, programmable instructions, or other suitable instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Although not separately shown, any suitable memory device(s) may be coupled to the processing device <b>264</b> to provide storage for data, and/or for processor-executable instructions. The data and/or instructions may be stored, for example, as look-up tables, formulas, algorithms, maps, models, and/or any other suitable format. The memory may include, for example, RAM, ROM, EPROM, and/or any other suitable type of storage device.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The electronic processing device <b>264</b> may be powered at a power input <b>266</b> by the charge coil <b>236</b> via various electronic power conditioning components, including one or more capacitors <b>268</b> that smooth or otherwise regulate the energy induced in the charge coil <b>236</b>. According to the embodiment shown here, the electronic processing device <b>264</b> may include an ignition signal output <b>270</b> for providing a discharge control signal to the ignition switch <b>254</b>, a first thermal signal output <b>272</b> for providing a control signal to the transistor <b>258</b>, and a second thermal signal input <b>274</b> for receiving a control signal from the second thermal switch. The device <b>264</b> may also include a stop input <b>276</b> coupled to an optional stop switch (not shown), which acts as a manual override for shutting down the engine <b>200</b>. It should be appreciated that numerous circuit arrangements, including ones other than the exemplary arrangement shown here, could be used to process, condition, or otherwise improve the quality of signals used herein.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the piston <b>214</b> has moved further toward the cylinder head <b>212</b> such that the intake passage <b>206</b> is initially opened and the exhaust passage <b>208</b> is being further closed. Also, the flywheel <b>220</b> has continued to rotate counterclockwise such that the magnet group <b>222</b> overlaps the first leg <b>230</b> of the lamstack <b>226</b>. The position of the piston <b>214</b> and flywheel <b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> corresponds to approximately 59 degrees before top dead center (BTDC) of the piston <b>214</b>. Also, the position of the piston <b>214</b> and flywheel <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> approximately corresponds to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, wherein electromechanical valve current has started to reverse direction as the axis of the first pole <b>221</b> has just passed the axis of the first lamstack leg <b>230</b>, and vacuum through the intake passage <b>206</b> is initiated due to the initial opening of the intake passage <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, the piston <b>214</b> has moved even further toward the cylinder head <b>212</b> such that the exhaust passage <b>208</b> is now closed and the intake passage <b>206</b> is now opened to the point at which vacuum through the intake passage <b>206</b> is substantially at a maximum. Also, the flywheel <b>220</b> has further continued to rotate counterclockwise such that the magnet group <b>222</b> is generally aligned with the first leg <b>230</b> of the lamstack <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The valve power coil <b>232</b> and the flywheel magnet group <b>222</b> are arranged in relation to the position of the piston <b>214</b> where vacuum through the intake passage <b>206</b> peaks. For example, the electromechanical valve <b>86</b> is powered within about 80% of peak engine intake vacuum and, more particularly may be powered within about 90% of peak engine intake vacuum. In another example, the electromechanical valve <b>86</b> opens when the intake passage <b>206</b> reaches an opening amount of about 10% to 20% of full opening and, more particularly about 15% to 16% of full opening. In a further example, the position of the piston <b>214</b> and flywheel <b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> corresponds to about 40 to 60 degrees BTDC of the piston <b>214</b> and, more particularly about 51 degrees BTDC of the piston <b>214</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the position of the piston <b>214</b> and flywheel <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> approximately corresponds to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, wherein electromechanical valve current reaches a level sufficient to power the valve <b>86</b> as the magnet M approximately aligns with the axis of the first lamstack leg <b>230</b>, and vacuum through the intake passage <b>206</b> begins to peak. As also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the electromechanical valve control signal has changed state substantially in correspondence with the electromechanical valve current. About 65% to 75% of peak current produced by the valve power coil <b>232</b> for the valve <b>86</b> and, more particularly about 70% of peak current, is initially used to open the valve <b>86</b> and corresponds to about 380 mA in the exemplary embodiment disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">The degree to which the electromechanical valve <b>86</b> stays on is dependent on engine speed and may increase with cranking speed, but may stay on for a minimum of about 10 degrees of crank angle, and may be on for up to about 72 degrees of crank angle, which equates to about 40% of the 180 degrees of the compression stroke. In the exemplary engine environment disclosed herein, at about 1,500 RPM the valve power coil <b>232</b> reaches peak current output and can maintain the electromechanical valve <b>86</b> in an energized state for about 10 to 72 degrees of crank angle. The valve <b>86</b> may stay open until the current falls below, for example, about 50 mA.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, the piston <b>214</b> has moved still further toward the cylinder head <b>212</b> such that the both the intake and exhaust passages <b>206</b>, <b>208</b> are closed and the spark plug <b>210</b> fires to ignite the air-and-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber and force the piston <b>214</b> to reverse direction and move away from the cylinder head <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Timing of the firing of the spark plug <b>210</b> varies with engine RPM, is specified in terms of its relationship to piston top-dead-center (TDC), and can be delayed with respect to TDC. For example, spark plug firing may be delayed to about 6 to 24 degrees BTDC, which corresponds in the exemplary engine to about 35 to 53 degrees delay, for instance, after the intake passage opens or after vacuum through the intake passage <b>206</b> substantially reaches a maximum.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Also, the flywheel <b>220</b> has further rotated further counterclockwise such that the magnet group <b>222</b> is generally aligned with the second leg <b>234</b> of the lamstack <b>226</b>. The position of the piston <b>214</b> and flywheel <b>220</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> corresponds to approximately 8 degrees BTDC of the piston <b>214</b>. Also, the position of the piston <b>214</b> and flywheel <b>220</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> approximately corresponds to the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> line in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, wherein an ignition output current spikes when the spark plug <b>210</b> is fired.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> illustrates an exemplary method <b>1200</b> of controlling supply of supplementary fuel for an engine, as discussed in detail below. Also, portions of the method <b>1200</b> will be described in reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 11</figref>. The method steps may or may not be sequentially processed, and the invention encompasses any sequencing, overlap, or parallel processing of such steps.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At step <b>1205</b>, the method <b>1200</b> may commence in any suitable manner. For example, the engine <b>200</b> may be cranked in an attempt to startup the engine <b>200</b> so that it runs on its own. More specifically, the engine <b>200</b> may be manually cranked such as by an operator pulling on a manual recoil starter (not separately shown). During engine cranking, the flywheel <b>220</b> rotates and the magnet group <b>222</b> and the lamstack cooperate to produce electrical power.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">At step <b>1210</b>, a supplementary fuel supply passage may be opened. For example, a valve may be powered. More specifically, electrical power may be communicated to the electromechanical valve <b>86</b> to unseat the valve member <b>108</b> and allow fuel to flow from the fuel chamber <b>72</b> to the air-and-fuel mixing passage <b>34</b></p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">At step <b>1215</b>, it may be determined whether or not a stop switch is activated. If so, the method terminates at step <b>1255</b>. If not, the method proceeds to step <b>1220</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">At step <b>1220</b>, it may be determined whether or not an engine temperature meets an engine temperature criteria. For example, the engine temperature criteria may be a first of two or more engine temperature criteria in the method <b>1200</b>. The criteria may be a low or cold engine temperature criteria, for instance, an engine temperature range or threshold value, for example, of between about 30 to about 50 degrees Fahrenheit and, more particularly, about 40 degrees. Of course, such temperature values and ranges are engine application specific, vary with carburetor settings for the particular application, and may be determined during calibration of carburetor prototypes in thermal chamber testing. The determination may include sensing engine temperature, for instance, using thermal switches, temperature sensors, thermocouples, or any other suitable devices and associated equipment like processors, memory, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">If the engine temperature does not meet the cold engine temperature criteria, then the method proceeds to step <b>1245</b>. But if so, then the method branches to step <b>1225</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">At step <b>1225</b>, it may be determined whether or not an engine speed meets engine speed criteria. For example, the engine speed criteria may be low engine speed criteria, for instance, between about 1,000 and 2,000 RPM and, more particularly, may be about 1,700 RPM. The low speed criteria and ranges are engine application specific, and may be determined during carburetor calibration and may correspond to a lowest engine speed at which the engine idles smoothly. Engine speed may be determined in any suitable manner, for example, an engine speed sensor (not shown) may be operatively coupled to the crankshaft, the flywheel, or the like in any suitable manner, or one or more of the lamstack coils <b>232</b>, <b>236</b>, <b>242</b>, <b>244</b> may be used to track engine revolutions in any suitable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">If engine speed does not meet the engine speed criteria, then the method proceeds to step <b>1230</b>. Otherwise, the method proceeds to step <b>1240</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">At step <b>1230</b>, a supplementary fuel supply passage may be initially opened or maintained in an open state. For example, electrical power is communicated to the electromechanical valve <b>86</b> to unseat the valve member <b>108</b> and allow fuel to flow from the fuel chamber <b>72</b> to the air-and-fuel mixing passage <b>34</b>. Thus, when the engine <b>200</b> is relatively cold, the electromechanical valve <b>86</b> is activated not only during cranking but also at any time engine speed falls below low speed criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">At step <b>1235</b>, a spark plug may be fired. For example, the electronic processing device <b>264</b> may send an ignition signal to the switch <b>254</b> to fire the spark plug <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">At step <b>1240</b>, a supplementary fuel supply passage may be closed. For example, electrical power to the electromechanical valve <b>86</b> is terminated or kept off to seat the valve member <b>108</b> or keep it seated and prevent fuel from flowing from the fuel chamber <b>72</b> to the air-and-fuel mixing passage <b>34</b>. In one embodiment, the electronic processing device <b>264</b> may cease output of the valve-on control signal. In another embodiment, the valve-on control signal from the electronic processing device <b>264</b> may be shorted to ground when the thermistor <b>256</b> conducts. After step <b>1240</b>, the method loops back just before step <b>1215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">At step <b>1245</b>, it may be determined whether or not an engine temperature meets additional engine temperature criteria. For example, the additional engine temperature criteria may be a warm or hot engine temperature, for instance, of about 75 to about 95 degrees Fahrenheit and, more particularly, about 85 degrees. Again, such temperature values and ranges are engine application specific, vary with carburetor settings for the particular application, and may be determined during carburetor calibration in a thermal chamber to correspond to a temperature at which the engine can be started and idle smoothly without additional enrichment from the electromechanical valve <b>86</b>. The determination may include sensing engine temperature, for instance, using thermal switches, temperature sensors, thermocouples, or any other suitable devices and associated equipment like processors, memory, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">If the engine temperature does not meet the additional engine temperature criteria, then the method proceeds to step <b>1250</b>. But if so, then the method branches to step <b>1240</b>, because a warm engine should not require supplementary fuel for startup. The A/F ratio of hot, running engine is generally leaner than the A/F ratio to reliably start a cold engine.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">At step <b>1250</b>, it may be determined whether or not a supplementary fuel supply passage has been open for more than a determined number of engine revolutions. Engine revolutions may be assessed in any suitable manner, for example, using any suitable counter with any suitable input such as that from an engine speed sensor, or one or more of the coils. The minimum number may be, for example, about 10 to 20 revolutions and, more specifically, about 15 revolutions. The number may be determined by engine testing as the maximum number of revolutions below the high temperature criteria that does not result in engine flooding.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In some cases an engine may fail to start quickly and, because the supplementary fuel supply passage may remain open, the start fuel may continue to be supplied to the engine <b>200</b>, thereby potentially &#x201c;flooding&#x201d; the spark plug <b>210</b> in the combustion chamber of the engine <b>200</b> with an excessively rich mixture of air and fuel. Once the spark plug <b>210</b> becomes flooded, the engine <b>200</b> may be difficult or impossible to start, and the operator must wait until the fuel evaporates from the spark plug <b>210</b> before trying to start the engine <b>200</b> again.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">If the supplementary fuel supply passage has been open for more than the determined number of engine revolutions, then the method may proceed to step <b>1240</b>. Otherwise, the method proceeds to step <b>1235</b>, whereafter the method may loop back to step <b>1215</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">At step <b>1255</b>, the method <b>1200</b> may terminate in any suitable manner. For example, the method terminates if the stop switch is engaged, if the engine revolutions are insufficient to power the circuit, and/or the like.</p>

<p id="p-0085" num="0084"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref> illustrates a routine of the method <b>1300</b> for supplying supplementary fuel during engine cranking. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13B</figref> illustrates another routine of the method <b>1300</b> for further supplying supplementary fuel after engine cranking and during engine warmup.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13A</figref>, at step <b>1305</b>, the method <b>1300</b> may commence in any suitable manner.

<p id="p-0087" num="0086">At step <b>1310</b>, it may be determined whether or not an engine stop switch is activated. If so, the method proceeds to step <b>1385</b>. If not, the method proceeds to step <b>1315</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">At step <b>1315</b>, engine temperature may be sensed and a supply of supplementary fuel during engine cranking may be determined. For example, upon engine cranking and within about the first two to three revolutions of an engine crankshaft, engine temperature may be sensed, crankshaft revolutions may be counted, and a number of crankshaft revolutions remaining over an engine cranking cycle may be calculated. For example, an engine cranking cycle may include six revolutions. So, for instance, if two crankshaft revolutions have been counted by the time the engine temperature is sensed, then the supply of supplementary fuel is determined to be carried out over the next four crankshaft revolutions. This is because six cranking revolutions minus two counted revolutions equals four revolutions.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">At step <b>1320</b>, a determination is made whether or not supplementary fuel is required during engine cranking. For example, the engine temperature sensed in step <b>1315</b> may be used in a comparison with engine temperature criteria, for instance, a certain minimum engine startup temperature. In one example embodiment, if the sensed engine temperature does not meet the criteria, then the method proceeds to step <b>1325</b>, otherwise the method proceeds to step <b>1385</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">At step <b>1325</b>, a supplementary fuel supply passage may be opened. For example, the electromechanical valve <b>86</b> may be powered.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">At step <b>1330</b>, engine speed may be determined. For example, an engine speed sensor may be used to sense engine speed, or lamstack coils and suitable circuitry may be used to determine engine speed, or the like. Using lamstack coils to count engine revolutions and circuitry to calculate engine speed as a function of revolutions per time is well known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">At step <b>1335</b>, it may be determined whether or not engine speed meets engine speed criteria. For example, the engine speed may be that determined in step <b>1330</b>, and the criteria may be a minimum engine speed startup criteria, for instance, between about 1,000 and 2,000 RPM and, more particularly, may be about 1,700 RPM. If the engine speed criteria is met, then the method proceeds to step <b>1340</b>, otherwise, the method proceeds to step <b>1385</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">At step <b>1340</b>, it may be determined whether or not a determined amount of supplementary supply of fuel for engine cranking has been reached. For example, if a sixth revolution of engine cranking has been determined to have occurred, then it can be determined that the determined amount of supplementary supply of fuel determined in step <b>1315</b> has been reached. If not, then the method loops back to step <b>1330</b>. But if so, then the method proceeds to step <b>1345</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">At step <b>1345</b>, a supplementary fuel supply passage may be closed. For example, the valve <b>86</b> may be depowered. Thereafter, the method proceeds to step <b>1350</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">At step <b>1350</b>, engine temperature and/or speed may be sensed in any suitable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">At step <b>1355</b>, a determination is made whether or not further supplementary fuel is required after engine cranking and during an engine warm-up period. For example, the engine temperature sensed in step <b>1350</b> may be used in a comparison with engine temperature criteria that may be the same as or different from that discussed in step <b>1320</b>. If the sensed engine temperature meets the criteria, then the method proceeds to step <b>1360</b>, otherwise the method proceeds to step <b>1385</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">At step <b>1360</b>, it may be determined whether or not engine speed meets engine speed criteria. For example, the engine speed may be that determined in step <b>1350</b>, and the engine speed criteria may be the same as that or different from the engine speed criteria of step <b>1335</b>.

<p id="p-0098" num="0097">At step <b>1365</b>, a supplementary fuel supply passage may be opened. For example, the electromechanical valve <b>86</b> may be powered.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">At step <b>1370</b>, engine temperature may be sensed and a further supply of supplementary fuel during engine warm-up may be determined For example, after engine cranking and during an engine warm-up period, engine temperature may be sensed, and a calculation can be made of warm-up parameters such as a fuel supply duration or quantity of crankshaft revolutions, and a fuel supply cycle length or frequency of revolutions over which the further supply of supplementary fuel is desired.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">The following examples are for illustration and not limitation. The frequency may be calculated to be, for instance, every sixth crankshaft revolution, and the quantity or duration may be calculated to be, for instance, one to four crankshaft revolutions over which the further supply of supplementary fuel is provided for every determined cycle length.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Such parameters may be calculated as a function of engine temperature and/or speed. For instance, supplementary fuel may be provided over a greater number of revolutions and more frequently for lower engine temperatures and/or speeds, and vice versa.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">At step <b>1375</b>, it may be determined whether or not engine temperature meets engine temperature criteria. For example, the engine temperature may be that sensed in step <b>1370</b> and the criteria may be same or different from that of step <b>1355</b>. If the sensed engine temperature meets the criteria, then the method proceeds to step <b>1380</b>, otherwise the method proceeds to step <b>1385</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">At step <b>1380</b>, it may be determined whether or not a determined amount of a further supply of supplementary fuel for engine warmup has been reached. For example, if the number of revolutions determined in step <b>1370</b> was four, and it has been determined that four revolutions have occurred since step <b>1370</b>, then it can be determined that the amount of further supply of supplementary fuel determined in step <b>1370</b> has been reached.

<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In addition to the PCM <b>318</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref> also illustrates a temperature sensor <b>333</b> to sense engine temperature, a stop switch <b>335</b> to stop engine operation, the solenoid coil <b>106</b>, the spark plug <b>210</b>, and the valve power coil <b>232</b>. The PCM <b>318</b> includes a pulse calculation block <b>337</b>, which may represent suitable instructions for supplying supplementary fuel that may be executed by an electronic processing device <b>364</b> of the PCM <b>318</b>.

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Finally, in contrast to the PCM <b>218</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, here the PCM <b>318</b> includes a rectifying circuit <b>343</b> interposed between the valve power coil <b>232</b> and the solenoid coil <b>106</b>.

Those of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the particular sizes and capacities of the components of the rectifying circuit <b>343</b> may be application specific and provided in accord with desired solenoid valve opening timing.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">In general, the components of the engine and carburetor can be manufactured according to techniques known to those skilled in the art, including molding, machining, stamping, and the like. Also, the carburetor can be assembled according to known techniques. Likewise, any suitable materials can be used in making the components, such as metals, composites, polymeric materials, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">A system for supplemental fuel supply also can be utilized to control engine temperature and/or speed at relatively high engine temperature and speeds, instead of or in addition to the starting and warm-up periods already discussed. In at least some engine applications, it may be desirable to provide a fuel and air mixture to the engine that is richer than is required for steady operation of the engine (e.g. richer than a stoichiometric fuel/air ratio) to help cool the engine in use. However, the richer fuel/air mixture can lead to undesirable exhaust emissions from the engine. Operating with a leaner fuel/air ratio can reduce emissions but may also lead to higher than desired engine temperatures. In some instances of high speed and/or high load engine operation (e.g. in use of a chainsaw or the like), the engine temperature in at least a portion of the engine may be high enough to cause unintended combustion within an engine cylinder. This unintended combustion can lead to higher than intended or desired engine speed, increased temperature and potentially further unintended combustion events which may lead to seizing of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">To deal with this potential issue, one solution is to skip an intended engine ignition event (e.g. not provide a spark at the spark plug so emission does not occur when it otherwise would occur). However, unburned fuel may be discharged through the exhaust system and can damage or impair a catalyst or other engine or exhaust component or system when an ignition event or multiple ignition events are skipped. Another possible solution is to retarding or delaying ignition events to slow down the engine. However, the temperature of exhaust gas emissions can increase undesirably and damage or impair the catalyst or other engine or exhaust component or system.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, an exemplary fuel supply system <b>1700</b> includes a primary fuel supply device (shown as a carburetor <b>1702</b>) and a supplementary fuel supply device <b>1704</b>. The supplementary fuel supply device <b>1704</b> may include a valve through which fuel may flow for delivery to the engine <b>1706</b> under certain engine operating conditions. That is, during certain engine operating conditions, the valve <b>1704</b> may be opened to permit fuel to flow through or past the valve for delivery to the engine <b>1706</b> of a supplementary supply of fuel. In one form, the valve <b>1704</b> is normally closed so that essentially no fuel flows past or through the valve, but the valve could normally be partially open and then opened further to enable a higher flow rate of fuel therethrough when desired. In that case, normal fuel flow would include fuel flow through the valve <b>1704</b> and supplemental fuel would be provided to the engine when the valve is further opened.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">Like the previous embodiment which related more to starting and engine warm-up, the valve <b>1704</b> may control fuel flow through a supplemental fuel passage <b>1708</b> or passages where fuel from the metering chamber <b>1710</b> of the carburetor <b>1702</b> may be supplied to the engine <b>1706</b>. The supplementary fuel passage <b>1708</b> may open into or communicate with the fuel and air mixing passage <b>1712</b>, and may as one example, provide fuel into the fuel and air mixing passage at a location downstream of a venturi (if one is provided in the fuel and air mixing passage). The supplementary fuel passage <b>1708</b> may open into the fuel and air mixing passage downstream of the throttle valve <b>1714</b>, at least when the throttle valve is in its idle position. Also like the previous embodiment, the valve timing can be controlled by a microprocessor or other controller <b>1713</b> that also controls the ignition timing, and the valve may be powered by a coil integrated into the ignition module, such as the valve power coil. The valve <b>1704</b> may be electrically actuated, such as a solenoid, piezoelectric (bending, rotary or linear actuators), ultrasonic piezoelectric such as are available from Discovery Technology International, Inc., voice coil actuator or similar type of valve.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">The duration that the valve <b>1704</b> is opened, or the number of times the valve is cycled (opened and closed) may vary as a function of the engine speed and/or engine temperature. For example, when the engine speed exceeds a first threshold (as determined by an engine speed sensor <b>1715</b> or other device or method), the valve <b>1704</b> may be opened for a given duration which may be a certain number of engine revolutions. If the engine speed exceeds a second threshold higher than the first threshold, the valve <b>1704</b> may be opened for a longer duration which may be a certain higher number of engine revolutions. Still further engine speed thresholds may be provided to provide for different valve opening durations or cycles, to provide a desired amount of supplemental fuel to the engine. The engine speed may be checked periodically including every revolution, or every cycle of the engine, and the supplemental fuel may be provided as a result, assuming the engine speed is faster than a first or lowest threshold. If the engine speed is not faster than a first threshold, then the valve <b>1704</b> may remain in its first position (e.g. closed, or its most closed position).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">In one exemplary implementation, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, engine revolutions are shown at <b>1716</b> and a control signal for opening and closing the valve is shown at <b>1718</b>. In this example, the first threshold is 12,000 rpm and in phase one <b>1720</b> the engine speed is below 12,000 rpm. Accordingly, the valve is maintained closed or in its first position. In this example, when operating normally, the engine speed may be below the first threshold, and so the valve would normally be closed (or in its first position) and the supplemental fuel would not be provided to the engine. In phase two <b>1722</b>, the engine speed is detected as being over 12,000 rpm. In this phase, the valve <b>1704</b> is opened (moved to its second positions) for two out of every 9 engine revolutions, where a cycle has been deemed to include 9 revolutions in this example. This may occur for a certain number of cycles, for example 1-10 cycles as represented by the box <b>1723</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, and the engine speed may be checked again. If the engine speed is below the first threshold (12,000 rpm in this example), the valve <b>1704</b> is no longer driven to its open position for as long as the engine speed remains below the first threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">If, however, the engine speed is above a second threshold which is higher than the first threshold, then the valve <b>1704</b> may be opened for a greater duration, or cycled more frequently than in phase two <b>1722</b>. In the example shown, the second threshold may be 13,000 rpm and operation of the valve <b>1704</b> when the engine speed is greater than the second threshold is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref> at phase three <b>1724</b>. In other words, despite adding the supplemental fuel in phase two <b>1722</b>, the engine speed increased in this example. In phase three <b>1724</b>, the valve <b>1704</b> may be opened for a greater duration each cycle than the valve was opened in phase two <b>1722</b>. For example, the valve <b>1704</b> may be opened for 4 revolutions each cycle during phase three <b>1724</b> as opposed to two revolutions as in phase two <b>1722</b>. This may also occur for a given number of cycles, as represented by box <b>1725</b>, before the engine speed is checked again, or the engine speed may be determined or checked every cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">After phase three <b>1724</b>, and in phase four <b>1726</b>, the engine speed was between the first and second thresholds. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the valve <b>1704</b> may then be operated similarly to phase two <b>1722</b>, and this may occur for a given number of cycles (represented by box <b>1727</b>) which may be the same as in phase two, as desired. If, after phase four <b>1726</b>, the engine speed is below the first threshold, then the valve <b>1704</b> is not driven to its second position (in this example), as shown in phase five <b>1728</b> and supplemental fuel is not provided through the valve <b>1704</b>. If, after phase three <b>1724</b>, the engine speed increased further, beyond a third threshold, then the valve <b>1704</b> could be operated in such a manner as to provide even more supplemental fuel to the engine, if desired. In one example, the third threshold could be 14,000 rpm. In addition to the supplemental fuel delivery, the ignition timing could be changed when the engine speed is above any of the thresholds, if desired. Also if desired, one or more ignition events could be skipped in addition to supplying supplemental fuel. This may include skipping a sufficient number of ignition events to shut down the engine <b>1706</b> should the engine speed exceed a given speed threshold, such as either the third threshold or an even higher threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Another exemplary control chart is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>. In the first phase <b>1730</b> of this control scheme, the engine speed is below a threshold speed and so no supplemental fuel is provided to the engine <b>1706</b>. In phase two <b>1732</b>, the engine speed is higher than the threshold speed and a first amount of supplemental fuel is added by moving the valve <b>1704</b> to its second position (opening or further opening the valve). In the example shown, the valve <b>1704</b> is open for 2 out of 9 revolutions and this may be repeated for a desired number of cycles (e.g. 1 to 10 or more represented by box <b>1733</b>). After the desired number of cycles are completed, the engine speed can again be determined or checked. If the engine speed still is above the threshold speed, then more supplemental fuel may be provided to the engine in phase three <b>1734</b>. In the example shown, supplemental fuel is provided for 3 out of 9 revolutions in phase three <b>1734</b> and this may be repeated for a desired number of cycles (e.g. 1 to 10 or more represented by box <b>1735</b>). If the engine speed is still above the threshold speed, still further supplemental fuel may be provided to the engine in phase four <b>1736</b>. Additionally, the engine speed for two revolutions, for example, each of the last two revolutions in phase three <b>1734</b>, can be compared. And the amount of supplemental fuel added in phase four <b>1736</b> can be controlled as a function of the engine speed during these compared revolutions. If, for example, the last revolution was slower than the second-to-last revolution, meaning the engine <b>1706</b> is slowing down, then the supplemental fuel may be added at the same rate/duration as in phase three <b>1734</b> (e.g. the valve may be opened 3 out of 9 revolutions) to achieve further engine speed reduction. If the last revolution was faster than or the same speed as the second-to-last revolution, meaning the engine speed is increasing or at least not decreasing, then an increased amount of supplemental fuel may be added in phase four <b>1736</b> (e.g. the valve may be opened 4 out of 9 revolutions). This may be repeated for any desired number of cycles as represented by box <b>1737</b>. In the example shown, the engine speed is below the threshold speed in phase five <b>1738</b> and so supplemental fuel is not supplied to the engine <b>1706</b>. That is, the valve <b>1704</b> is not opened in phase five <b>1738</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Instead of opening the controlling the valve for a given number of engine revolutions, the valve could also be opened for a predetermined amount of time, or for an amount of time determined by the controller as a function of the instantaneous engine speed compared to one or more thresholds. Time and number of engine revolutions may be referred to as increments, and the supplementary fuel may be supplied to the engine over one or more increments, as desired.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As noted herein, the control scheme or method for supplying supplementary fuel to the engine may use multiple speed thresholds with a predetermined valve opening schedule. For example, based on which threshold the engine speed exceeds, the valve may be opened for a predetermined number of engine revolutions less than the total number of engine revolutions in a cycle (where the total revolutions in a cycle may also be predetermined). Where engine speeds above higher engine speed thresholds would cause more supplementary fuel to be supplied to the engine. And that control scheme may be repeated over a predetermined number of cycles before the engine speed is again compared to the threshold(s). In at least some implementations, supplementary fuel may be supplied to the engine for a greater number of cycles where the engine speed exceeds higher engine speed thresholds, and for fewer cycles where the engine speed exceeds only lower thresholds. Of course, the engine speed could be compared to the threshold(s) after every cycle, or for each engine revolution, or for selected engine revolutions within one or more cycles, if desired. A single engine speed threshold may also be used and the magnitude by which the instantaneous engine speed exceeds the threshold may determine the amount or rate of supplementary fuel supplied to the engine, where the greater the engine speed is compared to the threshold, the more supplementary fuel may be supplied to the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">For a given engine speed or range of speeds, the controller may determine, based on predetermined values in a programmed control schedule, table, chart, or an algorithm/formula (determination with an algorithm or formula may also be predetermined as used herein because the algorithm or formula will make a determination in a predetermined way), one or more of: 1) the number of revolutions in a cycle, 2) the number of revolutions (or total time) for supplementary fuel supply during a cycle, and/or 3) the number of cycles to repeat the supplementary fuel supply. Of course, other control schemes are possible and contemplated herein. As noted herein, the provision of supplementary fuel to the engine may help to control the engine temperature and engine speed within certain thresholds. In at least some implementations, the amount of supplemental fuel provided is controlled as a function of instantaneous engine speed and/or the magnitude by which the instantaneous engine speed exceeds one or more thresholds. In this way, unintended combustion events can be reduced or avoided altogether, among other things.</p>
