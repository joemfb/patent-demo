<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The invention relates to a hybrid drive train including an internal combustion engine, an electric machine and a transmission provided with at least one torsional vibration damper.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In order to reduce torsional vibrations in the drive train of a hybrid drive, in practice one or more torsional vibration dampers (TVD) are used. A typical arrangement consists of one TVD between the engine rotational mass and the electric machine, and a further TVD between the electric machine and the transmission input shaft. This arrangement forms a three-mass vibration system in which the resonance frequency of the electric machine falls within the frequency range which is excited especially by 4-cylinder engines by the main order (second order). This results in disturbing excessive humming noises particularly in the low-speed driving range.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Furthermore, dual mass flywheels with spring and damping systems are known from DE 35 45 857 C1 and DE 36 09 149 C2, in which in the effective direction a resilient mounting arrangement with one or more dampers in the form of slip clutches are arranged in series for connecting a first flywheel element and a second flywheel element.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It has been found however that the operating behavior of drive trains of hybrid drives provided with known flywheels is unsatisfactory.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is the principal object of the invention to provide means for reducing humming noises in the low-speed driving range in vehicles with a hybrid drive.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In a hybrid drive train with torsional vibration dampers of a hybrid motor vehicle, including an internal combustion engine, an electric machine, a clutch and a transmission, a first spring damping system is arranged between the internal combustion engine and the electric machine and a second spring damping system is arranged between the electric machine and the transmission, each damping system being provided with an arrangement of springs and a centrifugal pendulum for reducing humming noises in a hybrid drive train in the low speed driving range of the hybrid motor vehicle.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the first spring system and damping system are constructed in the manner of a torsional vibration damper, in particular a dual mass flywheel, with springs on a first radius and the centrifugal pendulum means on a second radius, wherein the second radius is greater than the first radius. With this embodiment, it is the aim to accommodate the centrifugal pendulum means in the existing installation space of a dual mass flywheel such that it has a large effective radius and applies a counter torque to the vibration of the electric machine. This considerably reduces the torsional vibrations which are caused by the resonance of the electric machine, in the lower frequency range.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Preferably, the springs are arranged in the torque flow from the internal combustion engine to the transmission on the internal combustion engine side of the centrifugal pendulum means.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In a preferred embodiment, the centrifugal pendulum means are arranged on a rotational mass.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Also, the clutch is arranged on the transmission side of the centrifugal pendulum means, the input side of the clutch preferably being firmly connected for rotation with an output side of the centrifugal pendulum means.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Preferably, the clutch is a wet clutch.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Also advantageously, the electric machine is arranged on the transmission side of the clutch.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">A second spring and damping system is arranged between the electric machine and the transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The advantages of the invention are already apparent in connection with a torsional vibration damper for a motor vehicle hybrid drive, with an input side and an output side, between which a first spring and damping system is arranged, if&#x2014;as provided for according to one aspect of the invention&#x2014;the spring and damping system has a centrifugal force pendulum means. This reduces humming noises in the low-speed driving range of a hybrid-drive vehicle. This applies especially in a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, according to which provision is made for the first spring and damping system to be constructed in the manner of a dual mass flywheel which has springs on a first radius and the centrifugal pendulum means on a second radius, the second radius being greater than the first radius. With regard to the advantages and the operation of the torsional vibration damper, reference is expressly made to the corresponding description of the drive train.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The invention will become more readily apparent from the following description of advantageous embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF PARTICULAR EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In the schematic representation shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> of a particularly preferred first embodiment of a drive train <b>100</b> according to the invention, an internal combustion engine <b>102</b> and an electric machine <b>104</b> are provided in order to drive an output shaft <b>108</b> via an automatic transmission <b>106</b>. The internal combustion engine <b>102</b> is preferably a 4-cylinder, 5-cylinder or 6-cylinder spark ignition engine or diesel engine. The electric machine <b>104</b> is a unit which permits both motor operation and generator operation. The automatic transmission <b>106</b> is a transmission with five, six or seven forward gears. A reverse gear does not need to be provided, since reversing can be provided via the electric machine <b>104</b>. If the driving takes place via the internal combustion engine <b>102</b>, this and the electric machine <b>104</b> and the automatic transmission <b>106</b> represent a three-mass system.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In order to compensate for rotational irregularities of the internal combustion engine <b>102</b>, a torsional vibration damper <b>110</b> is provided. According to a particularly preferred first embodiment of the invention, the input side <b>112</b> of the torsional vibration damper <b>110</b> is firmly connected for rotation with a crankshaft of the internal combustion engine <b>102</b> and the output side <b>114</b> is firmly connected for rotation with an input side <b>116</b> of a clutch <b>118</b>. The clutch <b>118</b> is a wet clutch. An output side <b>120</b> of the clutch <b>118</b> is connected in torsion resistant manner to a shaft <b>122</b> of the electric machine <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The torsional vibration damper <b>110</b>, which is shown in a simplified sectional view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, comprises a first spring and damping system <b>124</b> in the form of a dual mass flywheel, with a first rotational mass <b>126</b> being arranged on the input side <b>112</b>. On this first rotational mass <b>126</b> there is supported a cage means <b>128</b> with a plurality of cages <b>130</b>, these cages <b>130</b> serving to receive pressure springs <b>132</b>. On their one side, the pressure springs <b>132</b> are supported on the respective cage <b>130</b>, and with their other side the pressure springs <b>132</b> are supported via a central disk <b>134</b> and a hub <b>136</b> on a shaft <b>138</b>, the shaft <b>138</b> possibly being part of the clutch <b>118</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The torsional vibration damper <b>110</b> further has a centrifugal pendulum arrangement <b>140</b>, which will be referred to below as a centrifugal pendulum. This centrifugal pendulum <b>140</b> has pendulum masses <b>142</b>, <b>144</b> which oscillate in curved paths in a centrifugal field generated during rotation of the vibration damper <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> that the centrifugal pendulum <b>140</b> is arranged radially outside the cage means <b>128</b> with the pressure springs <b>132</b> in an axially identical position. However, both the centrifugal pendulum <b>140</b> and the cage means <b>128</b> with the pressure springs <b>132</b> are located within the contour determined by the first rotational mass <b>126</b> which is for example the flywheel of the engine.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The method of operation of the drive train shown is as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A torque generated by the internal combustion engine <b>102</b> with a superposed oscillating torque is first transmitted by the cage means <b>128</b> (spring guidance plates), which is fastened to the first rotational mass <b>126</b> (flywheel), to the pressure springs <b>132</b> of the torsional vibration damper <b>110</b> and passed on by the springs <b>132</b> to the hub <b>136</b> fastened to the shaft <b>138</b> to the wet starting clutch <b>118</b> (WSC). This hub <b>136</b> and the central disk <b>134</b> connected thereto are designed such that their external diameter provides for sufficient installation space radially outside the set of springs, for accommodating the centrifugal pendulum <b>140</b>. This means that the oscillating torque generated by the engine is already considerably reduced by the set of springs, and that the centrifugal pendulum has a maximum effective radius and hence can apply a large counter torque to the oscillating torque which is still present after the torsional vibration damper. Since <b>136</b>, with the clutch <b>118</b> closed, the hub is connected directly to the electric machine <b>104</b>, the counter torque acts directly on the electric machine <b>104</b> and can thus considerably reduce the vibrations caused by the resonance of the electric machine <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It is noted that a second spring and damping system <b>146</b> is arranged between the electric machine <b>104</b> and the transmission <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The drive train <b>200</b> shown with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, according to a second embodiment of the invention, and also the torsional vibration damper <b>210</b> provided therein and shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> according to the second embodiment of the invention, differ from the respective first embodiment only in details. Therefore reference numerals which are increased by 100 compared with the first embodiment in each case are used for the description. Reference is hereby expressly made to the corresponding description.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As in the first embodiment, an internal combustion engine <b>202</b> and an electric machine <b>204</b> are provided in the drive train <b>200</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, which serve to drive an output shaft <b>208</b> via an automatic transmission <b>206</b>. The internal combustion engine <b>202</b> is preferably a 4-cylinder, 5-cylinder or 6-cylinder spark ignition engine or diesel engine. The electric machine <b>204</b> is a unit which permits both motor operation and generator operation. The automatic transmission <b>206</b> is a trans-mission with five, six or seven forward gears. A reverse gear does not need to be provided, since reversing can be provided via the electric machine <b>204</b>. If the driving takes place via the internal combustion engine <b>202</b>, the engine <b>202</b>, the electric machine <b>204</b> and the automatic transmission <b>206</b> represent a three-mass system.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In order to compensate for irregularities in rotation of the internal combustion engine <b>202</b>, a torsional vibration damper <b>210</b> is provided. The input side <b>212</b> is firmly connected to a crankshaft of the internal combustion engine <b>202</b>, and the output side <b>214</b> is connected to an input side <b>216</b> of a clutch <b>218</b>. The clutch <b>218</b> is a wet clutch. An output side <b>220</b> of the clutch <b>218</b> is connected to a shaft <b>222</b> of the electric machine <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The torsional vibration damper <b>210</b>, which is shown in a simplified sectional view in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, comprises a first spring and damping system <b>224</b> in the manner of a dual mass flywheel, with a first rotational mass <b>226</b> being arranged on the input side <b>212</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The second embodiment also has a cage means <b>228</b> with a plurality of cages <b>230</b>, these cages <b>230</b> serving to receive pressure springs <b>232</b>. On their one side, the pressure springs <b>232</b> are supported on the respective cage <b>230</b>. Unlike the first embodiment, the springs <b>232</b> are however supported with their other side on a central ring <b>250</b>, this central ring <b>250</b> being in operative connection with the first rotational mass <b>226</b>. Correspondingly, unlike the first embodiment, in the second embodiment the cage means <b>228</b> is supported optionally via a hub on a shaft <b>238</b>, the shaft <b>238</b> possibly being formed as part of the clutch <b>218</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The torsional vibration damper <b>210</b> further has a centrifugal pendulum <b>240</b>. This centrifugal pendulum <b>240</b> has pendulum masses <b>242</b>, <b>244</b>, which oscillate in curved paths in the centrifugal field. The frequency of the pendulum increases with the rotational speed and can eliminate the irregularity of rotation across the entire speed range.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> that the centrifugal pendulum means <b>240</b> is arranged radially outside the cage means <b>228</b> with the pressure springs <b>232</b> being arranged in an axially identical position. However, both the centrifugal pendulum means <b>240</b> and the cage means <b>228</b> with the pressure springs <b>232</b> are located within the contour determined by the first rotational mass <b>226</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The method of operation of the drive train <b>200</b> shown is as follows:</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A torque generated by the internal combustion engine <b>202</b> with a superposed oscillating torque is first transmitted by the central ring <b>250</b>, which is fastened to the first rotational mass <b>226</b> (to the flywheel), to the pressure springs <b>232</b> of the torsional vibration damper <b>210</b> and passed on by the springs <b>232</b> to the cage means <b>228</b> (spring guidance plates) which is fastened to the shaft <b>238</b> and to the wet starting clutch (WSC). This cage means <b>228</b> has an external diameter selected so that sufficient installation space is present radially outside the set of springs to fasten the centrifugal pendulum <b>240</b> to the cage means <b>228</b>. Since the cage means <b>228</b>, when the clutch <b>218</b> (WSC) is closed, is connected directly to the electric machine <b>204</b>, the counter torque acts directly on the electric machine <b>204</b> and can thus considerably reduce the vibrations caused by the resonance of the electric machine <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">It is noted that a second spring and damping system <b>246</b> is arranged between the electric machine <b>204</b> and the transmission <b>206</b>.</p>
