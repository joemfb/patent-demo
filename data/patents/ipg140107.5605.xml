<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates generally to handheld electronic devices and, more particularly, to a handheld electronic device that has a reduced keyboard and that facilitates the entry of text in a message.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Numerous types of handheld electronic devices are known. Examples of such handheld electronic devices include, for instance, personal data assistants (PDAs), handheld computers, two-way pagers, cellular telephones and the like. Many handheld electronic devices also feature a wireless or other communication capability, although other handheld electronic devices are stand-alone devices that are functional without communication with other devices. Such handheld electronic devices are generally intended to be portable, and thus are of a relatively compact configuration in which keys and other structures often perform multiple functions under certain circumstances or may otherwise have multiple aspects or features assigned thereto. With advances in technology, handheld electronic devices are built to have progressively smaller form factors yet have progressively greater numbers of applications and features resident thereon. As a practical matter, the keys of a keypad can only be reduced to a certain small size before the keys become relatively unusable.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In language entry applications, such as in a messaging or e-mail application, a keypad must be capable of generating substantially all of the elements desirable or necessary to form the relevant language. For example, in a language that employs Roman letters, a keypad must be capable of generating substantially all twenty-six of the Roman letters. In order to provide such functionality with relatively few keys, some keypads have included multiple linguistic elements per key, such as providing a plurality of Roman letters on each of at least some of the keys when the keypad is used to generate a language that employs Roman letters.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In order to make use of the multiple linguistic elements on any given key, numerous keystroke interpretation systems have been provided. For instance, a &#x201c;multi-tap system&#x201d; allows a user to substantially unambiguously specify a particular linguistic element, for example, on a key by pressing the same key a number of times equal to the position of the desired linguistic element on the key. Anther keystroke interpretation system includes key chording in which keys are pressed in various combinations to achieve particular results. Still another keystroke interpretation system might include a disambiguation routine which seeks to interpret the keystrokes in view of stored dictionary data, linguistic rules, stored algorithms, and/or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">While such disambiguation systems have been generally effective for their intended purposes, such disambiguation systems are not without limitation. In certain applications, the function of a disambiguation routine can be cumbersome if a user must expend substantial effort in entering language. One such situation in which this may occur is in the context of a word that may not already be in the stored dictionary. Another exemplary situation in which this may occur is when a word is already be stored in the dictionary but is considered to have a relatively low frequency, and this may require significant input effort by the user to achieve the desired word. Also, a desired word may not already be stored in the dictionary of the device. It thus would be desirable to provide a handheld electronic device having a reduced keyboard wherein the device might make available to a user words and the like that the user might reasonably be expected to enter. Such words and the like might, for example, be somewhat unconventional.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of the foregoing, an improved handheld electronic device having a reduced keyboard provides facilitated language entry by making available to a user certain words that a user may reasonably be expected to enter. In some situations, certain words can be stored, for example, in a temporary dictionary for use in particular situations. For instance, the names of the recipients of an electronic message might be stored in a temporary dictionary for rapid retrieval when entering a salutation in the message. As another example, a number of the words in an existing electronic message may be stored in a temporary dictionary and made available to a user when replying to or forwarding the message since the existing message might include words that the user might reasonably be expected to type in the reply message or the forwarded message.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Accordingly, an aspect of the invention is to provide an improved handheld electronic device that has a reduced keyboard and that provides facilitated entry of language.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Another aspect of the invention is to provide an improved handheld electronic device having a reduced keyboard that can store certain data in one or more temporary dictionaries for retrieval in certain contexts.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another aspect of the invention is to provide an improved handheld electronic device that has a reduced keyboard and that provides facilitated entry of a salutation in an electronic message to a recipient of the message.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Another aspect of the invention is to provide an improved handheld electronic device that has a reduced keyboard and that facilitates the entry of words in an electronic message on the basis of the word having previously appeared in another electronic message in the same message thread.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another aspect of the invention is to provide an improved method of enabling disambiguation of an entry on a handheld electronic device having a reduced keyboard.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">These and other aspects of the invention are provided by an improved method of enabling disambiguation of an input into a handheld electronic device. The handheld electronic device includes an input apparatus, an output apparatus, and a memory having a plurality of objects stored therein. The plurality of objects include a plurality of language objects and a plurality of frequency objects, with each of at least a portion of the language objects of the plurality of language objects being associated with an associated frequency object of the plurality of frequency objects. The handheld electronic device has a number of messages available thereon, with each message of at least a portion of the number of messages including a number of language objects. The input apparatus includes a plurality of input members, with each of at least a portion of the input members of the plurality of input members having a plurality of linguistic elements assigned thereto. The general nature of the method can be stated as including detecting at least one of a replying input and a forwarding input with respect to a message of the number of messages, detecting an ambiguous input including a number of input member actuations of a number of the input members of the plurality of input members, with each of at least a portion of the input members of the number of input members including a number of linguistic elements assigned thereto, and with at least one of the input members of the number of input members having a plurality of linguistic elements assigned thereto, determining that a first portion of the memory is associated with the message, with the first portion of the memory including at least a portion of the language objects of the number of language objects of the message, identifying in the first portion of the memory a first language object that corresponds with the ambiguous input, and outputting at least a portion of the first language object as a first proposed disambiguation of the ambiguous input.</p>

In the present exemplary embodiment, the exemplary letters <b>30</b> are Roman letters, and the exemplary Roman letters serve as linguistic elements for language entry into the handheld electronic device <b>4</b>. It is understood that while the linguistic elements of the instant exemplary embodiment are depicted as being characters, specifically Roman letters, the linguistic elements could be other elements such as, for example and without limitation, other types of characters, ideograms, portions of ideograms such as strokes, and other elements that can be used in the generation of language. The expressions &#x201c;text&#x201d; and &#x201c;word&#x201d;, and variations thereof, are to be broadly construed herein and are not intended to be limiting in any fashion with regard to a particular language, a particular portion of a language or a means of providing an expression in a language, or to a particular language type or format.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The output apparatus <b>16</b> in the present exemplary embodiment includes a display <b>36</b>. The output apparatus <b>16</b> may additionally include other output devices such as lights, speakers, and other output devices without limitation.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the processor apparatus <b>20</b> includes a processor which may be, for instance and without limitation, a microprocessor (&#x3bc;P) <b>40</b> and which is responsive to inputs from the input apparatus <b>12</b> and provides output signals to the output apparatus <b>16</b>. The processor apparatus <b>20</b> additionally includes a memory <b>44</b> with which the microprocessor <b>40</b> interfaces. The memory <b>44</b> can be any of a variety of storage devices such as, for example and without limitation, RAM, ROM, EPROM, EEPROM, and/or other devices.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The memory <b>44</b> includes a generic word list <b>48</b> that has a plurality of language objects and frequency objects stored therein. The language objects are, in the instant example, representative of words. The language objects and the frequency objects are associated. A given frequency object is representative of a frequency value that reflects, for instance, the relative likelihood that a language object with which the frequency object is associated is what is intended by a user when the user makes an input via the keypad <b>24</b>. The memory <b>44</b> includes other objects stored and organized therein, as will be described in greater detail below.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The processor apparatus <b>20</b> has resident thereon a disambiguation routine that interfaces with the memory <b>44</b> and the objects stored therein to provide output in response to input via the input apparatus <b>12</b>. In accordance with the invention, and in certain situations, certain words and the like may be stored in one or more temporary dictionaries in the memory <b>44</b> and made available to the user, such as when the user might reasonably be expected to wish to input such words. The words in such a temporary dictionary may be accorded a relatively high frequency value in order that such words, if appropriate, will be presented in whole or in part to the user at an early opportunity during the text entry process to limit the editing effort and other input that might otherwise be required to enter such words.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Although many uses for the invention will be apparent, one exemplary use of the invention is presented herein as being in the context of electronic mail. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, for example, a number of existing messages <b>52</b> are available on the handheld electronic device <b>4</b>. That is, the messages <b>52</b> may either be stored directly on the handheld electronic device <b>4</b> or may be downloadable on demand, for example. The exemplary messages <b>52</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> each include, for instance, a sender <b>56</b> and a subject <b>60</b> for reference by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In a situation where, for example, a user enters a replying or forwarding command with respect to one of the messages <b>52</b>, the user can reasonably be expected to wish to enter certain language. Such expected language might include, for example, a salutation to one of the recipients and/or, by way of additional example, a reference to something that has already been referred to in a prior message in the same message thread. In some circumstances, some of the language that a user can reasonably be expected to wish to enter can be ascertained prior to entry of such language by the user. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, therefore, certain language is advantageously stored in one or more temporary dictionaries in the memory <b>44</b> for ready use by user in entering language.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Such an example is presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref>. If a replying or forwarding command, for example, is entered with respect to one of the messages <b>52</b>, the e-mail client application resident on the handheld electronic device <b>4</b> will generate a new message <b>64</b> that employs certain data available in the original message <b>52</b>. For example, the new message <b>64</b> may include a number of recipients <b>68</b> and a subject <b>100</b>. The recipients <b>68</b> in the present example include a first recipient <b>72</b>, a second recipient <b>76</b>, and a copied recipient <b>80</b>. In the present example the user has entered a replying input with respect to the indicated message <b>52</b>, and accordingly the sender <b>56</b> of the original message <b>52</b> becomes the first recipient <b>72</b> of the new message <b>64</b>. The second recipient <b>76</b>, may, for example and without limitation, have been another recipient of the message <b>52</b>, and the copied recipient <b>80</b> may, for example, and without limitation, have been a copied recipient of the original message <b>52</b>. It is also noted that the subject <b>100</b> is the same as the subject <b>60</b>, and that the new message <b>64</b> and the original message <b>52</b> are in a common e-mail thread.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">It is noted that in generating the exemplary new message <b>64</b>, the e-mail client application fills in the names of the recipients <b>68</b> and the subject <b>100</b>. The e-mail client application or other application or routine may advantageously also create a first temporary dictionary <b>84</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>) in the memory <b>44</b> and may store the names of the recipients <b>68</b> therein. For example, the names of the recipients <b>68</b> may be stored as language objects in the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b>. The first temporary dictionary <b>84</b> may additionally include frequency objects stored therein that provide frequency values for association with the stored language objects. Alternatively, the language objects in the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b> may be associated in some other fashion with a frequency value that is relatively high. In this regard, and as will be set forth in greater detail below, the exemplary disambiguation routine employed on the handheld electronic device <b>4</b> identifies language objects in the memory <b>44</b> and presents the language objects, in whole or in part, to the user in response to an ambiguous input for the purpose of providing proposed disambiguated interpretations of the ambiguous input. The output oftentimes may include a plurality of language objects, in whole or in part, listed in some fashion in a descending order of frequency value and/or in accordance with other criteria. By associating with the language objects stored in the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b> frequency objects of a relatively high frequency value, the language objects identified in the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b> during operation of the disambiguation routine may be output at a position of relatively high probability, i.e., frequency, in order to make such language objects readily available to the user. Such ready access to such language objects by the user facilitates entry and reduces the amount of input effort that may otherwise be required of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The exemplary new message <b>64</b> is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as including the recipients <b>68</b>, the subject <b>100</b>, and some text in a language input field <b>96</b> of the new message <b>64</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the exemplary text is being input on a first line <b>104</b>, i.e., an initial line, in the language input field <b>96</b> and is in the form of a salutation <b>108</b>. The exemplary salutation <b>108</b> includes a salutatory expression <b>112</b>. The salutatory expression <b>112</b> in the present example is the word &#x201c;Dear&#x201d;, which is recognizable as being a salutatory expression <b>112</b> from among a number of known salutatory expressions <b>112</b> such as, for example and without limitation, &#x201c;Hi&#x201d;, &#x201c;Hello&#x201d;, &#x201c;Hey&#x201d;, and others. As employed herein, a &#x201c;salutatory expression&#x201d; and variations thereof shall refer broadly to any linguistic or other type of expression which indicates a greeting or other annunciation directed toward a recipient of a communication. The handheld electronic device <b>4</b> may have a number of salutatory expressions <b>112</b> stored therein in order to enable the recognition of a given input as being a part of a salutation <b>108</b> by virtue of it including a known salutatory expression <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Adjacent the exemplary salutatory expression <b>112</b> is a text input location <b>128</b> indicated by a cursor <b>136</b>. In the vicinity of the cursor <b>136</b> is an exemplary first name <b>140</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> represents an exemplary output on the display <b>36</b> after the user has entered a replying input with regard to one of the original messages <b>52</b>, as mentioned above, and has additionally provided an ambiguous input by actuating the key <b>28</b> having assigned thereto the letters <b>30</b> &#x201c;Z&#x201d; and &#x201c;X&#x201d;. The disambiguation routine has recognized that the aforementioned ambiguous input was intended to be part of the salutation <b>108</b> since the current text input location <b>128</b> is disposed adjacent the salutatory expression <b>112</b> that had been identified as such by the disambiguation routine. The disambiguation routine may be configured to additionally recognize any input on the first line <b>104</b> of the language input field <b>96</b> as being a salutation <b>108</b> regardless of additionally being adjacent a salutatory expression <b>112</b>. This may be useful in a situation where the salutation does not include a salutatory expression, and rather includes only the recipient's name. This may also be useful when a plurality of names are being entered as a part of the salutation, whereby not all of the names will be disposed directly beside a single initial salutatory expression.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In seeking to interpret the aforementioned ambiguous input, which could be intended to be the initial letter of a word starting with &#x201c;Z&#x201d; or a word starting with &#x201c;X&#x201d;, the disambiguation routine sought to identify in the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b> a language object stored therein that corresponds with either &#x201c;Z&#x201d; or &#x201c;X&#x201d;, and resultingly identified the first name <b>140</b> of &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT&#x201d; since the names of the recipients <b>68</b> have been stored in the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b>. Associated with such first name <b>140</b> would be a relatively high frequency value. The output of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> indicates that the disambiguation routine has additionally identified in the generic word list <b>48</b> one or more language objects beginning with the letter &#x201c;Z&#x201d; and one or more language objects beginning with the letter &#x201c;X&#x201d;. Such language objects would have associated therewith frequency objects having frequency values that are relatively lower than the frequency value associated with the first name <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In providing the output of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> on the display <b>36</b>, the disambiguation routine may have compared the frequency values associated with those language objects identified in the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b> and in the generic word list <b>48</b> as corresponding with the aforementioned ambiguous input, and may have determined that the first name <b>140</b> was associated with the highest frequency value. This may have been because all of the language objects in the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b> will have associated therewith relatively high frequency values.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The output in the present exemplary embodiment depicted <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> includes a text component <b>116</b> and a variant component <b>120</b>. The text component <b>116</b> is output at the text input location <b>128</b>. The variant component <b>120</b> is, in the exemplary embodiment of the depicted handheld electronic device <b>4</b>, output at a lower region of the display <b>36</b>. The contents of the output include a default output <b>124</b> and a number of variants <b>132</b>. The default output <b>124</b> is depicted as being output as both the text component <b>116</b> at the text input location <b>128</b> and as the leftmost variant <b>132</b> in the variant component <b>120</b>. In addition to the variant component <b>120</b> including the default output <b>124</b>, the variant component <b>120</b> outputs a number of variants <b>132</b> adjacent the default output <b>124</b> to provide alternate proposed outputs.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the present example, the user, in actuating the key <b>28</b> to which the letters <b>30</b> &#x201c;Z&#x201d; and &#x201c;X&#x201d; are assigned, likely intended to enter the name &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT&#x201d; as part of the salutation <b>108</b> since the first recipient <b>72</b> is &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT JONES&#x201d;. The first name <b>140</b> &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT&#x201d; is unlikely to previously have been stored in the generic word list <b>48</b> or otherwise in the memory <b>44</b>. By storing the first name <b>140</b> &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT&#x201d; in the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b>, the effort that otherwise would have been required of the user in entering the exemplary first name <b>140</b> &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT&#x201d; is reduced. That is, in the absence of the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b> the disambiguation routine might have offered numerous variants to the user in attempting to predict the intent of the user in providing the aforementioned input, and such variants may have required numerous selection and/or movement inputs by the user in ultimately entering the name &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT&#x201d;. By making available as a high frequency variant the first name &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT&#x201d;, the additional effort that otherwise might have been required of the user in entering the first name <b>140</b> of the salutation <b>108</b> is reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In certain disambiguation systems, the proposed output responsive to an input may be only the same length as the input. That is, in certain disambiguation routines the proposed output in response to a single keystroke might be a number of variants <b>132</b> that are only a single character, i.e., letter <b>30</b>, in length. In the present exemplary embodiment of the disambiguation routine, however, the proposed output in response to the single keystroke of the key <b>28</b> to which the letters <b>30</b> &#x201c;Z&#x201d; and &#x201c;X&#x201d; are assigned was the entire first name <b>140</b> &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT&#x201d;. The disambiguation routine thus provided a disambiguation in the nature of a predicted entire word in response to an ambiguous input consisting of a single keystroke. This is particularly advantageous because it avoids the need of the user to actuate all of the keys <b>28</b> that might otherwise be required to spell the first name <b>140</b> &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT&#x201d;. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, therefore, the disambiguation routine determined that the current input was a part of the salutation <b>108</b>, i.e., by determining that the text input location <b>128</b> was adjacent the salutatory expression <b>112</b> from among a number of predetermined salutatory expressions <b>112</b> and/or by being disposed at the first line <b>104</b> of the language input field <b>96</b>. Since the salutation likely will be limited to the names of the recipients <b>68</b>, the prediction of the entire first name <b>140</b> from the aforementioned single keystroke saves time and effort on the part of the user. In other embodiments, however, the output need not include an entire predicted name, and rather may be a letter-for-keystroke output.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the disambiguation routine may additionally provide a second name <b>144</b> as a variant <b>132</b> in combination with the first name <b>140</b>, thus &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT &#x26; WILLIAM&#x201d;. The first name <b>140</b> and the second name <b>144</b> correspond with the first recipient <b>72</b> and the second recipient <b>76</b>, respectively. As such, in addition to providing as the default output <b>124</b> the entire first name <b>140</b>, &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT&#x201d;, the disambiguation routine additionally can provide as a first variant <b>132</b> the combined first and second names <b>140</b> and <b>144</b> of &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT &#x26; WILLIAM&#x201d;. This saves additional time to the user if it is desired to provide the salutation <b>108</b> as addressing both the first and second recipients <b>72</b> and <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Depending upon the data stored in the memory <b>44</b>, the variant component <b>120</b> of the output might additionally include, for example, a first friendly name <b>148</b> of &#x201c;Ziggy&#x201d; and/or a second friendly name <b>152</b> &#x201c;Bill&#x201d;, with the first and second friendly names <b>148</b> and <b>152</b> corresponding with the first and second names <b>140</b> and <b>144</b>, respectively. Such a friendly variant <b>132</b> would provide an additional alternative in entering the salutation <b>108</b>. The disambiguation routine has provided as additional variants <b>132</b> the variant <b>132</b> &#x201c;Z&#x201d; and the variant &#x201c;X&#x201d; as lower priority variants <b>132</b>, and these may be provided for use in the event that the user has desired to enter a word beginning with either &#x201c;Z&#x201d; or &#x201c;X&#x201d; without intending to enter the first name <b>140</b>. In the present example, the first name <b>140</b> is provided as the default output <b>124</b> since the single keystroke by the user is most likely to have been intended as beginning the input of the first name <b>140</b>, which would be a likely entry as a part of the salutation <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">A further aspect of the invention is depicted generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> the user has accepted the first name <b>140</b> &#x201c;ZIGLEVEIT&#x201d; and has continued to enter additional text in the language input field <b>96</b>. In accordance with the invention, the disambiguation routine or other routine has caused certain language objects to be stored in the memory <b>44</b> and to be made available to the user at a relatively high priority to facilitate entry of the text.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">More specifically, many of the words in the original message <b>52</b> have been stored as language objects in a second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> in the memory <b>44</b>. Such second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> may have been generated, for example, upon detection of the aforementioned replying input or a forwarding input with respect to the original message <b>52</b>. Alternatively, if prior messages <b>52</b> in the same message thread as the original message <b>52</b> and the new message <b>64</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> had been replied to and/or forwarded by the user, for instance, the second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> associated with that message thread may have been generated at the time of such replying to and/or forwarding. Other variations will be apparent.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In one embodiment of the invention, the memory <b>44</b> may include a plurality of second temporary dictionaries <b>92</b>, each being associated with a corresponding message <b>52</b> and/or message thread. The disambiguation routine could identify such second temporary dictionaries <b>92</b> through the use of a lookup table <b>88</b> that might include, for instance, a table of first entries that are associated with messages <b>52</b> and/or message threads, and corresponding second entries having pointers to locations in the memory <b>44</b> where the appropriate second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> is located. In another embodiment, the memory <b>44</b> may include only a single second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> that is created upon replying to or forwarding message <b>52</b>, with the stored language objects thereof being replaced with other language objects contained in another message <b>52</b> upon replying to or forwarding of the another message <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In the present exemplary embodiment of the handheld electronic device <b>4</b>, upon detecting a replying or forwarding input with respect to one of the messages <b>52</b>, the disambiguation routine determines from the lookup table <b>88</b> whether or not a second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> has already been generated for the particular message <b>52</b> and/or the related message thread, if any. In this regard, the first entries in the lookup table <b>88</b> with which the messages <b>52</b> are associated may, for example, include the subject <b>60</b> of the message <b>52</b> or may be in the form of a hash of the subject <b>60</b> of the message <b>52</b>. A message thread including the message <b>52</b> could thus be identified so long as the subject <b>60</b> has not been changed. Other methods of identifying a given message <b>52</b> and/or message thread will be apparent.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">If no corresponding second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> has yet been created for the given message <b>52</b>, the disambiguation routine or other routine could generate the second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> by storing at a particular location in the memory <b>44</b> language objects corresponding with some or all of the words in the message <b>52</b>. Such language objects could be associated with a relatively high frequency value, either by having corresponding frequency objects stored in the memory <b>44</b>, by assigning to all language objects in the second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> a relatively high frequency value, or in other apparent fashions. Once a corresponding second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> has already been created for the message <b>52</b> and/or for the corresponding message thread, the respective second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> can be interrogated by the disambiguation routine in seeking to identify language objects stored therein that correspond with an ambiguous input into the handheld electronic device <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">That is, a user may enter an ambiguous input in the form of a number of keystrokes of the keys <b>28</b>. If any of the keys <b>28</b> has a plurality of letters <b>30</b> or other linguistic elements assigned thereto, the input will be ambiguous. With each successive keystroke, the disambiguation routine may interrogate the generic word list <b>48</b> for corresponding language objects and associated frequency objects, and will also seek to identify language objects stored in the corresponding second temporary dictionary <b>92</b>, along with seeking associated frequency values for such language objects in the second temporary dictionary <b>92</b>. The disambiguation routine potentially may also interrogate the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b> in seeking to identify additional language objects that correspond with the ambiguous input. The corresponding identified language objects from the generic word list <b>48</b> and the second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> (and first temporary dictionary <b>84</b>, if appropriate) are then output in order of frequency value.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">An example of the benefits provided by the second temporary dictionaries <b>92</b> is indicated generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. It can be seen that the original message <b>52</b> included, among other words, the word &#x201c;soir&#xe9;e&#x201d;. The word &#x201c;soir&#xe9;e&#x201d; may be stored in the generic word list <b>48</b> as a language object, and such language object may be associated with a relatively low frequency value, or it may not be present at all in the generic word list <b>48</b>. By storing in the second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> a language object corresponding with the word &#x201c;soir&#xe9;e&#x201d; and associating it with a relatively high frequency value, the language object corresponding with &#x201c;soir&#xe9;e&#x201d; can be readily provided to the user in entering the text of the new message <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In the example depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the user has begun typing the word &#x201c;soir&#xe9;e&#x201d; by entering an ambiguous input consisting of three keystrokes of keys <b>28</b>. Specifically, the user has actuated the keys <b>28</b> &#x201c;A S&#x201d;, &#x201c;O P&#x201d;, and &#x201c;U I&#x201d;. Other exemplary words in the generic word list <b>48</b> such as &#x201c;SPIN&#x201d; and &#x201c;APIECE&#x201d; also correspond with the aforementioned three-keystroke ambiguous input. In the generic word list <b>48</b>, the words &#x201c;SPIN&#x201d; and &#x201c;APIECE&#x201d; are likely to be associated with higher frequency values than any language object stored in the generic word list <b>48</b> corresponding with the word &#x201c;soir&#xe9;e&#x201d;. However, since the second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> associated with the new message <b>64</b> includes a language object corresponding with the word &#x201c;soir&#xe9;e&#x201d;, with such language object having associated therewith a relatively high frequency value, the default output <b>160</b> &#x201c;SOI&#x201d; corresponds with the word &#x201c;soir&#xe9;e&#x201d;, which is the word desired by the user. The output also includes a first variant output <b>164</b> &#x201c;SPI&#x201d; and a second variant output <b>168</b> &#x201c;API&#x201d; which might correspond with the otherwise relatively higher frequency words &#x201c;SPIN&#x201d; and &#x201c;APIECE&#x201d;, respectively. As such, providing the second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> reduces the number of keystrokes and/or the number of editing inputs and/or the amount of attention required of a user in entering the text in the new message <b>64</b>, which is advantageous.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">An exemplary flowchart in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref> depicts in general terms the method of the invention. The method of the invention can be said to begin with a detection of one of a replying input and a forwarding input, as at <b>204</b>, with respect to a first message, such as one of the messages <b>52</b>. Responsive to such detection, a second message is created, as at <b>208</b>, such as the new message <b>64</b>. In this regard, it is noted that the advantages of the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b> and its help in creating a salutation <b>108</b> can be provided with the generation of any message, i.e., even one that did not result from a replying or forwarding input with respect to an existing message, once the recipients <b>68</b> are added to the message, depending upon the configuration of the handheld electronic device <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Regardless of whether the additional message was created as a result of detecting a replying or forwarding input to an existing message, or if an original message was created, the disambiguation routine or other routine stores, as at <b>212</b>, the names of the recipients as found in, for example, a &#x201c;TO:&#x201d; field or a &#x201c;CC:&#x201d; field in the message in a first temporary dictionary <b>84</b>. The disambiguation routine or other routine may determine, as at <b>216</b>, whether a second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> has already been created for the message or message thread. Such a determination can be made by consulting the lookup table <b>88</b>. If a second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> has already been created for the message thread, its location in the memory <b>44</b> is determined as at <b>220</b>. If, however, no corresponding second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> has yet been created, such a second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> is created, as at <b>224</b>. Upon creating such second temporary dictionary <b>92</b>, the lookup table <b>88</b> is updated, as at <b>228</b>, with entries that correspond with, for example, the location in the memory <b>44</b> of the second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> and a corresponding subject of the e-mail thread or a hash thereof, for instance. Such an updating operation can be provided with different types of entries in the lookup table <b>88</b> without departing from the concept of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The processor apparatus <b>20</b> may detect, as at <b>232</b>, a text input that may be ambiguous. The disambiguation routine may then determine, as at <b>236</b>, whether or not the input is a portion of a salutation <b>108</b>. Such a determination can be made, as mentioned above, by determining the proximity of the text input location <b>128</b> to a salutatory expression <b>112</b>, the presence of the text input location <b>128</b> on a first line <b>104</b> of the language input field <b>96</b>, or in other fashions that will be apparent. If it is determined at <b>236</b> that the current input is a portion of a salutation <b>108</b>, the disambiguation routine then determines, as at <b>240</b>, whether the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b> includes a language object stored therein that corresponds with the input. If such a language object is identified, the disambiguation routine may retrieve, as at <b>244</b>, the entry and a corresponding frequency value. The disambiguation routine may also consult the generic word list <b>48</b>, as mentioned above, to identify other language objects and corresponding frequency values, as at <b>248</b>. The identified language objects from the first temporary dictionary <b>84</b> and the generic word list <b>48</b> may then be output, as at <b>252</b> in order of decreasing frequency value. It is noted that the names <b>140</b>, <b>144</b>, and the like are anticipated to be associated with relatively higher frequency values than any language objects stored in and obtained from the generic word list <b>48</b> and thus are expected to be output as the default output <b>124</b>. Processing then returns to <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">If at <b>236</b> it is determined that the input is not a part of a salutation <b>108</b>, processing may continues at <b>256</b> where it is determined whether the second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> that corresponds with the new message <b>64</b> has stored therein any language object that corresponds with the input. If yes, such corresponding language object or objects are obtained, as at <b>260</b>, from the second temporary dictionary <b>92</b>, along with any associated frequency value, which likely would be relatively high.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Regardless of whether any such language objects were identified in second temporary dictionary <b>92</b>, the disambiguation routine obtains from the generic word list <b>48</b>, as at <b>248</b>, any language objects that correspond with the input, along with associated frequency values. The disambiguation routine then outputs, as at <b>252</b>, at least a portion of the identified language objects, whether from the second temporary dictionary <b>92</b> or from the generic word list <b>48</b>, in order of decreasing frequency value. Processing thereafter continues at <b>232</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The improved handheld electronic device <b>4</b> and associated method in accordance with the invention provide facilitated input in appropriate situations including, for example and without limitation, in the situation of a salutation or in entering text when replying to or forwarding an e-mail message. This advantageously reduces the time, effort, and attention required of a user in using the handheld electronic device <b>4</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">While specific embodiments of the invention have been described in detail, it will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that various modifications and alternatives to those details could be developed in light of the overall teachings of the disclosure. Accordingly, the particular arrangements disclosed are meant to be illustrative only and not limiting as to the scope of the invention which is to be given the full breadth of the claims appended and any and all equivalents thereof.</p>
