<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Systems and methods for distributed antenna system reverse path summation using signal-to-noise ratio optimization are provided. In one embodiment, a method for reverse path summation for a distributed antenna system comprises: normalizing an uplink noise floor for a plurality of remote antenna units of a distributed antenna system, wherein the uplink noise floor is normalized based on a first remote antenna unit having a lowest noise floor of the plurality of remote antenna units; and scaling an uplink output gain of each of the plurality of remote antenna units by a scaling factor, wherein the scaling factor attenuates the uplink output gain based on a composite maximum host peak power for a host unit coupled to the plurality of remote antenna units.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application is a continuation application of U.S. application Ser. No. 12/814,896, filed on Jun. 14, 2010 (pending), and entitled &#x201c;SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR DISTRIBUTED ANTENNA SYSTEM REVERSE PATH SUMMATION USING SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO OPTIMIZATION,&#x201d; which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.</p>

<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Distributed antenna systems are used in simulcast applications such as cellular communications. Typically, a plurality of remote antenna units (RAUs) are coupled to a common host unit via a fiber optic network using, for example, a daisy chain, cascade, star, or hybrid configuration. In the downlink direction, simulcast operation is straightforward, as the host unit sends a digitized RF signal out to the RAUs and each RAU transmits the same RF signal. The host unit is therefore fully in control of the power and other transmission parameters for downlink simulcast operation. In the uplink direction, each RAU receives wireless RF signals. Uplink simulcast operation involves the summing of the digitized RF signals from each RAU so that the host unit receives a single composite signal. The goal is for the host unit to be able to process the single composite signal as if it were a signal received from a single antenna. However, the host unit does not have complete control of the power of the wireless RF signals being received at the RAUs. For example, the location of particular handset unit transmitting to an RAU will affect the power of the signal received at the RAU. Further, the RAU network topology will affect how signals from different RAUs are summed together affecting the relative gain of the digital RF signals received at the host unit. Schemes for normalizing the digital RF signal components within the composite signal received at the host become even more complicated when the RAU network comprises a non-homogenous set of RAU equipment such that signal-to-noise ratios, noise factors, and other parameters, are not uniform throughout the RAU network.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">For the reasons stated above and for other reasons stated below which will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the specification, there is a need in the art for improved systems and methods for reverse path signal summation for uplink simulcast systems.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The Embodiments of the present invention provide methods and systems for reverse path summation and will be understood by reading and studying the following specification.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one embodiment, a method for reverse path summation for a distributed antenna system comprises: normalizing an uplink noise floor for a plurality of remote antenna units of a distributed antenna system, wherein the uplink noise floor is normalized based on a first remote antenna unit having a lowest noise floor of the plurality of remote antenna units; and scaling an uplink output gain of each of the plurality of remote antenna units by a scaling factor, wherein the scaling factor attenuates the uplink output gain based on a composite maximum host peak power for a host unit coupled to the plurality of remote antenna units.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of specific illustrative embodiments in which the invention may be practiced. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and that logical, mechanical and electrical changes may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Embodiments of the present invention provide systems and methods for adjusting reverse path gains at remote antenna units for the optimization of dynamic range in any simulcast configuration. Embodiments of the present invention address the issue of providing optimal signal to noise ratio (SNR) summation for distributed antenna system remote antenna units in cascade, star, or other hybrid configurations, for any number of non-homogenous remote antenna units, with any given noise factor (NF) and gain. Further, as detailed below, by performing a digital attenuation of wireless RF signals, prior to their summation with other signals, embodiments of the present invention also provide for a lowered likelihood of digital overflow for properly provisioned real-work installation. Further, embodiments of the present invention maintain high SNR while equal-weigh balancing the SNR of each RAU individually, which benefits the performance of the composite uplink signal received at the host unit.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> illustrates at a simple star configuration of a 2 remote antenna unit (RAU) distributed antenna system (DAS) <b>100</b> of one embodiment of the present invention. DAS <b>100</b> comprises a first RAU <b>110</b> and a second RAU <b>115</b> coupled in a star configuration with a host unit <b>105</b>. DAS <b>100</b> is non-homogenous DAS in that RAU <b>110</b> and RAU <b>115</b> have differing performance characteristics from each other, as illustrated by the parameters in Table 1, below. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, RAU <b>110</b> comprises a &#x201c;Prism Remote&#x201d; RAU while RAU comprises a &#x201c;Spectrum HUB&#x201d; RAU, both manufactured by ADC Telecommunications, Inc. One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate that the selection of these two RAUs are arbitrary and for illustration purposes only, and that the scope of Embodiments of the present invention is not limited to DASs comprising only these particular makes of RAUs.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">For both the Prism RAU <b>110</b> and the Spectrum RAU <b>115</b>, the uplink gains are fixed at 30 dB. For the purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that overflow, caused when both RAUs <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> are operating near max power, is handled by truncation or clipping at the host unit <b>105</b>. For this example, the gain of the summed composite signal at the host unit <b>105</b> can be adjusted between 0 dB and 30 dB, but the individual gains of the RAUs <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> are not adjusted with respect to each other, before they are summed. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> illustrates the noise powers of a Prism RAU <b>110</b>, Spectrum RAU <b>115</b>, and a composite signal, generally at <b>101</b>. The noise power of the single Spectrum RAU <b>115</b> system is 12 dB higher than the Prism RAU <b>110</b>, and since the peak output power (also referred to herein as the composite maximum host peak power) at the host unit <b>110</b> is fixed at 0 dBm, the SNR is 12 dB lower for Spectrum RAU <b>115</b>. Furthermore, if the uplink signals from the two RAUs <b>110</b> and <b>115</b> are simply added, the overall dynamic range of the system is reduced to 126.7 dB as shown in column three of Table 1. In this scenario, the Spectrum RAU <b>115</b>'s portion of the simulcast dominates the total system dynamic range of the composite signal.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As opposed to simply adding the uplink signals from the two RAUs <b>110</b> and <b>115</b>, the DAS <b>100</b>'s total dynamic range can instead be preserved by normalizing the noise power of Spectrum RAU <b>115</b> to the noise power of the Prism RAU <b>110</b>, in this case, by subtracting 12 dB of gain (the difference in noise figure) from the Spectrum RAU <b>115</b> signal.

For this example, the composite SNR of the DAS <b>100</b> was improved from the 127 dB (using the straight summation illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> and Table 1) to 136.26 dB.
</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a flow chart illustrating the above method for providing optimal SNR summation. Applied to the DAS <b>100</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, this method preserves the individual SNR of both the Prism RAU <b>110</b> and the Spectrum RAU <b>115</b>, and normalizes the noise floor of the two RAUs such as to maximize SNR for the simulcast. The method begins at <b>210</b> with normalizing an uplink noise floor for a plurality of RAUs in the DAS to the noise power of the RAU with the lowest noise floor. That is, the noise power of the RAU with the lowest noise floor defines the noise floor normalization value. This process is discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>. The method proceeds to <b>220</b> with scaling an uplink output gain of each of the plurality of RAUs by a scaling factor, wherein the scaling factor attenuates the uplink output gain based on a composite maximum host peak power. The &#x201c;composite maximum host peak power&#x201d; or alternatively &#x201c;composite max peak host output power&#x201d; as those terms are defined for this disclosure, refer to the peak power that the host unit is designed to expect to receive from the composite uplink signal from the RAUs. For example, in the embodiments discussed above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A-1D</figref>, the host unit <b>105</b> is designed to handle a composite uplink signal having a maximum peak power of 0 dBm. The composite maximum host peak power for host unit <b>105</b> is therefore 0 dBm. The theoretical maximum power of the composite uplink signal after the normalization performed at <b>210</b> is 0.2653 dBm as indicated in Table 2. Accordingly, the scaling factor that would be applied at <b>220</b> is 0 dBm&#x2212;0.2653 dBm which is a scaling factor of &#x2212;0.2653. Applying this scaling factor to the normalized RAUs will ensure that the 0 dBm composite power of the host is not exceeded.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In one embodiment, the calculations for normalizing the uplink noise floor and for scaling the uplink output gains are calculated at the host unit and the results are pushed down to the RAUs via the DAS <b>100</b> network. The RAUs adjust the gain of the digital samples of the wireless RF signals they each receive prior to their summing into the composite, as discussed in more detail below. The actual gain adjustment performed by each RAU type will be different. For example, the Prism RAU <b>110</b> is adjusted by the scaling factor, but does not need to be normalized as it is already the RAU with the lowest noise floor. Therefore, the total gain adjustment performed at the Prism RAU <b>110</b> is an attenuation of 0.2653 dB, bringing the RAU <b>110</b>'s uplink gain from 30 dB to 29.734 dB. In contrast, the Spectrum RAU <b>115</b> is adjusted by the scaling factor, but also needs to be normalized. Therefore, the total gain adjustment performed at the Spectrum RAU is an attenuation of &#x2212;12 dB-0.2653 dB, bringing the RAU <b>115</b>'s uplink gain from 30 dB to 17.734 dB. Accordingly, in one embodiment, the host unit pushes to RAU <b>110</b> gain adjustment information to set the RAU <b>110</b>'s uplink gain to 29.734 dB, and different gain adjustment information to RAU <b>115</b> to set RAU <b>115</b>'s uplink gain to 17.734 dB.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The embodiment described with DAS <b>100</b> included only two RAUs. One distinct benefit of the embodiments of the present invention is that they can be utilized to calculate a scaling factor, as well as the individual performance parameters, for a DAS having any number of RAUs and for any simulcast topology, using the Equations <b>300</b> provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> with knowledge of the parameters defined in Table 4, below.</p>

<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As indicated in Table 8, the gain adjustments that will achieve optimal SNR summation for the uplink simulcast are a gain adjustment of 22.5431 dB at each RAU<b>1</b> type RAU, and a gain adjustment of 10.5431 dB at each RAU<b>2</b> type RAU for DAS <b>500</b>. That is, each of the Prism RAUs <b>510</b> will attenuate the wireless RF signal they receive by 7.4569 dB, prior to summing the digital RF samples with uplink signal received from the previous RAU in the cascade. Similarly, each of the Spectrum RAUs <b>515</b> will attenuate the wireless RF signal they receive by 19.4569 dB, prior to summing the digital RF samples with uplink signal received from the previous RAU in the cascade. Whether the previous RAU in the cascade is a Prism RAU or Spectrum RAU makes no difference to the summation process performed at each RAU because the RF signals digitized at each RAU are pre-scaled as dictated by their assigned gain adjustments prior to summation.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The embodiments described above for normalizing the uplink noise floor and for scaling the uplink output gains are applicable to a DAS having any simulcast topology that comprises two different types of RAUs having different operating parameter. Building on the Spectrum/Prism examples above, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> present a reverse summation method for a DAS having any number of different RAU types. This method also substantially preserves the dynamic range of the uplink simulcast.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The method begins at <b>610</b> with calculating an uplink noise floor for each RAU in the DAS. Assuming a maximum peak composite uplink signal at the host unit of 0 dBm, the uplink noise floor can be calculated for any remote &#x201c;N&#x201d; in the DAS using the equation:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Remote_UL_Noise_Floor<sub>&#x2014;</sub><i>N=&#x2212;</i>174<i>+XN+YN </i><?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
Wherein XN is the Remote Uplink Gain for remote &#x201c;N&#x201d;, and YN is the Remote Uplink Noise Factor for remote &#x201c;N&#x201d;.
</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The method proceeds to <b>620</b> with normalizing an uplink noise floor for each of the other RAUs to the RAU in the DAS having the lowest noise floor. The noise power of the RAU with the lowest noise floor establishes the noise floor normalization value. Assuming that Remote #<b>1</b> has the lowest noise floor, the uplink noise floor for all other remote antenna units will be normalized to Remote #<b>1</b>. For example, given that for Remote #<b>1</b>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Remote_UL_Noise_Floor<sub>&#x2014;</sub>1=&#x2212;174<i>+X</i>1<i>+Y</i>1<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>

</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The method proceeds to <b>630</b> with calculating a host max power contribution for each RAU and to <b>640</b> with summing the host max power contribution for each RAU.

</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The method proceeds to <b>650</b> with calculating a total gain adjustment to be applied to each RAU. The total gain adjustment to be applied to any remote &#x201c;N&#x201d; in the DAS can be calculated using the equation:

<br/>
where Max_Host_Pwr_dBm, the maximum peak composite uplink signal at the host unit, was defined as 0 dBm above.
</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In one embodiment of the method, the calculation discussed above for normalizing the uplink noise floor and for scaling the uplink output gains are calculated at the DAS host unit and the results are pushed down to the RAUs via the DAS network.

<p id="p-0047" num="0046">For the purpose of discussing embodiments of the present invention, the purpose of SeRF module <b>710</b> is to receive digital RF samples via incoming fiber <b>712</b> and sum those digital RF samples directly at the fiber level (using a summer <b>711</b>, for example) with the digital RF samples provided by the DART module <b>720</b>. The resulting sum is transmitted via outgoing fiber link <b>714</b>. Accordingly, for each RAU within the DAS, the corresponding SeRF module is adding the data from the RAU before it in the cascade to the digital RF samples produced by its own DART module. It is not necessary for the SeRF module <b>710</b> to have knowledge of the structure of the overall DAS. It just inputs from the fiber <b>712</b>, sums the digital RF samples from the fiber <b>712</b> with the digital RF samples from DART module <b>720</b>, and outputs the result via fiber <b>714</b>. For clarification, as the terms are used herein, &#x201c;adding&#x201d; and &#x201c;summing&#x201d; do not imply that the SeRF simply multiplexes the two streams of RF samples into a single stream. Instead, at summer <b>711</b>, the value of an RF sample received via the fiber <b>712</b> is added to the value of an RF sample received from the DART module <b>720</b> to produce a new &#x201c;summed&#x201d; RF data sample output. Such adding of the data signals can be performed when the digital RF samples from DART module <b>720</b> have the same sample rate as the digital RF samples from fiber <b>712</b>, to which they are being added.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In one embodiment, normalization and application of the scaling factor are performed digitally at the DART module <b>720</b> level, so there is no need for a physical attenuator within RAU <b>700</b>. In one embodiment, the attenuation is implemented via a multiplier directly in the signal path within the DART module <b>720</b>. Using either of the methods described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> or <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, gain adjustments that will achieve optimal SNR summation for the uplink simulcast are calculated at the host unit. The gain adjustment for RAU <b>700</b> is pushed by the host unit to RAU <b>700</b>, where it is stored within a register <b>722</b> of DART module <b>720</b> as a multiplier. As DART module <b>720</b> samples the wireless RF signals, it applies the multiplier stored in register <b>722</b> to the result before passing the result to SeRF module <b>710</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In alternate embodiment, the host units associated with the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> above include &#x201c;plug-and-play&#x201d; technology such that when a new RAU is added to the DAS, the host unit will detect the addition, obtain the information needed to calculate it's uplink noise floor, and recalculate the gain adjustments for each of the RAUs. Pushing out the new gain adjustment values for implementation can be performed automatically or initiated through a manual process by the network operator. Further, nothing in the methods described above prevents the network operator from overriding the gain adjustment calculated by the host unit for one or more of the RAUs by specifying a user defined attenuation for those one or more RAUs.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Although the optimal SNR summation methods described above provide a means for controlling the composite signal power at the host unit, digital overflow can still occur when data streams are added together, for example, by an RAU SeRF Module, or at the host unit. This is because the digital RF samples are representations of voltage values rather than power values. For example, returning to DAS <b>100</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, assume that both RAU <b>110</b> and RAU <b>115</b> are operating at max power for a particular band, and no dynamic range optimization is applied. Further assume that each RAU <b>110</b> and RAU <b>115</b> utilize a DART module that applies a 16-bit analog-to-digital conversion of the incoming wireless RF signal and that, the maximum code that will be output is 1.5 dB lower than the maximum possible output value of 2^16. The resulting maximum adjusted value would be 55140. Under the worst case scenario, a 55140 value is output from each DART module at the same time interval. These two values will be added at the host unit <b>105</b>, generating a 17-bit result of 110280. Because the digital-to-analog converter, which re-creates this digitized code, is a 16-bit device, the summation creates an overflow condition of 1 bit, which can only be handled by saturation to return the result back to 16 bits=65535. This operation clips the magnitude of the waveform, causing distortion, as well as an amplitude drop for overflow samples, in this case, of 4.5 dB.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In contrast, when SNR optimization is applied as described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1C and 1D</figref>, RAU <b>110</b> operates at a max power of &#x2212;0.265 dBm, or a max scale voltage code of 53479 out of its DART module. RAU <b>115</b> operates at a max power of &#x2212;12.365 dBm or a max scale voltage code of 13433. When these two code values are added at the host unit <b>105</b>, a 17-bit result of 66912 is generated, which is also handled by saturation to return the result back to 16 bits=65535. In this situation, the max amplitude is still saturated and clipped, but not as severely. Here only 0.18 dB of amplitude is clipped vs. the 4.5 dB found in the example without SNR optimization. One should note that this composite amplitude occurs only when both remote antenna units are at maximum power, and both samples are phased such that their voltages are at max code at the same sampling time interval. The probability of this occurring is extremely small, and it is not likely that this event will persist for very long.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">A further example is provided by considering an overflow condition of the dual-cascade network shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, with SNR optimization applied. Again assuming that each RAU in DAS <b>400</b> applies a 16-bit analog-to-digital conversion to incoming wireless RF signals, each Spectrum RAU <b>425</b> will have a max code of 4749, and each Prism RAU <b>415</b> will have a max code of 18908. The two cascades <b>410</b> and <b>420</b> add separately, and are summed together by the host unit <b>405</b>. For cascade <b>410</b>, the total code value of all 8 remote antenna units would be 8*18908, or 151264, if all remote antenna units were seeing a max code at the same time. This is a 7.24 dB overflow condition. For cascade <b>420</b>, we have 8*4749, or 37992. Cascade <b>420</b> does not exhibit overflow, but when the cascades <b>410</b> and <b>420</b> are added together, the output remains saturated at <b>16</b> total bits. This condition would only occur with all 16 remote antenna units at max code, which is not a real-world operating situation. Considering a worst-case real-world scenario of 2 Prism RAUs and 4 Spectrum RAUs at max scale, the host unit would see 2*18908+4*4749=56812. This is under the 65535 saturation limit, and therefore no clipping occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Because some RAUs in a DAS may be much more likely to see a full-scale input (for example, an RAU located within a building is likely closer to mobile units, as compared to an outdoor RAU, which would typically be located much further away from mobile units) a network operator may elect to overriding the gain adjustment calculated by the host unit by specifying a user defined attenuation for those RAUs.</p>
