The present invention may, however, be embodied in different forms and should not be construed as limited to the embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the present invention to those skilled in the art. Throughout the disclosure, like reference numerals refer to like parts throughout the various figures and embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a block diagram illustrating a portion of a semiconductor device in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the semiconductor device includes an internal information generation circuit <b>110</b>, an information multiplexing circuit <b>120</b>, and an information driving circuit <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The internal information generation circuit <b>110</b> generates internal information INF_INN. The internal information generation circuit <b>110</b> generates the internal information INF_INN in response to a command signal CMD for outputting the internal information INF_INN. The information multiplexing circuit <b>120</b> multiplexes the internal information INF_INN and other information INF_ETC. The information multiplexing circuit <b>120</b> outputs the internal information INF_INN or the other information INF_ETC in response to the command signal CMD. The other information INF_ETC means information that is different from the internal information INF_INN. Subsequently, the information driving circuit <b>130</b> drives an output pad <b>140</b> in response to an output signal of the information multiplexing circuit <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Hereinafter, the operation of the semiconductor device in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention is briefly described.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">First, in an operation mode using the internal information INF_INN, which is referred to as a first operation mode hereinafter, the internal information generation circuit <b>110</b> generates internal information INF_INN in response to a command signal CMD corresponding to the first operation mode. The internal information INF_INN means information specified in, for example, a specification. For example, the internal information INF_INN may be information related to Cyclic Redundancy Checks (CRC) or information related to a command/address parity. In other words, the internal information INF_INN may be information about an error detected in a signal transferred through a signal transfer line. Subsequently, the information multiplexing circuit <b>120</b> transfers the internal information INF_INN to the information driving circuit <b>130</b> in response to the command signal CMD, and the information driving circuit <b>130</b> outputs the internal information INF_INN to the output pad <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Subsequently, in an operation mode that is not the operation mode using the internal information INF_INN, which is referred to as a second operation mode hereinafter, the information multiplexing circuit <b>120</b> transfers other information INF_ETC to the information driving circuit <b>130</b> in response to a command signal CMD corresponding to the second operation mode, and the information driving circuit <b>130</b> outputs the other information INF_ETC to the output pad <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating the information driving circuit <b>130</b> of the semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with a first embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the information driving circuit <b>130</b> includes a PMOS transistor PM<b>1</b> and an NMOS transistor NM<b>1</b>. The PMOS transistor PM<b>1</b> has a source-drain path formed between a power source voltage VDD terminal and the output pad <b>140</b> in response to an output signal of the information multiplexing circuit <b>120</b>. The NMOS transistor NM<b>1</b> has a source-drain path between the output pad <b>140</b> and a ground voltage VSS terminal in response to an output signal of the information multiplexing circuit <b>120</b>. The PMOS transistor PM<b>1</b>, which is a pull-up driver, may receive only the other information INF_ETC, whereas the NMOS transistor NM<b>1</b>, which is a pull-down driver, may receive both of the other information INF_ETC and the internal information INF_INN.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Therefore, the semiconductor device in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention generates the internal information INF_INN of a logic high level in the first operation mode, and the NMOS transistor NM<b>1</b> pull-down drives the output pad <b>140</b> in response to the internal information INF_INN. Also, the PMOS transistor PM<b>1</b> and the NMOS transistor NM<b>1</b> pull-up or pull-down drives the output pad <b>140</b> in response to the other information INF_ETC during the second operation mode. Thus, the NMOS transistor NM<b>1</b> is enabled in the first operation mode, and both PMOS transistor PM<b>1</b> and NMOS transistor NM<b>1</b> are enabled in the second operation mode.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">As described above, the semiconductor device in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention may use the NMOS transistor NM<b>1</b> that outputs the internal information INF_INN as a driving circuit for outputting the other information INF_ETC other than the internal information INF_INN. This means that the utility efficiency of a driving circuit increases.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a circuit diagram illustrating the information driving unit <b>130</b> of the semiconductor device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. In the second embodiment, a case where the output pad <b>140</b> is precharged with a positive voltage applied from an external controller or an internal circuit is illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the information driving circuit <b>130</b> includes a PMOS transistor PM<b>2</b> and an NMOS transistor NM<b>2</b>. The PMOS transistor PM<b>2</b> pull-up drives and precharges the output pad <b>140</b> in response to a precharge control signal CTR_PRC. The NMOS transistor NM<b>2</b> pull-down drives the output pad <b>140</b> in response to internal information INF_INN.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Hereinafter, the circuit operation is described briefly. The NMOS transistor NM<b>2</b> pull-down drives the output pad <b>140</b> in response to the internal information INF_INN of a logic high level. The PMOS transistor PM<b>2</b> then pre-charges the output pad <b>140</b> in response to the precharge control signal CTR_PRC. The NMOS transistor NM<b>2</b> and the PMOS transistor PM<b>2</b> have different operation periods, respectively. For example, the precharge operation is performed before or after an operation using specified information.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As described above, the semiconductor device in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention may precharge the output pad <b>140</b> faster than semiconductor devices fabricated according to other technologies, which means that the timing point for performing another operation after the internal information INF_INN is outputted may arrive faster.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring back to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the output pad <b>140</b> is coupled with a data output unit <b>310</b>. The data output unit <b>310</b> is a circuit for outputting internal data DAT to an external device. The data output unit <b>310</b> performs a calibration operation on the output pad <b>140</b> in response to a calibration code COD_CAL. The driving circuit <b>130</b> including the PMOS transistor PM<b>2</b> and the NMOS transistor NM<b>2</b> in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention operates independently from the data output unit <b>310</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">As described above, the semiconductor device in accordance with the second embodiment of the present invention includes a driving circuit for outputting the internal information INF_INN specified by, for example, a specification, and the driving circuit may output the other information INF_ETC or perform a precharge operation.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to an embodiment of the present invention, a semiconductor device may output internal information specified by, for example, a specification to an external device and thereby maximize the efficiency of a driving circuit for outputting the internal information.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">While the present invention has been described with respect to the specific embodiments, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various changes and modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined in the following claims.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Meanwhile, although the embodiments of the present invention exemplarily illustrate a case where a driving circuit for outputting internal information INF_INN may output other information INF_ETC or perform a precharge operation, the technology of the present invention may be applied to perform a termination operation or other various operations other than the precharge operation or other information output operation.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The positions and kinds of the logic gates and transistors illustrated in the above embodiments may be realized differently according to the polarity of an input signal.</p>
