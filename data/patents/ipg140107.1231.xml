<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The degree of disability of people who use wheelchairs varies considerably. For some of those who use wheelchairs being able to leave the wheelchair to deal with body functions is a relatively simple matter. For others, it is impossible. This invention provides a solution to the need for people who are wheelchair bound to be able to perform certain body functions with a relative degree of simplicity.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In an embodiment, there is disclosed a wheelchair, comprising a frame supported on wheels, a removable seat supported by the frame, a receptacle supported by the frame under the removable seat, a lifting tower supported by the frame and a sling carried by the lifting tower; and the sling being operable by the lifting tower through a lifting range to move between positions in which a person carried in the sling is raised above the removable seat so that the removable seat may be removed and a person carried in the sling is lowered to be supported over the receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In various embodiments, there may be included any one or more of the following features: in the lowered position the person is supported by a toilet seat that is supported by the frame; the sling has at least a first supporting section and a second supporting section that are separated to be positionable respectively under the back and legs of the person; the sling is suspended from the lifting tower by cables; the lifting tower includes a part that extends upward above the frame of the wheelchair from the back of the frame; the lifting tower includes a lever arm that pivots on the part that extends upward above the frame, with a forward portion of the lever arm extending over the removable seat, and the sling being suspended from the forward portion of the lever arm; and a rearward portion of the lever arm is connected through a linear actuator to the frame. These and other aspects of the device are set out in the claims, which are incorporated here by reference.</p>

<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, a wheelchair <b>10</b> has major structural components forming a frame supported on wheels <b>12</b>. The frame has a back <b>14</b> and front <b>16</b>. The wheelchair frame itself is mostly conventional and the design of the frame will vary between manufacturers. In many instances, the frame will include legs <b>18</b> to which the wheels <b>12</b> are attached, a seat supporting cage <b>26</b> from which the legs <b>18</b> depend, back supports <b>24</b>, which extend upward from the rear of the seat supporting cage <b>26</b>, and arm rests <b>28</b>. A removable seat <b>30</b> is supported by the seat supporting cage <b>26</b>. Wheelchairs are known that include removable seats. Under the removable seat <b>30</b>, within the seat supporting cage <b>26</b>, is a receptacle <b>32</b> for body waste that is supported by structural members forming the seat supporting cage <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">A lifting tower <b>34</b> is supported by the frame. There are many ways to have a lifting tower supported by the frame. In an example shown, the lifting tower <b>34</b> includes a part <b>36</b> that extends upward above the frame of the wheelchair <b>10</b> from the back <b>14</b> of the frame, more specifically from posts <b>25</b> that may be secured to the back supports <b>24</b> in this example, and a lever arm <b>38</b> that pivots on the part <b>36</b>, with a forward portion <b>40</b> of the lever arm <b>38</b> extending over the removable seat <b>30</b>, and a sling <b>42</b> is suspended from the forward portion <b>40</b> of the lever arm <b>38</b>. Components of the lifting tower <b>34</b> may be made easily removable for example by using quick release connections.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The forward portion <b>40</b> of the lever arm <b>38</b> may include a cross-bar <b>43</b> to assist in lateral stabilization of the sling <b>42</b>. In this manner, the sling <b>42</b> is carried by the lifting tower <b>34</b>. In the embodiment shown, the sling <b>42</b> is suspended from the lifting tower <b>34</b> by straps <b>44</b> or other suitable suspension element. A rearward portion <b>46</b> of the lever arm <b>38</b> is connected through a linear actuator <b>48</b> to the frame, which in this example includes a plate <b>50</b> secured to the frame in any convenient manner to which the linear actuator <b>48</b> is attached. The plate <b>50</b> may be secured to the posts <b>25</b> and supported by support legs <b>29</b>, that connect to rearward extensions <b>19</b> of the frame of the wheelchair <b>10</b>. The linear actuator <b>48</b> may be any suitable linear actuator such as a pneumatic, hydraulic or electric linear actuator. The linear actuator <b>48</b> may be powered by a suitable motor <b>51</b> with control and power pack <b>53</b>, which may be placed in any suitable location on the wheelchair <b>10</b> such as at the back <b>14</b> or one side of the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For use during lifting of a person, stabilizer bars <b>27</b> may be secured to a suitable part of the frame such as rearward extensions <b>19</b> of the legs <b>18</b>. When stabilizer bars are used on the rear of the wheelchair frame, it is preferable that the brakes for the wheelchair be on the front wheels.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref>, <b>7</b> and <b>7</b>A, by actuation of the linear actuator <b>48</b>, the lever arm <b>38</b> may be made to pivot on the part <b>36</b> and raise and lower the sling <b>42</b> between positions A (raised), B (intermediate position) and C (fully lowered). In the intermediate position B shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the person is sitting in the sling <b>42</b> but supported by the seat <b>30</b>. This is the initial position. The sling <b>42</b> is thus operable by the lifting tower <b>34</b> through a lifting range to move between position A in which a person carried in the sling <b>42</b> is lifted above the removable seat <b>30</b> so that the removable seat <b>30</b> may be removed and position C in which a person carried in the sling <b>42</b> is supported over the receptacle <b>32</b>. The position C may also correspond to a position in which the person is supported by a toilet seat <b>33</b> mounted on a support plate <b>35</b> over the receptacle <b>32</b>. The support plate <b>35</b> may rest on and be secured to the cage <b>26</b>, and may replace the conventional support such as a sling formerly used to hold up the removable seat <b>30</b>. The receptacle <b>32</b> may be attached directly to the support plate <b>35</b>. Modifications may be made to the removable seat <b>30</b> to make it more comfortable, such as by adding more support to the seat. Various slings may be used for the sling <b>42</b>. In one embodiment, a sling <b>42</b> is used that has at least a first supporting section <b>45</b> and a second supporting section <b>46</b> that are separated to be positionable respectively under the back and legs of the person.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a further embodiment of a lifting tower. In this example, lifting tower <b>80</b> comprises a hollow tube or track on which a chain or cable (not shown) travels. The lifting tower <b>80</b> in this instance is secured to the back <b>14</b> of the frame, for example to the back supports <b>24</b> and receptacle support cage <b>26</b>. A motor (not shown) drives the chain or cable to raise or lower a sling (not shown) between the positions A, B and C. Controls and power for the motor for any of the disclosed embodiments may be located in any suitable position such as under the seat, in front of, at the back of or beside the receptacle.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a further embodiment of a lifting tower. In this example, lifting tower <b>90</b> comprises a pair of posts <b>92</b> connected by a beam <b>94</b> across an upper portion of the posts <b>92</b>. A chain or cable <b>96</b> extends from a winch <b>98</b> secured to the back <b>14</b> of the frame. The winch <b>98</b> drives the chain or cable <b>96</b> to raise or lower a sling (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> shows a further embodiment of a lifting tower. In this example, lifting tower <b>100</b> comprises a pair of vertically standing actuators <b>102</b>, such as hydraulic rams, and a pair of converging arcuate beams <b>104</b> that converge to meet at a connection <b>106</b>. A sling (not shown) may be suspended from the connection <b>106</b> by any suitable means such as a chain or cable <b>108</b>. The chain or cable <b>108</b> may be fixed to the connection <b>106</b> in this example. The rams <b>102</b> forming the lifting tower <b>100</b> in this instance may be secured to the back <b>14</b> of the frame and the cage <b>26</b> or may be secured to the sides of the frame, between the back <b>14</b> and front <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In each of the examples of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8</figref>, <b>9</b> and <b>10</b>, lowering of the sling may be accomplished by a controlled descent under gravity, while raising of the sling is powered.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The lift or lifting tower shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-7</figref> works well, and accommodates a reclining chair, by angling of the back arms to allow the chair to continue to be reclined to 45 degrees. The lift itself does not use or depend on any recline. For safety reasons, the lift should not be used in a reclining position and in the case of a reclining chair it is recommend to use a locking mechanism in place to prevent this.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The toilet seat <b>33</b> is preferably concealed below the removable seat <b>30</b> or cushion, and fitted to the size of the person expected to use the wheelchair <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The receptacle <b>32</b> functions as a commode pot or bedpan. The size and shape of the receptacle is dictated by the structure of the cage <b>26</b>, which varies from wheelchair to wheelchair. For example, the receptacle <b>32</b> may need to be shaped to accommodate cross-struts of a collapsible wheelchair.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The lifting sling may have a variety of designs. The design shown is a known sling for lifting a person that provides good upper back support. However, the leg slings do interfere somewhat with clothing adjustment for changing and toileting purposes when the individual is in the lift position. Therefore it is preferable to use under the knee supports attached directly to an upper part of the lifting tower (such as the lifting arm) and that moves in concert with the rest of the sling. Other options may be used for making the sling more accessible for dressing and undressing. For example, the second, under the knee part, piece of the sling might need to be fastened by two straps on either leg (back and front) to the sling belt to act as a counter weight and keep the belt from sliding into the rib cage.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The lifting tower <b>34</b> may be retrofitted to an existing wheelchair as disclosed, or built into a new wheelchair. In the retrofit case, the supports of the lifting tower <b>34</b> may be separate posts <b>25</b> as shown that are secured to the back supports <b>24</b> of the wheelchair by any suitable means. The lifting tower <b>34</b> should be rated for the intended use for example lifting up to 240 lbs. The particular wheelchair shown is an Invacare 9000xt wheelchair, but any suitable wheelchair may be used. Depending on the design of the wheelchair, the following general but detailed procedure may be carried out:</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Preparation:</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Facing the user, apply brakes.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Place sling around the user.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Walk to the rear of the chair, install stabilizer bars (if being used).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Install lifting tower, sling and actuator if not already installed, and check and correct any hazards, for example loose connections, sharp edges or components being in the way of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Lifting and Commode Use:</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Begin lifting the user. Once the user is raised high enough above the seat, remove the seat.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Lower the user on to toilet seat by operating the actuator with its control system.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Once the user has finished, raise the user to height below maximum to ensure there is still room to raise the user when the seat is replaced.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Remove an armrest if better access is needed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Remove waste receptacle out, for example by sliding, and place on floor/ground.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Finish cleaning process, wipe down seat and plate if needed.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Replace seat, possibly raising the user higher than before, and secure seat to chair, if required, for example using Velcro straps.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Lower the user onto seat, remove sling, remove or move any components of the lifting tower that might be in the way.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Secure the user with seat back rest straps, if required by that user.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Remove and store any lifting tower components in the opposite order they were placed, if required.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Empty, clean and replace receptacle</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Remove stabilizer bars (if being used)</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Release brakes</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Parts may be stored in a bag or on the chair at the discretion of the operator.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Parts should be cleaned and disinfected on a daily basis. Lifting tower, actuator, control box and batteries should receive weekly cleanings using a gentle antibiotic solution, unless otherwise needed.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The control should be provided with an emergency stop button. Depressing the button should only cause the actuator to stop moving but will not lower the user back to her seat.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Depending on the design of the wheelchair, there may be a high risk of the user lurching during regular use of the chair and frame. In such situations, it may be desirable not to leave the user alone in the wheelchair, there should be no sharp exposed edges that the user might press against, and in some situations, stabilizer bars may need to be in place when using the frame.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">Depending on the design of the sling, it may be necessary to ensure that the seat is easily replaced after cleaning, and that the user is not raised to the maximum height in case she might slip through the sling. When ready to replace the seat, raise the user to near or at the maximum height and slide seat in. This procedure may need some experimentation before figuring out the optimum heights.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Other features that might be desirable: Use foam covers on sharp components of the lifting tower. Make cloth wrappings for foam covers to permanently hold them in place. Place hooks on chair to carry lifting frame when not in use. Make an insulating cover for the linear actuator, control box and battery to protect them from cold. Keep sling straps as short as possible. Stitch Velcro disks into seat.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows a further embodiment of a wheelchair <b>10</b> having a back <b>14</b> and front <b>16</b>. The wheelchair frame itself is mostly conventional and the design of the frame will vary between manufacturers. In many instances, the frame will include legs <b>18</b> to which the wheels <b>12</b> are attached, a seat supporting cage <b>26</b> from which the legs <b>18</b> depend, back supports <b>24</b>, which extend upward from the rear of the seat supporting cage <b>26</b>, and arm rests <b>28</b>. The lifting tower <b>34</b> includes a sliding mechanism <b>128</b> that extends upward along the back <b>14</b> of the frame of the wheelchair <b>10</b> from the back <b>14</b> of the frame, more specifically from posts <b>25</b> that may be secured to the back supports <b>24</b> in this example. A removable seat is supported by the seat supporting cage <b>26</b>. A suitable motor <b>51</b> supplies power to the linear actuator <b>128</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> shows the lifting tower <b>120</b>, comprising a slide mechanism <b>126</b> and a linear actuator <b>128</b>. In a preferred embodiment, the slide mechanism <b>126</b> may be separate from the linear actuator <b>128</b>. The slide mechanism <b>126</b> supports paired hooks <b>124</b> which may be deployed forward to form a support from which a sling (not shown) may be suspended. In a preferred embodiment, the lifting tower <b>120</b> does not extend above the traveling configuration of the frame, allowing ease of storage and transportation of the wheelchair <b>10</b>. The traveling configuration of the frame includes the parts of the frame that are not readily removable. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the headrest is not a removable part of the frame. In this example wheelchair <b>10</b> is in standard configuration as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 and 13</figref>, the lifting tower <b>120</b> is positioned at or below the height of the wheel chair frame. A crossbar <b>130</b> is shown connecting the linear actuator <b>128</b> to sliding mechanism <b>126</b> to allow the linear actuator <b>128</b> to act upon the slide mechanism <b>126</b>. Headrest <b>122</b> is attached, for example by a horizontal support <b>123</b>, to a vertical support of the frame such as post <b>25</b> allowing the headrest <b>122</b> to be removed by rotating the headrest about a vertical axis.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In a preferred embodiment, under the removable seat <b>30</b> within the seat supporting cage <b>26</b> is a receptacle <b>32</b> for body waste which comprises a bowl <b>134</b> and a removable drawer <b>136</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> the drawer <b>136</b> is deployed rearward for emptying. When the drawer <b>136</b> is deployed rearward for emptying, the bowl <b>134</b> may be accessible from the rear of the wheelchair <b>10</b>, allowing the bowl <b>134</b> to be removed from the drawer and emptied.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-20</figref>, a lifting procedure is shown. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> shows the wheelchair <b>10</b> with the headrest <b>122</b> rotated out of the path of the hooks <b>124</b>.
