<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a novel Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal hydroxide having a laminated structure and a method for synthesis thereof, and more particularly, to a Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal hydroxide.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">With development of advanced synthetic chemical technologies, polymer materials are broadly used in medical products including textiles and other various commonly used products such as a flame-retardant agent, etc. However, among polymer materials commercially available in the art, in particular, polyolefin resin, halogenated resin and polyimide resin are unstable with respect to heat or light and, in a case where they are molten through heating or used at a high temperature during a molding process, thermal degradation or quality deterioration may be caused. Due to this, a final product may encounter disadvantages such as coloring problems, modification of characteristics, deterioration in mechanical properties, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Accordingly, in order to endow heat resistant stability to the resin formed product, heavy metal fatty acids such as Pb, Cd, etc., Sn materials and/or Ba materials have been used alone or in combination with two or more thereof. However, since the toxicity of such a stabilizer has recently become a social and/or environmental problem, Sn-based and Ca&#x2014;Zn based stabilizing agents are being intensively developed. However, such stabilizing agents also entail problems, for example, toxicity problems. In order to improve the above problems, some have proposed techniques using a composite metal hydroxide such as Mg&#x2014;Al hydrotalcite, Li&#x2014;Al hydrotalcite, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Hydrotalcite is a natural mineral discovered in 1842 and was reproduced by synthesis in a laboratory by Feiknecht in 1930 which is 100 years after a general structure thereof was disclosed. A layered composite metal hydroxide, known as a layered double hydroxide (LDH) or layered mixture metal hydroxide, including an anionic layer, is a two-dimensional layered structure enabling a charge balance by using anions, which are exchangeable with a positively charged ionic layer including two kinds of cations, wherein the anionic layer and can be exchanged with a variety of organic/inorganic ions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such a layered composite metal hydroxide is commercially synthesized with a high purity and applied to a wide range of applications, for example, an environmental pollution remover, a catalyst inactivating agent, an acid scavenger, an acid adsorbent, a flame retardant, a flame-retardant assistant, a heat-resistant stability enhancer for polymers, an acid-neutralizing agent, a UV ray protector, a heat preservation agent, and so forth.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Preparation of the layered composite metal hydroxide may be generally classified into co-precipitation using an aqueous metal salt and hydrothermal synthesis using a poor water-soluble metal hydrate to conduct synthesis at a high temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">U.S. Pat. No. 3,879,523 discloses a method for synthesis of a layered composite metal hydroxide having a hydrotalcite structure by using a variety of mixed metal components and anion providing materials, which is a process to synthesize the above material through co-precipitation using a water soluble metal salt, thus requiring excess washing water in a reaction process and causing a problem of generating by-products in large quantities.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Meanwhile, U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,026 discloses a method for synthesis of a hydrotalcite type catalyst, which includes: adding a solution containing a bivalent metal inorganic salt such as magnesium nitrate and a trivalent metal inorganic salt such as aluminum nitrate mixed together to another solution containing sodium hydroxide and sodium carbonate, as an anion providing material, combined in a stoichiometric ratio thereof; reacting the mixture to synthesize a hydrotalcite slurry; thereafter, filtering and washing the slurry, and heating and drying the same at a temperature of about 300 to 600&#xb0; C. The method described in the above US patent has a problem of consuming a considerable amount of heat during processing.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Alternatively, U.S. Pat. No. 4,904,457 discloses a method for synthesis of hydrotalcite at a high yield of 75% or more, which includes: heating a magnesium compound such as magnesium carbonate or magnesium hydroxide at a high temperature to activate the same; and reacting the activated magnesium in a solution containing hydroxyl group ions as well as an aluminum salt and a carbonate salt in a pH range of more than 13. However, the process proposed in the above US Patent not only consumes excess energy but also requires a reaction under an alkaline compound condition, thus causing a significant decrease in a thermal stability efficiency of the finally produced hydrotalcite.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Meanwhile, Korean Patent Laid-Open No. 2001-0108920 discloses a method for synthesis of a layered composite metal hydroxide in a hydrotalcite form, which includes: dispersing a crystalline metal hydroxide mixture in water; mixing the dispersion with a water-soluble metal hydroxide mixture, an interlayer anion providing material and a solution containing alkali-metal hydroxide; thereafter, synthesizing a hydrotalcite type layered composite hydroxide under high temperature/high pressure conditions. Although the above Korean published Patent describes that using advantages/disadvantage of both co-precipitation and hydrothermal synthesis can control physical/chemical properties of the layered composite metal hydroxide after final production thereof, a water-soluble metal hydroxide in excess is used and causes by-products in large quantities and a reaction at a high pH, thus causing disadvantages such as water pollution and requirement of excessive washing.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Alternatively, Korean Patent Laid-Open No. 2000-0049194 discloses a method for synthesis of a composite metal hydroxide containing lithium metal as a stabilizer for a halogen-containing resin. However, since three different metals as well as lithium as an expensive metal are used, economical effects are decreased.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In addition, when a Mg&#x2014;Al laminated structure includes other impurities, crystallinity is generally reduced to cause a deterioration in performance (see Microporous and Mesoporous Materials 111 (2008) pp. 12-17).</p>

<p id="p-0036" num="0035">More particularly, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the inventive method of preparing the Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal hydroxide may include: (a1) mixing a magnesium salt source and a titanium salt source with a solvent to synthesize a mixed solution; (a2) subjecting the mixed solution to ultrasonic processing; (a3) mixing an aluminum salt source with a pH regulator and heating the same to synthesize a solution containing the aluminum salt dissolved therein; (a4) adding an anion solution to the solution in heated state of step (a3) to synthesize a solution mixture; (a5) adding the solution of step (a2) to the solution in heated state of step (a4) to synthesize a solution mixture; (a6) reacting the solution of step (a5) under high temperature/high pressure conditions; (a7) filtering and washing a slurry resulting from step (a6) to remove the solvent, dispersing the slurry in water, and adding an anionic solution thereto, in order to conduct a reaction; (a8) filtering and washing the resultant product of step (a7) to remove the solvent and conducting surface treatment thereof; and (a9) repeatedly filtering and washing the above solution to remove the solvent and drying a resultant product to provide Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal hydroxide particles having a laminated structure and being represented by Formula 1.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">After the solution, containing a magnesium salt and a titanium salt in relative ratios of metal elements comprised in desired Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal hydroxide particles, is subjected to ultrasonic processing, the processed solution is mixed with a solution mixture including an aluminum salt, a pH regulator and an anionic solution, and then reacted at a temperature of 150 to 220&#xb0; C. and a pressure of 5 to 15 kg&#xb7;f/cm<sup>2</sup>, that is, under high temperature/high pressure conditions, for 1 to 8 hours to synthesize Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal hydroxide particles, followed by filtering, washing, surface treating and drying the particles, thereby giving a Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal hydroxide powder.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Hereinafter, synthesis of the Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal hydroxide according to the present invention will be described in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Ultrasonic Processing of Magnesium Salt/titanium Salt Mixed Solution</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">After mixing the magnesium salt with the titanium salt, the mixture is subjected to ultrasonic processing. This is an important means in synthesizing Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal hydroxide particles. When ultrasonic irradiation is applied to a liquid, ultrasonic cavitation occurs. Such ultrasonic cavitation is substantially associated with formation, growth and implosive collapse of bubbles. Also, the ultrasonic cavitation may lead to different physical and/or chemical influences such as a high temperature (&#x3e;5000 K), a high pressure (&#x3e;20 MPa), a rapid cooling rate (&#x3e;1010 Ks<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), and the like. Therefore, it may provide specific environments in which a chemical reaction is executed under very extreme conditions. For the ultrasonic processing, it is preferable to establish an ultrasonic frequency in a range of 10 to 50 kHz, a power in a range of 100 to 1500 W, and a temperature of not more than 100&#xb0; C. In addition, a time for the ultrasonic processing may range from 1 to 10 hours, and preferably, 2 to 4 hours. If the ultrasonic processing is conducted for less than 1 hour, irregular ultrasonic cavitation may occur. On the other hand, when the time for the ultrasonic processing exceeds 10 hours, magnesium and titanium hydroxides are respectively generated to cause an agglomeration of particles and, in turn, a rapid increase in a size of the particles. Accordingly, in order to uniformly generate and align the particles, the ultrasonic processing is preferably conducted for 1 to 10 hours.</p>

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The titanium salt referred herein may include at least one selected from, for example, titanium(IV) n-butoxide, titanium tetrachloride, titanium(IV) ethoxide, titanium(IV) isopropoxide, titanium(IV) sulfate, titanium(IV) propoxide or titanium hydroxide, which are used alone or in combination with two or more thereof, but not be limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The solvent for synthesizing a solution mixture may be used without water or may be an alcohol-based organic solvent which has a high boiling point thus is desirably used without a loss of solution, even in a reaction at a high temperature. Such an alcohol-based organic solvent may include bivalent, trivalent or polyvalent aliphatic alcohols, for example, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, isobutanol, 3-methyl-3-methoxy butanol, tridecyl alcohol, pentanol, ethyleneglycol, polyethyleneglycol, dipropyleneglycol, hexyleneglycol, butyleneglycol, sucrose, sorbitol, glycerin, and so forth.</p>

The acidic solution is preferably nitric acid or hydrochloric acid, while the alkaline solution may include, for example, ammonia water, sodium hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, etc. The pH regulator may be the acidic solution, the alkaline solution, or a mixture of the acidic solution and the alkaline solution, wherein the acidic solution and the alkaline solution may be used alone or in combination with two kinds or more thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The interlayer anionic material is an anionic component to form both upper and lower faces between a mixed metal component in the Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite particle represented by Formula 1 below, and may include, for example, F<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, Cl<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, Br<sup>&#x2212;</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>, CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, HPO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, HPO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, PO<sub>3</sub><sup>3&#x2212;</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>, H<sub>2</sub>BO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>, SiO<sub>3</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, HSi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub><sup>&#x2212;</sup>, Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub><sup>2&#x2212;</sup>, or the like.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">High Temperature/High Pressure Reaction</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">To a solution mixture of an aluminum salt, a pH regulator and an anionic solution, a mixed solution of magnesium/titanium is added, followed by proceeding a reaction at a temperature of 120 to 250&#xb0; C. at a pressure of 2 to 20 kg&#xb7;f/cm<sup>2</sup>, for 1 to 24 hours. Preferably, the reaction is conducted for 2 to 8 hours. If the reaction temperature is less than 120&#xb0; C. and the pressure is less than 2 kg&#xb7;f/cm<sup>2</sup>, Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal hydroxide particles is slowly proceeded to thus increase a reaction time. On the other hand, when the reaction temperature is more than 250&#xb0; C. and the pressure is more than 20 kg&#xb7;f/cm<sup>2</sup>, Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal hydroxide particles have reduced particle size and become micro-particles, hence causing agglomeration of particles and requiring high-cost equipment for mass production of products.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Filtering, Washing and Surface Treatment</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">After the high temperature/high pressure reaction, the product is filtered and washed to remove the solvent, re-dispersed in water, followed by surface treatment and drying the product.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The surface treatment is a process to inhibit deterioration of Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal hydroxide particles themselves by halogen, which occurs during processing when the Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal particles are used in a polymer, and to improve dispersibility of the particles, and the surface treatment is executed at 60 to 130&#xb0; C. for 1 to 4 hours.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In order to mix raw materials, 1.5 kg of water was put into a reactor, 4 moles of magnesium chloride and 0.1 mole of titanium tetrachloride were added to the reactor, and the mixture was stirred for 20 minutes and subjected to ultrasonic processing at 40&#xb0; C. for 1 hour, followed by natural cooling. Next, after adding 2 moles of aluminum hydroxide and 5.5 moles of sodium hydroxide to 1.0 kg of water, the mixture was heated and dissolved and mixed with 1.5 moles of sodium carbonate to prepare a solution mixture. A magnesium/titanium solution was added to the prepared solution mixture and this prepared product was subjected to a reaction at high temperature/high pressure for 4 hours while maintaining a temperature of 170&#xb0; C. and a pressure of 6.5 kg&#xb7;f/cm<sup>2</sup>. After completing the reaction, filtering and washing were repeated and a resultant slurry thereof was dispersed in 3.0 kg of water to form a material at 90&#xb0; C. Then, after agitating the formed material with sodium silicate No. 3 (0.1 mole of SiO<sub>2</sub>) placed around the material for 2 hours, filtering and washing were repeated, The resultant product was separated and re-dispersed in 3.0 kg of water, followed by surface treatment using sodium stearate at 95&#xb0; C. After completing the surface treatment, the treated product was filtered and washed further one time with a small amount of water. After filtering the same again, the product was dried at a temperature of not more than 150&#xb0; C., thereby providing synthesized Mg&#x2014;Ti&#x2014;Al composite metal hydroxide particles having a laminated structure.</p>
