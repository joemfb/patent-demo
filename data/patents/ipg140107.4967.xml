A power source <b>36</b>, such as a battery is attached to the power terminals of the chip <b>18</b>; in alternate embodiments a diode <b>38</b> is placed in the circuit <b>16</b> between the power source <b>36</b> and the chip <b>18</b> to prevent unintentional supply of power having the wrong polarity.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Additionally, the circuit <b>16</b> may be vulnerable to generating false alerts from static interference picked up by the antenna <b>26</b>. Therefore, to prevent false starts, a filter <b>40</b> is preferably placed across the terminals of the LED's <b>22</b>, DC motor <b>34</b> and speaker <b>24</b>. In the preferred embodiment, the filter <b>40</b> is configured to absorb brief pulses of energy to the LED's <b>22</b>, DC motor <b>34</b> and/or speaker <b>24</b>, thereby preventing the device <b>10</b> from illuminating in response to interference picked up by the antenna <b>26</b>. When a more sustained RF signal, perhaps from a mobile communication product that the device <b>10</b> is paired with, is picked up by the antenna, the filter <b>40</b> passes the resulting energy pulse from the chip <b>18</b>, causing the LED's <b>22</b> to illuminate, the DC motor <b>34</b> to vibrate and the speaker <b>24</b> to emit an audible sound.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order for an individual user to configure the filter <b>40</b>, a resistor <b>42</b> should be selected based on the current and voltage required to illuminate the LED's <b>22</b>, DC motor <b>34</b> and speaker <b>24</b> in comparison to the current and voltage supplied by the chip <b>18</b>. It may be advantageous to select a resistor <b>42</b> having as much resistance as possible, without noticeably impeding illumination of the LED's <b>22</b>, functions of the DC motor <b>34</b> and/or the audible tones from the speaker <b>24</b>. For example, a resistor value in the range of about one hundred &#x3a9; may be suitable for many applications. Furthermore, a capacitor <b>44</b> should be selected based on the value of the resistor <b>42</b> and the desired filtering frequency. It may be advantageous to select a value for the capacitor <b>44</b> that is as small as possible, while still effectively filtering out pulses having a frequency less than the desired filtering threshold. One of ordinary skill may select suitable values for resistor <b>42</b> and capacitor <b>44</b>, based on the factors described above.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> illustrates a cross-sectional view of the device <b>10</b>, and displaying the interior components of the housing <b>14</b>. As seen from the figure, and described below, the housing <b>14</b> contains the LED's <b>22</b>, the integrated circuit <b>16</b> and chip <b>18</b>, along with the speaker <b>24</b>, DC motor <b>34</b> and power source <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate alternate embodiments of the instant invention, wherein the housing <b>14</b> of the device <b>10</b> is designed as a watch or a bracelet, thereby allowing individuals to utilize the design of their choice.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the preferred method of operating the device <b>10</b>, comprising the device <b>10</b> and a second remotely located device <b>12</b>, each device <b>10</b> and <b>12</b> being wirelessly connected to a corresponding cellular phone where said cellular phones can additionally transmit and receive signals over a wireless carrier's network. When the first user activates the device <b>10</b>, the signal is sent to the corresponding cellular phone. The signal is then transmitted over the cellular phone's wireless network and is received by a second cellular phone, which then relays the signal to the second remotely located device <b>12</b>. Upon detection of the signal, the second device <b>12</b> responds with any combination comprising illumination, vibration, and emission of sound. Alternatively, users may connect paired devices with other Bluetooth-enabled wireless devices, such as PDA's. In this way, long-range signals can be successfully sent when paired devices are located outside of Bluetooth range. In either embodiment, the second user is notified in real time that the first user is thinking about him or her.</p>

However, it is to be expressly understood that such modifications and adaptations are within the spirit and scope of the instant invention, as set forth in the following claims.</p>
