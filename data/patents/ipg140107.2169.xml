<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 to PCT/ES2008/070045 filed Mar. 12, 2008, which claims the benefit of Patent Application 200700644 filed Mar. 12, 2007 in Spain. The entire disclosures of both applications are incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">STATE OF THE ART</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The possibility of expressing and selecting antibody molecules in bacteria, especially in <i>Escherichia coli </i>and its bacteriophages, has attracted the attention of biotechnology in recent decades and has enormously increased the biotechnological potential of antibodies for their use in diagnosis and therapy processes against various diseases, such as cancer or autoimmune diseases. The antibodies known as recombinant, produced in bacteria using genetic engineering techniques, are small fragments derived from the complete antibody molecules (e.g. IgGs) that retain the capacity to bind with the antigen. These antibody fragments preserve at least one of the variable domains (V) of immunoglobulins (Igs), where the antigen binding site resides, and can also include constant domain(s) (C) where other antibody functions reside (e.g. activation of the complement). Thus, although there are various formats of recombinant antibodies, they all have as a minimum common unit a V domain capable of antigen binding. In this way, on the basis of structural criteria, recombinant antibodies can be classified into at least three basic types: domain antibodies, (dAbs; if they only contain a V domain), single chain (Fv, scFv; if they contain the V domains of the heavy -VH- and light -VL- chains connected by means of a small flexible peptide) and Fab fragments (antigen binding fragment, Fab) formed by two polypeptide chains, one containing the domains VH-CH1 and the other domains VL-CL. Subsequently, through combinations of two, three or four (or more) of these basic units, whether dAbs, scFvs, or Fabs, diabodies, triabodies or tetrabodies can be obtained, which can provide molecules with more affinity (avidity) for the antigen due to having repetitive binding sites. Moreover, if different C domains are added to these molecules, a variety of recombinant antibody molecules, known collectively as minibodies, can be obtained. As previously stated, the different formats of recombinant antibodies contain at least one V domain capable of binding to a specific antigen.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The described dAb domain antibodies retain the capacity to bind to an antigen and include V domains derived from both &#x201c;standard&#x201d; natural antibodies (with heavy and light chains, such as those found in humans, mice, or rabbits) as well as natural antibodies with heavy chains only (or heavy chain antibodies), such as those produced by the family of camelids (e.g. camels, llamas and vicunas) or the IgNAR domains of shark species (e.g. nurse sharks). Hence, dAbs can include V domains of light chains (VL) or V domains of heavy chains (VH), whether of standard antibodies or heavy chain only antibodies (VHH, heavy chain only VH). Beneficial characteristics of dAb recombinant antibodies include their small size, low immunogenicity and rejection in humans, their ease of expression in bacteria and yeasts at high concentrations, and their biochemical properties of stability against denaturalizing agents and solubility.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Systems for injecting proteins from bacteria into eukaryotic cells, such as type III protein secretion systems (T3SS) can be used to deliver such dAb. T3SS are able to inject into the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell specific bacterial proteins. The natural proteins injected by T3SS systems, also known as effector proteins, are usually toxins that alter the metabolism of the eukaryotic cell. T3SSs are complex systems and comprise more than 20 different proteins that configure a molecular superstructure known as a needle complex or insectivore, which pierces the internal and external membranes of Gram negative bacteria forming a needle-shaped structure specialized in the secretion and injection of proteins. EPEC and EHEC strains the protein EscF, the protein EscC&#x2014;which forms a hydrophilic channel in the external bacterial membrane&#x2014;and the protein EscN, which is an essential ATPase for the secretion process located at the base of the needle. Other structural components of the EPEC and EHEC needle are the products of genes escR escS escT escU escD escJ escV and sepQ, among others. In addition to the needle complex, the injection of proteins into the eukaryotic cell via the T3SS system requires a group of proteins known as translocators which form a channel in the plasmatic membrane of the eukaryotic cell. These translocator proteins tend to be secreted by the T3SS themselves. In EPEC and EHEC strains, the translocator proteins are EspB and EspD. Also, in the T3SS of EPEC and EHEC, the protein EspA (also translocated by the T3SS) forms a filament that extends beyond the needle (EscF) to the translocation pore formed by EspB/D.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">T3SS components are assembled sequentially; thus the first to assemble are the rings found in the internal and external membranes of the bacteria (EscV and EscC, internal and external respectively), between these two proteins a third one acts as a bridge (EscJ), in such a way that the protein that crosses the system has no contact with the periplasmic space. Then the needle proteins are assembled (EscF), the filaments of EspA and, finally, the translocator proteins EspD and EspB.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">T3SS have been used to generate live vaccines based on attenuated bacterial strains. Thus, different antigens have been injected (bacterial, viral or tumoral) from attenuated bacterial strains (derived from <i>Salmonella enterica </i>or <i>Yersinia enterocolitica</i>) to induce an immune response in the host against the injected antigen/s. For example, attenuated strains of <i>Salmonella enterica </i>have been used for the injection of the Gag antigen of the HIV-1 virus or the tumoral antigen NY-ESO-1.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The EPEC and EHEC strains used in exemplary embodiments described herein are enteropathogens that develop an infection through a strong binding to the cells of the intestinal epithelium (enterocytes) known as the attaching and effacing A/E lesion. The capacity to bind intimately to the plasmatic membrane of the enterocytes is mediated by a bacterial adhesive called Intimin (eaeA), located in the bacteria's external membrane, which interacts with a receptor known as Tir (translocated intimin receptor) located in the plasmatic membrane of the epithelial cell and that the bacteria itself injects through the T3SS. The Intimin-Tir bonds facilitate the T3SS task of injecting effectors of the EPEC and EHEC strains towards the cytoplasm of the epithelial cell.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In EPEC and EHEC strains the genes that encode the structural components of the needle, the translocation pore, the intimin (eaeA) and Tir proteins, as well as most of the T3SS, are located in a genetic locus known as LEE (locus of enterocyte effacement) of 35 kb.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">T3SS machinery recognizes signals present in the sequence of the effector proteins, or in the mRNAs encoding them, which are generically referred to as type III signal sequences (SS). These SS are only well-defined and empirically characterized in some of the T3SS effector proteins. In general, the SS tend to be located near the N-terminal end of the effector proteins, and are constituted of the first 15-30 amino acids of the effector protein, or of the first 15-30 codons of its mRNA. As a general rule, the SS do not demonstrate a consensus or identifiable motive. T3SS SS are not proteolysed following secretion, as occurs with other protein export signal sequences. In addition to the SS, some effector proteins depend on their interaction with specific T3SS chaperones for their secretion, known as class I chaperones. Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that although an effector protein can depend on a class I chaperone for its secretion by the T3SS, the secretion of specific fusion proteins of the N-terminal SS of 15-30 amino acids with heterologous proteins (&#x3b2;-lactamase) does not depend on these chaperones. In natural effector proteins, the binding domains of class I chaperones are located immediately behind the N-terminal SS and are usually regions of approximately 50-100 amino acids. There are another two classes of T3SS chaperones (II and III) according to structural homologies, which take part in the stabilization and secretion of the different secreted proteins. Class II chaperones take part in the stabilization of translocator proteins (e.g. CesD is the chaperone of EspB and EspD in EPEC and EHEC). Class III chaperones take part in the secretion of some structural components of the needle (e.g. In EHEC and EPEC, CesA is the chaperone of EspA).</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The system for injecting proteins into eukaryotic cells&#x2014;type III secretion systems (T3SS)&#x2014;present in pathogenic strains of <i>E. coli </i>and other Gram negative microorganisms (e.g. <i>Salmonella enterica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, etc.) described herein is surprisingly capable of efficiently secreting into the extracellular medium or of injecting active recombinant antibodies (capable of recognizing and binding to their antigen), in one embodiment dAbs and, in another embodiment V<sub>HH</sub>, into the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell (in one embodiment human cells), and in particular embodiments the T3SS of EPEC and EHEC strains. This secretion or injection effect is achieved by fusion or linking of the antibodies with the secretion signal sequence that recognizes the secretion system (SS) of type III (T3SS: EspF<sub>20</sub>, SEQ ID NO: 6), which does not prevent said antibodies from being functionally active once secreted (Example 1) or injected (Example 2). Using as a model enteropathogenic strains of <i>E. coli </i>carriers of these T3SS injection systems and dAbs from camel antibodies modified to contain the signal recognized by the bacterial injection machinery, it has been verified that the antibodies can be injected in active form into the cytoplasm of human cells HeLa and that they are capable of binding with an intracellular antigen present therein (Example 2). Also, this injection of functional antibodies from bacteria into a eukaryotic cell can be carried out without the transfer of any genetic material (DNA or RNA) as in the case of infection with modified viruses or through DNA or RNA transfer using physical or chemical methods.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As the system for injecting proteins from the bacteria into the eukaryotic cell, type III protein secretion systems were used (T3SS) and in this particular case the T3SS present in enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC) strains of <i>E. coli</i>. In this particular case the recombinant antibodies with the smallest known size (approx. 15 kDa) and formed by single V domain (domain antibodies dAb) were used. More specifically, the dAb recombinant antibodies selected as models are two V<sub>HH </sub>clones with reactivity to the green fluorescent protein GFP antigens (Vgfp clone) and a pig pancreatic enzyme &#x3b1;-amylase (Vamy clone), previously isolated by phage display and coming from gene libraries obtained from camels immunized with said antigens.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Thus, for the purpose of studying the possibilities of secretion and/or injection of the recombinant antibodies (domain, dAb) using the T3SS (of EPEC/EHEC) it was decided to fuse or link these antibodies to the SS sequences of the T3SS developing a gene construct. A well-characterized T3SS SS was used, which corresponds to the 20 N-terminal amino acids of the effector protein (EspF<sub>20</sub>, SEQ ID NO: 6), present in a preserved manner in the EspF proteins of both EPEC and EHEC strains of <i>E. coli</i>. This SS had been identified through fusions of EspF to &#x3b2;-lactamase.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Therefore, one exemplary embodiment disclosed herein includes a microorganism with a type III protein injection system (T3SS) useful for the extracellular secretion or injection of functionally active antibodies into eukaryotic cells, hereinafter microorganism T3SS, which presents a T3SS-Ab gene construct that comprises at least one DNA sequence containing the sequence encoding the secretion signal region (SS) recognized by the T3SS system bound, fused or linked to a DNA sequence containing the sequence encoding an antibody and that allows the expression of said functionally active fusion antibody (in one embodiment in its cytoplasm) and its secretion or injection outside.</p>

This definition includes any modification of the recombinant antibodies such as their multimerization or fusion to any molecule (e.g. toxins, enzymes, antigens, other antibody fragments, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The functionally active antibody can be obtained from a human being or an animal (without limitation, camels, llamas, vicu&#xf1;as, mice, rats, rabbits, horses, nurse sharks, etc.) or through recombinant DNA techniques or the chemical synthesis of genes, or through the in vitro or in vivo selection of antibody gene libraries, using any strain of <i>Escherichia coli</i>, pathogenic or non-pathogenic, or any other strain or bacterial species containing a T3SS of any origin and using any recognized signal said T3SS to any eukaryotic cell.</p>

<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The DNA sequence encoding a type III secretion signal (SS) used in the T3SS-Ab gene construct can be constituted by the DNA sequence encoding the secretion signal sequence (SS) of <i>E. coli </i>or a fragment of said sequence, or an analogous DNA sequence, or a sequence of nucleotides encoding a variant, natural or artificial of SS or a fragment of same that comprises the abovementioned minimum domain to be recognized and secreted/injected by the T3SS machinery. As previously discussed, the SS are usually located near the N-terminal end of the effector proteins, and consist of the first 15-30 amino acids of the effector protein, or the first 15-30 codons of its mRNA.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In the sense used in this description, the term &#x201c;analogous&#x201d; seeks to include any sequence of nucleotides that can be isolated or constructed based on the DNA sequences disclosed herein, for example, through the introduction of conservative or non-conservative replacements of nucleotides, including the insertion of one or more nucleotides, the addition of one or more nucleotides to any end of the molecule or the deletion of one or more nucleotides from any end or inside the sequence, and encoding a peptide or protein with similar activity to the original, in other words a type III secretion signal (SS).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In general, an analogous DNA sequence is substantially homologous to the sequence of nucleotides described above.

Therefore, another exemplary embodiment disclosed herein includes any DNA sequence encoding a peptide or peptidic sequence that allows the isolation or detection of the T3SS fusion antibody, for example, by way of illustration and without limiting the scope of exemplary embodiments disclosed herein, a sequence of polyhistidine (6&#xd7;His), a peptidic sequence recognizable by a monoclonal antibody (for example, E-tag for its identification, or any other that serves to purify the resulting fusion protein through immunoaffinity chromatography: label peptides such as c-myc, HA, FLAG) (Using antibodies: a laboratory manual.

In this case, the T3SS-Ab gene construct can include a DNA sequence encoding a sequence of amino acids capable of being split specifically by enzymatic or chemical means. In a particular embodiment said sequence comprises a sequence of nucleotides encoding a protease cleavage recognition site, for example, an enterokinase, Arg-C endoprotease, Glu-C endoprotease, Lys-C endoprotease, coagulation factor Xa and such like. In another particular embodiment, said DNA sequence comprises a DNA sequence encoding a site that can be split specifically by a chemical reagent such as, for example, cyanogen bromide which splits residues of methionine or any other suitable chemical reagent.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Secretion of the Functionally Active Fusion Antibody (EspF-V<sub>HH</sub>) into the Extracellular Medium is Dependent on T3SS</heading>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Two plasmids, called pEspFVamy and pEspFVgfp, were constructed derived from vector pSA10 with fusions encoding the first 20 N-terminal amino acids EspF (EspF<sub>20</sub>), which are the type III secretion signal of this effector (SEQ ID NO: 6), and the camel bodies V<sub>HH </sub>anti-amylase (Vamy) and anti-GFP (Vgfp) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>; SEQ ID NO: 1 to 4). Also, epitopes 6&#xd7;his and E-tag were included on the C-terminal end of these fusions in order to facilitate immunodetection and purification of the proteins (SEQ ID NO: 2 and SEQ ID NO: 4, respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Plasmids pEspFVamy and pEspFVgfp were used to transform strains EPEC O127:H6 and EHEC O157:H7 (Table 1). The same strains were transformed with the empty vector pSA10, as a control. Bacteria from these strains containing these plasmids were grown in DMEM medium at 37&#xb0; C., which artificially activates the T3SS, and expression was induced of the fusions with IPTG (Isopropyl &#x3b2;-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside) during 3.5 hours (this time proved to be optimum in preliminary experiments with inductions lasting from 1 to 16 hours). Subsequently, the proteins present in the supernatants were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and by staining with Coomassie blue. The presence of protein bands of approx. 22-23 kDa (Kilodalton) was observed in the supernatants of the cultures, which could correspond to both V<sub>HH </sub>antibodies fused to the N-terminal signal EspF<sub>20 </sub>and the C-terminal epitopes 6&#xd7;his and E-tag (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, lanes 2 and 3; red arrows). These bands did not appear in the supernatants of the strains with the vector pSA10 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, lane 1), where other secreted proteins did appear (e.g. EspC/P, EspB, EspD, EspA).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">To demonstrate that the secretion of the fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>was produced by the T3SS, defective mutant strains were transformed in the T3SS, EHEC DescN::Km and EPEC DescF::Km, (see Garmendia (Cell Microbiol 6, 1167-1183 (2004)) and Wilson (Cell Microbiol 3, 753-762 (2001)) both of which are incorporated by reference for their teachings regarding the same) with the plasmids pSA10, pEspFVamy and pEspFVgfp. After induction with IPTG in conditions identical to those for the wild strain, the proteins present in the supernatants were analyzed and the absence of the proteins secreted by T3SS was observed (e.g. EspD, EspB, EspA) as well as of the fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>(<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, lanes 4 to 6). As a control, the secretion of the proteins EspC or EspP (secreted by the type V secretion system) was not affected by these mutation DescF or DescN (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In order to identify the secreted fusion antibodies EspF<sub>20</sub>-V<sub>HH </sub>unequivocally, advantage was taken of the fact that both contain on the C-terminal end an E epitope specifically recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) anti-E-tag. The proteins present in the supernatants of the abovementioned cultures, of wild EPEC and EHEC strains, as well as of their mutants &#x394;escN or &#x394;escF, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot developed with the mAb anti-E-tag conjugated to peroxide (POD) (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">It can be observed that in the supernatants of the wild strains of EPEC and EHEC both fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>are detected with the mAb anti-E-tag-POD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, lanes 2 and 3) whereas these proteins are not detected in the supernatants of the mutant strains &#x394;escN or &#x394;escF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, lanes 5 and 6). As a control, one can appreciate that these bands do not appear in the supernatants of the wild strains transformed with pSA10 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, lane 1). At the same time, upon analysis with SDS-PAGE and Western blot with anti-E-tag mAb-POD of the whole cell lysates of these cultures it was observed that both EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>fusions occurred intracellularly in both wild and mutant strains &#x394;escN or &#x394;escF (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>), and even an increase of intracellular accumulation can be appreciated in the mutants. These results indicate that the EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>fusion antibodies are only secreted into the extracellular medium in the presence of a functional T3SS.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">In order to discard the possibility that a higher cell lysis of the cultures that express the fusion proteins EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>in strains containing an active T3SS could explain the appearance of the antibodies in the extracellular medium, a lysis control was carried out, which detected the presence of the major cytoplasmic chaperone GroEL in the supernatants of the cultures. Through Western blot with mAb anti-GroEL-POD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) it was verified that GroEL was only detectable at very low levels in the supernatants of the cultures (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>). Moreover, the concentration of GroEL did not vary between the strains EPEC or EHEC wild and mutant &#x394;escN or &#x394;escF expressing the fusion proteins EspF-V<sub>HH</sub>, nor in relation to the levels found in these strains with the empty vector pSA10 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, lanes 1 and 4). The intracellular levels of GroEL are equally homogenous in all strains and irrespective of the plasmids that they contain (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>). Therefore, the expression of the EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>fusions does not induce a cell lysis that justifies its presence in supernatants of the wild EPEC or EHEC strains with an active T3SS.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In order to confirm that the fusions of antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>were secreted in a manner dependent on the EsP<sub>20 </sub>signal this sequence was eliminated from the plasmid pEspF-Vgfp constructing the derivative p&#x394;sVgfp with the sequence &#x394;sVgfp (SEQ ID NO: 7 and 8). Both plasmids were used to transform wild EPEC and EHEC strains and the proteins present in the supernatants of the cultures were analyzed following induction with IPTG. As one can observe from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the band corresponding to the antibody Vgfp can be detected in both staining with Coomassie (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>) and in Western blot with anti-E-tag-POD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>) in the supernatants of the EPEC and EHEC strains transformed with pEspF-Vgfp, but not in those transformed with p&#x394;sVgfp. The intracellular production of the protein without signal EspF was detected with anti-E-tag-POD in the whole cell lysates containing p&#x394;sVgfp (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>). Therefore, the sequence EspF<sub>20 </sub>is necessary for the secretion of the fusion proteins EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>in both EPEC and EHEC strains. Due to the identical behavior of EHEC and EPEC strains in the secretion of the fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>by the T3SS, the following experiments were carried out using EPEC strains unless otherwise indicated.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">To confirm that the fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>secreted into the medium were soluble and not associated to membrane vesicles or forming any type of protein aggregation, the supernatants of EPEC cultures containing fusion proteins EspF-Vamy and EspF-Vgfp were centrifuged at high speed (100,000&#xd7;g, 1 hour). After centrifugation, the proteins present in the supernatants (S) and the pellets (P) were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and Western blot with anti-E-tag-POD (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>). In these experiments, it was observed that almost the whole secreted protein corresponding to both EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>fusions was soluble after centrifugation, indicating that it was not aggregated nor did it form part of membrane vesicles.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The main characteristic of an antibody is its capacity to bind to an antigen in a specific manner. In order to check that this characteristic was retained in the secreted fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH</sub>, ELISA tests were carried out on the supernatants of the cultures of EPEC strains transformed with the plasmids pEspFVamy or pEspFVgfp. The tests used the supernatants obtained following induction and these were added to plates covered with the antigens of each of these fusion antibodies (&#x3b1;-amylase and GFP) as well as to a negative control antigen for both (BSA (Bovine serum alb&#xfa;mina)). Following several washes with PBS (Phosphate buffered saline), the binding of the fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>to the antigens was developed with the mAb anti-E-tag conjugated with peroxidase. As one can appreciate from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a specific binding was observed of each fusion antibody (EspF-Vamy and EspF-Vgfp) to its corresponding antigen (&#x3b1;-amylase and GFP) and in no case was reactivity of the fusions to other antigens observed (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Similar experiments were carried out with the EHEC strain and it was possible to verify this same result. Therefore, the binding of the fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>to the antigens confirmed that the antibodies secreted by the T3SS system of EPEC and EHEC were functionally active. In these experiments it was also observed that the supernatants containing the fusion antibody EspF-Vgfp produced always higher ELISA signals (to GFP) than those that contained EspF-Vamy (against &#x3b1;-amylase), despite the fact that the levels of both fusions in the supernatants were very similar (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). This is due to the different affinity of these antibodies for their antigens (see below).</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The placing on the C-terminal end of the epitope 6&#xd7;his offered the possibility of purifying the fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>in the supernatants by means of metal affinity resin chromatography (e.g. cobalt). Following this step of chromatography, both fusion antibodies were obtained with a purity of &#x3e;95% as developed by the analysis using SDS-PAGE and staining with Coomassie blue (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Next ELISA tests were carried out against GFP and &#x3b1;-amylase with different concentrations of the fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH</sub>, in order to obtain the binding curves of these antibodies to their corresponding antigens. As can be observed from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, characteristic curves were obtained of a specific binding of each antibody to its corresponding antigen, with the EspF-Vgfp fusion displaying more affinity than the EspF-Vamy fusion.</p>

<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Injection into Eukaryotic Cells of EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>Fusions with &#x3b2;-Lactamase</heading>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In order to obtain evidence of whether the fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>could be translocated with the T3SS from bacteria to the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell, initially a test was carried out based on the catalytic activity of the &#x3b2;-lactamase enzyme, absent from eukaryotic cells. It had been described that the &#x3b2;-lactamase enzyme, lacking its natural signal peptide, could be translocated from the cytoplasm of wild EPEC strains to the cytoplasm of the eukaryotic cell. To do so, the T3SS secretion signal (SS) was used, as EspF<sub>20</sub>, fused to the N-terminal end of &#x3b2;-lactamase. The translocated fusions (e.g. EspF<sub>20</sub>-&#x3b2;-lactamase) were easily detectable in the cytoplasm of the eukaryotic cell thanks to the use of a fluorescent substrate of &#x3b2;-lactamase (CCF2/AM; see materials and methods) which can be added to cells in culture and that passes from emitting green to blue if it is degraded by the enzyme.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">For these tests, the vector pCX340 was used, which encodes &#x3b2;-lactamase under the control of the promoter Ptrc inducible by IPTG (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>). Two derivatives of pCX340 were constructed wherein on the N-terminal end of the &#x3b2;-lactamase the EspF<sub>20</sub>-Vamy fusion was bound (pEspF-Vamy-bla: SEQ ID NO: 11 and 12) or the signal EspF<sub>20 </sub>(pEspF-bla: SEQ ID NO: 9 and 10) as a positive control.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">HeLa cells were infected with EPEC bacteria, wild and mutant &#x394;escF, transformed with each one of these three plasmids. After inducing with IPTG the expression of the fusion antibodies, the substrate CCF2/AM was added to check whether there was &#x3b2;-lactamase activity in the cytoplasm of the HeLa cells. Thus, it was possible to check through fluorescence microscopy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) that the HeLa cells infected with the wild EPEC bacteria and transformed with the plasmids pEspF-Vamy-bla or pEspF-bla emitted in blue (therefore, showed &#x3b2;-lactamase activity) whereas those infected with wild EPEC bacteria with the pCX340 vector, or with any of the plasmids in the case of the mutants &#x394;escF, emitted in green and therefore, had not translocated the fusion antibody with &#x3b2;-lactamase.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The expression of the fusion antibodies that contained &#x3b2;-lactamase in all the bacteria used was checked by Western blot with anti-&#x3b2;-lactamase antibodies (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>). Therefore, this experiment proved for the first time that an antibody V<sub>HH </sub>(e.g. the Vamy clone) could be translocated to the cytoplasm of a eukaryotic cell from wild EPEC strains using the T3SS.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Next, it was decided to investigate whether the fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>were capable of recognizing their specific antigen once injected into the cytoplasm of the eukaryotic cell. One way of obtaining evidence of the binding of an intracellular antigen to the fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>was to demonstrate the co localization of the antigen and the fusion antibody in the cytoplasm of the eukaryotic cell by means of fluorescence and confocal microscopy. It was possible to use the fusion antibodies EspF-Vgfp in order to check whether they were capable of binding to the protein GFP expressed heterologously in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Since the intention was to be able to detect the colocalization of the antigen and antibody, the anchoring of the GFP to a specific point of the cell was first required. To do this fusions of GFP were used to the protein GGA2, a clathrin receptor located on the cytoplasmic face of the membranes of the Golgi apparatus<sup>39</sup>. To detect the fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>indirect immunofluorescence was used with the mAb anti-E-tag and a secondary anti-mouse IgG antibody marked with Alexa-594, a fluorophore that emits in red and whose fluorescence is clearly distinguishable from the green emission of the GFP. As a negative control the fusion antibody EspF-Vamy was used, which does not bind to the GFP antigen.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Therefore, the HeLa cells were transfected in culture with a plasmid that expresses the fusion protein GGA2-GFP and subsequently these cultures were infected with EPEC bacteria that expressed the fusion antibodies EspFVgfp or EspFVamy. The HeLa cells were fixed and processed for fluorescence microscopy after staining with the antibodies anti-E-tag and anti-mouse IgG-Alexa-594. As can be observed from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, it was possible to verify that only in the case of the cells infected with the EPEC strain expressing the fusion antibody EspF-Vgfp could a clear colocalization of the antibody be observed (red; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) with the fusion protein GGA2-GFP (green; <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>) which specifically marked a region of membranes near the nucleus and that corresponded to the Golgi apparatus. Meanwhile, in the HeLa cells infected with the bacteria expressing the fusion antibody EspF-Vamy only a vague fluorescence could be observed with the anti-E-tag antibody (red) and that did not co-localize with the position of the fusion protein GGA2-GFP (green). The vague fluorescence in red detected with anti-E-tag in cells infected with EPEC/pEspFVamy was clearly superior to the signal detected in non-infected cells (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>). Also, thanks to the presence in the cultures of non-transfected HeLA cells, and which therefore did not express the fusion protein, it was possible to verify that the localization of the fusion antibody EspF-Vgfp in the Golgi only occurred if the cell expressed the fusion protein GGA2-GFP, meaning that there was no binding of the fusion antibody EspF-Vgfp to the Golgi membranes in the absence of GGA2-GFP.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">It was possible to verify these results through confocal microscopy (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) guaranteeing the colocalization of the fluorescence signals of the GFP and EspF-Vgfp. In these images, as well as the signals of the fusions EspF-Vgfp (red) and GGA2-GFP (green), a specific EPEC stain was included, with a polyclonal rabbit antibody anti-int280<sub>EPEC</sub>, which marks the intimin protein present on the surface of bacteria, and as secondary a conjugate anti-IgG rabbit-Alexa 647 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>; blue signal).</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Finally, in order to obtain unequivocal evidence of the direct interaction between the fusion antibody EspF-Vgfp and the antigen GGA2-GFP experiments of co-immunoprecipitation were carried out with the mAb anti-E-tag. To this effect clarified cell lysates were obtained (without nuclei or bacteria) from HeLa cells expressing the fusion protein GGA2-GFP and infected with EPEC/pEspFVgfp or EPEC/pEspFVamy (as in the previous experiment; see Materials and Methods). As an additional control, a cell lysate was obtained of a HeLa cell culture non-transfected with the fusion protein GGA2-GFP (NT) and infected with EPEC/pEspFVgfp. These protein extracts were incubated with mAb anti-E-tag joined covalently to a Sepharose resin with protein G. The resin was recovered through gentle centrifuging, it was washed to eliminate proteins not bound by the anti-E-tag antibody and the proteins immunoprecipitated (IP) by the mAb anti-E-tag were eluted with an acid pH (0.1 M glycine; pH 2.5). The presence of the fusion antibodies EspF-Vgfp and EspF-Vamy and the fusion protein in the result of the immunoprecipitation was analyzed using Western blots developed with mAb anti-E-tag or anti-GFP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">As can be seen, the fusion antibodies EspF-Vgfp and EspF-Vamy are found in the protein IP (immunoprecipitation) with anti-E-tag at similar levels (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>). However, fusion protein GGA2-GFP only co-immunoprecipitated with the fusion antibody EspF-Vgfp (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16A</figref>, lane 1) and not with the fusion antibody EspF-Vamy (lane 2). The presence of the proteins in the cell lysates that were used was developed using Western blots with anti-E-tag or anti-GFP (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16B</figref>). An anti-&#x3b2;-tubulin antibody was used as internal control of the load in the lysates. Therefore, the experiments of antigen-antibody co-immunoprecipitation, together with those of colocalization in vivo, demonstrate that the fusion antibodies EspF-V<sub>HH </sub>injected by the EPEC T3SS are functional inside a eukaryotic cell and are capable of recognizing their antigen.</p>

<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The bacterial strains used in this study are described in Table 1. The bacteria were grown at 37&#xb0; C. with aeration in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium or in Dubelcco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), supplemented with ampicillin (150 &#x3bc;g ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>) or tetracycline (10 &#x3bc;g ml<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>), when necessary for the selection of plasmids (see Chaprentier (J Bacteriol 186, 5486-5495 (2004)) and Garmendia (Cell Microbiol 6, 1167-1183 (2004)) which are incorporated by reference herein for their teachings regarding the same). To induce the strains inoculants were placed in LB with the appropriate antibiotic and they were allowed to grow during one night, and the following day 1:50 was diluted in DMEM and they were left growing at 37&#xb0; C. with agitation up to DO<sub>600</sub>=0.5, at this point a concentration of 0.1 mM of isopropyl &#x3b2;-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added and they were left inducing during another 4 hours in the same growth conditions (see Chaprentier (J Bacteriol 186, 5486-5495 (2004)) and Garmendia (Cell Microbiol 6, 1167-1183 (2004)) which are incorporated by reference herein for their teachings regarding the same).</p>
<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Plasmids</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">The plasmids used in this work are summarized in Table 1. The construction details of the most relevant plasmids in this work are described below. Standard DNA manipulation and amplification techniques were used. The plasmid pespFVamy (Table 1) is a derivative of pSA10 (see Schlosser-Silverman (J Bacteriol 182, 5225-5230 (2000)) which is incorporated by reference herein for its teachings regarding the same), a vector that contains a multiple cloning site under the control of the promoter Ptac. In this site a fragment of 549 pb was cloned that encoded the V<sub>HH </sub>anti-amylase (Vamy) fused to the type III secretion signal of 20 amino acids of espF and marked with a sequence of 6 histidines and one E epitope on end 3&#x2032;. This fragment was amplified by fusion PCR (polymerase chain reaction) of two different fragments. One of them, the EspF secretion signal, was amplified from the genomic DNA of the strain EDL933stx using the primers R1-Xb-SD-EspF and SfiI-espF (Table 2) giving rise to a fragment of 119 pb. The other fragment used in the fusion, of 517 pb (pair bases), is the one corresponding to Vamy with the epitopes 6&#xd7;his and E on end 3&#x2032;, which was amplified from the plasmid pEHLYA4SD-Vamy (Table 1) using the primers SfiI-Vamy and R1-Stop-E (Table 2). Both fragments were fused by PCR using oligos R1-Xb-SD-EspF and R1-Stop-E (Table 2) for the amplification. The final product of the fusion (of 560 pb) was digested by EcoRI and inserted in the same restriction site of the pSA10 choosing the orientation that situated the gene under the control of the promoter Ptac.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The plasmid pespFVgfp was obtained by replacing through SfiI-NotI digestion, the segment encoding Vamy of the plasmid pespFVamy with the segment encoding Vgfp. The Vgfp segment was obtained from the plasmid pcAbGFP4 (transferred by Dr. Serge Muyldermans, VIB, Brussels) through PCR with the primers Vhh-sfil2 and Vhh-NotI2 (Table 2). The amplified fragment was digested with SfiI and NotI and a digested fragment of 358 pb was linked with T4 ligase to the vector skeleton pespFVamy without the Vamy fragment (&#x2dc;4.3 kb).</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">The plasmids pEspF-bla and pEspF-Vamy-bla are derivatives of pCX340 (see Charpentier (J Bacteriol 186, 5486-5495 (2004)) incorporated by reference herein for its teachings regarding the same), a vector used for carrying out fusions to &#x3b2;-lactamase TEM (blaM) without signal peptide (Table 1). The first, pEspF-bla, contains the N-terminal signal of EspF (SS) fused to the &#x3b2;-lactamase. The SS of EspF was amplified from the genomic DNA of EDL933stx with the oligonucleotides NdeI-espF and EcoRI-espF (Table 2) giving rise to a fragment of 83 pb. At the same time, the segment encoding the &#x3b2;-lactamase from pCX340 was amplified with the primers EcoRI-TEM and BamHI-Tetra (Table 2), which gave rise to a fragment of 1.2 kb. These fragments were fused by PCR giving rise to a fragment of 1.3 kb which, following digestion with NdeI and BamHI, was linked to the skeleton of the vector pCX340 previously digested with NdeI and BamHI. In the plasmid pCX340 the hybrid EspF<sub>20</sub>-Vamy was inserted, which was amplified by PCR of the plasmid pEspF-Vamy (Table 1) using the primers NdeI-espF and EcoRI-Vamy-espF (Table 2) and subsequently digested with NdeI and EcoRI and linked to the skeleton of the vector pCX340, also digested by these enzymes.</p>

The samples of the supernatants were prepared for electrophoresis in two ways. In one of them 1 ml of supernatant was precipitated with TCA (trichloroacetic; 10% p/v final) during one hour in ice, the precipitated proteins were recovered through centrifugation (14000 g, 15 min), the pellets obtained were washed in cold acetone (&#x2212;20&#xb0; C.) and centrifuged again (14000 g, 15 min) and the resulting pellet was resuspended in 40 &#x3bc;l of TrisHCl 250 mM (pH 7.5), SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) 2%, and then 40 &#x3bc;l of SDS-PAGE 2&#xd7; buffer was added.

The proteins present in the acrylamide gels were stained in blue with Coomassie or were used in Western blot for detection with specific antibodies, for which they were transferred to a PVDF membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) using semi-dry transfer equipment (Bio-Rad) and the standard protocols. For immunodetection of the proteins with epitope E, the membranes were incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with anti-E-tag mAb-conjugated with peroxidase (POD) (1:5000) (GE Amersham Biosciences). The GroEL protein of <i>E. coli </i>was detected with an anti-GroEL-POD conjugated antibody (1:5000) (Sigma).

<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing quantities of ingredients, properties such as molecular weight, reaction conditions, and so forth used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term &#x201c;about.&#x201d; Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the specification and attached claims are approximations that may vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by the present invention. At the very least, and not as an attempt to limit the application of the doctrine of equivalents to the scope of the claims, each numerical parameter should at least be construed in light of the number of reported significant digits and by applying ordinary rounding techniques. Notwithstanding that the numerical ranges and parameters setting forth the broad scope of the invention are approximations, the numerical values set forth in the specific examples are reported as precisely as possible. Any numerical value, however, inherently contains certain errors necessarily resulting from the standard deviation found in their respective testing measurements.</p>

Recitation of ranges of values herein is merely intended to serve as a shorthand method of referring individually to each separate value falling within the range. Unless otherwise indicated herein, each individual value is incorporated into the specification as if it were individually recited herein. All methods described herein can be performed in any suitable order unless otherwise indicated herein or otherwise clearly contradicted by context. The use of any and all examples, or exemplary language (e.g., &#x201c;such as&#x201d;) provided herein is intended merely to better illuminate the invention and does not pose a limitation on the scope of the invention otherwise claimed. No language in the specification should be construed as indicating any non-claimed element essential to the practice of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Groupings of alternative elements or embodiments of the invention disclosed herein are not to be construed as limitations. Each group member may be referred to and claimed individually or in any combination with other members of the group or other elements found herein. It is anticipated that one or more members of a group may be included in, or deleted from, a group for reasons of convenience and/or patentability. When any such inclusion or deletion occurs, the specification is deemed to contain the group as modified thus fulfilling the written description of all Markush groups used in the appended claims.</p>
