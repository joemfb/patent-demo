<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention relates to a system suitable for displaying a target as well as a combat guidance system comprising a central unit for handling information. The present invention relates also to a device and process for displaying a target, e.g., an enemy unit.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates even to a device, a system and a process to generate a northerly direction.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates even to a software combat guidance, displaying a target and fighting a target.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The invention even relates to a process, device, system and software for fighting a target and/or documentation of performance.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">KNOWN TECHNOLOGY</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In U.S. Pat. No. 5,568,152 a device and a process for determining a target's position by an observer is described.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In conflicts between military units, participating soldiers and officers are often under pressure and emotionally affected because of the existing conditions. Performing difficult assignments during conflict and analyzing under time pressure is exhausting for many involved.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A considerable amount of information is communicated between fighting units and even with advanced technical equipment it is difficult to extract essential information from a high flow of information.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Today there are systems for determining an enemy unit's position. Position determination and threat identification are important parameters in the threat assessment which e.g. a combat command performs. The threat assessment can result in a threat prioritization, which can provide the base for the fight tactics and fighting strategy which can provide the base for the fight tactics and fighting strategy which is implemented.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Data regarding target displaying and target following is often communicated in real time. This puts extra high demands on units involved to effectively be able to fight an enemy unit. Even achievement documentation is important so that a combat command can have a good overview of the fight, both with regard to fighting enemy units and status for units within their own military unit.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Today a number of different systems are used separately to display targets, direct fighting and register target information. For example, there are laser distance measurers, binoculars with compass, positioning systems, guidance systems, etc., which are usually handled by specially-trained personnel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">None of the existing systems integrates said benefits and functions to one system for a single soldier.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">One goal of the present invention relates to the problem of integrating existing functions and systems to a portable system which can easily be handled by a single solder during combat.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A goal of the present invention relates to the problem of increasing the effectiveness of combat units.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Another goal of the present invention relates to the problem with overly slow chains of command during different types of fighting situations where there is a need for military personnel to be able to consistently deliver more accurate effective fire with high precision.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">A further goal of the present invention relates to the problem with reducing the weight borne by members of a military unit.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A further goal of the present invention relates to the problem with reducing stress in a combat situation.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">These problems are solved by a system suitable for displaying a target, comprising: a first unit arranged to generate a first information unit comprising the target's position relative to a first position, wherein the first information unit is arranged to transfer said first information unit to a second unit existing at a second position which is separate from the first position; wherein the second unit is arranged to generate a second information unit, comprising the target's position relative to the second position, depending on the first information unit; wherein the second unit is arranged to indicate the target's position to allow localization of the target.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to an embodiment of the invention a soldier or a vehicle, such as, e.g., a tank, is equipped with an organ which is arranged to determine a position for an enemy unit, and to transfer information, comprising target coordinates and other relevant information on the enemy unit, to another unit, e.g., a soldier or a vehicle, such as e.g. a tank, within the unit which with help of the transferred target coordinates, by means of a display device, can quickly and easily localize the enemy unit and fight it.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The position for the enemy unit can be determined with a laser type distance measurer, or with help of radio waves, and an organ for angle measuring, e.g., a gyro. The position is advantageously determined relative to the first unit's position, where the first unit can be a soldier or a vehicle, such as, e.g., a tank, which can be received with help of, e.g., GPS (Global Positioning System). The angle to the enemy unit is given relative to a generated northerly direction which is a north reference. The northerly direction can be generated with a process using phase frequency analysis of radio waves sent out from a central unit.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The soldier or personnel in a vehicle, such as, e.g., a tank, can, in connection with the positioning of the enemy unit, for example, with the voice, create information units which contain information on the enemy unit which allows identification of the same. Information which comprises the enemy unit's position and appurtenant information units can be stored in a central unit which is arranged to communicate with the units within the military unit. The information that comprises the enemy unit's position and related information can directly, upon request or distribution, be forwarded from the soldier or the vehicle, such as, e.g., a tank, to another unit within the military unit which has the capacity and possibility to fight the target. Alternatively, the information which comprises the enemy unit's position and related information can be forwarded via the central unit, upon request or distribution, to another unit within the military unit which has the capacity and possibility to fight the target.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With the invention the advantage of reducing the amount of data which is communicated within a unit is achieved. Advantageously, a fighting unit can use target coordinates which another unit has generated in a simple and reliable way, e.g., voice command. As a synergistic effect, increased capability for units within a military unit to cooperate and maximally utilize existing resources during battle is obtained. The simple use and handling of vital information within the military unit reduces stress for both commanding officers and soldiers.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As a surprising effect, an adaptive effect with a military unit within which the invention is realized without introducing further units is achieved. Existing units can be better used with the possibility to register and convey vital information to battle allies and the command hierarchy. This means that, e.g., heavier weapons systems within the military unit can be used fully with less risk to one's own dismounted troops or other units within the military unit. That is, the protection level is increased for, among others, individual soldiers.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">According to one aspect of the invention a target can be effectively allocated within the military unit. A recording that an enemy target is chosen by a unit for fighting makes it possible for other units to be able to choose and register other enemy units as targets, which minimises the risk that a number of units within the military unit fight the same target at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">However, it should be noted that in certain situations it is not desirable that a number of units within the military unit fight the same target at the same time. According to the invention this can be performed in a controlled way.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As a positive effect a mutual, more accurate, picture of the situation can be obtained within the military unit. As a further result it is possible for units within the military unit to more quickly be able to act from the right place at the right time. Improved and situation-tailored work is achieved through the simple handling of vital information.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Advantageously, an increased ability to fight in darkness is achieved. Night time battle has been associated with various difficulties for a long time, and places high requirements on personnel and equipment. According to an embodiment of the invention, fighting a target can be performed with a simple displaying process even in darkness where the target does not even need to be visible to the bighting unit.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">According to a preferred embodiment trajectory correction of ammunition is used all the way to the moment of contact. This is a very effective way to fight moving targets. That is, according to one embodiment, the invention can allow improved precision of displaying for search- and fight systems, such as, e.g., artillery systems or missile systems, and for fighter aircraft.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the invention a quick and certain identification of one's own units and third persons is made possible. Furthermore, quick and certain identification of one's own and enemy units is made possible. In a stressful combat situation, according to the invention a compromised and minimized amount of communicated information can effectively reduce injuries for third persons, at the same time as achieving an increased efficacy or quicker weapon performance with a certain weapon type for the target in question.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">According to an aspect of the invention the need for power can be reduced. Fewer power sources, e.g., batteries, results in a lower borne weight for soldiers. As a consequence there is greater stamina, both physical and mental stamina, as well as a longer stamina over time. Alternatively, reducer power needs also result in a reduced need for maintenance within the military unit and therewith reduced workload for different maintenance functions.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As a positive effect the military unit can, during training, reduce costs in connection with the increase of precision fighting of targets. This can resultantly reduce costs for a military unit's training time. According to the invention, a better assessment after military unit exercises can then be achieved with a logging function which can be used to analyze different periods during the exercise.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">According to an aspect of the invention the first information unit comprises information on type of target or name of the target for simple identification.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">According to an aspect of the invention the second unit is arranged to visually indicate a direction toward the target.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">According to an aspect of the invention, the first unit is arranged to generate at least a part of the first information by means of voice command.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to an aspect of the invention the first unit is arranged to generate at least a part of the first information by means of phase analysis and generation of a northerly reference.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">It is a further goal of the present invention to allow localization and aiming of a weapon for fighting a target by indicating a target position.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">This problem is further solved by providing a device to generate a northerly direction, comprising a weapon provided with a computer unit as well as a first and a second receiving unit. The device is characterised in that the first and the second receiving units are arranged at a distance relative to one another and are arranged to receive radio waves sent out from a central unit and, depending upon these, send signals to the computer unit. The computer unit is arranged to receive signals from the first and second receiving units as well as arranged to handle the received signals to generate a northerly direction.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The angle to the enemy unit is provided relative to the generated northerly direction which is a north reference. The northerly direction can be generated with a process using phase frequency analysis of radio waves sent out from the central unit.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">According to an aspect of the invention the device's first and second receiving units are arranged to register a first time point when a certain part of a radio wave is detected and a second time point when the same part of the radio wave is detected, respectively. According to an embodiment of the invention the computer unit is arranged to store a value representing the northerly direction I a memory provided therein.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows an over view of a region, such as a combat region, in which region different units are positioned. Three enemy units are illustrated with reference numerals <b>151</b>, <b>152</b> and <b>153</b>. Units that are shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, except for the units <b>151</b>, <b>152</b> and <b>153</b>, constitute a military unit. The units can be mobile. A central unit <b>100</b> is arranged to communication with a first unit <b>111</b> and a second unit <b>112</b>, via a first link <b>181</b> and a second ling <b>182</b>, respectively. The first and second units form a first combat pair <b>1111</b>. Furthermore, the first and second units <b>111</b> and <b>112</b> are arranged for communication with each other via a link <b>183</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">Herein the term link relates to a link which is wireless, e.g., a radio link. Alternatively a link can be a physical connection, such as a fibre optic cable. Alternatively a link can be an ultrasound link.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">According to an embodiment the central unit <b>100</b> is a combat command central. According to a realization the central unit <b>100</b> is an armoured vehicle comprising equipment necessary for communicating with units within the military unit as well as to lead them. According to a preferred realization the central unit is a vehicle arranged to transport seated ground troops, e.g., three or four combat pairs (6 or 8 soldiers).</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">According to a preferred embodiment the central unit is a vehicle arranged to transport seated troops, e.g., three or four combat pairs (6 or 8 soldiers).</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The equipment can, e.g., include senders and receivers as well as computers with software. One or a few operators can work at the same time with combat guidance, that is, coordination of efforts for units within the military unit. According to a realization the central unit can lead a combat unit or a certain size or a certain number of soldiers, such as, e.g., a platoon or a battalion. Alternatively the central unit <b>100</b> is arranged to lead large formations, such as battalions.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Alternatively the central unit <b>100</b> is arranged to function only as information handler. In this case units within the military unit are not controlled by personnel at the central unit, but rather only exchange information via the central unit <b>100</b>. Units within the military unit can therefore, according to an aspect of the invention, react autonomously with help of the central unit <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The central unit <b>100</b> is arranged for communication with a positioning system <b>170</b>, e.g., GPS, via a link <b>185</b>. Differential positioning can be used. Further, the central unit is arranged to generate a northerly direction of very good precision. The northerly direction generated by the central unit <b>100</b> is even called north reference. The central unit <b>100</b> is arranged to continually update information on its position (longitude, latitude, and altitude) as well as update the north reference.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">It should be noted that a local coordinate system can be used within the fighting military unit.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">The central unit <b>100</b> is arranged for communication with a third unit <b>113</b> and a fourth unit <b>114</b>, via a third link <b>193</b> and a fourth link <b>194</b>, respectively. The third and fourth units create a second fighting pair <b>1112</b>. Further, the third and fourth units <b>113</b> and <b>114</b> are arranged for communication with each other via a link <b>195</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In a similar way the central unit <b>100</b> is arranged for communication with a third combat pair <b>1113</b> in which combat pair a fifth unit <b>115</b> and a sixth unit <b>116</b> are included. It should be noted that the number of units which are included in a military unit, and which can communicate with the central unit, is elective. According to an embodiment the central unit <b>100</b> creates a group including a driver and an operator (combat guider) as well as the three combat pairs <b>1111</b>, <b>1112</b>, and <b>1113</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">It should even be noted that a military unit can consist of one or a number of central units, which can increase reliability regarding access to data stored in the central unit.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The central unit <b>100</b> is further arranged for communication with a unit <b>140</b> via a link <b>186</b>. The unit <b>140</b> is an artillery group. Alternatively, the unit <b>140</b> can be a mechanized vehicle, e.g., a tank, or a robot system or an airplane, such as an attack plane. According to an embodiment the unit <b>140</b> is arranged to be able to give effective fire toward the enemy units <b>151</b>, <b>152</b>, and <b>153</b>. The effective fire is according to an embodiment more powerful that what could be given from one of the combat pairs <b>1111</b>, <b>1112</b>, or <b>1113</b>, which means that a unit within the combat pair can enable the unit <b>140</b> to fight a registered target with necessary resources, e.g., a robot system. According to an embodiment the unit <b>140</b> is arranged to be able to give effective fire in a region AA, within which the enemy unit <b>152</b> is placed.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The enemy units <b>151</b>, <b>152</b>, and <b>153</b> are a single soldier, an armoured vehicle, and a building, respectively. Naturally, enemy units can be comprised of other types of units, such as, e.g., airplanes, artillery positions, boats, cargo vehicles, troop vehicles, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth units are even assigned to the first, second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth combat units, respectively. This will be described in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, below.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to an embodiment the first unit <b>111</b> is a single soldier with appurtenant equipment. According to another embodiment the first unit is a motor-driven vehicle which can be driven by, e.g., a single soldier. The first unit <b>111</b> is arranged for communication with the positioning system <b>170</b> via a link <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>schematically shows equipment units within a combat unit. According to this example the equipment units are intended to be carried by a single soldier <b>110</b>. The equipment units are coupled together via a link system <b>4</b> and comprise the basic borne equipment for the soldier.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">A headset <b>5</b> comprises hearing protection and earphones with microphone. An antenna module <b>6</b> is provided with one or a few antennas, and electronics as well as software provided therefore, for communication with among others GPS <b>170</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The basic equipment even comprises a control module <b>7</b> which is described in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>. A sighting module <b>8</b> is removably fastened to a weapon <b>410</b>. The sighting module <b>8</b> and the weapon <b>410</b> are described in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>d </i>and <b>1</b><i>e</i>. A group radio <b>9</b> is presently arranged for communication with the second unit <b>112</b>, alternatively one of the units in the second or third combat pair, or with other units within the military unit.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">A computer unit <b>10</b> is arranged to receive information from the other equipment units. The computer unit <b>10</b> is arranged to send information to the other equipment units. The computer unit <b>10</b> is arranged to store information received from the other equipment units. The computer unit <b>10</b> is arranged to handle information received from the other equipment units. The computer unit is described in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The equipment units <b>5</b>-<b>10</b> are arranged to be powered by a power supply <b>3</b>. Alternatively, the different equipment units are each equipped with their own power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>schematically illustrates the control module <b>7</b> in further detail. The control module is considered to be included in the basic equipment borne by the soldier who comprises a part of the first unit <b>111</b>. The control module <b>7</b> has a visual interface <b>11</b>, as well as a screen or display. According to an embodiment the interface <b>11</b> is a touch sensitive screen. According to an embodiment the screen is black/white or colour.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The interface <b>11</b> is arranged to show relevant information for the soldier. Information which can be shown is, e.g., positions for units within the military unit, own position as well as enemy unit's positions. The own position can even be indicated with help of coordinates X, Y, and Z. Further, according to an embodiment each individual unit's respective weapon bearing can be shown. The own position is illustrated in the figure with a rectangle, and other units are illustrated with circles. The respective unit's weapon bearings are illustrated with arrows.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Updating of information can occur with the soldier's voice. Updating of information can occur in real time and be automatically transferred to the central unit <b>100</b> and therein be available for all units within the military unit.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Different modes for the control unit, such as Map, Order, Radio, can be selected. Further, the control units is arranged to show northerly direction, system time T (that is, a reference time within the military unit), distance from direction to the central unit <b>100</b> as well as status information on other units within the military unit, such as amount of remaining ammunition, fuel in the vehicle or blood pressure for individual soldiers.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Status for a unit within the military unit or enemy units can be shown with different symbols. Status can include information on e.g., amount of ammunition, health condition, or other.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Further, firing with the units within the military unit can be indicated with e.g., a symbol. That is, a soldier can see if another soldier within the military unit discharges their weapon(s). This information can be used as a basis for decision for each soldier. The decision can e.g., concern request of information (target coordinates) on a new target for fighting. Said request is sent to e.g., the central unit <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>d </i>schematically shows in further detail a weapon which can be used by, e.g., the first unit <b>111</b>.</p>
