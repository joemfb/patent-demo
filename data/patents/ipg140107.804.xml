<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS</heading>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">While the present disclosure may be susceptible to embodiment in different forms, there is shown in the drawings, and herein will be described in detail, embodiments with the understanding that the present description is to be considered an exemplification of the principles of the disclosure and is not intended to limit the disclosure to the details of construction and the arrangements of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A beverage dispensing apparatus <b>30</b> illustrated generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> as comprising a plurality of beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> and a housing <b>34</b> that defines a chamber <b>36</b> containing water or other liquid suitable for use in brewing. The housing <b>34</b> desirably acts as a central reservoir for a constant supply of heated water to be used by the beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> to brew several different beverages.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The beverage dispensing apparatus <b>30</b> may have any suitable construction and configuration. The beverage apparatus <b>30</b> may include any suitable number of beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> oriented in any suitable manner, depending on various circumstances, such as, for example, customer demand, customer usage, available store space, and desired aesthetics. Similarly, the housing <b>34</b> may have any suitable construction and configuration that desirably is consistent with customer demand, customer usage, available store space and desired aesthetics. A plurality of conduits in the form of water lines <b>38</b> provide flow communication between the housing <b>34</b> and the beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> to supply water for brewing. In a preferred embodiment, the housing <b>34</b> is positioned behind the beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> and centrally located relative to the beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> to minimize the distance between the housing and each of the beverage dispensing modules, thereby increasing operational efficiency and minimizing space.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Terms including beverage and beverage making as used herein are intended to be broadly defined as including but not limited to the brewing of coffee, tea and any other brewed beverage, including a final beverage or food product as well as producing an intermediate product to be combined with a final beverage or food product. This broad interpretation is also intended to include, but is not limited to any process of infusing, steeping, reconstituting, diluting, dissolving, saturating or passing a liquid through or otherwise mixing or combining a beverage substance with a liquid such as water without a limitation to the temperature of such liquid unless specified. This broad interpretation is also intended to include, but is not limited to beverage substances such as ground coffee, tea, liquid beverage concentrate, powdered beverage concentrate, freeze dried coffee or other beverage concentrates, to obtain a desired beverage or other food.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the illustrated embodiment, for example, the beverage dispensing apparatus <b>30</b> comprises ten beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> oriented in a generally U-shaped manner that substantially surrounds the housing <b>34</b>. As illustrated, four of the beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> face the same direction, four other beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> face an opposite direction, and two of the beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> are positioned in a space-efficient manner consistent with a desired orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A simplified form of the beverage apparatus <b>30</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> which uses simplified block diagram illustrations to show multiple beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> which are configured to provide a beverage brewing system. The beverage apparatus <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is very similar to a soluble beverage apparatus <b>30</b><i>a </i>also shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The beverage apparatus <b>30</b>, as will be described in greater detail herein below, relates to a beverage brewing or producing system whereas the soluble beverage apparatus <b>30</b><i>a</i>, as will be described in greater detail herein below, relates to a soluble or powdered beverage dispensing system. Both beverage apparatuses <b>30</b>, <b>30</b><i>a </i>employ a common heated water reservoir contained in housing <b>34</b> to which the individual modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>are connected.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-4</figref>, the housing <b>34</b> desirably is centrally located to serve multiple beverage modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a</i>. The benefit of a common housing <b>34</b> functioning as a common reservoir to supply water, instead of individual tanks for each module <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a</i>, is that it substantially reduces the cost and greatly increases the efficiency of the system. Also it reduces the redundancy of multiple heated water reservoirs, reduces the wattage required by the system and increases flexibility in the number of modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>which might be included.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The particular configuration with the housing <b>34</b> positioned in close proximity to or between several modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>is beneficial in that it also minimizes the length of water lines <b>38</b> connecting the housing <b>34</b> to the modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a</i>. Additionally, a larger body of water in the housing <b>34</b> tends to help maintain the temperature and reduce temperature loss over time as well as maintaining a larger volume of brew water at a desired temperature. While the housing <b>34</b> retained within the beverage apparatus <b>30</b> is insulated to reduce heat loss and reduce heat load on the ambient environment, heat which may escape from the housing <b>34</b> will generally pass to the modules <b>32</b>, thereby increasing the efficiency of maintaining the temperature of the beverages retained in the modules <b>32</b>. Insulation desirably is provided to reduce heat loss to the ambient environment. This will also help reduce the exertion on the ambient air-conditioning system thereby further increasing efficiency of the present beverage apparatus <b>30</b>, <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, each module <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>produces a separate brewed beverage. The centralization of a housing <b>34</b> helps reduce the individual cost associated with the module <b>32</b>,<b>32</b><i>a </i>and improves the ease of manufacturing of the modules. Also, there is increased commonality of parts associated with this type of system. The modular configuration of the beverage apparatus <b>30</b> using the modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>increases the potential variability of the physical size and brewer configuration of the system. This is beneficial to accommodate the needs of a particular location. In other words, only a desired or required number of modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>will be needed at any given time. If a location has an increase in demand for brewed or soluble beverages additional modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>may be added as necessary for the particular change in demand. Additionally, with regard to repair and maintenance, the beverage apparatus <b>30</b>, <b>30</b><i>a </i>can be designed such that individual modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>can be removed for repair and maintenance as necessary with an identical module being inserted in the missing modules.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a preferred embodiment, (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) the housing <b>34</b> includes a heating element <b>52</b>, and one or more system sensors such as a level sensor <b>86</b> and a temperature sensor <b>84</b>. Such components tend to be generally readily available and easily replaced and as such further enhance the reliability of the overall beverage apparatus <b>30</b>, <b>30</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the line <b>38</b> connecting each housing <b>34</b> to a brewing portion <b>40</b> of the module <b>32</b> is shown. Water <b>42</b> retained in the housing <b>34</b> can be readily dispensed. A water inlet line <b>44</b> is provided to introduce unheated water <b>50</b> to the housing <b>34</b>. The inlet line <b>44</b> runs from an upper portion <b>46</b> of the housing <b>34</b> and directs the inward water downwardly towards a bottom portion <b>48</b> of the housing <b>34</b>. Introducing the unheated water <b>50</b> towards the bottom of the reservoir introduces the unheated water <b>50</b> in close relation to a heated element <b>52</b> thereby accelerating the heating of the water. Additionally, the introduction of unheated water <b>50</b> in the bottom portion <b>48</b> tends to force heated water in the upper portion <b>46</b> upwardly. As such, the water <b>42</b> in the upper portion <b>46</b> tends to be the hottest water in the housing <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Introducing unheated water <b>50</b> from the upper portion has the benefit of providing an entrance into the reservoir through a reservoir wall <b>56</b> with little or no pressure on the entry therethrough. This may result in an increase in the reliability of the entry therethrough. Additionally, a reinforcing or strengthening structure <b>58</b> is provided extending between opposed walls <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> of the housing <b>34</b>. This helps prevent bowing or stress on the walls <b>60</b>, <b>62</b> which might otherwise result from the force of the water on the walls. Multiple reinforcing structures <b>58</b> may be provided throughout the housing <b>34</b> as necessary to provide support for the size and dimension of the housing required for a particular system.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, for example, shows a diagrammatic illustration of an embodiment of the apparatus <b>30</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>. The beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> can have any suitable construction desirably adapted to produce beverages, store beverages for ready consumption, and facilitate ready dispensing of the beverages.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Each module <b>32</b> includes a brewing assembly <b>30</b> that may have any suitable construction that can be used to produce beverage such as brewing coffee or other beverages. The illustrated brewing assembly <b>30</b>, for example, includes a brewing substance retainer or assembly <b>64</b> including a funnel <b>66</b>. Such a retainer <b>64</b> may be well known in the art and may include a filter (not shown) retained in the funnel <b>66</b> for holding a charge of beverage substance. The funnel <b>66</b> may be positioned above a reservoir or container portion <b>68</b> of the dispensing module <b>32</b> which receives brewed beverage from the funnel. A dispensing assembly <b>70</b> in the form of a controllable valve may be associated with the container <b>68</b> for dispensing beverage from the module <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> a simplified review of the beverage brewing process is described. A brew actuator switch <b>72</b> desirably is associated with each of the modules <b>32</b>. To initiate a brew cycle for one of the modules <b>32</b> a respective brew activation switch <b>72</b> is operated. Operation of the switch <b>72</b> sends a signal over line <b>74</b> to controller <b>76</b>. Controller <b>76</b> operates an inlet valve <b>78</b> over line <b>80</b> to introduce water to the housing <b>34</b>. Also, heating element <b>52</b> is coupled to the controller <b>76</b> over line <b>82</b>. The temperature sensor <b>84</b> and level sensor <b>86</b> are coupled to the controller over lines <b>88</b>, <b>90</b> respectively. If the controller <b>76</b> detects proper level and temperature it will initiate a brew cycle thereby displacing water from the housing <b>34</b> through a sprayhead assembly <b>92</b>. The sprayhead assembly <b>92</b> communicates with the substance retainer <b>64</b> and dispenses water into the funnel <b>66</b> for producing a beverage therein.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The illustrated module <b>32</b> includes a level sensor <b>94</b> associated with the container <b>68</b> which is coupled to the control over line <b>96</b>. The level sensor can detect a change in level in beverage retained in the container <b>68</b> which may be used to activate a brew cycle. Also, the level detector <b>94</b> may sense the level in the beverage container <b>68</b> thereby indicating if the container is full or above the desired level to prevent initiation of a brew cycle. This will prevent over flow of the beverage server <b>68</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> can be constructed to dispense beverage in any suitable manner. In a preferred embodiment, for example, a dispenser or faucet switch <b>98</b> may be associated with the dispensing assembly <b>70</b> and coupled with a dispensing handle or control <b>100</b>. Activation of the control <b>100</b> will activate the switch <b>98</b> over line <b>102</b> connected to the controller, <b>76</b> thereby indicating that the controller <b>76</b> should operate a solenoid valve <b>104</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>), via line <b>106</b> to dispense beverage therefrom. As will be described in greater detail below with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, a disposal or dump valve <b>108</b> is also coupled with the container <b>68</b> to facilitate controllable disposal, via line <b>110</b> coupled to the controller <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 7</figref>, the beverage container <b>68</b> may further include a manifold <b>114</b>. The illustrated manifold <b>114</b> includes a primary passage <b>116</b> which communicates with an interior cavity or reservoir <b>118</b> of the container <b>68</b>. Beverage flows from the cavity <b>118</b> through the primary passage <b>116</b>. The solenoid valves <b>104</b>, <b>108</b> communicate with the passage <b>116</b>. A dispensing passage <b>120</b> and a disposal passage <b>122</b> communicate with the primary passage <b>116</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Solenoid valve <b>104</b> and <b>108</b> desirably are normally closed and require specific activation in order to open the valves. During a dispense cycle the switch or control <b>100</b>, for example a controllable faucet as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, is activated thereby activating solenoid valve <b>104</b>. When the dispense solenoid valve <b>104</b> is opened beverage <b>124</b> will flow from the cavity through the solenoid valve <b>104</b>. Under this condition disposal valve <b>108</b> is closed. When beverage must be disposed of, the disposal solenoid valve <b>108</b> is opened while maintaining the dispense solenoid valve <b>104</b> in a closed position. This will allow the disposal of beverage through a separate dispensing line.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Disposal of beverage may occur as a result of a time lapsed period whereby after a specified period of time beverage should be disposed of. For example, if a beverage only maintains a desired flavor profile or other characteristics for a period of time, for example 2 hours, at the end of two hours after the beverage brewing cycle is initiated, the beverage may be disposed of through the disposal valve <b>108</b>. Such disposal may also be used at the end of a service cycle such that at the end of the day all beverages may be disposed of at a predetermined time.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The disposal valve may also be used in a manner to flush and cleanse the beverage brewing system. In this regard, at a predetermined period of time, the controller <b>76</b> may operate the disposal valve <b>108</b> to dispose of any beverage retained in the container <b>68</b>. The disposal valve <b>108</b> and dispense valve <b>104</b> may be closed. The controller <b>76</b> may then dispense a quantity of water into the cavity <b>118</b> thereby flushing and sanitizing the reservoir. After holding the heated water for a predetermined period of time the water may be disposed through the disposal valve <b>108</b>. Multiple rinsing or flushing cycles may be controlled by the controller <b>76</b>. In this regard, both the cavity <b>118</b>, the container <b>68</b> and the associated passages <b>116</b>, <b>122</b>, <b>120</b> and solenoid valve <b>104</b>, <b>108</b> may be cleansed and sanitize periodically and automatically. It will be appreciated that these automatic cycles will likely greatly increase the cleanliness, taste reliability and sanitation of such beverage dispensing systems as such procedures require considerable amount of time on the part of manual operators.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The use of controllable solenoid valves <b>104</b>, <b>108</b> also prevents dispensing of beverage during a brew cycle. For example, once a brew cycle is initiated the controller <b>76</b> can lock out the solenoid valves <b>104</b>, <b>108</b>. This will allow for the brewing cycle to complete and brewed beverage to mix within the container <b>68</b> to insure consistent flavor.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> can be constructed in any other suitable manner to dispense brewed beverage in any suitable manner in accordance with various embodiments disclosed. If desired, for example, the beverage containers <b>68</b> of the beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b> can instead be in the form of carafes (not shown) or have any other suitable construction.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">In a preferred embodiment, during a brewing cycle, heated water <b>134</b> is dispensed from the housing <b>34</b> through the water dispensing system. Heated water <b>134</b> is used to infuse a beverage brewing substance <b>136</b> retained in the brewing assembly <b>64</b>. An opening <b>138</b> is provided in the bottom of the funnel <b>66</b> to allow a brewed beverage <b>140</b> to flow therefrom. As shown, for example, in previous figures, a brewed beverage container <b>68</b> is provided to collect the beverage <b>140</b>. The beverage container <b>68</b> may be of any suitable form.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, a liquid flavor dispensing system <b>130</b> may be employed with the modular beverage dispensing system disclosed. The liquid flavor dispensing system <b>130</b> can have any suitable configuration and can be used to supply flavoring <b>132</b> to all or less than all of the beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b>. The liquid dispensing system <b>130</b> may also be used to supply a different flavoring <b>132</b> to each of the different beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b>. Additionally, the flavorings <b>132</b> can be supplied to the beverage dispensing modules by a single liquid flavor dispensing system <b>130</b> or several liquid flavor dispensing systems. Further, the flavoring <b>132</b> may in the form of the typical flavorings associated with brewed coffee or instead be in any other suitable form such as, for example, honey, peach, lemon, herbal flavors, or any other suitable flavoring which might be desired by a beverage consumer for any number of different beverages.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">In a preferred embodiment, a small quantity of flavoring <b>132</b> is introduced into the water which is dispensed to the beverage brewing substance <b>136</b>. The beverage brewing substance may be in the form of decaff or regular ground coffee as well as tea substances or other substances which might be used in an infusion beverage brewing process. The objective in using the liquid flavoring material <b>132</b> is to introduce a small quantity of concentrated material or substance <b>132</b> during the brewing process so that the flavor becomes fully mixed with and saturated in the heated water <b>134</b>. Introduction of the flavor <b>132</b> early in the brewing process will help assure that the flavor frilly mixes with the water, is fully flushed through the beverage brewing substance to maximize the value of the flavor and is used to produce an aroma which might entice purchasers of the beverage as part of the beverage purchasing experience. The flavor could also be dispensed into the beverage brewing substance and subsequently mixed with the water and the resultant brew during the brewing process.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">A benefit of adding flavors at the time of brewing and/or mixing soluble beverages, over using pre-flavor beverage substances, is the increased effectiveness of the flavorings. The increased effectiveness of the flavorings reduces the amount of flavoring required to produce a desired taste profile. Under these circumstances, the flavorings are mixed with the beverage substance under optimal conditions to maximize the flavoring benefits of the flavorings. For example, the time prior to mixing the flavoring with the brewing substance is nominal thereby virtually eliminating any degradation of the flavoring which might occur if the flavoring was exposed to air.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">A liquid flavor dispensing system <b>130</b> is illustrated diagrammatically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. With this embodiment, the liquid flavor dispensing system dispenses a different liquid flavoring <b>132</b> in a controlled manner to several of the brewing assemblies of the beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b>. The flavor can be dispensed to a water or liquid distribution system which controllably dispenses water to a beverage making substance, the beverage making substance or both.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref>, the illustrated liquid flavor dispensing system <b>130</b> desirably includes a plurality of packages or containers <b>144</b><i>a</i>-<b>144</b><i>h</i>, each of which retains a respective liquid flavor <b>132</b> therein. The containers <b>144</b> desirably are in controlled communication with respective beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b><i>a</i>-<b>32</b><i>d </i>in any suitable manner. For example, a section of tubing or other passage <b>146</b> may connect each container <b>144</b> to a respective check valve <b>148</b>. The check valve <b>148</b> is part of a respective solenoid or other form of pump device <b>150</b> coupled to the controller <b>76</b> via a respective line <b>152</b>. A respective small diameter tube <b>154</b> extends from the solenoid pump <b>150</b> to a respective second check valve or flavor injection port <b>156</b> at a respective terminal end <b>158</b> of the tube <b>154</b>. A respective sensor <b>160</b> can be coupled to the controller via a respective line <b>162</b> to monitor and detect a low level of the respective flavoring <b>132</b> in the respective container <b>144</b>. As will be described in greater detail below with regard to sensing and monitoring, the status of the flavorings <b>132</b> can be reported by the controller <b>176</b>. The check valves <b>148</b> and <b>156</b> at each end of each of the tubes <b>154</b> provide a sealed line to which the container <b>144</b> can be attached.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Also, either alternatively or in addition to the use of the sensor <b>160</b>, the flavor usage can be inferred based on information collected on a characteristic of the pump such as operation or usage for example, pump actuation. For example, a sensor may be associated with the pump and run time of the pump <b>150</b> could be monitored and a calculation made to infer the amount of flavorings remaining in a corresponding flavorings container <b>144</b>. The system would provide a signal to the operator, such as &#x201c;check-status&#x201d; when the level of flavorings approaches, attains or drops below a predetermined level, for example 20% remaining. Such advance warning would give the operator the opportunity to change the flavorings container <b>144</b> before it runs out. The advance warning also helps assure that a reasonable margin of error in the inferred calculation is considered and accommodated for.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In use, when a brewing cycle is initiated, the solenoid pump <b>150</b> can be activated simultaneous with the initiation of the brewing cycle of one of the beverage dispensing modules or shortly thereafter. A quantity, for example 9 ml for use in brewing &#xbd; gallon of coffee, of liquid flavoring <b>132</b> is pumped from the container <b>144</b> through the tubing <b>154</b>. The check valve or flavor injection port <b>156</b> is positioned in close proximity to a sprayhead <b>170</b> of the dispensing assembly <b>92</b>. Dispensing of the flavor <b>132</b> into the water will allow the flavor to mix with the heated water for brewing substance during the saturation and extraction process. Generally, it is desirable to use the flavoring at the start of the cycle which will result in completely integrating the flavor during the brewing cycle. The process may be repeated with other beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>and, if desired, with other flavors.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The flavor injection ports <b>156</b> may, for example, include a check valve of a type as produced by Smart Products. This is a positive pressure inverted check valve which requires positive pressure through the tube <b>154</b> to open the valve. Positioning of the injection port <b>156</b> in close proximity to the sprayhead <b>170</b> results in the benefit of clearing and rinsing the surface as a result of the water vapor and heat during a brewing cycle. Periodic manual cleaning of the sprayhead <b>170</b> and injection port <b>156</b> helps maintain a clean system.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Desirably, because the injection port <b>156</b> is an inverted pressure check valve, physical contact with the tip of the injection port <b>156</b> through which the liquid <b>132</b> is dispensed does not result in dispensing of liquid <b>132</b>. Rather, physical contact with the end of the injection port <b>156</b> causes the valve to close as opposed to open. The system also prevents the entry of atmosphere into the container <b>144</b> or line <b>154</b> thereby preventing contamination or degrading of the flavor or quality of the flavorings. This system provides a generally closed system which prevents the flavorings contact with the atmosphere and prevents contamination providing a generally aseptic environment.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the liquid flavor dispensing system <b>130</b> as described with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8-10</figref> may be used with a soluble beverage system <b>176</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the liquid dispensing system dispenses liquid flavor into a hot water path <b>174</b> of a soluble or powdered beverage dispensing system <b>176</b>. The devices used to dispense the liquid flavor are the same as those describe above with regard to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. As such, only the terminal ends <b>158</b><i>a</i>, <b>158</b><i>b </i>and <b>158</b><i>c </i>of multiple lines <b>154</b><i>a</i>, <b>154</b><i>b</i>, and <b>154</b><i>c </i>are shown. Similarly, the multiple injection ports <b>156</b><i>a</i>, <b>156</b><i>b</i>, and <b>156</b><i>c </i>are shown.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The soluble beverage dispensing system <b>176</b> retains a quantity of powdered beverage mix (not shown) in a beverage dispensing container <b>178</b>. The dispensing of soluble beverage material in powder form is generally known in the art. The container <b>178</b> includes a dispensing auger (not shown) which controllably dispenses powder by operation of a dispensing drive or motor <b>180</b> controlled by the controller <b>76</b><i>a</i>. Powdered beverage material is dispensed through the passage <b>182</b> into a mixing chamber <b>184</b>. The hot water line <b>174</b> communicates with the mixing chamber <b>184</b> to combine with the powder. The combined powder and hot water flow into an agitating chamber <b>186</b> there below. A whipper motor <b>188</b> and agitating blade <b>190</b> further blend the powder and water combination for dispensing a beverage <b>192</b> through a nozzle <b>194</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The flavor dispensing system <b>130</b> (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>) controllably dispenses liquid flavor <b>132</b> from respective containers <b>144</b> using corresponding pumps via the lines <b>154</b><i>a</i>, <b>154</b><i>b</i>, and <b>154</b><i>c</i>. Either individual flavors or combinations of flavors may be dispensed into the hot water line. Such dispensing may be programmed in the controller <b>76</b><i>a</i>. Positioning of the injection ports <b>156</b><i>a</i>, <b>156</b><i>b</i>, <b>156</b><i>c </i>in the heated water path helps to assure that the liquid flavors are rinsed from the injection ports during and at the conclusion of the heated water dispensing cycle during a beverage dispensing cycle. It should be noted that generally these powdered beverage dispensing systems have a momentary hot water overrun at the end of the cycle during which powdered beverages dispense from the container <b>178</b>. The slight overrun of heated water helps to assure that the mixing chamber <b>184</b>, whipping chamber <b>186</b>, and nozzle <b>194</b> are rinsed clean at the end of the cycle. The injection ports <b>156</b><i>a</i>, <b>156</b><i>b </i>and <b>156</b><i>c </i>have been positioned in the hot water line to provide the rinsing characteristics and benefits of the overrun of hot water. Furthermore, it is commonly known to have at least one daily rinse cycle in which heated water is dispensed through the assembly <b>176</b> to maintain cleanliness and sanitation of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">During a brew cycle as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, liquid flavor is generally preferably dispensed at the initiation of the brew cycle. As noted, this helps to ensure complete mixing and optimal extraction of the flavor from the beverage brewing substance <b>136</b>. A predetermined volume of liquid flavor <b>132</b> can be dispensed into the brewing assembly <b>30</b> at the initiation of the brew cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In contrast, the soluble system <b>176</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may have a variable quantity of beverage <b>192</b> dispensed therefrom. It is anticipated that multiple beverage sizes may be dispensed from the soluble system <b>176</b>. As a result, the liquid flavoring <b>132</b> must be dispensed at a rate consistent with the concentration flavor profile or recipe, and powder also dispensed by the system. For example, if a consumer wishes to obtain a 12 ounce beverage the proper amount of liquid flavoring must be dispensed for a 12 ounce beverage. However, the consumer may be allowed to control whether they wish to have a full 12 ounces of beverage or if they decide to short the beverage resulting in, perhaps, only 10 ounces being dispensed. As such, the pump associated with the powdered beverage system <b>176</b> must be calibrated to dispense small quantities of liquid flavoring <b>132</b> on a per unit time basis to assure a desirable and consistent mixing of flavor with the powder. This will help assure that the desired flavor is achieved regardless of the quantity of beverage dispensed.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The solenoid pump <b>150</b> used with the liquid flavor dispensing system <b>130</b> is a precision controlled metering pump. It is anticipated that other forms of the metering pump may be used with this system. However, in the present embodiment, the metering pump is controllably operated to dispense very small quantities of the liquid flavor <b>132</b>. The frequency of the plunger rate, the stroke of the plunger as well as the duration of plunger operation the solenoid pump <b>150</b> can be controlled by the controller <b>76</b>, <b>76</b><i>a</i>. As a result, very small quantities of highly concentrated liquid flavor can be dispensed into the beverages <b>140</b>, <b>192</b> during the corresponding beverage preparation process.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">As such, precise quantities can be added to provide flexibility and tailoring of the resultant beverages. The system <b>130</b> can be calibrated using volumetric guidelines associated with various beverage recipes and flavor materials to match particular flavor preferences, for example for various demographics. As such, a franchise operation can custom blend and configure the flavor of beverages dispensed by the beverage dispensing system to meet and satisfy regional preferences. Additionally, if preferences change over time the system can be modified and calibrated to match those preferences. This adds further flexibility to the beverage system disclosed.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>, a powdered or soluble beverage dispensing system <b>199</b> is shown. While a soluable beverage system <b>199</b> has been shown and described as a powder dispensing system, it is envisioned that such a soluable system also includes a liquid concentrate system which dispenses a quality of liquid coffee concentrate for mixing with water or other dilution or reconstituting substance. Reference to a soluable beverage system is intended to be broadly interpreted. Such a beverage dispensing system has been generally and diagrammatically shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. With further reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the container <b>178</b> is shown positioned inside a housing <b>200</b>. The passage <b>182</b> coupled to the container <b>178</b> is shown positioned for dispensing into the mixing chamber <b>184</b> and communicating with the whipping chamber <b>186</b> and nozzle <b>194</b>. A portion of the housing <b>200</b> in the form of a door <b>202</b> conceals the powdered beverage system <b>176</b> in the housing <b>200</b>. Also, the liquid flavor dispensing system <b>130</b> as described hereinabove may be used with the powdered beverage or soluble beverage dispensing system <b>176</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">One of the potential difficulties involved with a soluble beverage dispensing system is that the container <b>178</b> must be removed periodically for refilling with powdered or soluble beverage substance as well as regular maintenance and cleaning. The container <b>178</b> may not be very heavy when it is empty because it is generally formed of a plastic material. However, once filled, it may contain 5 to 10 pounds of powder material. With the container <b>178</b> being positioned in an elevated location and containing a quantity of material, it may be difficult to lift the container into a desired position in the housing <b>200</b>. The container <b>178</b> is positioned in an upper position in the housing <b>200</b> in order to benefit from gravity assistance when dispensing powdered beverage therefrom to the mixing chamber <b>84</b>. Additionally, it is important to align the dispensing passage <b>182</b> with the housing <b>184</b> to help assure that when powdered beverage material is dispensed from the container <b>178</b> it flows into the proper path for mixing with water. As such, it would be desirable to provide an apparatus and system for facilitating improved ease of removal and replacement of the powdered beverage container <b>178</b> relative to the housing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 14-18</figref>, a container positioning assembly or container positioner <b>220</b> in the form of a slide-out support or shelf is provided. The container positioning assembly <b>220</b> includes a pair of handles <b>222</b> which can be grasped (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>) by a user to extract the container <b>178</b> attached to the assembly <b>220</b> for removing it from the housing <b>200</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the assembly <b>220</b> allows the container <b>178</b> to be pulled straight out of the housing <b>200</b> thereby allowing disengagement of the passage <b>182</b> relative to the mixing chamber <b>184</b>. Movement of the assembly <b>220</b> also replaces the container <b>178</b> in a desired position to align the dispensing passage <b>182</b> with the mixing chamber <b>184</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref>, the container <b>178</b> has been removed from the housing <b>200</b> in order to refill the container <b>178</b> but does not have to be removed from the shelf <b>250</b> of the assembly <b>220</b>. Support rails <b>226</b> are positioned on each side of container <b>178</b> and are engaged with side walls <b>228</b> of the housing <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>). Each of the guide rails <b>226</b> includes a pair of tracking slots <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> which are engaged with corresponding upper <b>234</b> and lower <b>236</b> guide rollers. A support roller <b>240</b> is positioned along an exterior edge <b>242</b> of the guide <b>226</b> to further help facilitate smooth and controlled movement of the assembly <b>220</b>. Support rollers <b>240</b> and guide rollers <b>234</b>, <b>236</b> are mounted on the sidewalls of the housing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The guides <b>226</b> are connected by a cross extending shelf <b>250</b> on which the container <b>178</b> is positioned.

The guide rollers <b>240</b>, <b>234</b>, <b>236</b> associated with the guides <b>226</b> prevent tipping of the shelf <b>250</b> and associated container <b>178</b>. When the assembly <b>220</b> is stowed in the housing <b>200</b> the shelf <b>250</b> rests on a corresponding surface <b>252</b> of the housing <b>200</b>. As can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15-17</figref>, the guides <b>226</b> include a generally horizontal portion <b>254</b> and a vertically oriented portion <b>256</b>. The shelf <b>250</b> and container <b>178</b> are associated with the generally horizontal portion <b>254</b>. The generally vertical portion <b>256</b> helps to allow forward movement as well as downward movement of the assembly <b>220</b> relative to the housing <b>200</b>. The guide including the portion <b>254</b>, <b>256</b> help facilitate movement of the container into and out of the housing <b>200</b> and forward and downward movement.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In the embodiment as shown, the assembly facilitates positioning of the container <b>178</b> approximately 6-8 inches downwardly from its stored position in the housing <b>200</b>. This lowering of the container <b>178</b> is beneficial in that it allows for easy filling of the container. Also, by fixing the container to the shelf <b>250</b> and the assembly <b>200</b> it prevents spilling or otherwise tipping of the container <b>178</b> during filling or other processes. This can result in savings in terms of lost beverage material as well as cleanup costs and associated complications.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In the stored position, detents <b>260</b>, <b>262</b> are provided on the guides <b>230</b>, <b>232</b>, respectively. The detents <b>260</b>, <b>262</b> allow the rollers <b>234</b>, <b>236</b> respectively, to be engaged therewith to prevent casual disengagement of the assembly <b>220</b> from the housing <b>200</b>. This helps to lock or retain the assembly <b>220</b> in a desired stored or stowed position in the housing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">As the assembly <b>220</b> is moved outwardly from the housing <b>200</b>, the track guides <b>234</b>, <b>236</b> track along the corresponding channels <b>230</b>, <b>232</b> generally horizontally along the horizontal portion <b>254</b>. As such, the container <b>178</b> attached to the shelf <b>250</b> sides forwardly and outwardly from the housing. At a position where the generally horizontal portion <b>254</b> transitions into the partially vertical portion <b>256</b> (elbow <b>270</b>) the guides allow the assembly to slide downwardly and forwardly. In the extended most position the guides <b>234</b>, <b>236</b> engage corresponding extended detents <b>272</b>, <b>274</b>, respectively. These detent positions <b>272</b>, <b>274</b> help retain the assembly <b>220</b> in the outward or extended most position.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">The assembly <b>220</b> also includes an assist system <b>280</b> which includes cables <b>282</b> and biasing members or springs <b>284</b> forming a cable-biasing assembly to help facilitate removal of and replacement of the container <b>178</b> relative to the housing <b>200</b>. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>, the assist system <b>280</b> includes a spring <b>284</b> attached at one end <b>286</b> to a back portion of the housing and at a second end to a first pulley <b>288</b>. The cable <b>282</b> is attached at a first end <b>290</b> to a corresponding portion of the housing and extends through the first pulley <b>288</b> and up and around a second pulley <b>292</b>. The second end <b>294</b> of the cable <b>282</b> attaches to a corresponding portion of the guides <b>226</b> at attachment point <b>296</b>. Attachment of the cable <b>282</b> to the guide <b>226</b> is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>. The assist assembly <b>288</b> helps further facilitate ease of removal and replacement of the container <b>178</b> relative to the housing <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">For example, when the container <b>178</b> is removed from the housing on the assembly <b>220</b> the spring <b>284</b> stores energy and is stretched as the cables <b>282</b> are extended. The cables <b>282</b> are extended as a result of the forward and downward movement of the guides <b>226</b>. Extension of the springs <b>284</b> expends the stored energy and imparts a return force in the springs which helps reduce the force required to return the container <b>178</b> to the housing <b>200</b>. This is particularly useful when an empty container is removed from the housing, filled with powdered material and then returned. Returning the filled container <b>178</b> normally would require additional effort on the part of the operator and as such the return forces in the assist system <b>280</b> help make the return easier.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, the beverage system also includes a communications system or means <b>300</b> for communicating <b>302</b> between a corresponding beverage brewing, beverage making apparatus or beverage dispensing modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>and a receiver or base station <b>304</b>. Each of the modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>includes a controller <b>76</b>, <b>76</b><i>a </i>which is centralized for use with multiple modules or dedicated to an individual module. The controller collects information about the module or modules. For purposes of this present discussion, we will refer to the controller as being dedicated to multiple modules and receiving information from each individual module associated therewith. The many modules associated with a single control also provides the added benefit of the modular assembly as described hereinabove. It should also be noted that the details of the circuitry used to achieve the communication system are illustrated in the detailed schematics provided in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21-28</figref> and all corresponding sub-portions thereof. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> is a general schematic of the overall system. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 22-28</figref> provide details about the general system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> has been noted with cross reference to the other figures which provide details about the portions of the circuitry shown generally in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The controllers <b>76</b>, <b>76</b><i>a </i>include the link <b>302</b> which connects the controller to the corresponding receiver or base station <b>304</b>. In the present embodiment as diagrammatically illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>, the controllers <b>76</b>, <b>76</b><i>a </i>communicate with the receiver <b>304</b> by way of an RF link <b>302</b>. Generally, the controllers are remote from the receiver and use the link <b>302</b> and the associated means for linking to communicate the collected information about the beverage making apparatus. Antennae <b>306</b>, <b>308</b> are provided on the controllers <b>76</b>, <b>76</b><i>a </i>and the corresponding receivers <b>304</b> respectively. It should be noted that the communication link <b>302</b> may be in any one of a variety of forms such as hardwired physical point-to-point link, optical lines, light wave, ultrasonic, infrared or any other form of communication link between one or more devices.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The receiver <b>304</b> receives information from the controller or various components of the modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>to identify information relating to the modules and operation of the modules. The receiver <b>304</b> may be in the form of a monitoring unit positioned in an appropriate location relative to an operator or attendant who has responsibility for or otherwise maintains the modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a</i>. The receiver <b>304</b> includes a means for displaying display <b>305</b> and can provide visual auditor or other information about numerous conditions. The display <b>304</b> allows a form of the collected information about the beverage making apparatus to be displayed at the receiver. The visual display may include, but is not limited to lights, text, symbolic images (i.e., dispenser &#x201c;full&#x201d; showing a colored or shaded dispenser and a dispenser &#x201c;empty&#x201d; showing an unshaded dispenser), and mechanical devices that are operated or other visual displays. An auditory display may include, but is not limited to speech information, alarms, tones or other signals that can be heard. Tactile displays are also contemplated in the form of a vibrating surface, vibrating device worn by the operator or other means for letting the operator or other means for letting the operator know about the collected information. For example, the following is a list of the messages or conditions which can be displayed:</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Receiver fault;</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Please wait attempting communication;</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Communication failure, coffee module #;</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">Communication fault, soluble module #;</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Flavor [type.] low, coffee module #;</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Flavor [type] low, soluble module #;</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Hopper low, soluble module #;</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Hopper empty, soluble module #;</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Coffee empty, coffee module #;</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Coffee low, coffee module #;</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Freshness expired, coffee module #;</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Dumping in <sub>&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;</sub> minutes, coffee unit #;</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Server removed, coffee module #;</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Refill too long;</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Temperature probe open;</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Temperature probe short;</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Heating too long;</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Over flow safety;</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Coffee stations all OK; and</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Soluble stations all OK.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">For example, in an convenience store setting, multiple modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>may be generally remotely positioned in one portion of the store, for example, a rearward location of the store, if desired. The operator of the beverage system may also be the same person responsible for stocking of the equipment, and register activities. As such, one person is required to operate and maintain many components of the convenience store facility. The receiver <b>304</b> may be positioned at the cash register so that while the attendant is operating the cash register he may also be notified of matters that require his attention at the modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">For example, if a module <b>32</b><i>a </i>indicates that a container <b>68</b> is empty the controller <b>76</b> will communicate with the receiver <b>304</b> to indicate this condition. The receiver may also be configured with audible alarms and visual displays to provide additional information. For example, a display may identify which module and the specific condition associated with the module which has provided a signal to the receiver <b>304</b>. The operator can then make a decision how to use that information relative to his responsibilities at the cash register. If an emergency requires immediate attention he can secure the cash register and address the emergency while attending to the module <b>32</b>. Alternatively, if it is a slow period in the store and a module is indicating that a container <b>68</b> is empty he can put off attending to this condition until he completes one or more transactions in queue.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">The signal communication between the controller <b>76</b> and the receiver <b>304</b> may be a single path signal or in the form of a multiple path verification signal. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> a first signal <b>310</b> is transmitted from the controller <b>76</b> to the receiver <b>304</b>. This initial communication may report the status of a condition at the module <b>32</b>. The receiver <b>304</b> can then return a copy of the information <b>312</b> to the controller <b>76</b>. If the controller confirms the information received (<b>312</b>) it can then send a return confirmation <b>314</b> that the information is correct.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">This is a useful communication link in the present situation due to the presence of electrical noise and other interference within other beverage system applications. For example, each of the components associated with the modules <b>32</b>, <b>32</b><i>a </i>may provide some degree of electrical or other noise. Additionally, other systems within the beverage system setting may be producing RF or other signals which could create interference. As such, the present embodiment providing the verification communication links <b>310</b>-<b>314</b> helps facilitate and assure accurate and timely communication. In the event of excessive interference such as from patrons of the store using telephone or RF communication devices, the controller <b>76</b> can continue to periodically send a message <b>310</b> to the receiver <b>304</b> until the verification signal <b>312</b> is received.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">While preferred embodiments are disclosed, illustrated and described, it is envisioned that those skilled in the art may devise various modifications and equivalents without departing from the spirit and scope of the disclosure as recited in the following claims.</p>
