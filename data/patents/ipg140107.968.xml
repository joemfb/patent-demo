<heading id="h-0001" level="1">REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to German Application No. 10 2010 004 961.1-15 filed on Jan. 20, 2010.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to a power tool, particularly a power tool that is operated by hand, preferably a hammer drill.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A power tool such as a hammer drill usually includes a drive motor, a tool spindle to drive a tool in rotary manner, a rotary drive transmission to couple the drive motor to the tool spindle, a hammer mechanism to drive the tool in percussive manner, a hammer mechanism transmission to couple the drive motor to the hammer mechanism, and a switching device to activate and deactivate the hammer mechanism.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The disclosed power tool includes a switching device with a clutch that is integrated in the force path of the hammer mechanism transmission and has an actuation stroke for advancing and withdrawing, that is to say activating an deactivating, the hammer mechanism. The switching device is also designed so that a stroke direction of this actuation stroke extends perpendicularly to the axis of rotation of the tool spindle, or parallel to an axis of rotation of an element that is rotated manually to actuate the switching device. The actuation stroke may also extend perpendicularly to the axis of rotation of the tool spindle and parallel to the axis of rotation of the actuating element at the same time. In this case, the actuation stroke of the clutch corresponds to a linear displacement movement of a corresponding coupling member that causes the clutch to be advanced and withdrawn. Due to the orientation of the actuation stroke perpendicularly to the axis of rotation of the tool spindle and/or parallel to the axis of rotation of the actuating element as well as the integration of the clutch in the hammer mechanism transmission, the switching device is able to be located close to the tool spindle, thus enabling a construction of the power tool that is more compact overall.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">According to one advantageous embodiment, the clutch may be integrated in the force path of the hammer mechanism transmission particularly easily if the hammer mechanism transmission is furnished on the input side with a driving gearwheel that is rotatable about an axis of rotation, and if the hammer mechanism transmission is furnished on the output side with a crank drive wheel that is supported so as to be rotatable about the axis of rotation of the driving gearwheel and which drives a connecting rod of the hammer mechanism when the hammer mechanism is activated. Inside the hammer mechanism transmission, the clutch includes a clutch ring arranged coaxially with the axis of rotation of the driving gearwheel, and on the crank drive wheel so as to be non-rotatable but axially displaceable on the crank drive wheel. Then, this clutch ring cooperates with the driving gearwheel to advance and withdraw the clutch in such manner that when the clutch ring is in the advanced state it transmits a torque from the driving gearwheel to the crank drive wheel, and when it is in the withdrawn state torque is not transmitted from the driving gearwheel to the crank drive wheel. The construction described here enables the clutch to be integrated in the hammer mechanism transmission in particularly compact manner.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to a practical refinement of this arrangement, the driving gearwheel may include a slaving contour on the axial side facing the crank drive wheel, while a slaving contour corresponding to the slaving contour of the driving gearwheel is provided on the axial side of the clutch ring facing the driving gearwheel, and when the clutch ring is advanced this contour cooperates with the slaving contour on the driving gearwheel to transmit a torque, and when the clutch ring is withdrawn the slaving contour is axially separated therefrom. The axial slaving contours are capable of transmitting large torques and require only a small installation space.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A further refinement is then particularly practical, according to which the switching device has an actuating device for advancing and withdrawing the clutch, and which couples a manually operable actuating element with a displaceable coupling member of the clutch. It is expedient if the coupling member is the clutch ring. The actuating element, which is preferably arranged on the outside of a housing of the power tool, enables engagement with the hammer mechanism transmission, and thus with the clutch, so that it may be advanced and withdrawn.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The actuating device may preferably be equipped with a stroke element that is coupled to the clutch ring via at least one arm section extending parallel to the axis of rotation of the driving gearwheel, so that a stroke displacement of the stroke element away from and parallel to the axis of rotation of the driving gearwheel entrains the clutch ring, thereby extending it. In this way, the actuating device spans across crank drive wheel with the respective arm section of the stroke element to engage with the clutch ring. This enables the actuating device to be disposed coaxially with the axis of rotation of the driving gearwheel for a particularly economical arrangement in terms of space.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">According to a further advantageous embodiment, in order to create a rotationally immovable and axially displaceable coupling between the clutch ring and the crank drive wheel, an axial section of the crank drive wheel may be equipped with an exterior slaving contour while the clutch ring is furnished with an interior slaving contour mating therewith, so that the clutch ring is arranged on the crank drive wheel via these slaving contours in non-rotating but axially displaceable manner with respect to the crank drive wheel. In this case, a particularly practical refinement may be realised if the slaving contours have polygonal profiles. These enable transmission of particularly large torques while causing low wear. The suggested design enables particularly compact construction with high functional reliability.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Further important features and advantages of the inventions are explained in the subordinate claims, the drawing, and the associated description of the figures with reference to the drawing.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Of course, the features described in the preceding and those that will be explained in the remainder of this document may be implemented not only in the combination cited in each case, but also in other combinations or alone without exceeding the scope of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a power tool <b>1</b> that is operable by hand, and which is represented as a hammer drill in the example, includes a housing <b>41</b> having for example an L-shape, since a spindle section <b>59</b> of housing <b>41</b> and a motor section <b>60</b> of housing <b>41</b> are offset relative to one another by about 90&#xb0;. A tool spindle <b>3</b> extends inside spindle section <b>59</b>, and the end of this spindle that protrudes from housing <b>41</b> supports a tool chuck <b>61</b>. A drive motor <b>2</b> is accommodated inside motor sections <b>60</b>. The lengthwise direction of spindle section <b>59</b> is defined by the axis of rotation <b>8</b> of tool spindle <b>3</b> and it extends parallel therewith. The lengthwise direction of motor section <b>60</b> is defined by the axis of rotation <b>18</b> of a drive shaft of drive motor <b>2</b> and it extends parallel therewith.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Housing <b>41</b> has a handle section <b>62</b> that extends parallel to motor housing <b>60</b> and which in the example is attached at the two opposite ends thereof, to spindle section <b>59</b> at one end and to motor section <b>60</b> at the other. Hammer drill <b>1</b> or the power tool may be connected to an external power supply via a cable <b>63</b> in handle section <b>62</b>. In an alternative embodiment, hammer drill <b>1</b> may also be equipped with a rechargeable battery, so that it may be operated without connection to an electricity network.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows hammer drill <b>1</b> in a typical upright or vertical working position, in which spindle section <b>59</b> is orientated horizontally while motor section <b>60</b> is orientated vertically. Accordingly, an upper side <b>64</b> and a lower side <b>65</b> are defined for hammer drill <b>1</b> and its housing <b>41</b>. An actuating element <b>28</b> of a switching device <b>7</b> is arranged on an area of housing <b>41</b> marked with II on upper side <b>64</b> thereof. This area II is located vertically above motor section <b>60</b>, particularly in the area of a connecting point <b>66</b> between handle section <b>62</b> and spindle section <b>59</b>. Switching device <b>7</b> services to activate and deactivate a hammer mechanism or hammer action of hammer drill <b>1</b>. When the hammer action is deactivated, hammer drill <b>1</b> may be used as a simple drill. Switching device <b>7</b> includes an actuating element <b>28</b> that is operable manually to engage or disengage the hammer mechanism. For this purpose, actuating element <b>28</b> is arranged so as to be rotatable about an axis of rotation <b>37</b>. In the example, axis of rotation <b>37</b> extends parallel to the axis of rotation <b>18</b> of drive motor <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>, a manually operable hammer drill <b>1</b> of such kind includes a drive motor <b>2</b>, a tool spindle <b>3</b>, a rotary drive transmission <b>4</b>, a hammer mechanism <b>5</b>, a hammer mechanism transmission <b>6</b> and a switching device <b>7</b>. During operation, tool spindle <b>3</b> rotates about an axis of rotation <b>8</b> and serves to drive a tool particularly a hammer drill tool, not shown here, in rotary manner. Rotary drive transmission <b>4</b> couples drive motor <b>2</b> with tool spindle <b>3</b>. Hammer mechanism <b>5</b> serves to drive the tool with percussive action. In the example, hammer mechanism <b>2</b> is operated pneumatically. Hammer mechanism transmission <b>6</b> couples drive motor <b>2</b> with hammer mechanism <b>5</b>. Hammer mechanism <b>5</b> may be activated and deactivated via switching device <b>7</b>. When hammer mechanism <b>5</b> is deactivated, hammer drill <b>1</b> may be used as a simple drill, so that the respective tool is then driven only in rotary manner, without hammer action.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Switching device <b>7</b> is equipped with a clutch <b>9</b> that is integrated in the force path <b>10</b> of hammer mechanism transmission <b>6</b>&#x2014;indicated by a broken line. Clutch <b>9</b> has an actuating stroke <b>11</b>, indicated by a double-headed arrow, which extends perpendicularly to axis of rotation <b>8</b> of tool spindle <b>3</b>. Actuating stroke <b>11</b> is characterized by the direction of movement of a coupling member <b>12</b>, in which coupling member <b>12</b> is displaceable in order to advance and withdraw clutch <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">In the embodiments shown here, coupling member <b>12</b> is a clutch ring, which will also be designated with the number <b>12</b> in the following. This clutch ring <b>12</b> is arranged inside hammer mechanism transmission <b>6</b>. In force path <b>10</b>, clutch ring <b>12</b> is located between a driving gearwheel <b>13</b> of hammer mechanism transmission <b>6</b> on its input side and a crank drive wheel <b>14</b> of hammer mechanism transmission <b>6</b> on its output side. Driving gearwheel <b>13</b> engages with a drive sprocket <b>15</b> of a drive shaft <b>16</b> of drive motor <b>2</b>. Driving gearwheel <b>13</b> is supported so as to be rotatable about an axis of rotation <b>17</b>, which in the example extends parallel with an axis of rotation <b>18</b> which in the example extends parallel of drive shaft <b>16</b> of drive motor <b>2</b>. At the same time, driving gearwheel <b>13</b> is supported in rotatable manner on a static shaft <b>19</b>. Crank drive wheel <b>14</b> is also supported so as to be rotatable about the axis of rotation <b>17</b> of driving gearwheel <b>13</b>. In the example, crank drive wheel <b>14</b> is also supported rotatably on static shaft <b>19</b>. When hammer mechanism <b>5</b> is activated, crank drive wheel <b>4</b> drives a connecting rod <b>20</b> of hammer mechanism <b>5</b>, driving a piston <b>21</b> in oscillating manner for example, which piston is supported inside the hollow tool spindle <b>3</b> so as to be displaceable in linear manner.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Clutch ring <b>12</b> is arranged on crank drive wheel <b>14</b> and coaxially with the axis of rotation <b>17</b> of driving gearwheel <b>13</b> in such manner that is axially displaceable on crank drive wheel <b>14</b> and at the same time coupled non-rotatably therewith. As illustrated in exemplary manner in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>, this capability of axial movement simultaneously with rotational immobilisation as achieved with an axial gear arrangement. In the embodiments shows here, crank drive wheel <b>14</b> has an axial section <b>22</b> that extends coaxially with axis of rotation <b>17</b> of driving gearwheel <b>13</b>. This axial section <b>22</b> has a slaving contour <b>23</b> extending axially on its radial periphery that cooperates with a complementary slaving contour <b>56</b> on clutch ring <b>12</b>. Consequently, the two cooperating slaving contours <b>23</b>, <b>56</b> allow an arrangement in which clutch ring <b>12</b> is able to move axially along the cylindrical section <b>22</b> of crank drive wheel <b>14</b> but is immobilised in the radial direction. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref>, the one slaving contour <b>23</b> has at least one axial ridge, while the other slaving contour <b>56</b> has at least one axially extending seating groove mating therewith. Alternatively, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows an embodiment in which crank drive wheel <b>4</b> has a polygonal profile <b>57</b> on the exterior thereof, while clutch ring <b>12</b> has a interior polygonal profile <b>58</b> that is conformed to mate with exterior polygonal profile <b>57</b>. When they are engaged with one another, these two cooperating polygonal profiles <b>57</b>, <b>58</b> create a coupling between clutch ring <b>12</b> and crank drive wheel <b>14</b> that is radially fixed and axially movable.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, exterior slaving contour <b>23</b> on crank drive wheel <b>14</b> is constructed as an externally located polygonal profile, while interior slaving contour <b>56</b> on clutch ring <b>12</b> is constructed as in internally located polygonal profile <b>58</b> in complementary manner thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Besides crank drive wheel <b>14</b> and clutch ring <b>12</b>, the section of clutch <b>9</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is also shown to be fitted with driving gearwheel <b>13</b>, a needle bearing <b>67</b> for supporting driving gearwheel <b>13</b> on shaft <b>19</b>, a disc <b>68</b>, a thrust spring <b>50</b> for biasing clutch ring <b>12</b> axially against driving gearwheel <b>13</b>, a needle bearing <b>69</b> to support crank drive wheel <b>14</b> on shaft <b>19</b>, a disc <b>70</b>, and a retaining ring <b>71</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The axial side of driving gearwheel <b>13</b> facing crank drive wheel <b>14</b> is furnished with a slaving contour <b>24</b>. The axial side of clutch ring <b>12</b> facing driving gearwheel <b>13</b> is also furnished with a slaving contour <b>25</b> that is conformed in complementary manner to the slaving contour <b>24</b> on driving gearwheel <b>13</b>. When clutch ring <b>12</b>, and thus also clutch <b>9</b>, is in the advanced state, the two slaving contours <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> cooperate to transmit torque, and when clutch ring <b>12</b> is withdrawn they are no longer engaged with one another and no torque is transmitted. The one slaving contour <b>24</b> for example may be equipped with at least one pin, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, while the other slaving contour <b>25</b> have be furnished with at least one matching recess to accommodate the pin, in which the pin may engage axially.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, clutch ring <b>12</b>, and thus also clutch <b>9</b>, is shown in the advanced position. Axial slaving contours <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> of driving gearwheel <b>13</b> and clutch ring <b>12</b> are engaged with one another and complete force path <b>10</b> for transmitting torque from driving gearwheel <b>13</b> to crank drive wheel <b>14</b> via clutch ring <b>12</b>. Thus when clutch <b>9</b> and together with clutch ring <b>12</b> is in the advanced position, hammer mechanism <b>5</b> is activated.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In contrast to this, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> shows hammer mechanism <b>5</b> in the deactivated state. For this, clutch ring <b>12</b>, and thus also clutch <b>9</b>, is withdrawn so that slaving contours <b>24</b>, <b>25</b> on driving gearwheel <b>13</b> and clutch ring <b>12</b>, which have been designed to engage with another, are disengaged. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> show an axial separation <b>26</b> that prevents engagement and the transmission of any torque In this way, force path <b>10</b> is interrupted.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In the embodiments shown here, switching device <b>7</b> is equipped with an actuation device <b>27</b>. This includes a manually operable actuating element <b>28</b> and a stroke element <b>29</b>. Actuation device <b>27</b> couples clutch ring <b>12</b> with actuating element <b>28</b> so that clutch <b>9</b>, and thus also clutch ring <b>12</b>, may be advanced and withdrawn. In this context, the movement is created via stroke element <b>29</b>. The stroke element is furnished with at least one arm section <b>30</b>, which extends parallel to the axis of rotation <b>17</b> of driving gearwheel <b>13</b>. In the examples presented here, stroke element <b>29</b> is furnished with two such arm sections <b>30</b>, which are arranged diametrically opposite one another with respect to axis of rotation <b>17</b> of driving gearwheel <b>13</b>. In other words, the two arm sections <b>30</b> are disposed at an angle of 180&#xb0; to one another. This means that they are arranged on opposite sides of axis of rotation <b>17</b> of driving gearwheel <b>13</b>. Respective arm section <b>30</b> is coupled with clutch ring <b>12</b> in such manner that when stroke element <b>29</b> is moved away from driving gearwheel <b>13</b> in a stroke path extending parallel to axis of rotation <b>17</b> of driving gearwheel <b>13</b>, it picks up and withdraws clutch ring <b>12</b>, and advances the clutch ring when it moves in the opposite direction.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Stroke element <b>29</b> includes an annular section <b>31</b>, from which the two arm sections <b>30</b> project, and which is aligned coaxially with axis of rotation <b>17</b> of driving gearwheel <b>13</b> and is located on a side of crank drive wheel <b>14</b> facing away from driving gearwheel <b>13</b>. Arm sections <b>30</b> extend over the sides of crank drive wheel <b>14</b> and terminate close to clutch ring <b>12</b>. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>5</b> and <b>6</b>, arm sections <b>30</b> are reinforced with bracing elements <b>32</b>. Bracing elements <b>32</b> are essentially U-shaped and engage behind clutch ring <b>12</b>. In particular, a U-base <b>33</b> of the respective bracing clip <b>32</b> lies flush against the rest of the body of the respective arm section <b>30</b>. A leg of the U-shape <b>34</b> proximal to clutch ring <b>12</b> serves to clasp or engage behind clutch ring <b>12</b>. A leg of the U-shape <b>35</b> distal to clutch ring <b>12</b> engages in a corresponding recess in annular section <b>31</b>. Because it is braced by these clips <b>32</b>, stroke element <b>29</b> may be injection moulded from plastic, while the bracing clips <b>32</b> themselves are made from metal, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Actuating device <b>27</b> may be equipped with a stroke drive <b>36</b>, as shown particularly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. This stroke drive may convert the manual operation of actuating element <b>28</b> into a stroke displacement of stroke element <b>29</b>. In this context, stroke drive <b>36</b> is designed in such manner that it converts a rotary operation of actuating element <b>28</b> about an axis of rotation <b>37</b> into a stroke displacement of stroke element <b>29</b> in a direction parallel to this axis of rotation <b>37</b>. In the preferred examples shown here, the axis of rotation <b>37</b> of actuating element <b>28</b> is coincident with the axis of rotation <b>17</b> of driving gearwheel <b>13</b>, with the result that the stroke of stroke element <b>29</b> also extends parallel to axis of rotation <b>17</b>. In this context, stroke drive <b>36</b> cooperates with annular section <b>31</b> of stroke element <b>29</b>. For this purpose, annular section <b>31</b> may be furnished with at least one sliding member <b>38</b> protruding radially inwards, as illustrated in the embodiment shown here. In the example, three such sliding members <b>38</b> are provided, and are arranged at equal distances from each other about the circumference.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Stroke drive <b>36</b> is equipped with a bushing <b>39</b>, which is rotatable coaxially with annular section <b>31</b>. This bushing <b>39</b> is furnished radially outwardly with at least one shoulder <b>40</b>, which rises axially in the periopheral direction of bushing <b>39</b>. In the example, one such shoulder <b>40</b> is provided on each sliding member <b>38</b>. Accordingly, bushing <b>39</b> has three shoulders <b>40</b> arranged about the circumference thereof. Each shoulder cooperates with one of the sliding members <b>38</b> in such manner that a rotary displacement of bushing <b>39</b> is converted into a stroke displacement of stroke element <b>29</b>. Stroke element <b>29</b> arranged so as to be rotationally immovable but stroke-displaceable in housing <b>41</b> or a housing compartment of hammer drill <b>1</b>. When bushing <b>39</b> is rotated, sliding members <b>38</b> slide along the respective shoulder <b>40</b>, causing a stroke displacement of stroke element <b>29</b>. In order to protect the respective upper or lower end position of stroke element <b>29</b>, the lower and/or upper end(s) of shoulders <b>40</b> may be equipped with a detent stage <b>42</b>. When it reaches the respective end position, sliding member <b>38</b> engages with the associated detent stage <b>42</b> creating a haptically perceptible non-positive locking safety catch in the manner of a pressure point, and making it difficult or impossible for bushing <b>39</b> and thus also actuating element <b>28</b> to move on its own.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Actuating element <b>28</b> is connected in non-rotating manner with bushing <b>39</b>. For example, a screw <b>43</b> is screwed from the inside through bushing <b>29</b> and into actuating element <b>28</b> for this purpose. Actuating element <b>28</b> is arranged on an external side of housing <b>41</b> of hammer drill <b>1</b>. On the other hand, bushing <b>39</b> is arranged on an internal side of housing <b>41</b>. A gasket <b>44</b> may be located between bushing <b>39</b> and housing <b>41</b> to seal housing <b>41</b> in the area of a passthrough <b>45</b>. This gasket <b>44</b> is designed in such manner that it permits rotary movements of bushing <b>39</b>. Bushing <b>39</b> may be furnished with a cylindrical extension <b>46</b> that protrudes through passthrough <b>45</b> from the inside to the outside of housing <b>41</b> to create a rotationally locked connection between actuating element <b>28</b> and bushing <b>39</b>. Extension <b>46</b> has a plurality of radial gaps <b>47</b> that are engaged in positive locking manner by sections of actuating element <b>28</b>. This is illustrated clearly in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Stroke element <b>29</b> is furnished with outwardly projecting longitudinal guides <b>48</b> in the area of its arm sections <b>30</b>, in which guide elements <b>49</b> of housing <b>41</b> engage as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 5</figref>. In this way, a linear guide is created for stroke element <b>29</b>, helping to ensure precise stroke displacement.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 5</figref> and <b>7</b>, a thrust spring <b>50</b> may also be provided to force clutch ring <b>12</b> axially against driving gearwheel <b>13</b>. Thrust spring <b>50</b> thus forces clutch ring <b>12</b> into the advanced position.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Rotary drive transmission <b>4</b> may expediently be a crown wheel <b>51</b> with axial spur gearing, and which also engages with drive sprocket <b>15</b> of drive motor <b>2</b> on the side diametrically opposite driving gearwheel <b>13</b>. Crown wheel <b>51</b> is supported rotatably on tool spindle <b>3</b> and cooperates with a torque-dependent coupling <b>52</b>. Torque-dependent coupling <b>52</b> includes a drive ring <b>53</b> that is arranged in rotationally fixed and axially displaceable manner on tool spindle <b>3</b> and is forced against crown wheel <b>51</b> with the aid of biasing spring <b>54</b>. Coupling bodies <b>55</b> enable ring <b>53</b> and thus also tool spindle <b>3</b> to be driven. If the torque that is transmitted to tool spindle <b>3</b> from crown wheel <b>51</b> exceeds a predefined limit value, coupling bodies <b>55</b> displace ring <b>53</b> against the biasing force of spring <b>54</b> and crown wheel <b>51</b> is able to continue rotating when tool spindle <b>3</b> is stationary.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The foregoing description is only exemplary of the principles of the invention. Many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above teachings. It is, therefore, to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise than using the example embodiments which have been specifically described.
