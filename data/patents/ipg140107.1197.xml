<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a sheet processing apparatus which performs a process of, for example, double folding a sheet bundle made of a plurality of sheets, and discharging the same so as to be stacked, and an image forming apparatus including this sheet processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Conventionally, an image forming apparatus for forming an image on a sheet, such as a copying machine, and a laser beam printer, may be provided with a sheet processing apparatus for bringing a sheet, on which an image has been formed, into a bundle state, performing a binding process at the substantially central portion, and performing a folding process, etc., so as to perform a saddle stitch bookbinding. In a sheet processing apparatus illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 21 to 23</figref>, sheets, on which images have been formed, are stored in a storage portion <b>803</b> so as to be bundled, and a binding process is performed at a substantially central portion of the sheet bundle. Moreover, the sheet bundle is jabbed at its substantially central portion by a jabbing member <b>830</b> so as to be put into a nip portion of a pair of folding rollers <b>810</b>. A double folding process is performed to the sheet bundle while being conveyed by the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b>. Then, a folded end portion processing is performed in order to further strengthen the folded end portion of the sheet bundle (which is called &#x201c;folded bundle&#x201d; hereinafter) to which a double folding processing has been performed. After that, the folded bundle is discharged to a folded bundle tray <b>840</b> so as to be stacked (refer to Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. 2008-184311).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref> illustrates a flow chart when a folding process is performed to a second copy or succeeding copies in the conventional apparatus mentioned above. When a saddle stitch bookbinding mode is selected, a sheet is stored in a storage portion <b>803</b>, and aligning and stapling processes are performed (S<b>101</b>). After that, a sheet bundle, to which the stapling process has been performed, is jabbed by the jabbing member <b>830</b> at its substantially central portion where the stapling process has been performed so as to be pushed into the nip portion of the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b>. A double folding process is performed to the sheet bundle while being conveyed by the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b> (S<b>102</b>). The folded bundle to which the folding process has been performed is stopped at a position where its folded end portion is subjected to a folded end portion processing by a press unit <b>860</b> (S<b>103</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Then, the folded end portion processing is performed (S<b>104</b>), but, during this folded end potion processing, the folded bundle P<b>1</b>, which has already been discharged and stacked on the folded bundle tray <b>840</b>, is positioned outside the moving region of the press unit <b>860</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref>). Then, after finishing the folded end portion processing of the succeeding folded bundle P<b>2</b>, conveyer belts <b>844</b>, <b>845</b> are reversely rotated so that the folded bundle P<b>1</b> positioned outside the moving region is moved back to a bundle receiving position adjacent to a pair of second folding conveying rollers <b>812</b> (S<b>105</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Note that the moving back amount L of this folded bundle is determined according to the kind of sheet to be used, such that, when the succeeding folded bundle P<b>2</b> is discharged, the leading edge (the downstream edge in the conveying direction) of the succeeding folded bundle P<b>2</b> is positioned downstream in the conveying direction of the trailing edge (the upstream edge in the conveying direction) of the preceding folded bundle P<b>1</b> which has already been stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">After that, the folded bundle P<b>2</b> is discharged to the folded bundle tray <b>840</b> (S<b>106</b>), and the conveyer belts <b>844</b>, <b>845</b> are forwardly rotated so that the folded bundles are stacked in imbricate state, thereby preventing a sheet jam or a sheet bending (S<b>107</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">At this time, when the length of the folded bundle P<b>2</b>, to which the folded end portion processing is to be performed, in the conveying direction is included within bundle conveying guides <b>813</b>, <b>814</b>, the trailing edge of the folded bundle is located outside the storage region (stacking region) of the storage portion <b>803</b>. Therefore, during the folded end portion processing of the folded bundle, a sheet of the succeeding sheet bundle can be conveyed to the storage portion <b>803</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">However, when the length of the folded bundle P<b>2</b>, to which the folded end portion processing is to be performed, in the conveying direction is not included within the bundle conveying guides <b>813</b>, <b>814</b>, the trailing edge of the folded bundle remains in the storage region of the storage portion <b>803</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>). In this case, after finishing the folded end portion processing, this succeeding folded bundle P<b>2</b> cannot be discharged until the trailing edge of the preceding folded bundle P<b>1</b>, which has already been discharged and stacked on the folded bundle tray <b>840</b>, is finally moved back to the position adjacent to the pair of second folding conveying rollers <b>812</b>. Accordingly, the start of conveying the succeeding sheet bundle to the sheet storage portion is delayed, thereby causing a problem that the productivity is deteriorated in the conventional control method.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Moreover, if the conveying length of the bundle conveying guides <b>813</b>, <b>814</b> is increased so as to correspond to the length of the folded bundle P<b>2</b>, to which the folded end portion processing is performed, in the conveying direction, such that the folded bundle P<b>2</b> is included within the bundle conveying guides <b>813</b>, <b>814</b>, although the deterioration of productivity can be prevented, there is a problem that the size of apparatus is caused to be increased.</p>

<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Therefore, the present invention is intended to enable the productivity to be enhanced without increasing the size of apparatus, even when the end portion of the folded bundle, to which the folded end portion processing is to be performed, remains in the stacking region where the succeeding sheet bundle is to be stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to the present invention, there is provided a sheet processing apparatus including: a sheet stacking portion on which a sheet being sent is stacked; a folding portion which performs a double folding process to a sheet bundle made of a plurality of sheets which are stacked on the sheet stacking portion; a folded bundle conveying portion which conveys a folded bundle double folded by the folding portion; a folded end portion processing portion which processes a folded end portion of the folded bundle by abutting the folded end portion and moving in a direction orthogonal to a conveying direction; a folded bundle stacking portion on which a folded bundle discharged from the folded bundle conveying portion is stacked; a folded bundle transfer portion disposed on the folded bundle stacking portion, the folded bundle transfer portion moving the folded bundle stacked on the folded bundle stacking portion between a first stacking position where an upstream edge thereof in a conveying direction does not interfere with the folded end portion processing portion during a folded end portion processing, and a second stacking position which is closer to the folded bundle conveying portion than the first stacking position, such that the upstream edge in the conveying direction of the folded bundle stacked on the folded bundle stacking portion is positioned upstream in the conveying direction of a downstream edge in the conveying direction of the folded bundle to be discharged by the folded bundle conveying portion; and a controller which controls operations of the folded bundle conveying portion, the folded end portion processing portion, and the folded bundle transfer portion, wherein the controller controls the folded bundle transfer portion so that, after a preceding folded bundle stacked on the folded bundle stacking portion has been moved to the first stacking position, the preceding folded bundle is moved to the second stacking position such that a succeeding folded bundle discharged to the folded bundle stacking portion abuts the preceding folded bundle, and controls the folded bundle conveying portion so that, in case the succeeding folded bundle has a length in the conveying direction that the upstream edge in the conveying direction of the succeeding folded bundle remains within a stacking region of the sheet stacking portion when the succeeding folded bundle is temporarily stopped for the folded end portion processing, after the folded end portion processing has been applied, the succeeding folded bundle is conveyed until the upstream edge in the conveying direction of the succeeding folded bundle passes through outside the stacking region of the sheet stacking portion before the preceding folded bundle has been finally moved to the second stacking position.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to the present invention, when the trailing edge of the folded bundle remains in the stacking region of the sheet stacking portion during the processing of the folded end portion, before finishing the moving back of the folded bundle stacked on the folded bundle stacking portion to the upstream of the conveying direction, the folded bundle, of which the folded end portion processing has been finished, is conveyed until the trailing edge thereof is moved out of the stacking region of the sheet stacking portion. With this, the sheet of the sheet bundle to be folded next can be conveyed to the sheet stacking portion with a timing earlier than that of the conventional apparatus, thereby, the productivity can be enhanced without changing the apparatus configuration or increasing the size of the apparatus.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Hereinafter, an exemplary embodiment of the present invention is described in detail with reference to the drawings. Note that, sizes, materials, shapes, or relative positions of components, which are described in the following embodiment, should be suitably changed according to the configuration and various conditions of the apparatus to which the present invention is applied. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention is not intended to be limited to them as long as there is no specific description.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">(Image Forming Apparatus)</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a configuration diagram of the image forming apparatus and the sheet processing apparatus. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the image forming apparatus <b>1000</b> includes an image forming apparatus main body <b>600</b> for performing a black-and-white/color image forming, and a saddle stitch bookbinding apparatus (which is called a &#x201c;finisher&#x201d; hereinafter) <b>500</b> as a sheet processing apparatus connected thereto. Accordingly, the sheet discharged from the image forming apparatus main body <b>600</b> can be processed by the on-line connected finisher <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Note that, the image forming apparatus main body <b>600</b> can be used independently without being connected to the discharge port of the finisher <b>500</b>. The finisher <b>500</b> may be integrally assembled into the image forming apparatus main body <b>600</b> as a sheet discharging apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Here, the position where a user faces an operation portion <b>601</b> for performing various inputs/settings to the image forming apparatus main body <b>600</b> is called a front near side (a near side, hereinafter) of the image forming apparatus, and the apparatus rear side is called a back side. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates the configuration of the image forming apparatus viewed from the apparatus near side. The finisher <b>500</b> is connected to the side portion of the image forming apparatus main body <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The image forming apparatus main body <b>600</b> includes an original feed portion <b>100</b>, an image reader portion <b>200</b>, and a printer portion <b>300</b>. The original feed portion <b>100</b> sequentially feeds original copies sheet by sheet to the image reading position of the image reader portion <b>200</b>. The image reader portion <b>200</b> reads an image of an original. The printer portion <b>300</b> is provided with an image forming portion including a photosensitive drum, a developing device, and a transferring portion. An electrostatic latent image formed on the photosensitive drum is developed by the developing device with toner based on image information of the original read by the image reader portion <b>200</b> or image information which has been sent. Then, the toner image is transferred to the sheet which has been timely fed to the transferring portion, and the transferred toner image is fixed by heat and pressure on the sheet in the fixing device so as to form an image.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">A four color toner image is transferred on the sheet P fed from cassettes <b>909</b><i>a</i>, <b>909</b><i>b </i>in the image forming apparatus main body <b>600</b> by photosensitive drums <b>914</b><i>a </i>to <b>914</b><i>d </i>of yellow, magenta, cyan, and black, respectively constituting the image forming portions. The above sheet P is conveyed to a fixing device <b>904</b> so that a toner image is fixed thereon, and in a one-sided image forming mode, the sheet P is directly discharged from a pair of discharge rollers <b>907</b> outside the apparatus main body. In a two-sided image forming mode, the sheet P is transferred from the fixing device <b>904</b> to a reverse roller <b>905</b>. When the trailing edge of the sheet in the conveying direction has been moved beyond a reverse switching portion, the reverse roller <b>905</b> is reversely rotated so as to be conveyed in the direction of both sides conveying rollers <b>906</b><i>a </i>to <b>906</b><i>f </i>which is opposite to the conveying direction. Then, a four color toner image is transferred again on the rear side of the above sheet P by yellow, magenta, cyan, and black photosensitive drums <b>914</b><i>a </i>to <b>914</b><i>d</i>, etc. The sheet P, in which images have been transferred on its both sides, is conveyed again to the fixing device <b>904</b> so as to fix the toner images, and discharged from the pair of discharge rollers <b>907</b> outside the apparatus main body.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">(Finisher <b>500</b>)</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The finisher <b>500</b> is configured to align a plurality of sheets conveyed from the image forming apparatus main body <b>600</b>, and process the sheets.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the finisher <b>500</b> includes a conveying path <b>520</b> for taking a conveyed sheet into the inside of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">A switching member <b>513</b> disposed on the terminal of the conveying path <b>520</b> is configured to switch an upper discharge path <b>521</b> and a lower discharge path <b>522</b> which are connected to the downstream. The upper discharge path <b>521</b> is configured to guide the sheet to a sample tray <b>701</b>. On the other hand, a switching member <b>514</b> is disposed in the middle of the lower discharge path <b>522</b>. The switching member <b>514</b> guides the sheet to a process tray <b>550</b> or a saddle discharge path <b>523</b>. The sheet, which has been guided to the saddle discharge path <b>523</b> by the switching member <b>514</b>, is sent to a saddle stitch bookbinding portion <b>800</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The sheets, which have been discharged to the process tray <b>550</b>, are sequentially aligned and stacked in a bundle state, and a sorting process or a staple binding process by a stapler <b>560</b> is performed thereto according to the setting from the operation portion <b>601</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The processed sheet bundle is selectively discharged to a stack tray <b>700</b> or a sample tray <b>701</b> by a pair of bundle discharge rollers <b>551</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The stack tray <b>700</b> and the sample tray <b>701</b> are configured to be lifted and lowered along the apparatus main body of the finisher <b>500</b>. The upper sample tray <b>701</b> is configured to receive sheets from the upper discharge path <b>521</b> and the process tray <b>550</b>. The lower stack tray <b>700</b> is configured to receive sheets from the process tray <b>550</b>. Thus, the stack tray <b>700</b> and the sample tray <b>701</b> are configured to be stacked with a large amount of sheets. The stacked sheets are stopped at their trailing edges by a trailing edge guide <b>710</b> extending vertically so as to be aligned.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">(Saddle Stitch Bookbinding Portion)</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Next, the configuration of the saddle stitch bookbinding portion <b>800</b> as the sheet processing apparatus is described.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The sheet, which has been sent to the saddle stitch bookbinding portion <b>800</b>, is transferred to a pair of saddle inlet rollers <b>801</b>, and a receiving entrance is selected by a switching member <b>802</b> which is operated by a solenoid according to its size so as to be conveyed into a storage portion <b>803</b> as the sheet stacking portion. The storage portion <b>803</b> is inclined such that the downstream side in the sheet conveying direction is lower than the upstream side. The taken-in sheet is continued to be conveyed by a slide roller <b>804</b> and transferred to a first feed roller <b>806</b> and a second feed roller <b>807</b> which are also disposed at a downstream side. The slide roller <b>804</b> is a roller having slippage, and the first feed roller <b>806</b> and the second feed roller <b>807</b> also have slippage similar to the slide roller <b>804</b>. The first feed roller <b>806</b> and the second feed roller <b>807</b> are sheet bundle pressing portions which are movable between the abutment position for pressing the sheet to the sheet stacking face of the storage portion <b>803</b> (solid line position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) and the retracted position for releasing the press of the above sheet (broken line position in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The pair of saddle inlet rollers <b>801</b> and the slide roller <b>804</b> are driven by an inlet roller motor M<b>1</b>. The first feed roller <b>806</b> and the second feed roller <b>807</b> are driven by a feed roller motor M<b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The sheet, which has been conveyed to the storage portion <b>803</b>, is conveyed until its edge portion (the downstream edge in the conveying direction) abuts an edge portion stopper <b>805</b> which has been preliminary moved to a predetermined position according to the sheet size (the length of the sheet in the conveying direction). The edge portion stopper <b>805</b> can be moved in the sheet conveying direction along the sheet stacking face which is inclined lower on the downstream side of the storage portion <b>803</b> in the sheet conveying direction than the upstream side, and can be moved in the sheet conveying direction by the driving force of an edge portion stopper moving motor M<b>2</b>. The edge portion stopper <b>805</b> has a restriction face <b>805</b><i>a </i>protruding from the storage portion <b>803</b> so that the edge portion of the sheet, which has been conveyed to the storage portion <b>803</b>, on the downstream side in the sheet conveying direction is received and held by this restriction face <b>805</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The edge portion stopper <b>805</b> receives a sheet at a first receiving position or a second receiving position which are spaced apart from each other by a given range on a respective downstream side of the first feed roller <b>806</b> or the second feed roller <b>807</b>. The first receiving position is the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as a solid line, and is the receiving position downstream of the first feed roller <b>806</b> by a preliminary set space so as not to buckle the sheet. The second receiving position is the position illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> as a broken line, and is the receiving position downstream of the second feed roller <b>807</b> by the same space as the above space. Here, the given range means a range in which the sheet is not buckled even when conveying force of the feed roller is further applied to the sheet after being abutted against the above restriction face <b>805</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Because the easiness of buckling (bending) of a sheet is proportional to the length of the sheet in the conveying direction, the receiving position by the edge portion stopper <b>805</b> is preferred to be short within the above given range. Here, the above given range is set from 15 to 30 mm, depending on the stiffness (basis weight) of the sheet and the conveying force of the feed roller. Note that this value is determined by an experiment etc., and is not limited to the above value. When the previously stored sheet is buckled, the buckled sheet blocks the entrance path for the next sheet to be stored, thereby causing a paper jam. Accordingly, the above given range is set within the range in which no paper jam occurs.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">In the middle of the storage portion <b>803</b>, there is disposed a stapler <b>820</b> including portions which are positioned opposite to each other over the storage portion <b>803</b>. The stapler <b>820</b> is a binding portion for binding the bundle made of a plurality of sheets stored in the storage portion <b>803</b> at its central portion in the conveying direction. The stapler <b>820</b> is divided into a driver <b>820</b><i>a </i>for thrusting a staple, and an anvil <b>820</b><i>b </i>for bending the thrust staple, and staples the central portion in the conveying direction of the bundle made of the sheets when the storing of the sheets has been completed.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Therefore, the receiving position where the sheet edge portion is received by the edge portion stopper <b>805</b> is preferred to be located such that the moving distance to the staple binding position (or the folded position) is short, thereby shortening the processing time, or stabilizing the bundle conveyance. Here, the length from the above sheet edge portion to the position on the sheet to be processed is a half of the length L of the conveyed sheet in the conveying direction, i.e., L/2. Accordingly, a controller mentioned below determines whether the length L/2, which is a half of the length L of the conveyed sheet in the sheet conveying direction, is close to the first distance (length) L<b>1</b> from the staple binding position to the restriction face at the first receiving position, or to the second distance (length) L<b>2</b> from the staple binding position to the restriction face at the second receiving position. Then, the receiving position of the edge portion stopper <b>805</b> whose length to the staple binding position is closer to a half of the sheet length L, i.e., L/2, is selected.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">On the downstream side of the stapler <b>820</b>, a pair of folding rollers <b>810</b><i>a</i>, <b>810</b><i>b </i>and the jabbing member <b>830</b> are disposed via the storage portion <b>803</b> so as to be opposite to each other. The pair of folding rollers <b>810</b><i>a</i>, <b>810</b><i>b </i>and the jabbing member <b>830</b> constitute a folding portion which performs a double folding process at the central portion in the conveying direction of the sheet bundle which is made of a plurality of sheets stacked and stored in the storage portion <b>803</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The jabbing member <b>830</b> has a home position at the position where the jabbing member <b>830</b> is retracted from the storage portion <b>803</b>, and protrudes toward the central portion in the conveying direction of the sheet bundle stored in the storage portion <b>803</b> by the driving force of a jabbing motor M<b>3</b>. With this, the above sheet bundle is pressed into the nip of the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b><i>a</i>, <b>810</b><i>b </i>so as to be double folded at the above central portion. After jabbing the sheet bundle, the jabbing member <b>830</b> is moved again back to the home position.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Note that, between the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b>, there is applied pressure F<b>1</b> by a spring (not shown) which is sufficient for making a fold on the sheet bundle. The sheet bundle provided with the fold (folded bundle) is discharged to the folded bundle tray <b>840</b> as the folded bundle stacking portion via a pair of first folding conveying rollers <b>811</b><i>a</i>, <b>811</b><i>b</i>, and a pair of second folding conveying rollers <b>812</b><i>a</i>, <b>812</b><i>b</i>. Also on the pair of first folding conveying rollers <b>811</b> and the pair of second folding conveying rollers <b>812</b> which constitute the folded bundle conveying portion, there are applied pressures F<b>2</b>, F<b>3</b> which are sufficient for conveying and stopping the sheet bundle provided with the fold (folded bundle). Note that, the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b>, the pair of first folding conveying rollers <b>811</b> and the pair of second folding conveying rollers <b>812</b> are rotated by the same folding conveying motor M<b>4</b> at the constant velocity.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">When the sheet bundle is folded without performing a binding process, the sheet bundle is moved such that the central portion in the conveying direction of the sheet bundle stored in the storage portion <b>803</b> is located at the nip position of the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b><i>a</i>, <b>810</b><i>b</i>. On the other hand, when the sheet bundle which has been bound by the stapler <b>820</b> is folded, after finishing the stapling process, the sheet bundle at the staple position (central portion in the conveying direction) is moved such that the stapled position of the sheet bundle is located at the nip position of the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b>. With this, the sheet bundle can be folded around the position where the stapling process has been performed.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The movement of the sheet bundle from the sheet storage position (each receiving position) to the stapling position, or from the stapling position to the folding position, is performed by lowering or lifting the edge portion stopper <b>805</b> by the motor M<b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">At the positions of the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b><i>a</i>, <b>810</b><i>b</i>, there are disposed a pair of aligning plates <b>815</b> having faces projecting to the storage portion <b>803</b> while extending along the outer circumferential faces of the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b><i>a</i>, <b>810</b><i>b</i>. The pair of aligning plates <b>815</b> are moved in the width direction orthogonal to the sheet conveying direction when receiving driving force of an aligning plate moving motor M<b>5</b>, so as to align (position) the sheet stored in the storage portion <b>803</b> in the width direction.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">(Press Unit)</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Next, the press unit <b>860</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a perspective view of the press unit, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is an explanatory diagram of the inside of the press unit.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The press unit <b>860</b> is a folded end portion processing portion which processes the above folded end portion by moving in the direction orthogonal to the conveying direction while abutting the folded end portion of the double-folded sheet bundle (folded bundle).</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the press unit <b>860</b> includes a base metal plate <b>863</b> to which a main portion is incorporated, and two slide shafts <b>864</b>, <b>865</b>, and is fixed to the front and rear side plates. Two slide shafts <b>864</b>, <b>865</b> extend in the sheet width direction orthogonal to the discharging direction of the folded bundle so as to be disposed side by side, and penetrate into slide bearings <b>874</b>, <b>875</b> respectively fixed to a press holder <b>862</b> so as to support the press holder <b>862</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">A pair of press rollers <b>861</b> are rotatably disposed on the above press holder <b>862</b>, and a sheet guide <b>871</b> for the pair of press rollers <b>861</b> is disposed.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, press arms <b>873</b><i>a</i>, <b>873</b><i>b </i>are swingably supported via bearings on swing shafts <b>874</b><i>a</i>, <b>874</b><i>b </i>which are fixed on a frame <b>839</b>. Tension springs <b>875</b><i>a</i>, <b>875</b><i>b </i>are disposed across the one ends of the press arms <b>873</b><i>a</i>, <b>873</b><i>b </i>and the frame <b>839</b>, so that the pair of press rollers <b>861</b><i>a</i>, <b>861</b><i>b </i>nip with pressure which brings the pair of press rollers <b>861</b><i>a</i>, <b>861</b><i>b </i>close to each other. When the folded bundle is inserted into the pair of press rollers <b>861</b>, the press arms <b>873</b><i>a</i>, <b>873</b><i>b </i>rotate around the swing shafts <b>874</b><i>a</i>, <b>874</b><i>b </i>as fulcrums so as to move the rollers apart from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Moreover, a gear <b>883</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> meshes with a rack gear <b>851</b> which extends in parallel with the above slide shafts <b>864</b>, <b>865</b> and is fixed to the base metal plate <b>863</b>. Then, when the motor M<b>6</b> is rotated, while the timing belt <b>868</b> is moved, the press holder <b>862</b> is moved while being supported by the slide shafts <b>864</b>, <b>865</b>. In this movement, the gear <b>883</b> of the press holder <b>862</b> is rotated while meshing with the rack gear <b>851</b>. Therefore, driving force is also transmitted to the pair of press rollers <b>861</b><i>a</i>, <b>861</b><i>b </i>which are connected with the above gear <b>883</b> via gear trains (not shown). Note that, the above gear trains are set such that the moving velocity of the press holder <b>862</b> and the circumferential velocity of the two pairs of press rollers <b>861</b><i>a</i>, <b>861</b><i>b </i>are at the constant velocity.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">When a folded end portion processing for strengthening the fold of the folded end portion at the pair of press rollers <b>861</b> is performed, the folded bundle, which has been folded at the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b><i>a</i>, <b>810</b><i>b</i>, is held by two or more pairs of rollers, regardless of the size to be processed. By holding like this, the folded bundle, to which the folded end portion processing is performed, is prevented from displacing by the movement of the pair of press rollers <b>861</b>. Note that, the leading edge stop position (press leading edge position) of the folded bundle when the folded end portion processing is performed is controlled by using a bundle discharge sensor <b>884</b> disposed on the conveying guide <b>814</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, such that the relative relationship with the pair of press rollers <b>861</b> is kept constant regardless of the size.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">On the other hand, regarding the folded bundle trailing edge position (press trailing edge position) when the folded end portion processing is performed, the positions of respective portions are determined such that the trailing edge is restricted by the storage portion <b>803</b> etc. so as to prevent the trailing edge from opening. When the length in the conveying direction is outside the storage region (stacking region) of the above storage portion <b>803</b>, the position of the press trailing edge enables the storing operation of the sheets for forming the succeeding sheet bundle to the storage portion <b>803</b>, and the aligning operation during the folded end portion strengthening processing is performed by the pair of press rollers <b>861</b>. This contributes to the improvement of the productivity of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The folded bundle conveying guides <b>813</b>, <b>814</b> illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, including the press holder <b>862</b>, are disposed so as to be included between the storage portion <b>803</b> and the trailing edge guide <b>710</b>. This causes the effect of decreasing the size of the apparatus in the conveying direction, along with the spatially overlapping arrangement of the folded bundle tray <b>840</b> and the press unit <b>860</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">(Folded Bundle Tray)</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Next, the configuration of the folded bundle tray <b>840</b>, which is the folded bundle stacking portion for stacking the folded bundle made by folding the sheet bundle, and conveying the same, is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the folded bundle tray <b>840</b> is provided with a first stacking face <b>841</b>, a second stacking face <b>842</b>, and a third stacking face <b>843</b>, successively in this order in the discharging direction of the folded bundle, and the folded bundle discharged from the pair of second folding conveying rollers <b>812</b> is stacked thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">The first stacking face <b>841</b> is disposed below the press unit <b>860</b> so as to partially overlap with the press unit <b>860</b> in the space in the vertical direction, and the downstream side in the conveying direction is inclined downward. The inclined angle is configured to be substantially equal to the discharging angle of the folded bundle by the pair of second folding conveying rollers <b>812</b> mentioned above. The top of the inclination is positioned as high as possible at the height where there is no interference with the operation of the press unit <b>860</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">At the first stacking face <b>841</b> and the second stacking face <b>842</b>, there are disposed the conveyer belts <b>844</b>, <b>845</b> which constitute the folded bundle transfer portion for transferring the discharged folded bundle to the downstream side in the folded bundle discharge direction, or the upstream side.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The conveyer belts <b>844</b>, <b>845</b> are disposed at the folded bundle tray <b>840</b>. The conveyer belts <b>844</b>, <b>845</b> move the preceding folded bundle stacked on the folded bundle tray <b>840</b> to the first stacking position where the trailing edge (upstream edge in the conveying direction) thereof does not interfere with the above press unit <b>860</b>. Or, the conveyer belts <b>844</b>, <b>845</b> move the above stacked preceding folded bundle to the second stacking position closer to the above press unit <b>860</b> than the above first stacking position. This second stacking position is a position which is set such that the trailing edge (upstream edge in the conveying direction) of the above stacked preceding folded bundle is positioned upstream in the conveying direction of the leading edge (downstream edge in the conveying direction) of the succeeding folded bundle discharged from the above press unit <b>860</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">One end of each conveyer belt <b>844</b>, <b>845</b> is wound around a drive pulley <b>846</b> adjacent to the bent portion. The other end of the first conveyer belt <b>844</b> is wound around an idler pulley <b>847</b>, and the other end of the second conveyer belt <b>845</b> is wound around an idler pulley <b>848</b>, so as to be parallel with the stacking faces. Then, respective conveyer belts <b>844</b>, <b>845</b> are rotated in the same forward or reverse direction by receiving driving force of the conveyer motor M<b>7</b> connected to the shaft of the drive pulley <b>846</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">At the first stacking face <b>841</b>, there is disposed a bundle detection sensor <b>849</b> capable of detecting the folded bundle stacked just below the operation region of the press unit <b>860</b>, so that the stacking position of the discharged folded bundle is controlled based on the detection signal.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">(Inserter)</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Next, the configuration of an inserter <b>900</b> is described. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the inserter <b>900</b> is disposed on the upper portion of the finisher <b>500</b>. The inserter <b>900</b> is configured to insert a sheet (insert sheet) which is different from a normal sheet into the sheets as the front page, the last page, or the intermediate page. Namely, the inserter <b>900</b> is configured to insert an insert sheet or a front page sheet between the sheets on which images have been formed by the printer portion <b>300</b> of the image forming apparatus main body <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">The inserter <b>900</b> is configured to feed the sheet set on the insert trays <b>901</b>, <b>902</b> by a user to one of the sample tray <b>701</b>, the stack tray <b>700</b>, and the folded bundle tray <b>840</b>, without passing through the printer portion <b>300</b>. The sheets stacked on the insert tray <b>901</b>, <b>902</b> are sequentially separated sheet by sheet and merged with the conveying path <b>520</b> at a desired timing.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">(Controller)</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">Here, the control system of the image forming apparatus <b>1000</b> is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a block diagram illustrating the configuration of the control system of the image forming apparatus <b>1000</b>. A CPU circuit portion <b>150</b> is disposed at the printer portion <b>300</b>, and includes CPU (not shown), ROM <b>151</b>, and RAM <b>152</b>. Then, the CPU circuit portion <b>150</b> controls the following respective portions according to the control program stored in the ROM <b>151</b> and the setting of the operation portion <b>601</b>. Namely, the CPU circuit portion <b>150</b> controls an original feed controller <b>101</b>, an image reader controller <b>201</b>, an image signal controller <b>202</b>, a printer controller <b>301</b>, a finisher controller <b>501</b>, and an external I/F (external interface) <b>203</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">Then, the original feed controller <b>101</b> controls the original feed portion <b>100</b>, the image reader controller <b>201</b> controls the image reader portion <b>200</b>, and the printer controller <b>301</b> controls the printer portion <b>300</b>. Moreover, the finisher controller <b>501</b> is disposed in the finisher <b>500</b> so as to control the finisher <b>500</b>, the saddle stitch bookbinding portion <b>800</b>, and the inserter <b>900</b>. For details, respective motors M<b>1</b> to M<b>7</b> of the above saddle stitch bookbinding portion <b>800</b> are controlled to be driven by the finisher controller <b>501</b>. Note that, the operation control of the saddle stitch bookbinding portion <b>800</b> performed by the finisher controller <b>501</b> is described later.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The operation portion <b>601</b> includes a plurality of keys for setting various functions regarding an image forming, and a display portion for displaying a setting condition, etc. The operation portion <b>601</b> outputs a key signal corresponding to the operation of each key by the user to the CPU circuit portion <b>150</b>, and displays corresponding information on the display portion based on the signal from the CPU circuit portion <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">RAM <b>152</b> is used as a region for temporarily holding the control data, and an operation region for calculation along with controlling. The external I/F <b>203</b> is an interface between the image forming apparatus <b>1000</b> and an external computer <b>204</b>, and expands a print data from the computer <b>204</b> to a bit map image so as to output the same as an image data to the image signal controller <b>202</b>. An image of an original read by the image sensor <b>109</b> is output from the image reader controller <b>201</b> to the image signal controller <b>202</b>. The printer controller <b>301</b> outputs the image data from the image signal controller <b>202</b> to the exposure controlling portion <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Here, there is described the configuration in which the finisher controller <b>501</b> as the controller for controlling the operation of each portion of the saddle stitch bookbinding portion <b>800</b> which is described later is disposed in the finisher <b>500</b>, but this is not the only case. For example, this controller may be disposed in the printer portion <b>300</b> integrally with the CPU circuit portion <b>150</b> so as to control the finisher <b>500</b> from the printer portion <b>300</b> side.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">(Bookbinding Discharge Operation)</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Next, based on the above configuration, the saddle stitch bookbinding discharge according to the present embodiment is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 11</figref>, regarding the operation of each portion, along with the flow of sheet. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 to 9</figref> are cross-sectional views illustrating the operations of the saddle stitch bookbinding portion. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10 and 11</figref> are explanatory diagrams of the folded end portion processing operation.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">When the saddle stitch bookbinding mode is set by the user (S<b>201</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>), the sheets, on which images have been formed and suitably applied with pagination, are sequentially discharged from the pair of discharge rollers <b>907</b> of the printer portion <b>300</b> (refer to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the sheet is transferred to the pair of inlet rollers <b>511</b> of the finisher <b>500</b>, then, passes through the conveying path <b>520</b>, and enters the lower discharge path <b>522</b>. After that, the sheet is introduced to the saddle discharge path <b>523</b> by the switching member <b>514</b> in the middle of the lower discharge path <b>522</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the sheet is guided by the switching member <b>802</b> according to its size, and discharged to the storage portion <b>803</b>. Moreover, while receiving conveying force of the slide roller <b>804</b>, the first feed roller <b>806</b>, or the second feed roller <b>807</b>, the sheet is abutted against the edge portion stopper <b>805</b>, which has been preliminarily stopped at a position suitable for the length in the conveying direction, so as to be positioned in the conveying direction.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Next, a sandwiching alignment is performed by the pair of aligning plates <b>815</b> which have been waiting at positions where the discharge of sheet is not disturbed, so that the sheets are also positioned in the width direction orthogonal to the sheet conveying direction. The above-mentioned sheet storing, and aligning operations are performed for each discharge of sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">When the alignment of the last sheet for one sheet bundle has been finished, the stapler <b>820</b> performs a staple binding at the central portion in the conveying direction of the sheet bundle (S<b>202</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the stapled sheet bundle P is moved downward (arrow D direction) according to the movement of the edge portion stopper <b>805</b>. The edge portion stopper <b>805</b> is stopped at a position where the central portion of the sheet bundle, i.e., the stapled portion, is located so as to correspond to the nip of the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Next, the jabbing member <b>830</b>, which has been located at the waiting position, is moved toward the nip portion of the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b> (arrow E direction). Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the sheet bundle P is moved such that its central portion is inserted into the nip portion of the pair of rollers so as to widen the nip between the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b>, and is folded. At this time, the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b> are rotated in the arrow directions by receiving the driving force of the motor M<b>4</b> along with the pair of first folding conveying rollers <b>811</b> and the pair of second folding conveying rollers <b>812</b>. Accordingly, the folded bundle P is conveyed in the conveying guides <b>813</b>, <b>814</b> with its folded end portion set to the leading position (S<b>203</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, when the folded end portion of the folded bundle has been conveyed to the position where the folded end portion is to be nipped by the pair of press rollers <b>861</b>, the motor M<b>4</b> is stopped (S<b>204</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>). The stop position control is performed by detecting the leading edge of the folded bundle P<b>1</b> by the sensor <b>884</b>. At this time, as mentioned above, the folded bundle P<b>1</b> is surely held, across the center in the conveying direction, at its leading edge portion by the pair of second folding conveying rollers <b>812</b>, at its trailing edge side by the pair of first folding conveying rollers <b>811</b>, and depending on the size of the folded bundle P<b>1</b> (the length in the conveying direction), by the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b>. Note that, the above jabbing member <b>830</b> is moved again to the retracted position after finishing the jabbing.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, when the folded end portion processing is performed, prior to the conveyance of the folded bundle P<b>1</b>, the press holder <b>862</b> waits at the waiting position (back side) according to the size (width direction) of the folded bundle P<b>1</b>. Then, the folded bundle P<b>1</b> is temporarily stopped at a give position where the folded end portion is processed (folded end portion processing position). When the stopping of the folded bundle P<b>1</b> has been completed, and the folded end portion of the folded bundle P<b>1</b> has been inserted into the sheet guide <b>871</b> (broken line), the pair of press rollers <b>861</b> are rotated by receiving driving force of the motor M<b>6</b> so as to start moving to the near side (arrow F direction).</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">After that, the pair of press rollers <b>861</b> abut side faces of the folded bundle P<b>1</b>, which is stopped and held, adjacent to the folded end portion. The pair of press rollers <b>861</b> themselves are driven at both sides to be rotated so as to be able to smoothly move onto the side faces and nip the folded end portion, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. This effect cannot be changed even when the thickness of the folded bundle increases, and the folded bundle can be nipped by the pair of press rollers <b>861</b> in synchronization with the movement of the press holder <b>862</b> without a response delay, thereby preventing the folded bundle P<b>1</b> from being wrinkled or broken, or suffering damage of roller rut etc.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">When the pair of press rollers <b>861</b> has finished its moving, the press unit <b>860</b> is moved to the home position so as to open the path in the conveying direction of the folded bundle P<b>1</b>. By doing this, the pair of press rollers <b>861</b> process the folded end portion of the folded bundle, which has been temporarily stopped at a given position, by moving in the direction orthogonal to the conveying direction of the folded bundle.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Note that, the order of the following process operation for the preceding folded bundle which has been stopped at the folded end portion processing position and the process operation for the succeeding sheet bundle to be followed is different according to whether the length in the conveying direction makes the trailing edge of the preceding folded bundle remain within the storage region (stacking region) of the storage portion. This is described hereinafter.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">(Moving Operation of Folded Bundle Stacked on Folded Bundle Tray)</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">Next, in the case that the length in the conveying direction does not make the trailing edge of the folded bundle (upstream edge in the conveying direction) remain within the storage region of the storage portion <b>803</b>, there is described an operation control of the folded bundle which has already been discharged and stacked on the folded bundle tray <b>840</b> when a folded bundle is discharged, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12 to 17</figref>. Note that, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 12</figref> to <b>16</b> are explanatory diagrams of the bundle discharging operation. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref> is a flow chart illustrating the bundle discharging operation.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Here, the length in the conveying direction which does not make the trailing edge of the folded bundle remain within the storage region of the storage portion is the length of 18 inches or below in the sheet conveying direction before being folded. This length in the conveying direction is suitably set, and is not limited to this.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the conveyer belts <b>844</b>, <b>845</b> are started to rotate in the conveying direction by the conveyer motor M<b>7</b> at a given timing, and transfer the folded bundle P<b>1</b> which has been discharged on the folded bundle tray <b>840</b>. Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, when the bundle detection sensor <b>849</b> detects the trailing edge of the folded bundle P<b>1</b>, the conveyer motor M<b>7</b> is stopped (first stacking position). As mentioned above, because the bundle detection sensor <b>849</b> is disposed just below the operation region of the press unit <b>860</b>, the trailing edge of the stopped folded bundle P<b>1</b> is also outside the operation region of the press unit <b>860</b>. Namely, the folded bundle P<b>1</b> stacked on the folded bundle tray <b>840</b> is moved such that its trailing edge (upstream edge in the conveying direction) is moved to the first stacking position, where there is no interference with the press unit <b>860</b>, outside the operation region of the press unit <b>860</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">At the same time, the discharging and aligning operations for the sheets which constitute the next folded bundle P<b>2</b> are continued, and the next folded bundle P<b>2</b> is similarly applied with the folded end portion processing by the press unit <b>860</b>. At this time, the trailing edge (upstream edge in the conveying direction) of the folded bundle P<b>1</b> located in the above first stacking position is positioned downstream in the discharging direction of the operation region of the press holder <b>862</b> of the press unit <b>860</b>. Accordingly, the discharged folded bundle P<b>1</b> does not disturb the folded end portion processing by the press unit <b>860</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">Then, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>, the folded end portion processing for the next folded bundle P<b>2</b> as the second copy is performed, and the press unit <b>860</b> is moved to the home position so as to finish the folded end portion processing. After finishing this folded end portion processing (S<b>207</b>), the conveyer belts <b>844</b>, <b>845</b> receive driving force from the conveyer motor M<b>7</b> so as to rotate in the direction opposite to the conveying direction of the folded bundle. Then, the folded bundle P<b>1</b> at the first stacking position is moved back to the position (second stacking position) which is upstream of the first stacking position and closer to the pair of second folding conveying rollers <b>812</b> (S<b>212</b>), and stopped.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The moving back amount at this time is set such that the trailing edge (upstream edge in the conveying direction) of the folded bundle P<b>1</b> at the second stacking position is positioned upstream in the folded bundle discharging direction of the leading edge position of the next folded bundle P<b>2</b> discharged by the pair of second folding conveying rollers <b>812</b> when hanging by its self-weight so as to be discharged.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">After that, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref>, the folded bundle P<b>2</b> is discharged by the pair of second folding conveying rollers <b>812</b> (S<b>213</b>), and its leading edge (downstream edge in the conveying direction) lands on the folded bundle P<b>1</b> which is stopped at the second stacking position. In the middle of the discharge of the folded bundle P<b>2</b>, the conveyer belts <b>844</b>, <b>845</b> are driven to rotate forwardly in the conveying direction (S<b>214</b>), and, as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 16</figref>, the trailing edge of the folded bundle P<b>2</b> stacked on the folded bundle P<b>1</b> in a stacked state is detected by the bundle detection sensor <b>849</b> (S<b>215</b>). Then, when the bundle detection sensor <b>849</b> detects the trailing edge of the folded bundle P<b>2</b>, the conveyer motor M<b>7</b> is stopped, and, this time, the folded bundle P<b>2</b> is stopped at the first stacking position (S<b>216</b>). With this, the press unit <b>860</b> can be operated without interfering with the folded bundle stacked on the folded bundle tray <b>840</b>. The above-mentioned operations are repeated until a desired number of bundles have been discharged on the folded bundle tray <b>840</b> (S<b>217</b>), and the job is finished (S<b>218</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115">Note that, in the above-mentioned case, the timing of discharging the folded bundle P<b>2</b>, which has been applied with the folded end portion processing, to the folded bundle tray <b>840</b> is set at a time after the folded bundle P<b>1</b> has been moved back to the second stacking position, but this is not the only case. The discharging operation of the succeeding folded bundle P<b>2</b> may be started before the preceding folded bundle P<b>1</b> is finally moved back to the second stacking position, and the conveying velocities of the folded bundle P<b>1</b> and the folded bundle P<b>2</b> may be set such that the folded bundle P<b>1</b> is finally moved back to the second stacking position before the leading edge (downstream edge in the conveying direction) of the folded bundle P<b>2</b> lands thereon.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">The length in the conveying direction of the folded bundle in the above description means a length in the conveying direction which does not make the trailing edge of the folded bundle remain in the storage region (stacking region) of the storage portion <b>803</b>, i.e., 18 inches or below of the length in the sheet conveying direction before being folded (S<b>205</b>). Therefore, after the preceding folded bundle has been stopped at the folded end portion processing position, at the same time of performing the folded end portion processing for this preceding folded bundle, the stacking operation of the sheets for the succeeding sheet bundle following this to the storage portion is also performed (S<b>206</b>). Namely, before completing the folded end portion processing for the preceding folded bundle, the processing for the succeeding sheet bundle can be concurrently performed.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">Next, in the case that the length in the conveying direction makes the trailing edge of the folded bundle (downstream edge in the conveying direction) remain within the storage region of the storage portion <b>803</b>, there is described an operation control of the folded bundle which has already been discharged and stacked on the folded bundle tray <b>840</b> when a folded bundle is discharged, with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 18 and 19</figref> are explanatory diagrams of the bundle discharging operation.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">At this time, the sheet is stacked on the storage portion <b>803</b>, is bound with a staple by the stapler <b>820</b> (S<b>202</b>), and is applied with folding process and conveyed by the jabbing member <b>830</b> and the pair of folding rollers <b>810</b> (S<b>203</b>), and the folded bundle is stopped at the folded end portion processing position (S<b>204</b>). This operation is similar to that for the above length in the conveying direction which does not make the trailing edge of the folded bundle remain within the storage region of the storage portion <b>803</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">Here, the length in the conveying direction which makes the trailing edge of the folded bundle remain within the storage region of the storage portion is the length of over 18 inches in the sheet conveying direction before being folded.

<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Then, in the case that the length in the conveying direction before being folded is over 18 inches for the length in the sheet conveying direction (S<b>205</b>), the folded end portion processing is performed by the folded end portion processing portion under state in which the trailing edge (downstream edge in the conveying direction) of the preceding folded bundle remains within the storage region of the storage portion <b>803</b> (S<b>208</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). Then, after the folded end portion processing for the preceding folded bundle has been finished (S<b>209</b>), the above folded bundle is conveyed downstream by the pair of folding conveying rollers <b>811</b>, <b>812</b> until the trailing edge of this preceding folded bundle has passed through the storage portion, and is stopped (S<b>210</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">When the trailing edge (downstream edge in the conveying direction) of the folded bundle P<b>2</b>, which remained in the storage region of the storage portion <b>803</b>, has passed therethrough, the sheet for the next sheet bundle is conveyed to the storage portion <b>803</b> (S<b>211</b>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>). Namely, after the folded end portion processing for the preceding folded bundle has been finished, and its trailing edge has passed through the storage portion, the conveyance of the succeeding sheet bundle to the storage portion is started.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">As illustrated in the flow chart of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the following folded bundle discharging operation is similar to that for the length in the conveying direction which does not make the trailing edge (downstream edge in the conveying direction) of the folded bundle remain in the storage region of the storage portion <b>803</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">In the above-mentioned description, the folded bundle P<b>2</b>, which has already been applied with the folded end portion processing, is temporarily stopped at a position in which the trailing edge of the folded bundle P<b>2</b> does not remain within the storage region of the storage portion <b>803</b>, and is discharged to the folded bundle tray <b>840</b> after the folded bundle P<b>1</b> has been moved back to the second stacking position. However, this operation is not the only case. For example, the discharge of the folded bundle P<b>2</b>, which has already been applied with the folded end portion processing, may be started before the folded bundle P<b>1</b> has been moved back to the second stacking position, and the conveying velocities of the folded bundles P<b>1</b>, P<b>2</b> may be set such that the leading edge of the folded bundle P<b>2</b> lands on the folded bundle P<b>1</b> which has been moved back to the second stacking position.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Thus, when the folded bundle is discharged after the folded end portion processing, by using the time period for moving the conveyer belt back to the bundle receiving position, the folded bundle is preliminary discharged until its trailing edge has passed through the storage region of the storage portion, thereby enabling the succeeding sheet to be conveyed into the storage portion. With this, even when the trailing edge of the folded bundle to be applied with the folded end portion processing remains within the stacking region for stacking the next sheet bundle, the interruption for the conveyance of the succeeding sheet can be shortened so that the productivity can be enhanced without increasing the size of apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">The conveyer belt is moved back to the bundle receiving position in order to suppress the opening of the trailing edge of the folded bundle by stacking the folded bundles in a stacked state. If the conveyer belt is moved back under a state in which the previously stacked folded bundle is stacked thereon during the folded end portion processing, the press unit <b>860</b> and the previously stacked folded bundle may collide with each other. Therefore, after the folded end portion processing has been finished, the conveyer belt is moved to the bundle receiving position. Note that, even when preliminarily discharged as mentioned above, the conveyance of the succeeding sheet should be interrupted during the folded end portion processing for the preceding folded bundle, not only stopping the image forming, the succeeding sheet may be made to wait at a buffer.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the above-mentioned embodiment, the sheet size (length in the conveying direction) information is obtained based on the information input by the user via the operation portion <b>601</b>. Moreover, in the above-mentioned embodiment, the length in the conveying direction, which remains within the storage region of the storage portion <b>803</b>, is set to be over 18 inches before being folded. However, this is determined according to the conveying path length of the bundle conveying guides <b>813</b>, <b>814</b>, and the length in the conveying direction, which remains within the storage region of the storage portion <b>803</b>, is suitably set according to the configuration of the apparatus. Namely, when giving priority to decreasing the size of apparatus, the conveying path lengths of the bundle conveying guides <b>813</b>, <b>814</b> may be shortened, but in such case, the set length in the conveying direction, which remains within the storage region of the storage portion <b>803</b>, becomes shorter according to its conveying path length.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">In the above-mentioned embodiment, although the folding operation of the saddle stitch bookbinding is described, a similar bundle discharging operation is performed for un-binding folding.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">As mentioned above, when the length in the conveying direction of the folded bundle is longer than the conveying path lengths of the bundle conveying guides <b>813</b>, <b>814</b>, and the folded bundle trailing edge remains within the storage region of the storage portion <b>803</b> during the folded end portion processing, the timing of discharging the folded bundle after the folded end portion processing is advanced. By doing like this, the storage portion <b>803</b> can be made empty at a timing earlier than that of the conventional apparatus. Therefore, even during the moving back operation of the previously stacked folded bundle on the folded bundle tray <b>840</b>, the sheet for a next bundle can be conveyed to the storage portion <b>803</b>, as a result, the productivity can be enhanced without changing the apparatus configuration. Namely, the productivity can be enhanced without increasing the conveying path lengths of the bundle conveying guides <b>813</b>, <b>814</b> according to the length in the conveying direction, so that the apparatus can be miniaturized.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In the above-mentioned embodiment, there is exemplified the sheet processing apparatus capable of being suitably disposed on the image forming apparatus main body, but the present invention is not limited to this. For example, the image forming apparatus may be integrally provided with the sheet processing apparatus, and similar effects can be obtained by applying the present invention to this sheet processing apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Moreover, in the above-mentioned embodiment, a copying machine is exemplified as the image forming apparatus, but the present invention is not limited to this. For example, other image forming apparatuses, such as a scanner, a printer, a facsimile apparatus, etc., or other image forming apparatuses, such as a multifunction machine etc. made by combining these functions. By applying the present invention to the sheet processing apparatuses used for these image forming apparatuses, similar effects can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">While the present invention has been described with reference to exemplary embodiments, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited to the disclosed exemplary embodiments. The scope of the following claims is to be accorded the broadest interpretation so as to encompass all modifications, equivalent structures and functions.</p>
