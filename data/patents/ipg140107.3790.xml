<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0122662, filed on Dec. 10, 2009, which is hereby incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a touch panel. More specifically, the present invention relates to a touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device wherein a touch panel is formed on the outer side of a substrate in a liquid crystal panel to reduce the total number of substrates used and to optimize the connection between a driving portion of the touch panel and a driving portion of the liquid crystal panel.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In keeping with dramatic advances in information technology, displays to visualize electric information signals have been rapidly developed. Various slim, lightweight, and low-power flat display devices are commonly used as alternatives to conventional cathode ray tubes (CRTs).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Examples of flat display devices include liquid crystal displays (LCDs), plasma display panels (PDPs), field emission displays (FEDs), electroluminescent displays (ELDs) and the like. These flat display devices necessarily require a flat display panel to realize an image wherein the flat display panel has a structure in which a pair of transparent insulating substrates is joined such that an inherent luminous or polarized material layer is interposed between the substrates. Among flat display devices, liquid crystal display devices control light transmittance of liquid crystals using an electric field to display an image. For this purpose, an image display device includes a display panel including liquid crystal cells, a backlight unit to irradiate light to the display panel and a driving circuit to drive the liquid crystal cells.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The display panel is formed such that a plurality of gate lines cross a plurality of data lines to define a plurality of unit pixel regions. Each pixel region includes a thin film transistor array substrate and a color filter array substrate that face each other, a spacer interposed between the two substrates to maintain a predetermined cell gap, and a liquid crystal inserted into the cell gap.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The thin film transistor array substrate includes a plurality of gate lines and a plurality of data lines, a thin film transistor formed as a switching device at each intersection between the gate line and the data line, a pixel electrode arranged in each liquid crystal cell and connected to the thin film transistor, and an orientation layer coated on the resulting structure. The gate lines and data lines receive signals from driving circuits through respective pad portions.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In response to scan signals supplied to the gate lines, the thin film transistor transfers pixel voltage signals from the data lines to the pixel electrode.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In addition, the color filter array substrate includes color filters arranged in respective liquid crystal cells, a black matrix to partition the color filters and reflect external light, a common electrode to supply a reference voltage to the liquid crystal cells, and an orientation layer coated on the resulting structure.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The thin film transistor substrate and the color filter array substrate thus separately formed are arranged and then joined such that the two substrates face each other, liquid crystal is injected into a region provided between the substrates and the region is sealed, thereby completing fabrication of the liquid crystal display device.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">There is an increasing need for a touch panel wherein a predetermined portion is touched by the hand or a separate input means and additional information can be transferred to the liquid crystal display device in response to the touch. Such a touch panel is adhered to the external surface of a liquid crystal display.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Touch panels are applied to a variety of information-processing systems since they have advantages of simplicity, reliability, portability, possible input of characters without using additional input systems and easy usage.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Depending upon how touch is sensed, touch panels are divided into resistive touch panels in which direct current is applied to a metal electrode formed in an upper or lower substrate and the touched position is determined from the gradient of voltage/resistance, capacitive touch panels in which a predetermined electric current is formed on a conductive film and positions in which voltage variations occur in upper and lower substrates upon touch are thus sensed and electromagnetic touch panels in which LC induced when an electric pen contacts a conductive film is read to sense the touched position.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Among the touch panels, capacitive-type touch panels include a plurality of x electrodes and a plurality of y electrodes that cross each other arranged on a transparent substrate such that an insulating layer is interposed between the x electrode and the y electrode and sense touch by sensing whether or not electric capacity generated between the x and y electrodes is changed.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Depending on the touch sensation type, touch panels are classified into resistive touch panels, capacitive touch panels and infrared (IR) touch panels. In view of factors such as convenience of fabrication and sensitivity, capacitive touch panels attract much attention in small-size models.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Hereinafter, a conventional touch panel-provided liquid crystal display device will be described with reference to the annexed drawings in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a sectional view illustrating a conventional touch panel-provided liquid crystal display device.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the conventional touch panel-provided liquid crystal display device comprises: a liquid crystal panel <b>10</b> including first and second substrates <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, a liquid crystal layer <b>3</b> filled between the first and second substrates <b>1</b> and <b>2</b>, first and second polarizing plates <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>adhered to the outer surface of the first substrate <b>1</b> and the second substrate <b>2</b>, respectively; a capacitive-type touch panel <b>20</b> placed on the liquid crystal panel <b>10</b>; and a cover glass <b>30</b> to protect the top of the touch panel <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The first substrate of the liquid crystal panel is provided with gate lines and data lines which cross each other to define pixel regions, a thin film transistor (TFT) formed at the intersection between the gate line and the data line and a thin film transistor array provided with a pixel electrode (not shown) in the pixel region.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The first substrate <b>1</b> is further provided at one side thereof with a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>8</b> to drive the gate lines and the data lines.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In addition, the second substrate <b>2</b> is provided with a black matrix layer, a color filter layer and a common electrode (not shown, Vcom (applied voltage)).</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The structure of the touch panel <b>20</b> may be varied depending on the operation mode. For example, a capacitive-type touch panel senses touch position via variation in electric capacity, based on capacitance generated between first and second electrodes which cross each other.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition, the touch panel <b>20</b> is further provided on the side thereof with a touch driving circuit <b>25</b> to operate the touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Meanwhile, a cover glass <b>30</b> to protect the touch panel <b>20</b> is further provided on the touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">For the afore-mentioned conventional touch panel-provided liquid crystal display, the touch driving circuit <b>25</b> for driving the touch panel <b>20</b> is separately formed from the PCB <b>8</b> for driving the liquid crystal panel <b>10</b>, and the touch driving circuit <b>25</b> and the PCB <b>8</b> are connected to the system driving circuit (not shown) in a system including the liquid crystal panel <b>10</b>, the touch panel <b>20</b> and the cover glass <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In this case, in order to connect the touch driving circuit <b>25</b> and the PCB <b>8</b> to a system driving circuit, connectors and areas to mount the same are required. Such mounting areas cause an increase in the size of the periphery. Also, connectors should be separately provided, disadvantageously requiring numerous manual labor-intensive mounting operations.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In addition, the touch panel <b>20</b> is provided at the exterior of the liquid crystal panel <b>10</b>, thus requiring a double-sided adhesive layer between the touch panel <b>20</b> and the liquid crystal panel <b>10</b>. In this case, a process for forming the touch panel <b>20</b>, apart from the liquid crystal panel <b>10</b>, and a process for adhering the touch panel <b>20</b> to the liquid crystal panel <b>10</b> are required, disadvantageously causing an increase in total thickness caused by use of a plurality of substrates and lengthened process period.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In addition, when the cover glass <b>30</b> is provided, a double-sided adhesive layer is also provided between the touch panel <b>20</b> and the cover glass <b>30</b> to join the cover glass <b>30</b> to the touch panel <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The conventional liquid crystal display device including a touch panel has the following problems.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">First, the touch panel and the liquid crystal panel are separately formed and an adhesive layer is interposed between the panels to join the panels. As a result, the total number of glass substrates required is four to five, that is, two substrates for the liquid crystal panel and two substrates for the touch panel and a cover glass, thus making it impossible to reduce the thickness of the liquid crystal display device. That is, for example, the glass substrate is the thickest, about 0.7T (mm), among all of the elements. This is the reason that the glass substrate is used for cover glasses to protect the touch panel, the liquid crystal panel and the touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Second, the thickness of the touch panel makes direct connection between the touch driving portion circuit and the PCB for driving the liquid crystal panel impossible and connection thereof is separately realized in a system-driving portion, thus making it impossible to realize circuit integration in the device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Third, an area to mount the touch driving portion circuit and the PCB for driving the liquid crystal panel is required, thus increasing the size of the periphery of the device and decreasing an active area of the device.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Fourth, the driving circuit of the touch panel requires a long wire for connecting the system-driving portion arranged thereunder due to the thickness of the touch panel and the thickness of the liquid crystal panel, thus making it difficult to simplify mounting of the touch driving circuit.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Hereinafter, a touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device according to the present invention will be described with reference to the annexed drawings in detail.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a sectional view illustrating the touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device according to the present invention, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a plan view illustrating the touch panel of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a sectional view taken along the lines of I-I&#x2032; and II-II&#x2032; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 to 4</figref>, the touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device comprises: a liquid crystal panel <b>1000</b> including a first substrate <b>100</b> and a second substrate <b>200</b> crossing each other, and a liquid crystal layer <b>300</b> filled between the first and second substrates <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>; and a touch panel <b>400</b> provided on an outer surface of the second substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">The first substrate <b>100</b> present in the liquid crystal panel <b>1000</b> is provided with gate lines and data lines which cross each other to define pixel regions and a thin film transistor array (not shown) comprising a thin film transistor (TFT) in the pixel region. Also, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a COF (chip-on-film: <b>130</b>) connected to the pad electrode <b>105</b> provided on the end of the gate lines and data lines on one side of the first substrate <b>100</b> and a PCB <b>150</b> connected to the other end of the COF (<b>130</b>) are further provided.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">The COF <b>130</b> includes a drive IC <b>131</b> to transfer signals of each of the data lines or gate lines to each of a plurality of regions. If appropriate, the gate driving signals of the gate lines may be transferred via a line on glass (LOG) formed on an edge of the first substrate <b>100</b>. In this case, a connection line is further provided in a part of the COF <b>130</b>, to connect a gate driving signal output terminal of the PCB <b>150</b> to the pad electrode of the LOG line.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">Meanwhile, the PCB <b>150</b> is connected to the other side of the COF <b>130</b> and includes a controller (not shown) to receive image information from a host system (not shown), make the same suitable for the panel and generate various control signals, and a power supply to generate various signals at a set voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Also, when the gate driving portion is provided in the form of an LOG line, no additional gate PCB is required, the PCB <b>150</b> can be configured using only one source PCB corresponding to pad electrodes of the data lines.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Also, a black matrix layer <b>201</b>, color filter layers <b>202</b> (R(<b>202</b><i>a</i>), G(<b>202</b><i>b</i>), B(<b>202</b><i>c</i>)) and a common electrode <b>203</b> are formed in the thin film transistor array on the second substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The black matrix layer <b>201</b> is formed in a region corresponding to the gate lines, the data lines and the thin film transistor in the thin film transistor array.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The color filter layer <b>202</b> is formed in each pixel region.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">Also, the common electrode <b>203</b> is formed in the black matrix layer <b>201</b> and the color filter layer <b>202</b> (R, G, B) over an entire surface of the second substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Also, a liquid crystal layer <b>300</b> is formed in a region provided between the first and second substrates <b>100</b> and <b>200</b> including the thin film transistor array and the color filter array, and a seal pattern <b>250</b> to define a region that is filled with the liquid crystal layer <b>300</b> is formed at an edge of the first and second substrates <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In this case, the seal pattern <b>250</b> is a non-display region and is shielded by extending the black matrix layer <b>201</b> on the second substrate in order to prevent light leakage.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">That is, an inner part of the seal pattern <b>250</b> is defined as a display region in which display is actually realized.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Also, a touch panel <b>400</b> provided with the plurality of layers including the first and second electrodes is formed on the outer surface of the second substrate <b>200</b> using the second substrate <b>200</b> as a touch panel-formation side.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">The touch panel <b>400</b> comprises a plurality of first electrodes <b>403</b> arranged in parallel in an X-axis direction and a plurality of second electrodes <b>404</b> arranged in parallel in a Y-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Also, the first electrode <b>403</b> and the second electrode <b>404</b> are spaced from each other on an insulating layer <b>402</b> formed on the outer surface of the second substrate <b>200</b>, and the first electrode <b>403</b> and the second electrode <b>404</b> are in the form of a diamond in a sensing region and there is a difference in the intersection configuration between the first and second electrodes <b>403</b> and <b>404</b>. That is, for the first electrode <b>403</b>, adjacent diamond patterns are connected through a connection metal <b>401</b> connected via a contact hole <b>402</b><i>a </i>provided in the insulating layer <b>402</b> to apply common signals to the diamond-shaped first electrodes <b>403</b> arranged in the X-axis direction. The second electrode <b>404</b> is provided with a thin connection pattern to connect adjacent integral diamond patterns to apply common signals to the second electrodes <b>404</b> arranged in the Y-axis direction.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Meanwhile, the first and second electrodes <b>403</b> and <b>404</b> are transparent electrodes made of a material such as indium tin oxide (ITO), indium zinc oxide (IZO), indium tin zinc oxide (ITZO), and the connection metal <b>401</b> is composed of a highly conductive material such as molybdenum (Mo) or a molybdenum alloy (e.g., Mo/AlNd), silver, copper, aluminum or an alloy thereof to realize connection without increasing resistance in spite of using a thin connection portion.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The connection portion of the first electrode <b>403</b> is composed of a highly conductive connection metal and a connection portion of the second metal <b>404</b> is composed of a transparent electrode, thus causing difference in resistance between two electrodes. Taking into consideration the resistance difference, a total area of the second electrode <b>404</b> is designed to be smaller than that of the first electrode <b>403</b> and thus reduce the influence of the resistance difference.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Also, the insulating layer <b>402</b> including the contact hole <b>402</b><i>a </i>is an inorganic insulating layer such as an oxide layer or a nitride layer, or an organic insulating layer such as photo acryl.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Meanwhile, first and second polarizing plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are formed on an outer surface of the first substrate <b>100</b> and on an upper surface (outer surface) including the first and second electrodes <b>403</b> and <b>404</b> of the liquid crystal panel <b>1000</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The formation surface of the touch panel <b>400</b> utilizes the outer surface of the second substrate <b>200</b> without using an additional glass substrate or plastic substrate, thus omitting a process for joining to the substrates. For this reason, the second polarizing plate <b>120</b> is arranged on the upper surface of the touch panel <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The first and second polarizing plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> are provided with an adhesive layer on the first substrate <b>100</b> or an opposite surface of the first and second electrodes <b>403</b> and <b>404</b>, and the adhesive layer is embedded in the opposite surface to adhere an outer surface of the first substrate <b>100</b> to the first and second electrodes <b>403</b> and <b>404</b> arranged at an outer surface of the second substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In this case, an additional interlayer dielectric layer (represented by reference numeral &#x201c;<b>405</b>&#x201d; of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>) to protect the first and second electrodes <b>403</b> and <b>404</b> may be further provided between an entire surface of the first and second electrodes <b>403</b> and <b>404</b>, and the second polarizing plate <b>120</b>. In this case, the interlayer dielectric layer <b>405</b> may be composed of the same material as the insulating layer <b>402</b>, for example, an inorganic insulating layer such as a nitride layer or an oxide layer or an organic insulating layer such as photo-acryl.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">A touch pad region is defined in a part of the touch panel <b>400</b> and the touch pad region is provided with pad electrodes <b>421</b> and thus connected to a flexible printed cable (FPC) <b>430</b> including a touch controller <b>431</b> to generate touch-driving signals.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The connection metal <b>401</b> and the pad electrode <b>421</b> are simultaneously formed, and at the same time, routing lines <b>411</b> to apply signals to the first and second electrodes <b>403</b> and <b>404</b> are also formed. Furthermore, a routing contact line <b>415</b> to contact the routing lines <b>411</b> with the first electrodes <b>403</b> or the second electrodes <b>404</b> is formed on the end of the first and second electrode <b>403</b> and <b>404</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The pad region is formed over the seal pattern <b>250</b> of the liquid crystal panel <b>100</b>. The pad electrode <b>421</b> partially overlaps the seal pattern <b>250</b> and is formed at the edge of the second substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">A method for forming the touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device is as follows.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The first electrodes <b>403</b> and the second electrodes <b>404</b> are arranged in a display region (a display region in a seal pattern region) of the second substrate <b>200</b> on the outer surface of the second substrate <b>200</b> and a routing line <b>411</b>, a pad electrode <b>421</b>, an insulating layer <b>402</b> and an interlayer dielectric layer <b>405</b> are formed in the periphery thereof to constitute a touch panel <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Subsequently, the second substrate <b>200</b> provided with the touch panel <b>400</b> is reversed to form a color filter array and a thin film transistor array on the second substrate <b>200</b> and the first substrate <b>100</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">Subsequently, a seal pattern <b>250</b> is formed at one edge of the first substrate <b>100</b> or the second substrate <b>200</b>, the substrates are joined and a liquid crystal layer is injected between the first and second substrates to define the seal pattern. Alternatively, a seal pattern <b>250</b> is formed on one of the first and second substrates <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>, liquid crystals are poured onto the substrate and the substrate is joined to the opposite substrate to define the liquid crystal layer <b>300</b> between the first and second substrates <b>100</b> and <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Subsequently, a first polarizing plate <b>110</b> and a second polarizing plate <b>120</b> are adhered to the bottom of the first substrate <b>100</b> and on the touch panel <b>400</b> present on the second substrate <b>200</b>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Subsequently, the FPC <b>430</b>, including the pad electrode <b>421</b> and the touch controller <b>431</b> in the touch panel <b>400</b>, is connected to the outer surface of the second substrate <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">The pad electrode <b>105</b> of the first substrate <b>100</b> is connected to the PCB <b>150</b> via a COF <b>130</b> at one side of the PCB <b>150</b>.

<p id="p-0102" num="0101">Subsequently, the FPC <b>430</b> is adhered to the side of the second substrate <b>200</b> to allow the touch electrode arranged at one side of the second substrate <b>200</b> to be operated through the touch controller <b>431</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">Also, the first and second polarizing plates <b>110</b> and <b>120</b> include a display region of the liquid crystal panel <b>1000</b> and partially overlap an inner side of the seal pattern <b>250</b>.</p>

In this case, the FPC <b>430</b> is bent such that it passes a larger part of the second substrate <b>200</b>, as compared to the PCB <b>150</b> connected to the COF <b>130</b>. However, the FPC <b>430</b> is a flexible circuit substrate, and does not pass a glass substrate including a plurality of layers and further passes only a monolayer-second substrate at the vertically bent side surface monolayer-second substrate and may be thus sufficiently bent toward a lower side of the liquid crystal panel <b>1000</b>, when compared to a conventional structure.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">In this case, in order to prevent separation of the FPC <b>430</b>, the liquid crystal panel <b>1000</b> may be further provided at one side thereof with a double-sided tape.

<p id="p-0113" num="0112">The side corresponding to the side of the second substrate <b>200</b> or the first substrate <b>100</b>, in which the FPC <b>430</b> is bent, is a region in which the pad electrode is not formed. Metal lines formed in the FPC <b>430</b> do not cause short.</p>

<p id="p-0120" num="0119">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, for the touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device according to the third embodiment, FPCs <b>440</b><i>a </i>and <b>440</b><i>b </i>alternate with the COF <b>130</b> connected to the PCB <b>150</b> on the side at which the PCB <b>150</b> is formed. At this time, when one side of FPCs <b>440</b><i>a </i>and <b>440</b><i>b </i>is connected to the pad electrode of the touch panel in order to drive the touch panel and is bent at one side of the second substrate <b>200</b>, the other side thereof is connected to the PCB <b>150</b>. That is, in this case, the other side of the FPC <b>440</b><i>a </i>or <b>440</b><i>b </i>is connected to one side of the PCB <b>150</b> to synchronize and control operation of the touch panel through a timing controller (liquid crystal panel driving portion).</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Meanwhile, when compared to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows an embodiment in which the numbers of COF and FPC are varied and configuration of one side of the second substrate <b>200</b> is the same as in the previous embodiment).</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">As such, in the third embodiment, the PCB <b>150</b> can be connected to the FPCs <b>440</b><i>a </i>and <b>440</b><i>b </i>without using additional connectors and configuration thereof is thus simplified, as compared to the afore-mentioned first and second embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a sectional view illustrating a touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, for the touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device according to the fourth embodiment, the FPC is replaced by a wire <b>450</b>, when compared to the afore-mentioned configuration in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and in this case, the wire <b>450</b> is connected to one side of the COF <b>130</b> and receives signals from the PCB <b>150</b> through metal lines of the COF <b>130</b>. In this case, signals for driving the touch panel <b>400</b> are generated in the PCB <b>150</b> and a controller (not shown) of the touch panel <b>400</b> is provided in the PCB <b>150</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a plan view illustrating connection between a touch panel driving portion and a liquid crystal panel driving portion for a touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device according to a fifth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, for the touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device according to the fifth embodiment, the touch panel <b>400</b> is divided into, two driving regions, an A region and a B region, and two FPCs <b>450</b><i>a </i>and <b>450</b><i>b </i>(or <b>450</b><i>c </i>and <b>450</b><i>d</i>) are provided in each region. Each FPC <b>450</b><i>a</i>, <b>450</b><i>b</i>, <b>450</b><i>c </i>and <b>450</b><i>d </i>includes a driving chip <b>451</b><i>a</i>, <b>451</b><i>b</i>, <b>451</b><i>c </i>and <b>451</b><i>d</i>, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In this case, the FPCs <b>450</b><i>a</i>, <b>450</b><i>b</i>, <b>450</b><i>c </i>and <b>450</b><i>c </i>are connected to the PCB <b>150</b> through wires (not shown) or connectors (not shown) and the PCB <b>150</b> is connected to a host system (not shown) through a separate connector (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> is a plan view illustrating connection between a touch panel driving portion and a liquid crystal panel driving portion for a touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device according to a sixth embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">The touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device according to the sixth embodiment is different from that of the fifth embodiment in that two chips <b>461</b> and <b>462</b> (or <b>463</b> and <b>464</b>) are provided in one FPC <b>460</b><i>a </i>or <b>460</b><i>b </i>in each divisional driving region.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Meanwhile, in the afore-mentioned embodiments, the FPC and (touch panel) pad electrode connected thereto are formed over the seal pattern <b>250</b>, to endure shock generated upon bonding the FPC to the pad electrode and thus prevent damage to cells.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">When bonding the FPC in which the pad electrode is formed on the seal pattern, it may be difficult to perform desired alignment and indentation tests. Accordingly, the pad electrode is arranged such that it partially overlaps the seal pattern to endure shock applied to the liquid crystal panel upon bonding, facilitating alignment and indentation testing and thus improving efficiency of process.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Also, in the afore-mentioned embodiments, the FPC or wire to operate the touch panel is primarily connected to the PCB for driving the liquid crystal panel to synchronize touching with operation of the liquid crystal panel.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">The touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device may be applied to cellular phones, mobile equipment such as PDAs, notebooks, monitors, TVs, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Also, operation mode of the liquid crystal panel may vary configurations of the thin film transistor array and color filter array and examples thereof include TN, IPS, VA and ECB modes.</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Meanwhile, the pad portion including the pad electrode in the touch panel partially overlaps the seal pattern of the liquid crystal panel and extends to the periphery thereof, to endure shock applied upon bonding the pad electrode to the FPC for driving the touch panel.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Also, for an on-cell touch panel integrated with a touch panel to reduce panel cost and thickness, wire bonding is used for the contact between the pad electrode connected to the routing line of the touch panel and the board provided with chips to operate touch on the outer surface of the color filter substrate, to reduce defects and inefficient operations due to the step between the FPC bonding portion and the COF bonding portion, and two chips are provided on one FPC, when multiple chips are used, thus providing an efficient interface.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Consequently, when defective elements caused by the step between the FPC bonding portion for driving touch panel and COF bonding portion for driving the liquid crystal panel are removed or multiple chips are used, the number of FPC bonding processes can be reduced, yield can be increased, and module manufacturing process can be easily performed, thus reducing manufacturing costs.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">Meanwhile, the mode used for the touch panel may be applied to mutual capacitive mode and self-capacitive mode. For example, a case in which a driving voltage is applied to the first electrode and the second electrode senses voltage drop depending on touch is referred to as a mutual capacitive mode, and a case in which a driving voltage is applied to first and second electrodes, and the first and second electrodes independently sense voltage variation depending on touch is referred to as a self capacitive mode.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">The touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device has the following advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">First, unlike a conventional structure in which a touch panel provided with a separate substrate and a plurality of layers arranged thereon is joined to a liquid crystal panel, touch panel electrodes and an insulating layer to protect and contact the same are directly arranged on the outer surface of an upper substrate to constitute the liquid crystal panel, thereby forming the touch panel. As a result, there is no need to increase the number of substrates for the touch panel-integrated liquid crystal display device, to realize a slim device and thus process simplification and cost savings.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">Second, the pad electrode of the touch panel is provided on one side of the upper substrate and a flexible printed cable is connected to the pad electrode. As a result, the flexible printed cable is arranged on one layer of the second substrate and the printed circuit board to operate the liquid crystal panel can thus be easily connected. That is, the printed circuit board to operate the liquid crystal panel can be connected by bending the corresponding thickness of the second substrate, and the flexible printed cable can thus be directly bonded to the printed circuit board for driving the liquid crystal panel due to the short distance.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">Third, the pad electrode of the touch panel is arranged such that it partially the seal pattern of the liquid crystal panel and extends to the periphery of the seal pattern. As a result, the seal patterns can ensure pressure applied upon connecting (bonding) the pad electrode to the flexible printed cable, damage to the upper substrate can be prevented, and process conditions can be tuned to efficiently bond the pad electrode to the flexible printed cable. In addition, the pad electrode is formed such that it extends to the periphery of the seal pattern, to readily obtain the desired alignment and enable indentation testing after bonding.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142">Fourth, to drive the touch panel, the wire, instead of the flexible printed cable provided with a controller (chip) for driving the touch panel, is connected to the pad electrode, and a touch panel controller is further provided on the printed circuit board for driving the liquid crystal panel, the touch panel controller is connected to the wire, to solve difficult mounting induced by the step between the upper substrate, on which the touch panel is formed, and the printed circuit board for driving the liquid crystal panel.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">Fifth, when the touch panel is divisionally operated, divisional operation number of a plurality of touch panel controllers are formed on the flexible printed cable and circuit mounting can thus be simplified.</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Sixth, in the case where the number of electrodes for driving the touch panel is many, when a given number of output pins needs to be assigned to the predetermined chip (touch panel controller), they can be arranged on one flexible printed cable and can be thus readily mounted with the printed circuit board for driving the liquid crystal panel. That is, separate connection of a plurality of chips is not required due to connection of one flexible printed cable to the printed circuit board for driving the liquid crystal panel.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the present invention without departing from the spirit or scope of the inventions. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.</p>
