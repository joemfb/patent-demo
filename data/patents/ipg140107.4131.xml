<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This disclosure relates to head-mounted display apparatus employing one or more reflective optical surfaces, e.g., one or more free space, ultra-wide angle, reflective optical surfaces (hereinafter abbreviated as &#x201c;FS/UWA/RO surfaces&#x201d;). More particularly, the disclosure relates to head-mounted display apparatus in which reflective optical surfaces such as FS/UWA/RO surfaces are employed to display imagery from a light-emitting display system held in close proximity to a user's eye.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A head-mounted display such as a helmet-mounted display or eyeglass-mounted display (abbreviated herein as a &#x201c;HMD&#x201d;) is a display device worn on the head of an individual that has one or more small display devices located near one eye or, more commonly, both eyes of the user. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows the basic elements of one type of HMD which includes a display <b>11</b>, a reflective optical surface <b>13</b>, and an eye <b>15</b> having a center of rotation <b>17</b>. As shown in this figure, light <b>19</b> from display <b>11</b> is reflected by surface <b>13</b> and enters the user's eye <b>15</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some HMDs display only simulated (computer-generated) images, as opposed to real-world images, and accordingly are often referred to as &#x201c;virtual reality&#x201d; or immersive HMDs. Other HMDs superimpose (combine) a simulated image upon a non-simulated, real-world image. The combination of non-simulated and simulated images allows the HMD user to view the world through, for example, a visor or eyepiece on which additional data relevant to the task to be performed is superimposed onto the forward field of view (FOV) of the user. This superposition is sometimes referred to as &#x201c;augmented reality&#x201d; or &#x201c;mixed reality.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Combining a non-simulated, real-world view with a simulated image can be achieved using a partially-reflective/partially-transmissive optical surface (a &#x201c;beam splitter&#x201d;) where the surface's reflectivity is used to display the simulated image as a virtual image (in the optical sense) and the surface's transmissivity is used to allow the user to view the real world directly (referred to as an &#x201c;optical see-through system&#x201d;). Combining a real-world view with a simulated image can also be done electronically by accepting video of a real world view from a camera and mixing it electronically with a simulated image using a combiner (referred to as a &#x201c;video see-through system&#x201d;). The combined image can then be presented to the user as a virtual image (in the optical sense) by means of a reflective optical surface, which in this case need not have transmissive properties.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">From the foregoing, it can be seen that reflective optical surfaces can be used in HMDs which provide the user with: (i) a combination of a simulated image and a non-simulated, real world image, (ii) a combination of a simulated image and a video image of the real world, or (iii) purely simulated images. (The last case is often referred to as an &#x201c;immersive&#x201d; system.) In each of these cases, the reflective optical surface produces a virtual image (in the optical sense) that is viewed by the user. Historically, such reflective optical surfaces have been part of optical systems whose exit pupils have substantially limited not only the dynamic field of view available to the user, but also the static field of view. Specifically, to see the image produced by the optical system, the user needed to align his/her eye with the optical system's exit pupil and keep it so aligned, and even then, the image visible to the user would not cover the user's entire full static field of view, i.e., the prior optical systems used in HMDs that have employed reflective optical surfaces have been part of pupil-forming systems and thus have been exit-pupil-limited.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The reason the systems have been so limited is the fundamental fact that the human field of view is remarkably large. Thus, the static field of view of a human eye, including both the eye's foveal and peripheral vision, is on the order of &#x2dc;150&#xb0; in the horizontal direction and on the order of &#x2dc;130&#xb0; in the vertical direction. (For the purposes of this disclosure, 150 degrees will be used as the straight ahead static field of view of a nominal human eye.) Well-corrected optical systems having exit pupils capable of accommodating such a large static field of view are few and far between, and when they exist, they are expensive and bulky.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Moreover, the operational field of view of the human eye (dynamic field of view) is even larger since the eye can rotate about its center of rotation, i.e., the human brain can aim the human eye's foveal+peripheral field of view in different directions by changing the eye's direction of gaze. For a nominal eye, the vertical range of motion is on the order of &#x2dc;40&#xb0; up and &#x2dc;60&#xb0; down and the horizontal range of motion is on the order of &#xb1;&#x2dc;50&#xb0; from straight ahead. For an exit pupil of the size produced by the types of optical systems previously used in HMDs, even a small rotation of the eye would substantially reduce what overlap there was between the eye's static field of view and the exit pupil and larger rotations would make the image disappear completely. Although theoretically possible, an exit pupil that would move in synchrony with the user's eye is impractical and would be prohibitively expensive.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In view of these properties of the human eye, there are three fields of view which are relevant in terms of providing an optical system which allows a user to view an image generated by an image display system in the same manner as he/she would view the natural world. The smallest of the three fields of view is that defined by the user's ability to rotate his/her eye and thus scan his/her fovea over the outside world. The maximum rotation is on the order of &#xb1;50&#xb0; from straight ahead, so this field of view (the foveal dynamic field of view) is approximately 100&#xb0;. The middle of the three fields of view is the straight ahead static field of view and includes both the user's foveal and peripheral vision. As discussed above, this field of view (the foveal+peripheral static field of view) is on the order of 150&#xb0;. The largest of the three fields of view is that defined by the user's ability to rotate his/her eye and thus scan his/her foveal plus his/her peripheral vision over the outside world. Based on a maximum rotation on the order of &#xb1;50&#xb0; and a foveal+peripheral static field of view on the order of 150&#xb0;, this largest field of view (the foveal+peripheral dynamic field of view) is on the order of 200&#xb0;. This increasing scale of fields of view from at least 100 degrees to at least 150 degrees and then to at least 200 degrees provides corresponding benefits to the user in terms of his/her ability to view images generated by an image display system in an intuitive and natural manner.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">There thus exists a need for head-mounted displays that have improved compatibility with the field of view, both static and dynamic, of the human eye. The present disclosure is directed to this need and provides head-mounted displays that employ reflective optical surfaces which provide an ultra-wide angle field of view.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DEFINITIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the remainder of this disclosure and in the claims, the phrase &#x201c;virtual image&#x201d; is used in its optical sense, i.e., a virtual image is an image that is perceived to be coming from a particular place where in fact the light being perceived does not originate at that place.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">A FS/UWA/RO surface is referred to herein as a &#x201c;free space&#x201d; surface because its local spatial positions, local surface curvatures, and local surface orientations are not tied to a particular substrate, such as the x-y plane, but rather, during the surface's design, are determined using fundamental optical principles (e.g., the Fermat and Hero least time principle) applied in three dimensional space.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The FS/UWA/RO surface is referred to as an &#x201c;ultra-wide angle&#x201d; surface because, during use, at a minimum, it does not limit the dynamic foveal field of view of a nominal user's eye. As such, depending on the optical properties of optional optical components that may be used with the &#x201c;ultra-wide angle&#x201d; surface, e.g., a Fresnel lens system, the overall optical system of the HMD can be non-pupil forming, i.e., unlike conventional optical systems that have an exit pupil which limits the user's field of view, the operative pupil for various embodiments of the optical systems disclosed herein will be the entrance pupil of the user's eye as opposed to one associated with the external optical system. Concomitantly, for these embodiments, the field of view provided to the user will be much greater than conventional optical systems where even a small misalignment of the user's eye with the exit pupil of the external optical system can substantially reduce the information content available to the user and a larger misalignment can cause the entire image to disappear.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Throughout this disclosure, the following phrases/terms shall have the following meanings/scope:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0015">(1) The phrase &#x201c;a reflective optical surface&#x201d; (also referred to herein as a &#x201c;reflective surface&#x201d;) shall include surfaces that are only reflective as well as surfaces that are both reflective and transmissive. In either case, the reflectivity can be only partial, i.e., part of the incident light can be transmitted through the surface. Likewise, when the surface is both reflective and transmissive, the reflectivity and/or the transmissivity can be partial. As discussed below, a single reflective optical surface can be used for both eyes or each eye can have its own individual reflective optical surface. Other variations include using multiple reflective optical surfaces for either both eyes or individually for each eye. Mix and match combinations can also be used, e.g., a single reflective optical surface can be used for one eye and multiple reflective optical surfaces for the other eye. As a further alternative, one or multiple reflective optical surfaces can be provided for only one of the user's eyes. The claims set forth below are intended to cover these and other applications of the reflective optical surfaces disclosed herein. In particular, each claim that calls for a reflective optical surface is intended to cover head-mounted display apparatus that includes one or more reflective optical surfaces of the type specified.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0016">(2) The phrase &#x201c;an image display system having at least one light-emitting surface&#x201d; is used generally to include any display system having a surface which emits light whether by transmission of light through the surface, generation of light at the surface (e.g., by an array of LEDs), reflection off of the surface of light from another source, or the like. The image display system can employ one or multiple image display devices, e.g., one or multiple LED and/or LCD arrays. As with reflective optical surfaces, a given head-mounted display apparatus can incorporate one or more image display systems for one or both of the user's eyes. Again, each of the claims set forth below that calls for an image display system is intended to cover head-mounted display apparatus that includes one or more image display systems of the type specified.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0017">(3) The phrase &#x201c;binocular viewer&#x201d; means an apparatus that includes at least one separate optical element (e.g., one display device and/or one reflective optical surface) for each eye.</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0004" num="0018">(4) The phrase &#x201c;field of view&#x201d; and its abbreviation FOV refer to the &#x201c;apparent&#x201d; field of view in image (eye) space as opposed to the &#x201c;real&#x201d; field of view in object (i.e., display) space.</li>

<p id="p-0038" num="0041">In one embodiment, the headed-mount display apparatus <b>100</b> can be, for example, an optical see-through, augmented reality, binocular viewer. Because an optical see-through, augmented reality, binocular viewer is typically the most complex form of a HMD, the present disclosure will primarily discuss embodiments of this type, it being understood that the principles discussed herein are equally applicable to optical see-through, augmented reality, monocular viewers, video see-through, augmented reality, binocular and monocular viewers, and binocular and monocular &#x201c;virtual reality&#x201d; systems.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0042">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, the head-mounted display apparatus <b>100</b> includes a frame <b>107</b> adapted to be worn by the user and supported by the user's nose and ears in a manner similar to that in which eyeglasses are worn. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2-3</figref>, as well as in the other embodiments disclosed herein, the head-mounted display apparatus may have a variety of configurations and can, for example, resemble conventional goggles, glasses, helmets, and the like. In some embodiments, a strap may be used to hold the HMD's frame in a fixed position with respect to the eyes of the user. In general terms, the outside surface of the HMD package can assume any form that holds the optical system in the required orientation with respect to the HMD's display(s) and the user's eyes.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">The head-mounted display apparatus <b>100</b> includes at least one image display system <b>110</b> and at least one optical system that includes a reflective optical surface which, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, is free space, ultra-wide angle, reflective optical surface <b>120</b>, i.e., FS/UWA/RO surface <b>120</b>, which by necessity is curved. In some embodiments, the FS/UWA/RO surface can be the entire optical system. Surface <b>120</b> can be purely reflective or can have both reflective and transmissive properties, in which case, it can be thought of as a type of &#x201c;beam splitter.&#x201d; In one embodiment, the frame <b>107</b> supports the image display system <b>110</b> at a fixed location which during use of the HMD, is outside of the user's field of view. Additionally, as disclosed herein, the reflective optical surface <b>120</b> may not be rationally symmetric (is not a surface of revolution) about axes of a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system (x, y, or z), thus having an arbitrary origin.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">The FS/UWA/RO surface <b>120</b> may completely surround one or both eyes, as well as the at least one image display system <b>110</b>. In particular, the surface can curve around the sides of the eyes and toward the sides of the face so as to expand the available horizontal field of view. In one embodiment, the FS/UWA/RO surface <b>120</b> may extend up to 180&#xb0; or more (e.g., more than 200&#xb0;), as best seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> discussed below. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the HMD may include two separate FS/UWA/RO surfaces <b>120</b>R and <b>120</b>L for the user's two eyes which are separately supported by the frame and/or a nasal ridge piece <b>210</b> (see below). Alternately, the HMD may employ a single FS/UWA/RO surface that serves both eyes with a single structure, some portions of which are viewed by both eyes and other portions of which are viewed by only one eye.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">As noted immediately above and as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the head-mounted display apparatus <b>100</b> can include a nasal ridge piece <b>210</b>. The nasal ridge piece can be a vertical bar or wall which provides a separation between two FS/UWA/RO surfaces, one for each of the user's eye. The nasal ridge piece <b>210</b> can also provide a separation between the fields of view of the user's two eyes. In this way, the user's right eye can be shown a first representation of three dimensional physical reality in the environment by displaying a first image to the right eye via a first image display device and a first FS/UWA/RO surface, while the user's left eye is shown a second representation of three dimensional physical reality in the environment by displaying a second image to the left eye via a second image display device and a second FS/UWA/RO surface. A separate display device/reflective surface combination thus services each eye of the user, with each eye seeing the correct image for its location relative to the three dimensional physical reality in the environment. By separating the user's two eyes, the ridge piece <b>210</b> allows the image applied to each eye to be optimized independently of the other eye. In one embodiment, the nasal ridge piece's vertical wall may include two reflectors, one on each side, to allow the user to see imagery as he/she turns his/her eyes nasally, either to the left or to the right.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">The at least one image display system <b>110</b> can be mounted inside the FS/UWA/RO surface <b>120</b> and may be horizontally disposed or at a slight angle with respect to the horizon. Alternatively, the at least one image display system can be located just outside of the FS/UWA/RO surface. The tilt or angle of the at least one image display system <b>110</b> or, more particularly, its at least one light-emitting surface, will in general be a function of the location of the pixels, images, and/or pieces of display information that are to be reflected from the surface <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">In certain embodiments, the head-mounded display apparatus <b>100</b> is configured to create an interior cavity, with the FS/UWA/RO surface being reflective inward into the cavity. For a FS/UWA/RO surface having transmissive properties, the image or display information from the at least one image display system is reflected into the cavity and to the user's eye from the surface while, simultaneously, light also enters the cavity and the user's eye from the external world by passing through the reflective surface.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">As discussed in detail below, in certain embodiments, the at least one image display system <b>110</b> provides images and/or pieces of display information that prior to entering the user's eye(s) are adjusted for near viewing. In some embodiments, an optional lens or lens system <b>115</b> may contribute to this adjusting. Commonly-assigned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/211,365, filed Aug. 17, 2011, in the names of D. Smith, G. Wiese, G. Cuddihy, and G. Harrison, entitled &#x201c;Head-Mounted Display Apparatus Employing One or More Fresnel Lenses,&#x201d; the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, describes the use of one or more Fresnel lenses for this purpose. Other embodiments do not utilize the optional lens or lens system, and instead rely on the FS/UWA/RO surface to provide desired optical properties for in-focus, near-to-the-eye viewing of the images formed by the display system.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">The head-mounted display apparatus can include an electronics package <b>140</b> to control the images that are displayed by the at least one image display system <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the electronics package <b>140</b> includes accelerometers and gyroscopes that provide location, orientation and position information needed to synchronize images from the at least one image display projection system <b>110</b> with user activities. Power and video to and from the head-mounted display apparatus <b>100</b> can be provided through a transmission cable <b>150</b> coupled to the electronics package <b>140</b> or through a wireless medium.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">A set of cameras <b>170</b> may be situated on opposite sides of the head-mounted display apparatus <b>100</b> to provide input to the electronics package to help control the computer generation of, for example, &#x201c;augmented reality&#x201d; scenes. The set of cameras <b>170</b> may be coupled to the electronics package <b>140</b> to receive power and control signals and to provide video input to the electronics package's software.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">The image display system used in the head-mounted display apparatus can take many forms, now known or subsequently developed. For example, the system can employ small high resolution liquid crystal displays (LCDs), light emitting diode (LED) displays, and/or organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays, including flexible OLED screens. In particular, the image display system can employ a high-definition small-form-factor display device with high pixel density, examples of which may be found in the cell phone industry. A fiber-optic bundle can also be used in the image display system. In various embodiments, the image display system can be thought of as functioning as a small screen television. If the image display system produces polarized light (e.g., in the case where the image display system employs a liquid crystal display where all colors are linearly polarized in the same direction), and if the FS/UWA/RO surface is polarized orthogonally to the light emitted by the display, then light will not leak out of the FS/UWA/RO surface. The information displayed and the light source itself will accordingly not be visible outside of the HMD.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">Overall operation of an exemplary embodiment of an optical system constructed in accordance with the present disclosure, specifically, an optical system for an &#x201c;augmented reality&#x201d; HMD, is illustrated by the ray-tracings of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, specifically, light rays <b>180</b>, <b>185</b>, and <b>190</b>. In this embodiment, FS/UWA/RO surface <b>120</b> has both reflective and transmissive properties. Using surface <b>120</b>'s transmissive properties, light ray <b>190</b> enters from the environment through the surface and proceeds towards the user's eye. From the same region of surface <b>120</b>, light ray <b>180</b> is reflected by the surface (using the surface's reflective properties) and joins light ray <b>190</b> to create combined light ray <b>185</b> that enters the user's eye when the user looks in the direction of point <b>195</b>, i.e., when the user's direction of gaze is in the direction of point <b>195</b>. While so looking, the user's peripheral vision capabilities allow the user to see light from other points in the environment which pass through surface <b>120</b>, again using the surface's transmissive properties.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a further ray-trace drawing illustrating the operation of an exemplary embodiment of the head-mounted display apparatus <b>100</b> disclosed herein. In this embodiment, the overall vision system includes three parts: (1) the at least one image display system <b>110</b>, (2) FS/UWA/RO surface <b>120</b>, and (3) the user's eye <b>310</b>. The eye <b>310</b> is represented with an internal lens <b>330</b>. The light emitted from a pixel of the at least one image display system <b>110</b> is represented by ray <b>180</b>, as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. This light will appear at a point on the retina of the user's eye after being reflected by surface <b>120</b> provided the user's direction of gaze and associated field of view (see the discussion of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> below) include the point at which ray <b>180</b> strikes surface <b>120</b>. More particularly, as discussed below, due to the optical properties involving the normal that bisects the vectors to the eye and to the pixel from the point on the FS/UWA/RO surface, the pixel will only appear at point <b>195</b>; that is, even though light radiates from the pixel in a wider cone, the FS/UWA/RO surface is engineered to only let the light come from one location.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, it is assumed that the user's direction of gaze is towards the point of intersection of ray <b>180</b> with surface <b>120</b>, as illustrated by light rays <b>185</b> and <b>340</b>. What the eye sees, however, is a virtual image that appears in the space ahead of it, at a distance represented by vectors <b>345</b> and <b>350</b>, e.g., at infinity as shown by reference number <b>352</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a chair is used for purposes of illustration, with the at least one image display system <b>110</b> producing a real image <b>355</b> of the chair which becomes virtual image <b>360</b> after reflection of the light emitted from the display system by FS/UWA/RO surface <b>120</b>. In an &#x201c;augmented reality&#x201d; environment, the optical system, including the FS/UWA/RO surface, could, for example, cause the virtual image <b>360</b> of the chair to appear to be at the same location as a person <b>365</b> actually in the physical environment. Note that ray <b>345</b>, which stops at a distance closer than infinity, is included in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> to show that the image can be made to optically appear at any distance between nearby and infinity. For instance, the person could be standing at 50 meters away, and that is where the chair would be placed.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref>, the at least one image display system is shown as having a planar light-emitting surface (e.g., surface <b>111</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). The display system may also have a curved light-emitting surface. Such an embodiment is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, where a light ray <b>405</b> emanates from a curved display screen <b>407</b> (curved light-emitting surface). This ray reflects from FS/UWA/RO surface <b>120</b> and enters the pupil <b>415</b> of the user's eye <b>310</b> (see ray <b>410</b>). In this embodiment, surface <b>120</b> also admits light represented by ray <b>345</b> from the external environment, thus allowing display-generated images to overlay external images. Note that for purposes of illustration, ray <b>345</b> is shown displaced from ray <b>410</b>; for a pure overlay of the external image, ray <b>345</b> will overlay ray <b>410</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">As discussed above, prior optical systems used in HMDs that have employed reflective optical surfaces have been pupil forming and thus have had limited viewing areas, a typical field of view being &#x2dc;60 degrees or less. This has greatly limited the value and capability of prior head-mounted display apparatuses. In various embodiments, the head-mounted displays disclosed herein have much wider fields of view (FOV), thus allowing much more optical information to be provided to the user compared to HMDs having smaller fields of view. The wide field of view can be greater than 100&#xb0;, greater than 150&#xb0;, or greater than 200&#xb0;. In addition to providing more information, the wide field of view allows the additional information may be processed by the user in a more natural manner, enabling better immersive and augmented reality experiences through a better match of the displayed images to physical reality.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">Specifically, in the exemplary embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, for a straight ahead direction of gaze, the eye is able to take in a whole viewing area represented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> by curved FS/UWA/RO surfaces <b>201</b> and <b>202</b>, corresponding to at least 150 degrees of horizontal field of view (FOV) for each eye (e.g., &#x2dc;168 degrees of horizontal FOV). This field of view is composed of the eye's foveal field of view and its peripheral field of view. In addition, the eye is allowed to move freely about its center of rotation to aim the combined foveal+peripheral field of view in different directions of gaze, as the eye naturally does when viewing the physical world. The optical systems disclosed herein thus allow the eye to obtain information throughout a range of motion in the same manner as the eye does when viewing the natural world.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">Examining <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> in more detail, this figure is a simplified line representation of the front of a user's head <b>200</b> as seen from the top. It shows FS/UWA/RO surfaces <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> placed in front of the user's eyes <b>203</b> and <b>204</b>. As discussed above, the FS/UWA/RO surfaces <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> may rest upon the user's nose <b>205</b> where they come together at the center front <b>214</b> of the user's head <b>200</b>. As discussed in detail below, the local normals and local spatial locations of surfaces <b>201</b> and <b>202</b> are adjusted so that images produced by the at least one image display system (not shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>) cover at least 100&#xb0;, e.g., in certain embodiments, at least 150&#xb0; and, in other embodiments, at least 200&#xb0;, of horizontal FOV for each eye. (Optionally, as also discussed below, the local radii of curvature are also adjusted to provide, when combined with a Fresnel lens system, distant virtual images.) For example, the local normals and local spatial locations can be adjusted to cover the user's complete &#x2dc;168 degree, straight ahead, horizontal, static field of view for each eye, with the 168 degrees extending from edge-to-edge of the FS/UWA/RO surfaces <b>201</b> or <b>202</b>, as shown by sight lines <b>210</b>,<b>211</b> and <b>212</b>,<b>213</b>. The sight lines thus correspond to the wide static field of view (foveal+peripheral) that is provided to the user. In addition, the user is free to move his/her eyes around rolling centers <b>215</b> and <b>216</b> while continuing to see computer-generated imagery.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, as well as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>5</b>, and <b>12</b>, the FS/UWA/RO surfaces are shown as parts of spheres for ease of presentation. In practice, the surfaces are not spheres, but have more complex configurations so that their local normals and local spatial locations (and, optionally, local radii of curvature) will provide the desired static and dynamic field of view (and, optionally, desired distances to the virtual images). Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the right side of the head-mounted display apparatus operates identically to left side, it being understood that the two sides can differ if desired for particular applications.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> further illustrate the static and dynamic fields of view provided by the FS/UWA/RO surfaces disclosed herein. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a user's nominal right eye <b>71</b> having a straight ahead direction of gaze <b>73</b>. The eye's foveal+peripheral field of view is shown by arc <b>75</b>, which has an angular extent of &#x2dc;168&#xb0;. Note that for ease of presentation, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6-8</figref>, the field of view is shown relative to the center of rotation of the user's eye as opposed to the center or edges of the user's pupil. In fact, the large field of view (e.g., &#x2dc;168&#xb0;) achieved by a human eye is a result of the large angular extent of the retina which allows highly oblique rays to enter the user's pupil and reach the retina.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> schematically shows the interaction of the field of view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> with a HMD having: (a) an image display system whose at least one light-emitting surface <b>81</b> has a first light-emitting region <b>82</b> (illustrated as a square) and a second light-emitting region <b>83</b> (illustrated as a triangle) and (b) a FS/UWA/RO surface having a first reflective region <b>84</b> which has a first local normal <b>85</b> and a second reflective region <b>86</b> which has a second local normal <b>87</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">As indicated above, the FS/UWA/RO surface is both a &#x201c;free space&#x201d; surface and an &#x201c;ultra-wide angle&#x201d; surface. In addition, as noted above and discussed in more detail below, the surface can participate in (or be the sole source of) collimation (or partial collimation) of the light that enters the user's eye. Such collimation causes the virtual image produced by the FS/UWA/RO surface to appear to be located a long distance from the user, e.g., 30 meters or more, which permits the user to easily focus on the virtual image with a relaxed eye.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0063">The &#x201c;free space&#x201d; and &#x201c;ultra-wide angle&#x201d; aspects of the FS/UWA/RO surface can be achieved by adjusting the local normals of the surface so that the user's eye sees light-emitting regions of the at least one image display system as coming from predetermined regions of the FS/UWA/RO surface (predetermined locations on the surface).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0064">For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the designer of the HMD might decide that it would be advantageous for a virtual image <b>88</b> of the square to be viewed by the center portion of the user's retina when the user's direction of gaze is straight ahead and for a virtual image <b>89</b> of the triangle to be viewed by the center portion of the user's retina when the direction of gaze is, for example, &#x2dc;50&#xb0; to the left of straight ahead. The designer would then configure the at least one image display system, the FS/UWA/RO surface, and any other optical components of the system (e.g., one or more Fresnel lenses between the image display system and the FS/UWA/RO surface) so that the virtual image of the square would be straight ahead and the virtual image of the triangle would be 50&#xb0; to the left of straight ahead during use of the HMD.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0065">In this way, when the user's direction of gaze (line of sight) intersected the FS/UWA/RO surface straight on, the virtual image of the square would be visible at the center of the user's eye as desired, and when the user's direction of gaze (line of sight) intersected the FS/UWA/RO surface at 50 degrees to the left of straight ahead, the virtual image of the triangle would be visible at the center of the user's eye, as also desired. Although not illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref>, the same approaches are used for the vertical field of view, as well as for off-axis fields of view. More generally, in designing the HMD and each of its optical components, the designer &#x201c;maps&#x201d; the at least one light-emitting surface of the display to the reflective surface so that desired portions of the display are visible to the user's eye when the eye's gaze is in particular directions. Thus, as the eye scans across the field of view, both horizontally and vertically, the FS/UWA/RO surface shines different portions of the at least one light-emitting surface of the image display system into the user's eye. Although the foregoing discussion has been in terms of the center of a nominal user's retina, the design process can, of course, use the location of a nominal user's fovea instead, if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0066">It should be noted that in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, any rotation of the user's eye to right causes the virtual image <b>89</b> of the triangle to no longer be visible to the user. Thus, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, any direction of gaze that is straight ahead or to the left of straight ahead provides the user with virtual images of both the square and the triangle, while a direction of gaze to the right of straight ahead provides a virtual image of only the square. The acuity of the virtual images will, of course, depend on whether the virtual images are perceived by the user's foveal vision or the user's peripheral vision.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0067">If the designer of the HMD had placed the virtual image of the square far to the right in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> while leaving the virtual image of the triangle far to the left, there would be directions of gaze where only the virtual image of the square was visible and other directions of gaze where only the virtual image of the triangle was visible. Likewise, based on the principles disclosed herein, the designer could arrange the virtual image of the square and the virtual image of the triangle so that the virtual image of the triangle was always visible, with the virtual image of the square being visible for some directions of gaze, but not for others. As a further variation, the designer of the HMD could place the virtual image of the square and triangle at locations where for one or more directions of gaze, neither image was visible to the user, e.g., the designer could place the virtual images just outside the user's static field of view for a straight ahead direction of gaze. The flexibility provided to the HMD designer by the present disclosure is thus readily apparent.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">In one embodiment, the &#x201c;free space&#x201d; and the &#x201c;ultra-wide angle&#x201d; aspects of the reflective surface are achieved by using the principles of Fermat and Hero pursuant to which light travels along the shortest (least time) optical path. Commonly-assigned and co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/211,389, filed Aug. 17, 2011, in the names of G. Harrison, D. Smith, and G. Wiese, entitled &#x201c;Methods and Systems for Creating Free Space Reflective Optical Surfaces,&#x201d; the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference, describes an embodiment in which the Fermat and Hero principles are used to design FS/UWA/RO surfaces suitable for use in HMDs.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">In various embodiments, the HMD apparatus may provide the user with a full foveal dynamic field of view, a full foveal+peripheral static field of view, or a full foveal+peripheral dynamic field of view.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">Additionally, in various embodiments, the HMD apparatus may be a binocular non-pupil-forming system in which the eye is free to move about its rolling center throughout its normally obtainable angular extents without being constrained to look through an external pupil. Prior HMD devices have alleged that they have or can provide a wide field of view, but these devices have included an external pupil that the eye must look through. Although there is a wide amount of information provided to the eye, if the eye turns, the information is gone. This is the fundamental problem with pupil-forming systems which is avoided in embodiments of the present disclosure which employ reflective surfaces and, in particular, FS/UWA/RO surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">Furthermore, in certain embodiments of the above aspects of the disclosure, a separate reflective surface and/or a separate image display system is used for each of the user's eyes. In other embodiments, the reflective optical surface, either alone or in combination with other optical components (e.g., one or more Fresnel lenses), collimates (or substantially collimates) the light from the image display system, such collimation being achieved through the surface's local radii of curvature.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">By means of the Fermat and Hero least-time principles, any &#x201c;desired portion&#x201d; of the at least one light-emitting surface of an image display system (e.g., any pixel of an image display system) can be caused to have any desired point of reflection at the FS/UWA/RO surface, provided that the optical path from the desired portion of the at least one light-emitting surface to the point of reflection at the FS/UWA/RO surface and then to the center of rotation of the user's eye is at an extremum.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">An extremum in the optical path means that the first derivative of the optical path length has reached a zero value, signifying a maximum or a minimum in the optical path length. An extremum can be inserted at any point in the field of view by creating a local region of the reflective optical surface whose normal bisects (a) a vector from the local region to the user's eye (e.g., a vector from the center of the local region to the center of the user's eye) and (b) a vector from the local region to the &#x201c;desired portion&#x201d; of the light-emitting surface (e.g., a vector from the center of the local region to the center of the &#x201c;desired portion&#x201d; of the light-emitting surface). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref> illustrate the process for the case where the &#x201c;desired portion&#x201d; of the at least one light-emitting surface of the image display system is a pixel.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> shows a light-emitting surface <b>510</b> of an image display system composed of a generally rectangular array of pixels that are emanating light toward the front of a head-mounted display apparatus in the direction of light beam <b>515</b>. Light beam <b>515</b> bounces off of reflective optical surface <b>520</b>, which for ease of presentation is shown as a flat in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. Upon reflection, light beam <b>515</b> becomes light beam <b>525</b> that enters the user's eye <b>530</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0075">For the purposes of determining the surface normal of the reflector for each pixel, it is only necessary to determine the three-dimensional bisector of vectors corresponding to light beams <b>515</b> and <b>525</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, this bisector vector is shown in two-dimensional form as line <b>535</b>. Bisecting vector <b>535</b> is normal to the reflective optical surface at point of reflection <b>540</b>, which is the location on surface <b>520</b> where pixel <b>545</b> of light-emitting surface <b>510</b> will be visible to the user of the HMD.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0076">Specifically, in operation, pixel <b>545</b> in the display surface <b>510</b> emits light beam <b>515</b> that bounces off reflective optical surface <b>520</b> at an angle established by the surface normal corresponding to bisecting vector <b>535</b> and its perpendicular plane <b>550</b>, yielding by the Fermat and Hero principles, a reflected pixel at point of reflection <b>540</b> that is seen by the eye <b>530</b> along light beam <b>525</b>. In order to accurately calculate the surface normal at the point of reflection <b>540</b>, the beam <b>525</b> can pass through approximately the center <b>555</b> of the user's eye <b>530</b>.

The geometry is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, where the bisector is between the two longer vectors.
</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0087">The foregoing is, of course, merely a representative calculation serving to show the use of the Fermat and Hero principles of least time in determining local tangent plane angular constraints for a field of points making up a free-space (free-form) surface manifold of reflecting regions intended to present a contiguous virtual image to the viewer. The only real constant is the center of the user's eye, and the eye's natural field of view. All other components may be iteratively updated until an appropriate solution for a given image display system and reflective optical surface orientation is reached. Looked at another way, the pixel image reflection locations, M<b>1</b>, M<b>2</b>, . . . , Mn, and their associated normals and curvatures may be thought of as a matrix that is &#x201c;warped&#x201d; (adjusted) so that the FS/UWA/RO surface achieves the desired virtual image processing of computer-generated images formed by the image display system.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0088">In applying the Fermat and Hero principles, it should be noted that in some embodiments, it will be desirable to avoid the situation where the normals are adjusted such that the user sees the same pixel reflection at more than one point. It should also be noted that in some embodiments, the local regions of the reflective optical surface can be very small and may even correspond to a point on the reflector, with the points morphing into other points to make a smooth surface.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0089">In order to ensure that the user can easily focus on the virtual image of the &#x201c;desired portion&#x201d; of the at least one light-emitting surface (e.g., the virtual image of a pixel), the radius of curvature of the region surrounding the reflection point (reflection area) is controlled so that a collimated (or near collimated) image reaches the user. The collimated (or near collimated) image has optical rays that are more parallel, as if the image had originated at a far distance from the user, tens to hundreds of meters for instance. In order to achieve such a surface, the radius of curvature of the reflection region of the reflective optical surface corresponding to the &#x201c;desired portion&#x201d; of the at least one light-emitting surface (desired light-emitting pixel) may be kept to a radius near to one-half the distance from the reflection region to the actual &#x201c;desired portion&#x201d; of the light-emitting surface (actual pixel) on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0090">Thus, in one embodiment, the inter-reflected-pixel normal vector from the pixel of concern to the adjacent pixels satisfies a relationship that allows them to establish a radius of curvature of approximately one-half the length of the vector from the location of the reflected pixel on the reflective surface to the display pixel. Adjustments that affect this parameter include the size of the at least one light emitting surface and whether the at least one light emitting surface is curved.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0091"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> illustrates this embodiment. In order to control the radius of curvature of the region surrounding the pixel reflection so that a collimated (or near collimated) image reaches the user, two adjacent pixel reflecting regions, such as at the point of reflection <b>540</b>, are considered. More regions may be considered for better balance but two are sufficient. With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, two pixel reflective points <b>540</b> and <b>610</b> are shown with respect to two pixels, <b>545</b> and <b>615</b>, respectively on display surface <b>510</b>. The surface normals at points <b>540</b> and <b>610</b> are calculated along with the angle between their directions. The radius of curvature is calculated knowing these angles and the distance between the points <b>540</b> and <b>610</b>. Specifically, the surface configuration and, if needed, the surface's spatial location are adjusted until the radius of curvature is equal to (or approximately equal to) one-half of the average of the lengths of beams <b>515</b> and <b>620</b>. In this way, zero or near-zero diopter light can be provided to the user's eye. This is equivalent to light coming from a point essentially infinitely distant, and the light wavefront is flat, resulting in parallel surface normals to the light's wavefront.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0092">In addition to controlling the local radii of curvature, in certain embodiments, as a first order point solution to having a collimated (or near collimated) image enter the eye, the at least one light emitting surface is nominally located a distance of one focal length away from the FS/UWA/RO surface, where the focal length is based on the average value of the radii of curvature of the various reflective regions making up the FS/UWA/RO surface.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0093">The result of applying the Fermat and Hero principles is a set of reflective regions that may be combined into a smooth reflective surface. This surface will, in general, not be spherical or symmetric. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a two dimensional representation of such a FS/UWA/RO surface <b>520</b>. As discussed above, surface <b>520</b> may be constructed such that the radii of curvature at points <b>710</b> and <b>720</b> are set to values which provide for relaxed viewing of the image being reflected from the at least one light-emitting surface of the image display system which is being reflected by the surface. In this way, looking in a certain direction represented by line <b>730</b> will provide a collimated (or near collimated) virtual image to the eye <b>530</b>, as will looking in a different direction represented by line <b>740</b>. To enable a smooth transition of viewing all across the field of view, the regions of the FS/UWA/RO surface may be smoothly transitioned from one control point to another, as may be performed by using Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) technology for splined surfaces, thus creating a smooth transition across the reflective surface. In some cases, the FS/UWA/RO surface may include a sufficient number of regions so that the surface becomes smooth at a fine grain level. In some embodiments, different magnifications for each portion of the display (e.g., each pixel) may be provided using a gradual gradient to allow better manufacturability, realization, and image quality.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> show a FS/UWA/RO surface created using the above techniques from two different perspectives. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15 and 16</figref> show a further refined version of the reflective surface of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref>, again from two perspectives. The FS/UWA/RO surfaces of these figures were designed using the computer-based techniques of the commonly-assigned and co-pending application entitled &#x201c;Methods and Systems for Creating Free Space Reflective Optical Surfaces,&#x201d; referred to above.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0095">From the foregoing, it can be seen that methods for designing head-mounted displays have been disclosed which in exemplary embodiments can include: determining a desired field of view, choosing a display surface size (e.g., width and height dimensions), choosing an orientation for the display surface relative to a reflective surface, cataloging the position of every pixel on the display surface, and choosing a location for display of every pixel from the display surface on the reflective surface. The display surface can be placed above the eye and tilted toward the reflective surface, allowing the curvature of the reflective surface to reflect light to the eye of the wearer. In further embodiments, the display surface may be placed in other positions, such as to the side of the eye or below the eye, with the reflective position and curvature selected to reflect the light from the display surface appropriately, or being tilted to a different degree.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0096">In certain embodiments, a three-dimensional instantiation or mathematical representation of the reflective surface can be created, with, as discussed above, each region of the reflective surface being a local region having a normal that bisects the vectors from the center of that region to the center of the user's eye and to the center of a pixel in the display surface. As also discussed above, the radii of curvature of regions surrounding a pixel reflection can be controlled so that a collimated (or near collimated) image reaches the user across the field of view. Through computer-based iterations, changeable parameters (e.g., local normals, local curvatures, local spatial locations) can be adjusted until a combination (set) of parameters is identified that provides a desired level of optical performance over the field of view, as well as a manufacturable design which is aesthetically acceptable.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0097">During use, the non-symmetrical FS/UWA/RO surface which, in certain embodiments, is constructed from a splined surface of multiple local regions of focus, forms a virtual image of the at least one light emitting surface of the image display system that is stretched across a wide field of view. The FS/UWA/RO surface may be thought of as a progressive mirror or progressive curved beam splitter or a free-form mirror or reflector. As the eye scans across the field of view, both horizontally and vertically, the curved FS/UWA/RO surface shines different portions of the at least one light-emitting surface of the image display system into the user's eye. In various embodiments, the overall optical system is manufacturable in large quantities at low cost while maintaining an image quality commensurate with typical human visual resolution.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0098">In terms of the overall structure of the HMD, Table 1 sets forth representative, non-limiting, examples of the parameters which a HMD display constructed in accordance with the present disclosure will typically meet. In addition, the HMD displays disclosed herein will typically have an inter-pixel distance that is small enough to ensure that a cogent image is established in the visual plane of the user.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0099">Various features that can be included in the head-mounted displays disclosed herein include, without limitation, the following, some of which have been referenced above:</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0100">(1) In some embodiments, one or more Fresnel lenses may be used to modify the diopter characteristics of the light beam emanating from the display surface.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0101">(2) In some embodiments, the reflective optical surface may be semi-transparent, allowing light to come in from the external environment. The internal display-generated images can then overlay the external image. The two images may be aligned through the use of localization equipment, such as gyroscopes, cameras, and software manipulation of the computer-generated imagery so that the virtual images are at the appropriate locations in the external environment. In particular, a camera, accelerometer, and/or gyroscopes can be used to assist the apparatus in registering where it is in the physical reality and to superimpose its images on the outside view. In these embodiments, the balance between the relative transmittance and reflectance of the reflective optical surface can be selected to provide the user with overlaid images with appropriate brightness characteristics. Also in these embodiments, the real world image and the computer-generated image can appear to both be at approximately the same apparent distance, so that the eye can focus on both images at once.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0102">(3) In some embodiments, the reflective optical surface is kept as thin as possible in order minimize effects on the position or focus of external light passing through the surface.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0103">(4) In some embodiments, the head-mounted display apparatus provides a field of view to each eye of at least 100 degrees, at least 150 degrees, or at least 200 degrees.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0104">(5) In some embodiments, the static field of view provided by the head-mounted display to each eye does not overlap the user's nose by any large degree.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0105">(6) In some embodiments, the reflective optical surface may employ a progressive transition of its optical prescription across the field of view to maintain focus on the available display area.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0106">(7) In some embodiments, ray tracing may be used to customize apparatus parameters for a particular implementation, such as military training, flight simulation, gaming and other commercial applications.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0107">(8) In some embodiments, the reflective optical surface and/or the surface of the display, as well as the curvatures of lenses (when used), and the distances between the display and the reflective optical surface and between the reflective optical surface and the eye, can be manipulated with respect to a Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) specification at the retina and/or the fovea.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0108">(9) In some embodiments, the HMDs disclosed herein can be implemented in applications such as, but not limited to, sniper detection, commercial training, military training and operations, and CAD manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0109">Once designed, the reflective optical surfaces disclosed herein (e.g., the FS/UWA/RO surfaces) can be produced e.g., manufactured in quantity, using a variety of techniques and a variety of materials now known or subsequently developed. For example, the surfaces can be made from plastic materials which have been metalized to be suitably reflective. Polished plastic or glass materials can also be used. For &#x201c;augmented reality&#x201d; applications, the reflective optical surfaces can be constructed from a transmissive material with embedded small reflectors thus reflecting a portion of an incident wavefront while allowing transmission of light through the material.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0110">For prototype parts, an acrylic plastic (e.g., plexiglas) may be used with the part being formed by diamond turning. For production parts, either acrylic or polycarbonate may, for example, be used with the part being formed by, for example, injection molding techniques. The reflective optical surface may be described as a detailed Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) description or as a non-uniform rational B-Spline NURBS surface, which can be converted into a CAD description. Having a CAD file may allow the device to be made using 3-D printing, where the CAD description results in a 3D object directly, without requiring machining.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0111">The mathematical techniques discussed above can be encoded in various programming environments and/or programming languages, now known or subsequently developed. A currently preferred programming environment is the Java language running in the Eclipse Programmer's interface. Other programming environments such as Microsoft Visual C# can also be used if desired. Calculations can also be performed using the Mathcad platform marketed by PTC of Needham, Mass., and/or the Matlab platform from MathWorks, Inc., of Natick, Mass. The resulting programs can be stored on a hard drive, memory stick, CD, or similar device. The procedures can be performed using typical desktop computing equipment available from a variety of vendors, e.g., DELL, HP, TOSHIBA, etc. Alternatively, more powerful computing equipment can be used including &#x201c;cloud&#x201d; computing if desired.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0112">A variety of modifications that do not depart from the scope and spirit of the invention will be evident to persons of ordinary skill in the art from the foregoing disclosure. For example, although reflective optical surfaces which provide the user with a large field of view, e.g., a field of view greater than or equal to 100&#xb0;, 150&#xb0;, or 200&#xb0;, constitute an advantageous embodiment of the design aspects of the invention, the computer-based methods and systems for designing reflective optical surfaces disclosed herein can also be used to create surfaces having smaller fields of view. The following claims are intended to cover these and other modifications, variations, and equivalents of the specific embodiments set forth herein.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0113">While embodiments have been described with reference to various embodiments, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various changes, omissions and/or additions may be made and equivalents may be substituted for elements thereof without departing from the spirit and scope of the embodiments. In addition, many modifications may be made to adapt a particular situation or material to the teachings of the embodiments without departing from the scope thereof. Therefore, it is intended that the embodiments not be limited to the particular embodiment disclosed as the best mode contemplated for carrying out this invention, but that all embodiments falling within the scope of the appended claims are considered. Moreover, unless specifically stated, any use of the terms first, second, etc., does not denote any order or importance, but rather the terms first, second, etc., are used to distinguish one element from another.</p>
