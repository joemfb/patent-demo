<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from European Patent Application No. 10156749.3 filed 17.03.2010, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention concerns a method of determining the location of an object sought by means of electromagnetic signals exchanged between a search device, incorporated in a portable object, and a target device attached to the object sought, wherein the search device includes a transceiver associated with a pair of antennae spaced apart from each other, display means, electronic means for managing the transceiver and the display means, and manual control means, and wherein the target device includes a transceiver associated with an antenna and with electronic means capable of detecting the reception of signals originating from the search device and responding with signals representing the identity of the target device.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">People misplace commonly used objects, or especially forget where they have left them, for example in a home or place of work. If the object is small, such as a set of keys or glasses, it may be difficult to find and the search may take a long time. This is why various wireless transmission location systems have already been proposed. The present invention proposes the use of wireless UVB (Ultra Wide Band) technology in a system of this type. The main advantages of using this technology in short distance location of objects are mentioned in US Patent Application 2006/0033662. However, to date, UWB signals used in these applications had to be combined with narrow band radiofrequency signals.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">US Patent Application No. 2008/0136644 discloses in detail a system of searching for and locating objects including identification tags which contain both narrow band RF circuits and UWB circuits. This system notably enables the distance between a local search device and an object sought to be measured using UWB technology, by measuring the return travel time of the signals. This document specifies that UWB technology enables relatively short distances to be measured with sufficient precision to locate objects, typically precision on the order of a decimetre or even a centimeter. However, the proposed system involves quite a complex structure and also requires a synchronisation operation to be performed between the search device and the tags for each search.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Another system using UWB signals for short distance object location is disclosed in EP Patent Application No 1 630 966 and one of the embodiments thereof has the features set out in the above preamble. This system is mainly intended for searching for a person who has a mobile terminal, for example a telephone, which constitutes the object sought and the target device within the meaning of the above description. The search method includes two successive phases. The first comprises responding to an emergency call, for example from the mobile terminal, by generally locating the mobile terminal, for example by means of GPS, and sending a rescue team to the location. The second phase comprises short distance location, generally to find victims, and uses the exchange of UWB signals between the mobile terminal sought and the search device held by the rescue crew, as explained below.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The mobile terminal emits characteristic UWB signals on demand, either by manual pressure on a key, or automatically in response to a location request, sent for example by short text message, or in response to detection of a dangerous situation by the terminal itself. To locate the mobile terminal using UWB signals, the search device includes four antennae arranged at the points of a rhombus and associated in pairs with an electronic circuit that measures the differences in the UWB signal reception time in each pair of antennae. From these measurements, the search device calculates the orthogonal coordinates of the mobile terminal relative to the frame of reference defined by the four antennae, then the polar coordinates (azimuth and distance) and displays the latter by means of a hand and a digital display.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The system disclosed in the aforecited document EP 1 630 966 cannot easily be applied to searching for misplaced objects, since the mobile terminal, which cannot be manually activated in such case, becomes too complicated to take the form of a tag, for example, and to have a standby mode with almost zero power consumption. Another drawback results from the need for four antennae placed at the points of a rhombus, which means the search device must have a relatively large volume.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is an object of the present invention to provide a method and system of locating an object that substantially avoid the drawbacks of the prior art. According to the objectives of the invention, the target device should be able to be made small enough to be discreetly associated with the object concerned, for example in the form of a wafer or adhesive label. The target device should be able to be switched on to respond to the search device with no action apart from receiving signals from the search device. It is another object of the invention to combine the search device with a portable electronic apparatus, some of whose components said device uses, so as to achieve a high level of miniaturisation and to allow the user to have the search device constantly available and carry it without any inconvenience.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The present invention concerns a location method as defined in the independent claim(s). Various dependent claims define particular modes of implementing the method according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">By combining exclusively UWB transmission with the use of a UWB wake-up signal for actuating the target device, it becomes possible to keep the latter in standby mode for a very long period of time, typically several years, using a small quantity of electrical energy. The target device, using a single frequency band and a single UWB antenna may be made in a much more reduced form that in the prior art, and can be attached to small objects, such as keyrings, a wallet or glasses. The power consumption of the search device is also notably reduced. In combination with the use of a single pair of antennae, of small size and separated by only a few centimeters given the very high frequency of the UWB signals, this allows the search device to be incorporated in a portable apparatus of small size, particularly a mobile telephone or watch.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The object location system shown very schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> includes a search device D<b>1</b> and at least one target device D<b>2</b>. Search device D<b>1</b> is incorporated in a portable apparatus <b>11</b> and includes a UWB transceiver, provided with two antennae A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>. Target device D<b>2</b> is attached to an object <b>12</b>, for example a set of keys, and includes a UWB transceiver, provided with an antenna A<b>3</b>. The drawing further shows that in most of the respective positions of devices D<b>1</b> and D<b>2</b>, the distance between antennae A<b>1</b> and A<b>3</b> differs from that between antennae A<b>2</b> and A<b>3</b>, thus the respective UWB signal travel times t<b>1</b> and t<b>2</b> over these distances are different.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">In the particular embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the portable apparatus <b>11</b> containing search device D<b>1</b> is an electronic watch, in particular a wristwatch, having manual control members <b>13</b>, such as push buttons and/or a control stem and/or a touch sensitive crystal. The electronic unit <b>14</b> of the search device is housed inside the sealed case of watch <b>11</b> and can be powered by the same battery as the watch. Because of the very high frequency (on the order of 3.1 to 10 GHz) used in UWB, the size of the antennae is very small. Microstrip antennae can notably be used. Antennae A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> have diametrically opposite locations, so that the distance d<b>0</b> separating them measured along axis <b>15</b>, which passes through the central point of each of the two antennae, is as large as possible. Depending upon the constituent material of the case, the antennae could be housed with the timepiece components inside said case. A value of d<b>0</b> of between approximately 3 and 4 cm is entirely compatible with the usual size of a wristwatch and with the precision necessary for the measurements and calculations described below. It will be noted that the UWB standard obtains precision of the order of magnitude of a millimeter.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">As stated above, one of the advantages of incorporating search device D<b>1</b> in a watch is that it is permanently available, since the user generally wears the watch all day. Another advantage lies in the possibility of using the usual display members of an electronic watch for the indications provided by the search device, insofar as the watch has an analogue time display, which can indicate directions using hands. A digital or alphanumerical display, provided for example for indicating the date or a measured time, can indicate the distance from the object sought, but this distance could also be indicated in an analogue manner, for example by means of a chronograph counter hand. Thus, there is a high level of synergy between the search device and the wristwatch, since the sealed case, the electric power source, the display means, the manual control means and the bracelet or strap for attachment to the user's wrist are all shared.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Reference will be made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> to describe an embodiment of the electronic circuit of search device D<b>1</b>. Antennae A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> are alternately connected to a UWB transmitter module <b>21</b> and to a UWB receiver module <b>22</b>, via a transmission/reception switch <b>20</b> (optional). Modules <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> are connected to a digital processing unit <b>23</b>, connected in turn to an entry key <b>24</b>, to an analogue display <b>25</b> and to a digital display <b>26</b>, with displays <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> also being used to display the time and other time-related values in watch <b>11</b>. Entry key <b>24</b> is a manual command, for example actuated by one of push buttons <b>13</b> of the watch or by a touch sensitive crystal.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The UWB transmitter module <b>21</b> includes a UWB pulse generator <b>28</b> and an amplifier <b>29</b> whose output signal simultaneously reaches the two antennae A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> via switch <b>20</b>. The UWB receiver module <b>22</b> includes two parallel chains respectively receiving the signals from antennae A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> and each including an amplifier <b>30</b><i>a</i>, <b>30</b><i>b</i>, an energy detector <b>31</b>, <b>31</b><i>b </i>and a demodulator <b>32</b><i>a</i>, <b>32</b><i>b </i>which delivers its output signal to digital processing unit <b>23</b>. Unit <b>23</b> coordinates the operation of elements <b>20</b>, <b>21</b> and <b>22</b> by the digital connections shown in dotted lines, performs the operations described below for calculating the position of the object sought and controls displays <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> to indicate this position.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the electronic unit of target device D<b>2</b> includes a UWB transmitter module <b>34</b> and a UWB receiver module <b>35</b>, which are alternately connected to antenna A<b>3</b> by a transmission/reception switch <b>36</b>. Modules <b>34</b> and <b>35</b> are connected to a digital processing unit <b>37</b>, connected in turn to an entry key <b>38</b> and, optionally, to an acoustic transducer <b>39</b>. The UWB transmitter <b>34</b> includes a UWB pulse generator <b>41</b> and an amplifier <b>42</b> whose output signal reaches antenna A<b>3</b> via switch <b>36</b>. UWB receiver module <b>35</b> includes an amplifier <b>43</b>, an energy detector <b>44</b> and a demodulator <b>45</b>, which delivers its output signal to digital processing unit <b>37</b>. This unit <b>37</b> coordinates the operation of elements <b>34</b>, <b>35</b> and <b>36</b> by digital signals on the connections shown in dotted lines, performs the operations described below for transmitting UWB signals in response to the received signals, and produces a warning signal to be diffused by acoustic transducer <b>39</b> if the latter is present.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">To ensure that D<b>2</b> consumes very little energy in the standby state, it includes an wake-up receiver <b>46</b>, which also receives the signals picked up by antenna A<b>3</b> and only switches on receiver module <b>35</b> after receiving an encoded wake-up signal. The structure and function of this type of wake-up receiver are known. An example embodiment is described in the article entitled &#x3c;&#x3c;A 2 GHz 52 &#x3bc;W Wake-Up Receiver With &#x2212;72 dBm Sensitivity Using Uncertain-IF Architecture&#x3e;&#x3e;, par N. Pletcher et al, 2008 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference, Digest of Technical Papers, p. 524-525. The basic structure is very simple. It is an envelope detector calibrated at the desired frequency. The received wake-up signal is an amplitude modulated signal, with a data sequence (code) identifying the device to be woken up. Since demodulation is very simple, the structure uses very little energy. The power provided by a miniature battery can keep this type of receiver on standby for a period of several years, depending upon the duty cycle selected.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Module <b>37</b> further includes a non volatile memory which stores the code representing the identity of the target device D<b>2</b>, so as to distinguish it from other similar target devices D<b>3</b>, D<b>4</b> etc. capable of being located by means of the same search device D<b>1</b>. This D<b>2</b> identity code must be stored in a memory of D<b>1</b> during a declaration operation, controlled for example by a combination of actions on entry key <b>38</b>, before the search device can be used to locate the target device. The same is true for the identity codes of the other target devices D<b>3</b>, D<b>4</b> etc. that one might wish to add to the system.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The operation of the system for locating object <b>12</b> linked to target device D<b>2</b> will now be described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 to 8</figref>. The diagram of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows the operational steps carried out in or by devices D<b>1</b>, D<b>2</b> and D<b>3</b> (if the latter is present in proximity) for an operation of locating object <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In the first step <b>101</b> that the user starts by suitable activation of control members <b>13</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) of watch <b>11</b>, search device D<b>1</b> emits a wake up signal <b>102</b> containing the identity code of target device D<b>2</b>. The latter receives and recognises signal <b>102</b> in step <b>103</b> by means of its wake up receiver <b>46</b>, which switches on the rest of the electronic circuit of D<b>2</b> in step <b>104</b>. In step <b>105</b>, D<b>2</b> emits an acknowledgement of receipt signal <b>106</b> which also contains its identity code. During this time, the other target device D<b>3</b> has also received, in <b>107</b>, the wake up signal <b>102</b>, since it was quite close by, but the D<b>3</b> wake up receiver does not recognise its identity in this signal, thus D<b>3</b> remains inactive in <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Search device D<b>1</b> receives signal <b>106</b> in step <b>109</b> and then starts a first location sequence, by a step <b>110</b> consisting in elaborating and simultaneously emitting a locating signal <b>111</b>, also containing the identity code of D<b>2</b>, across its two antenna A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, at an instant tini that starts a countdown in clock circuit <b>50</b> of D<b>1</b>. Let us assume that, at that moment, antenna A<b>3</b> of the target device is closer to antenna A<b>1</b> than to antenna A<b>2</b>, i.e. the travel time t<b>1</b> of locating signal <b>111</b> between A<b>1</b> and A<b>3</b> is shorter than the travel time t<b>2</b> between A<b>2</b> and A<b>3</b>. In step <b>112</b>, target device D<b>2</b> receives the signal <b>111</b> from antenna A<b>1</b>, at an instant tpktRx<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), which resets its clock circuit <b>51</b>, then it receives the same signal <b>111</b> from antenna A<b>2</b> at instant tpktRx<b>2</b> and measures the time difference tdiff=t<b>2</b>&#x2212;t<b>1</b> between these two receptions. In step <b>113</b>, D<b>2</b> elaborates and emits at instant tpktTx<b>3</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) a return signal <b>114</b>, which contains the time difference tdiff and a processing duration tproc which is the time interval between tpktRx<b>1</b> and tpktTx<b>3</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">As an option, D<b>2</b> may perform a step <b>115</b> consisting in emitting an acoustic signal via the acoustic transducer <b>39</b> thereof, to assist in locating the object sought audibly if conditions allow. In a variant, the duration of processing may correspond to the period of time between the second received signal and the return signal. It should be noted that it is possible, in another implementation of the location method, for the processing time to be predetermined. By knowing the possible travel time differences and the duration of data processing by the target device up to the transmission of the return signal, it is possible to define a fixed processing period which is sufficient and to arrange the target device so that it always sends its return signal exactly after this fixed period. In this variant, there is no need to transmit data relating to this fixed period in the return signal, since it can be introduced beforehand in a non-volatile manner in the search device.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">In step <b>116</b>, search device D<b>1</b> receives return signal <b>114</b> firstly at an instant tfin<b>1</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) via antenna A<b>1</b> thereof which is closest to antenna A<b>3</b>. This reception actuates a switch which temporarily isolates antenna A<b>2</b> from its UWB receiver, so that the latter is not operating at instant tfin<b>2</b> when the same signal will be received by antenna A<b>2</b>, so as to reduce the power consumption of D<b>1</b>. In digital processing module <b>23</b> of D<b>1</b>, the value tdist=tfin<b>1</b>&#x2212;tini is measured by a clock circuit.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In step <b>117</b>, module <b>23</b> of D<b>1</b> calculates the travel times:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>t</i>1=(<i>t</i>dist&#x2212;<i>t</i>proc)/2<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?><i>t</i>2<i>=t</i>1<i>+t</i>diff<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
which represent the corresponding distances d<b>1</b> and d<b>2</b> between antenna A<b>3</b> and each antenna A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>. The module then calculates, by triangulation in the plane of the three antennae from values d<b>0</b>, d<b>1</b> and d<b>2</b>, the polar coordinates of the possible position or positions of antenna A<b>3</b> and thus of the object sought <b>12</b> with reference to the watch and the axis <b>15</b> thereof, then operates a corresponding visual indication by display means <b>25</b> and <b>26</b> of watch <b>11</b> in step <b>118</b>. It will be noted that if t<b>1</b>&#x3e;t<b>2</b>, indices <b>1</b> and <b>2</b> should be swapped in the above formulae. It will also be noted that this method may be carried out in a similar manner using the D<b>1</b> antenna which is the second to receive the return signal.
</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Generally, the absolute value of d<b>2</b>&#x2212;d<b>1</b> is less than d<b>0</b> and the aforementioned triangulation calculation provides two possible symmetrical positions relative to axis <b>15</b>, referenced P and Q in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. In the present example, the respective directions of these positions are indicated by hour hand <b>51</b>, minutes hand <b>52</b> of analogue display <b>25</b>, whereas the common distance (4.9 m here) is indicated by digital display <b>26</b>. Evidently, at least one additional measurement is required to remove any ambiguity, after a movement has been imparted to search device D<b>1</b> in step <b>119</b> to place it in a new position in which it will carry out said measurement. For example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> the new position <b>11</b><i>a </i>is achieved by a movement of translation. It will be observed that the technology selected within the scope of the present invention, namely UWB technology, is a particularly appropriate choice because a UWB receiver is capable, according to UWB standard IEEE 802.15.4a, of distinguishing between the reception of two signals as soon as they are more than 15 ps (picoseconds) with a bandwidth of 499.2 MHz (this temporal distance may be further reduced with a larger bandwidth). Thus, the difference between d<b>1</b> and d<b>2</b> only has to be at least 5 millimeters for the receiver provided in device D<b>2</b> to be able to identify the reception of the two signals on the single antenna A<b>3</b> thereof. The invention is characterized in that, even with a small distance between the two antennae A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> of device D<b>1</b>, the reception of two signals, simultaneously emitted by the two antennae, are managed by the same single receiver associated with a single antenna in device D<b>2</b>. This means that less power is consumed, the time difference between reception of the two signals can be calculated using a straightforward electronic circuit and the determination of the time difference can be very precise.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">However, it will be noted that when antenna A<b>3</b> comes close to a perpendicular position to the direction of alignment of antennae A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>, the single receiver provided in D<b>2</b> is not longer able to distinguish the reception of the second signal correctly. At least two variants can be envisaged to respond to this particular problem within the scope of the invention. In a first variant of the location method, the user rotates search device D<b>1</b> at a certain angle, notably at least 30 degrees, after having given the search command. The locating signal is simultaneously emitted by the two antennae A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b> repeatedly at a given time interval. As soon as a valid return signal is received, the locating signal transmission ends. Otherwise, the transmission ends after a certain period of time and a non detection message is given to the user. In a second variant, a single locating signal is sent by the two antennae A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>. In the event of failure to locate, before concluding that the object sought is absent, the user has to rotate the search device at least by a certain angle and again actuate the control device to generate the emission of a new locating signal in a new spatial configuration. If the object sought is in the locating area, the search device will then be able to detect its position according to the method of the invention. Another variant, which may also be combined with one of the two preceding variants, envisages the receiver being able to recognise, at least in certain cases, the reception of at least one of the two signals whose separation in time it cannot determine and it then sends a specific message to the user to invite him to rotate the search device before another locating signal is transmitted, automatically or after the control means are actuated again.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">To perform the aforementioned additional measurement, to determine unambiguously the direction of the object sought from among two possible directions resulting from processing a first return signal, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> shows an embodiment of said movement in the form of a limited rotation of watch <b>11</b> in the plane of the dial thereof, so as to change the orientation of the reference axis <b>15</b> thereof without any translation, and thus without changing place. To simplify the drawing, watch <b>11</b> is represented only by the pair of antennae A<b>1</b> and A<b>2</b>. The frame of reference in the drawing is the Earth. The two possible positions of the object according to the first measurement are indicated by points P and Q.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">After a limited rotation w of watch <b>11</b>, for example clockwise, the new positions of the antennae define a new position of the reference axis <b>15</b>&#x2032; thereof, so that the coordinates stored for points P and Q define points P&#x2032; and Q&#x2032;, angularly shifted from w by P and Q. Device D<b>1</b> then performs a second locating sequence, including steps <b>120</b> to <b>125</b>, which are similar to steps <b>110</b>, <b>112</b>, <b>113</b>, <b>115</b>, <b>116</b> and <b>117</b> of the first sequence, but with complementary calculations in step <b>125</b>. This sequence is preferably started automatically, after a delay of between, for example, several tenths of a second and several seconds after step <b>117</b> but it could also be carried out by manual command. As the real position of the object sought <b>12</b> has not changed on Earth, the triangulation calculation performed in D<b>1</b> provides, in general, as before two possible positions of the object sought <b>12</b>, indicated here by points S and T. The point representing the position of object <b>12</b> is that which in practice coincides with P or Q, thus S which coincides with P in the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In the reference system based on axis <b>15</b>&#x2032;, D<b>1</b> has to select, in step <b>125</b>, which of points S and T is angularly shifted by &#x2212;w relative to P&#x2032; and Q&#x2032; respectively. It then operates a visual indication of the position of the object sought <b>12</b> by the watch display means in step <b>126</b>, the direction of this position being indicated by the two superposed hands <b>51</b> and <b>52</b>, whereas the distance is indicated by the digital display <b>26</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Distinguishing between S and T according to the direction of angular shift of each point, respectively from P&#x2032; and Q&#x2032;, requires indicating to search device D<b>1</b> the direction of rotation that watch <b>11</b> undergoes between the two locating sequences. A simple and economical solution consists in prescribing the direction of rotation in the operating instructions, for example clockwise. Otherwise, a gyroscope could be incorporated in D<b>1</b>, but this would involve a relatively expensive complication and an increase in power consumption. However, the gyroscope would allow the direction of the hands to be maintained relative to the environment when the orientation of the watch changes after the measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">If, for any reason, it was not possible to distinguish between S and T, D<b>1</b> could store their coordinates instead of those of P and Q, and then carry out a new locating sequence from step <b>120</b>. However, when the display has been performed normally in step <b>126</b>, the search is deemed finished and D<b>1</b> stops automatically at <b>127</b>. An end of search command is performed in target device D<b>2</b> in step <b>128</b>. This may occur automatically, for example by timing, or by a manual action on entry key <b>38</b>. D<b>2</b> is then in a standby state again in step <b>129</b> where only the wake-up receiver is switched on.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In a variant, another operating mode of search device D<b>1</b> can be provided, with periodic repetition of the locating sequence in different successive positions of watch <b>11</b>, while the user himself interprets the movements of the watch hands relative to the environment. There is no need to perform steps <b>120</b> to <b>127</b>. The continuous repetition of the locating sequence is optionally represented by arrow <b>130</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> and may be performed, for example, at a rhythm on the order of a half second to a second. The new sequence (steps <b>110</b> to <b>118</b>) overwrites the stored data positions and leads to the display of a new distance and (generally) two new possible directions of the object sought <b>12</b>. It falls on the user to observe the movements of the two hands and deduce therefrom which indicates a relatively constant position in space: it is this direction which corresponds to the true position of the object sought. Thus, it is not indispensable for the search device to be arranged to determine which of the two directions is the right one, since the user can do this himself by observing how the display changes.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Interpretation may be facilitated when the user moves the watch in the direction of one of the hands: if this hand remains in the same direction in space, it is because the watch is moving towards the object sought. This operating mode is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. If the user, starting from the initial position of watch <b>11</b>, moves the latter in the direction of the large hand <b>52</b> as far as <b>11</b><i>a</i>, the new locating sequence will move both hands, such that the small hand <b>51</b> is pointing in this case towards the real position P of object <b>12</b> and the large hand <b>52</b> is pointing towards the symmetrical point Qa of P relative to the new situation <b>15</b><i>a </i>of the reference axis. When he sees that both hands have changed direction, the user has to deduce that the translation was not made in the right direction. If, conversely, he moves the watch in the direction of small hand <b>51</b> from <b>11</b> to <b>11</b><i>b</i>, this hand, pointing towards P, does not change direction, and it can be deduced therefrom that the translation was correctly made in the direction of object <b>12</b>. In such case, large hand <b>52</b>, pointing towards the symmetrical point Qb of P relative to position <b>15</b><i>b </i>of the reference axis, only rotates if the orientation of the axis changes. Here too, the user may pivot the watch until the two hands are superposed. He will then have to end the locating repetitions by manual action on the control members of the watch.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">A similar operating mode is applicable with movements of rotation with no translation. In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the clockwise rotation has had the effect of moving the two hands apart, to point towards S and T. If, conversely, the user had rotated them slowly anticlockwise, the two hands would gradually have moved closer together during the locating sequences, until they were superposed, thereby showing the true direction of the object sought <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">It is important to note that the operating mode described above is not limited to movements of pure rotation or pure translation of the watch, since it can still be used when the watch makes a combination of translations and rotations. For the user to interpret the movements of the hands correctly, the watch dial need only remain within approximately the same, for example, horizontal plane.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">According to another embodiment of search device D<b>1</b>, which is not described in detail here, the device may be provided with an inertial unit including, for example, an accelerometer with at least two axes and a gyroscope, in order to calculate the movements to which the watch is subjected in the plane of the dial, which is generally kept horizontal. When there is a new locating sequence, this allows the device to convert the coordinates of the two points stored in the preceding sequence into coordinates in the displaced frame of reference and to compare them to those of the two new points in order to find which has not moved. The operating mode of this device is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. A first locating sequence with watch <b>11</b> stationary in position <b>11</b><i>c </i>provides the coordinates of points P and Q in the reference frame of the watch, wherein P is the position of the antenna of target device D<b>2</b> attached to object <b>12</b>, while Q is the symmetrical point of P relative to the position <b>15</b><i>c </i>of the reference axis of the watch.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">While the user is imparting a movement M on the watch, the search device periodically measures the components of this movement by means of the accelerometer and the gyroscope, recalculates the coordinates of P and Q relative to the new position of its reference frame and orients hands <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> accordingly as is seen in intermediate position <b>11</b><i>d</i>. A second locating sequence, similar to that described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is then automatically or manually started in any position <b>11</b><i>e </i>of the watch. This sequence allows search device D<b>1</b> to distinguish between the real position P of object <b>12</b> and that of the symmetrical image thereof relative to the current position <b>15</b><i>e </i>of the reference axis, and to indicate the direction of the object by superposing the two hands <b>51</b> and <b>52</b> while indicating the distance on digital display <b>26</b>. The user therefore knows where the object is located and may, if he wishes, continue the search more closely via UWB or end the search.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The above description shows that the invention provides a location system that can be integrated in very compact apparatus, such that the target devices can be discreetly attached to the objects to be located and a user can easily keep the search device with him in case of need. The search device is not necessarily combined with a watch. One could envisage incorporating it in an apparatus intended solely for this use or in another portable apparatus containing an electric power source, electronic circuits and display means capable of indicating two directions and a distance, for example a mobile telephone or a nomad satellite positioning device.</p>
