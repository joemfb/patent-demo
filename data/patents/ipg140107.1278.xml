<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This invention relates to retractable structures useful as accessories for recreational vehicles such as motor homes and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">More specifically this invention relates to a self storing, sliding, retractable, full size porch or deck assembly from a position of use in front of a recreational vehicle door to a transport position under the vehicle totally out of view and can be built to meet any size vehicle specifications. About four different types of deck or porch extensions for use with recreational vehicles such as motor homes, campers and trailers have been proposed. These all have in common the features of a small floor system for use in a horizontal position and folded or retracted to a stored or transportable position.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">One common approach used in the construction is to build a small unit to be placed in position but not attached to the vehicle and can be disassembled and stored inside the vehicle as shown in the prior art, U.S. Pat. No. 7,500,335.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Another approach is to have the constructed floor attached by a hinge support and -for use in a horizontal position then -folded to the side of-the vehicle and attached, for storage and transport, thus adding to the size of the vehicle as shown in prior art, U.S. Pat. No. 6,799,833.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">This invention provides for a retractable, sliding deck assembly particularly adapted for use adjacent the side door of a motor home, camper trailer or similar type of vehicle. The deck floor framing is adapted to be attached to the undercarriage of the vehicle and is retractable by sliding to a transport position and kept out of view and kept secure for safe transport. Ten inches of the railing system is kept inside of the undercarriage stowage system for added support and strength of the deck railing assembly. The floor assembly components are stored in a drawer also attached to the undercarriage of the vehicle. The drawer is constructed to carryall the flooring components and also be transported safely to any destination and out of view in a very convenient location. The size of this invention can be changed easily to accommodate any size of travel trailer or recreational vehicle. Nine leg stabilizers are used to provide multi-point leveling and support to the deck assembly. One inch diameter all thread bolts are used to quickly level and support the deck railing system, and can be adjusted to any height to accommodate for uneven or sloping ground surfaces. Decorative piping is used to disguise the all thread adjustable legs of the assembly. Decorative lights and railings are strung between piping for an enclosure to the deck.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">It is the object of this invention to provide a large deck assembly for a recreational vehicles of any size.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Another object of this invention is to provide a large deck for recreational vehicles adopted for use on uneven or sloping ground, with respect to the condition of ground whether it be wet or dry, gravel or sand, paved or cement.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Yet another object of this invention is to provide increased support and rigidity to the floor platform of a movable deck assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Still another object of this invention is to provide a decking assembly that can be assembled by one person in a minimal amount of time.</p>
