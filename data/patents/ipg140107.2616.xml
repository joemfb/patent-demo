<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Embodiments disclosed herein pertain to methods of forming capacitors.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Capacitors are one type of component commonly used in the fabrication of integrated circuits, for example in DRAM circuitry. A capacitor is comprised of two conductive electrodes separated by a non-conducting dielectric region. As integrated circuitry density has increased, there is a continuing challenge to maintain sufficiently high storage capacitance despite typical decreasing capacitor area. The increase in density of integrated circuitry has typically resulted in greater reduction in the horizontal dimension of capacitors as compared to the vertical dimension. In many instances, the vertical dimension of capacitors has increased.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One manner of fabricating capacitors is to initially form an insulative material within which a capacitor storage node electrode is formed. For example, an array of capacitor electrode openings for individual capacitors may be fabricated in such insulative capacitor electrode-forming material, with an example insulative electrode-forming material being silicon dioxide doped with one or both of phosphorus and boron. The capacitor electrode openings may be formed by etching. It can be difficult to etch the capacitor electrode openings within the insulative material, particularly where the openings have high aspect ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One manner of reducing such difficulty is to split the deposition and etch of such openings into two or more combinations of deposition and etch steps. For example, the material within which the capacitor electrode openings are to be formed can be deposited to an initial deposition thickness which is one half or less of the desired ultimate deposition thickness. Shallower capacitor electrode openings can then be etched to the underlying node location. Such openings are subsequently completely filled/plugged, and another material within which capacitor electrode openings will be formed is deposited over the material in which the first openings were formed and filled. Individual capacitor electrode openings are then formed through the overlying layer to the plugging material. Such can be repeated if desired. Regardless, the plugging material is at some point etched from the capacitor electrode openings to enable contact to be made to a node location on the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">One common plugging material used in such instances is polysilicon. A native oxide can form on the outermost surfaces thereof that can be difficult to remove. Such oxide can be removed by etching prior to etching the polysilicon within the openings from the substrate. The native oxide etch is usually conducted using an HF wet etching solution. However, the material within which the capacitor electrode openings are usually formed is a doped silicon dioxide, such as borophosphosilicate glass or phosphosilicate glass. The HF will etch such material, thereby undesirably widening the capacitor electrode openings above the plugging material while removing the native oxide received thereover. Further and regardless, it can be difficult to remove the polysilicon plugging material from the openings. Example techniques in accordance with the above are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,365,453 and 6,204,143.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further and regardless, it is often desirable to etch away most if not all of the capacitor electrode-forming material after individual capacitor electrodes have been formed within the openings. Such enables outer sidewall surfaces of the electrodes to provide increased area and thereby increased capacitance for the capacitors being formed. However, the capacitor electrodes formed in deep openings are often correspondingly much taller than they are wide. This can lead to toppling of the capacitor electrodes, either during the etching to expose the outer sidewalls surfaces, during transport of the substrate, and/or during deposition of the capacitor dielectric layer or outer capacitor electrode layer. U.S. Pat. No. 6,667,502 teaches the provision of a brace or retaining structure intended to alleviate such toppling. Other aspects associated in the formation of a plurality of capacitors, some of which include bracing structures, are also disclosed and are:</p>

<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Fabrication of capacitors in integrated circuitry such as memory circuitry may form an array of capacitors within a capacitor array area. Control or other circuitry area is often displaced from the capacitor array area, with the substrate including an intervening area between the capacitor array area and the control or other circuitry area. In some instances, a trench is formed in the intervening area between the capacitor array area and the other circuitry area. Such trench can be formed commensurate with the fabrication of the openings within the capacitor array area within which the isolated capacitor electrodes will be received.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Example methods of forming capacitors, including pluralities of capacitors, are described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-16</figref>. Referring initially to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, a substrate, for example a semiconductor substrate, is indicated generally with reference numeral <b>10</b>. In the context of this document, the term &#x201c;semiconductor substrate&#x201d; or &#x201c;semiconductive substrate&#x201d; is defined to mean any construction comprising semiconductive material, including, but not limited to, bulk semiconductive materials such as a semiconductive wafer (either alone or in assemblies comprising other materials thereon), and semiconductive material layers (either alone or in assemblies comprising other materials). The term &#x201c;substrate&#x201d; refers to any supporting structure, including, but not limited to, the semiconductive substrates described above. Accordingly, and by way of example only, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> might comprise a bulk semiconductor material (not shown), for example bulk monocrystalline, and/or comprise semiconductor-on-insulator layers.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Substrate <b>10</b> can be considered as comprising a capacitor array area <b>25</b>, a circuitry area <b>75</b> other than capacitor array area <b>25</b>, and an intervening area <b>50</b> between capacitor array area <b>25</b> and circuitry area <b>75</b>. In the depicted example embodiment, intervening area <b>50</b> completely surrounds and encircles capacitor array area <b>25</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>), and circuitry area <b>75</b> comprises a peripheral circuitry area to that of capacitor array area <b>25</b>. Alternate constructions are contemplated, of course, for example whereby neither intervening area <b>50</b> nor circuitry area <b>75</b> completely or partially encircles a capacitor array area <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an insulative material <b>12</b> having electrically conductive storage node pillars <b>14</b> formed therethrough. Materials <b>12</b> and <b>14</b> may be fabricated over some suitable underlying material, for example bulk monocrystalline and/or underlying circuitry. Example insulative materials <b>12</b> include doped and undoped silicon dioxides, for example silicon dioxide deposited by the decomposition of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) and/or borophosphosilicate glass (BPSG) and/or silicon nitride. In the context of this document, &#x201c;doped silicon dioxide&#x201d; or &#x201c;silicon dioxide doped&#x201d; requires at least 0.5 atomic percent concentration of one or a combination of boron or phosphorus in silicon dioxide. Further, an undoped silicon dioxide requires less than 0.5 atomic percent of any of boron and phosphorous. Alternately by way of example only, material <b>12</b> might comprise anisotropically etched insulative sidewall spacers, for example formed about transistor gate lines (not shown). An example material <b>14</b> is conductively doped polysilicon. Conductive material <b>14</b> can be considered as comprising or defining a plurality of capacitor storage node locations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> on substrate <b>10</b>. Storage node locations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b> are examples only, and regardless, may be conductive at this point in the process, or made conductive subsequently.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">A material <b>22</b> has been formed over material <b>12</b> and capacitor storage node locations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>. Examples for material <b>22</b> comprise silicon nitride and/or undoped silicon dioxide deposited to an example thickness range of from about 100 Angstroms to about 2,000 Angstroms. Material <b>22</b> might be included to provide an etch stop, or other function.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Some material <b>24</b> is received over capacitor array area <b>25</b> and circuitry area <b>75</b>, and also in the depicted embodiment over intervening area <b>50</b>. Such might be homogeneous or comprise multiple different compositions and/or layers. An example material is doped silicon dioxide, for example comprising at least one of phosphorus and boron, such as BPSG, borosilicate glass (BSG), and/or phosphosilicate glass (PSG). An example thickness range for material <b>24</b> is from 5,000 Angstroms to 10 microns, with 2 microns being a specific example. Thinner and greater thicknesses are, of course, contemplated. Regardless and in one embodiment, layers <b>22</b> and <b>24</b> comprise example base material <b>27</b> received over node locations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, a plurality of openings <b>28</b> has been etched into base material <b>27</b> over individual node locations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>. Further, a trench <b>30</b> has been formed in intervening area <b>50</b> within base material <b>27</b>. In one embodiment, trench <b>30</b> completely surrounds capacitor area <b>25</b>. An example technique for forming capacitor electrode openings <b>28</b> and trench <b>30</b> comprises photolithographic patterning and selective anisotropic dry etch to produce the example <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> constructions. An example minimum width of trench opening <b>30</b> is from about 200 Angstroms to about 5,000 Angstroms, while an example minimum width for capacitor electrode openings <b>28</b> is also from about 200 Angstroms to about 5,000 Angstroms. Trench <b>30</b> may or may not be formed at this point in the process, or at all. Regardless, the processing depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-4</figref> depicts but one example method of providing a material (i.e. material <b>27</b>) having an opening therein (i.e. any of openings <b>28</b>) over a node location (i.e. any of locations <b>15</b>, <b>16</b>, <b>17</b> and <b>18</b>) on a substrate. The opening(s) may or may not extend completely to the node locations at this point in the process. Regardless in one embodiment, the processing depicted by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> can occur in a suitable processing tool which for convenience in description can be considered as a &#x201c;first processing tool&#x201d;. In one embodiment the first processing tool may be a plasma etcher. By way of example only, a LAM&#x2122; Exelan&#x2122; oxide etch tool is an example such tool.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, bridging material <b>32</b> has been formed across base material openings <b>28</b>, with such openings <b>28</b> comprising voids <b>33</b> therebeneath. In one embodiment, such occurs by depositing bridging material <b>32</b> over base material <b>27</b> and across base material openings <b>28</b>, and in one embodiment to partially within base material openings <b>28</b> as shown. In one embodiment, such occurs in the very same first processing tool within which the etching to produce openings <b>28</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> occurred, and in one embodiment before removing substrate <b>10</b> from such processing tool after such etching to produce openings <b>28</b>. By way of examples only, example bridging materials include silicon dioxide-comprising material; polymers comprising C, H, and F; and combinations of these and other materials. Further by way of example, any silicon dioxide-comprising material may also include at least one of H, Cl, and F, for example provided in molar concentrations of from 10 to 20 percent of total atomic amount of silicon, oxygen and the at least one of H, Cl, and F. Regardless, these and/or other materials can be deposited by any existing or yet-to-be developed techniques. Example silicon-containing precursors for chemical or atomic layer deposition include SiH<sub>4</sub>, SiCl<sub>4</sub>, SiCl<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, and SiF<sub>4</sub>. Example carbon-containing precursors include CH<sub>4</sub>, CF<sub>4</sub>, CH<sub>2</sub>F<sub>2</sub>, CHF<sub>3</sub>, CH<sub>3</sub>F, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>6</sub>, C<sub>4</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>F<sub>4</sub>, and C<sub>6</sub>F<sub>6</sub>. Example conditions during deposition within a plasma etcher or a plasma deposition tool include a chuck temperature of from 10&#xb0; C. to 40&#xb0; C., pressure from 10 mTorr to 200 mTorr, total power of from 500 watts to 2,000 watts and frequencies at one or a combination of 2 MHz and 27 MHz. Regardless, quantity of the atomic components of the composition of bridging material <b>32</b> can be controlled by quantity of precursor gases depending on the ultimate desired composition of bridging material <b>32</b>. Composition of material <b>32</b>, regardless, can be selected, controlled, and/or balanced in allowing greater or lesser resistance to subsequent processing steps (i.e. resistance to melting) and/or ease of subsequent removal of material <b>32</b> from openings <b>28</b>, as is described below. Regardless, bridging material <b>32</b> might be homogenous or non-homogenous.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and in one embodiment, bridging material <b>32</b> has been removed from being received over base material <b>27</b> and to leave bridging material <b>32</b> within and bridging across base material openings <b>28</b>. An example manner for doing so includes chemical mechanical polishing. Alternately, removing of the bridging material might occur by an etching technique. For example in one embodiment, such could be etched by a timed etch within the first processing tool within which openings <b>28</b> were formed and bridging material <b>32</b> was formed. Regardless, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref> depict, by way of examples only, methods of forming bridging material across base material openings which comprise a respective void beneath the bridging material.</p>

Any of such materials may be the same or different in composition as one or more components of base material <b>27</b>. An example material <b>36</b> is doped silicon dioxide, an example material <b>37</b> comprises silicon nitride, and example materials for layers <b>38</b> and <b>39</b> include one or more different organic and/or inorganic antireflective coating layers. Regardless and in one embodiment, deposition of all of covering material <b>34</b> will comprise some highest deposition temperature in degrees C. at which any of such covering material <b>34</b> is deposited. For example, different materials <b>36</b>, <b>37</b>, and <b>38</b> may be deposited at different elevated temperatures, with one or two of such being deposited at some highest deposition temperature at which any of the components of covering material <b>34</b> are deposited. In such one embodiment, bridging material <b>32</b> is fabricated of a composition which will have a melting temperature in degrees C. which is at least 10% higher than said highest deposition temperature of any of covering material <b>34</b>. For example in such embodiment, if layer <b>37</b> is the component of covering material <b>34</b> which has a highest deposition temperature of, for example, 350&#xb0; C., bridging material <b>32</b> in such embodiment is fabricated to have a melting temperature of 385&#xb0; C. or higher.</p>
