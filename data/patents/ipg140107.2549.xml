<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The following detailed description should be read with reference to the drawings, in which like elements in different drawings are identically numbered. The drawings, which are not necessarily to scale, depict exemplary embodiments for the purpose of explanation only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention. The detailed description illustrates by way of example, not by way of limitation, the principles of the invention. This description will clearly enable one skilled in the art to make and use the invention, and describes several embodiments, adaptations, variations, alternatives and uses of the invention, including what is presently believed to be the best mode of carrying out the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">As used herein, the terms &#x201c;about&#x201d; or &#x201c;approximately&#x201d; for any numerical values or ranges indicate a suitable dimensional tolerance that allows the part or collection of components to function for its intended purpose as described herein.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In general, hand-held test meters for use with an analytical test strip in the determination of an analyte (such as glucose) in a bodily fluid sample (i.e., a whole blood sample) according to embodiments of the present invention include a housing, a microcontroller block disposed in the housing, and a phase-shift-based hematocrit measurement block (also referred to as a phase-shift-based hematocrit circuit). In such hand-held test meters, the phase-shift-based hematocrit measurement block includes a signal generation sub-block, a low pass filter sub-block, an analytical test strip sample cell interface sub-block, a transimpedance amplifier sub-block, and a phase detector sub-block. In addition, the phase-shift-based hematocrit measurement block and microcontroller block are configured to measure the phase shift of a bodily fluid sample in a sample cell of an analytical test strip inserted in the hand-held test meter and the microcontroller block is also configured to compute the hematocrit of the bodily fluid sample based on the measured phase shift.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Hand-held test meters according to embodiments of the present invention are beneficial in that they provide improved accuracy of analyte determination (such as glucose determination) in whole blood samples by measuring the hematocrit of the whole blood sample and then employing the measured hematocrit during analyte determination.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Once one skilled in the art is apprised of the present disclosure, he or she will recognize that an example of a hand-held test meter that can be readily modified as a hand-hand test meter according to the present invention is the commercially available OneTouch&#xae; Ultra&#xae; 2 glucose meter from LifeScan Inc.

<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 6</figref>, hand-held test meter <b>100</b> includes a display <b>102</b>, a plurality of user interface buttons <b>104</b>, a strip port connector <b>106</b>, a USB interface <b>108</b>, and a housing <b>110</b> (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>).

To simplify the current descriptions, the figures do not depict all such electronic circuitry.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Display <b>102</b> can be, for example, a liquid crystal display or a bi-stable display configured to show a screen image. An example of a screen image may include a glucose concentration, a date and time, an error message, and a user interface for instructing an end user how to perform a test.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Strip port connector <b>106</b> is configured to operatively interface with an analytical test strip TS, such as an electrochemical-based analytical test strip configured for the determination of glucose in a whole blood sample. Therefore, the analytical test strip is configured for operative insertion into strip port connector <b>106</b> and to operatively interface with phase-shift-based hematocrit measurement block <b>114</b> via, for example, suitable electrical contacts.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">USB Interface <b>108</b> can be any suitable interface known to one skilled in the art. USB Interface <b>108</b> is essentially a passive component that is configured to power and provide a data line to hand-held test meter <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Once an analytical test strip is interfaced with hand-held test meter <b>100</b>, or prior thereto, a bodily fluid sample (e.g., a whole blood sample) is introduced into a sample chamber of the analytical test strip. The analytical test strip can include enzymatic reagents that selectively and quantitatively transform an analyte into another predetermined chemical form. For example, the analytical test strip can include an enzymatic reagent with ferricyanide and glucose oxidase so that glucose can be physically transformed into an oxidized form.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Memory block <b>118</b> of hand-held test meter <b>100</b> includes a suitable algorithm and can be configured, along with microcontroller block <b>112</b> to determine an analyte based on the electrochemical response of analytical test strip and the hematocrit of the introduced sample. For example, in the determination of the analyte blood glucose, the hematocrit can be used to compensate for the effect of hematocrit on electrochemically determined blood glucose concentrations.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Microcontroller block <b>112</b> is disposed within housing <b>110</b> and can include any suitable microcontroller and/or micro-processor known to those of skill in the art. One such suitable microcontroller is a microcontroller commercially available from Texas Instruments, Dallas, Tex. USA and part number MSP430F5138. This microcontroller can generate a square wave of 25 to 250 kHz and a 90 degree phase-shifted wave of the same frequency and, thereby, function as a signal generation s-block described further below. MSP430F5138 also has Analog-to-Digital (ND) processing capabilities suitable for measuring voltages generated by phase shift based hematocrit measurement blocks employed in embodiments of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring in particular to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, phase-shift-based hematocrit measurement block <b>114</b> includes a signal generation sub-block <b>120</b>, a low pass filter sub-block <b>122</b>, an analytical test strip sample cell interface sub-block <b>124</b>, an optional calibration load block <b>126</b> (within the dashed lines of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), a transimpedance amplifier sub-block <b>128</b>, and a phase detector sub-block <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As described further below, phase-shift-based hematocrit measurement block <b>114</b> and microcontroller block <b>112</b> are configured to measure the phase shift of a bodily fluid sample in a sample cell of an analytical test strip inserted in the hand-held test meter by, for example, measuring the phase shift of one or more high frequency electrical signals driven through the bodily fluid sample. In addition, microcontroller block <b>112</b> is configured to compute the hematocrit of the bodily fluid based on the measured phase shift. Microcontroller <b>112</b> can compute the hematocrit by, for example, employing an A/D converter to measure voltages received from a phase-detector sub-block, convert the voltages into a phase-shift and then employing a suitable algorithm or look-up table to convert the phase-shift into a hematocrit value. Once apprised of the present disclosure, one skilled in the art will recognize that such an algorithm and/or look-up table will be configured to take into account various factors such as strip geometry (including electrode area and sample chamber volume) and signal frequency.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">It has been determined that a relationship exists between the reactance of a whole blood sample and the hematocrit of that sample. Electrical modeling of a bodily fluid sample (i.e., a whole blood sample) as parallel capacitive and resistive components indicates that when an alternating current (AC) signal is forced through the bodily fluid sample, the phase shift of the AC signal will be dependent on both the frequency of the AC voltage and the hematocrit of the sample. Moreover, modeling indicates that hematocrit has a relatively minor effect on the phase shift when the frequency of the signal is in the range of approximately 10 kHz to 25 kHz and a maximum effect on the phase shift when the frequency of the signal is in the range of approximately 250 kHz to 500 KHz. Therefore, the hematocrit of a bodily fluid sample can be measured by, for example, driving AC signals of known frequency through the bodily fluid sample and detecting their phase shift. For example, the phase-shift of a signal with a frequency in the range of 10 kHz to 25 kHz can be used as a reference reading in such a hematocrit measurement while the phase shift of a signal with a frequency in the range of 250 kHz to 500 kHz can be used as the primary measurement.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 through 6</figref> in particular, signal generation sub-block <b>120</b> can be any suitable signal generation block and is configured to generate a square wave (0V to Vref) of a desired frequency. Such a signal generation sub-block can, if desired, be integrated into microcontroller block <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The signal generated by signal generation sub-block <b>120</b> is communicated to dual low pass filter sub-block <b>122</b>, which is configured to convert the square wave signal to a sine wave signal of a predetermined frequency. The dual LPF of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is configured to provide both a signal of a first frequency (such as a frequency in the range of 10 kHz to 25 kHz) and a signal of a second frequency (such as a frequency in the range of 250 kHz to 500 kHz) to the analytical test strip sample cell interface sub-block and an analytical test strips'sample chamber (also referred to as the HCT measurement cell). Selection of the first and second frequency is accomplished using switch IC<b>7</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The dual LPF of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> includes employs two suitable operational amplifiers (IC<b>4</b> and IC<b>5</b>) such as the operational amplifier available from Texas Instruments, Dallas, Tex., USA as high-speed, voltage feedback, CMOS operational amplifier part number OPA354.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, F-DRV represents a square wave input of either a low or high frequency (e.g., 25 kHz or 250 kHz) and is connected to both IC<b>4</b> and IC<b>5</b>. Signal Fi-HIGH/LOW (from the microcontroller) selects the output of dual low pass filter sub-block <b>122</b> via switch IC<b>7</b>. C<b>5</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is configured to block the operating voltage of dual low pass filter sub-block <b>122</b> from the HCT measurement cell.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">Although a specific dual LPF is depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, dual low pass filter sub-block <b>122</b> can be any suitable low pass filter sub-block known to one skilled in the art including, for example, any suitable multiple feedback low pass filter, or a Sallen and Key low pass filter.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The sine wave produced by low pass filter sub-block <b>122</b> is communicated to analytical test strip sample cell interface sub-block <b>124</b> where it is driven across the sample cell of the analytical test strip (also referred to as an HCT measurement cell). Analytical test strip sample cell interface block <b>124</b> can be any suitable sample cell interface block including, for example, an interface block configured to operatively interface with the sample cell of the analytical test strip via first electrode and second electrodes of the analytical test strip disposed in the sample cell. In such a configuration, the signal can be driven into the sample cell (from the low pass filter sub-block) via the first electrode and picked-up from the sample cell (by the transimpedance amplifier sub-block) via the second electrode as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The current produced by driving the signal across the sample cell is picked-up by transimpedance amplifier sub-block <b>128</b> and converted into a voltage signal for communication to phase detector sub-block <b>130</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Transimpedance sub-block <b>128</b> can be any suitable transimpedance sub-block known to one skilled in the art. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is a simplified annotated schematic block diagram of one such transimpedance amplifier sub-block (based on two OPA354 operational amplifiers, IC<b>3</b> and IC<b>9</b>). The first stage of TIA sub-block <b>128</b> operates at, for example, 400 mV, which limits the AC amplitude to +/&#x2212;400 mV. The second stage of TIA sub-block <b>128</b> operates at Vref/2, a configuration which enables the generation of an output of the full span of the microcontroller ND inputs. C<b>9</b> of TIA sub-block <b>128</b> serves as a blocking component that only allows an AC sine wave signal to pass.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Phase detector sub-block <b>130</b> can be any suitable phase detector sub-block that produces either a digital frequency that can be read back by microcontroller block <b>112</b> using a capture function, or an analog voltage that can be read back by microcontroller block <b>112</b> using an analog to digital converter. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts a schematic that includes two such phase detector sub-blocks, namely an XOR phase detector (in the upper half of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and including IC<b>22</b> and IC<b>23</b>) and a Quadrature DEMUX phase detector (in the lower half of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> and including IC<b>12</b> and IC<b>13</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> also depicts a calibration load sub-block <b>126</b> that includes a switch (IC<b>16</b>) and a dummy load R<b>7</b> and C<b>6</b>. Calibration load sub-block <b>126</b> is configured for the dynamic measurement of a phase offset for the known phase shift of zero degrees produced by resistor R<b>7</b>, thus providing a phase offset for use in calibration. C<b>6</b> is configured to force a predetermined slight phase shift, e.g. to compensate for phase delays caused by parasitic capacities in the signal traces to the sample cell, or for phase delays in the electrical circuits (LPF and TIA).</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The Quadrature DEMUX phase detector circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> includes two portions, one portion for a resistive part of the incoming AC signal and one portion for the reactive portion of the incoming AC signal. Use of such two portions enables the simultaneous measurement of both the resistive and reactive portion of the AC signal and a measurement range that covers 0 degrees to 360 degrees. The Quadrature DEMUX circuit of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> generates two separate output voltages. One of these output voltages represents the &#x201c;in phase measurement&#x201d; and is proportional to the &#x201c;resistive&#x201d; part of the AC signal, the other output voltage represents the &#x201c;Quadrature Measurement&#x201d; and is proportional to the &#x201c;reactive part of the signal. The phase shift is calculated as:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>&#x3c6;=tan<sup>&#x2212;1</sup>(<i>V</i><sub>QUAD-PHASE</sub><i>/V</i><sub>IN-PHASE</sub>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Such a Quadrature DEMUX phase detector circuit can also be employed to measure the impedance of a bodily fluid sample in the sample cell. It is hypothesized, without being bound, that the impedance could be employed along with the phase-shift, or independently thereof, to determine the hematocrit of the bodily sample. The amplitude of a signal forced through the sample cell can be calculated using the two voltage outputs of the Quadrature DEMUX circuit as follows:
<br/>
<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="lead"?>Amplitude=SQR((<i>V</i><sub>QUAD-PHASE</sub>)<sup>2</sup>+(<i>V</i><sub>IN-PHASE</sub>)<sup>2</sup>)<?in-line-formulae description="In-line Formulae" end="tail"?>
<br/>
This amplitude can then be compared to an amplitude measured for the known resistor of calibration load block <b>126</b> to determine the impedance.
</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The XOR phase detector portion has a measurement range of 0&#xb0; to 180&#xb0;, or alternatively a measurement range of &#x2212;90&#xb0; to +90&#xb0;, depending whether the &#x201c;Square wave input from &#x3bc;C&#x201d; is in phase to the sine wave or is set to a 90&#xb0; phase shift. The XOR phase detector produces an output frequency that is always double the input frequency, however the duty cycle varies. If both inputs are perfectly in phase, the output is LOW, if both inputs are 180&#xb0; shifted the output is always HIGH. By integrating the output signal (e.g. via a simple RC element) a voltage can be generated that is directly proportional to the phase shift between both inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Once apprised of the present disclosure, one skilled in the art will recognize that phase detector sub-blocks employed in embodiments of the present invention can take any suitable form and include, for example, forms that employ rising edge capture techniques, dual edge capture techniques, XOR techniques and synchronous demodulation techniques.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Since low pass filter sub-block <b>122</b>, transimpedance amplifier sub-block <b>128</b> and phase detector sub-block <b>130</b> can introduce a residual phase shift into phase-shift-based hematocrit measurement block <b>114</b>, calibration load block <b>126</b> can be optionally included in the phase-shift-based hematocrit measurement block. Calibration load block <b>126</b> is configured to be essentially resistive in nature (for example a 33 k-ohm load) and, therefore, induces no phase shift between excitation voltage and generated current. Calibration load block <b>126</b> is configured to be switched in across the circuit to give a &#x201c;zero&#x201d; calibration reading. Once calibrated, the hand-held test meter can measure the phase shift of a bodily fluid sample, subtract the &#x201c;zero&#x201d; reading to compute a corrected phase shift and subsequently compute the bodily sample hematocrit based on the corrected phase shift.</p>
