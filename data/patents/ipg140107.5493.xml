<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/529,255 entitled &#x201c;Hardware Device for Collecting and Manipulating Transaction Data&#x201d; and filed Aug. 31, 2011, U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/584,323 entitled &#x201c;A Novel Data Manipulation System&#x201d; and filed Jan. 9, 2012, and U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/584,324 entitled &#x201c;Plurality of Hardware Devices for Collecting and Manipulating Transaction Data&#x201d; and filed Jan. 9, 2012, the contents of each of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Payments for goods or services (e.g., transactions) can involve a variety of payment options such as, in some examples, cash, credit card, check, money order, and online debit account (e.g., PayPal&#x2122; by eBay Inc. of Palo Alto, Calif.). More recent payment options include a virtual wallet application provided through a mobile computing device such as a smart phone. An example of a virtual wallet is Google wallet by Google of Menlo Park, Calif. A pre-paid card, such as a service or product-specific debit card, may also be used to pay for certain transactions, such as a public transit debit card.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Collection of transactional data is an increasingly important factor in designing marketing strategies. One method involves analyzing, on a macro level, electronic purchases such as credit card purchases. For example, transactional data may be analyzed using the traditional banking system which operates through a clearing system to manage electronic transactions involving a client bank account. In another example, information collected from online commerce may be used to monitor transactions. Another option involves the purchase of specialized point of sale equipment, where the equipment manufacturer offers a service and/or system collects and provides information regarding transactions. However, in an entity involving multiple locations, potentially in geographic diverse regions and frequently under various management structures, managing an overview of transaction data collected from each of the multiple locations can prove difficult if not impossible. A further method for tracking transactional behavior involves customer loyalty programs, often requiring a customer to provide personal information at point of sale (e.g., telephone number) or requesting a loyalty card be swiped or scanned to identify the customer. The loyalty program, while beneficial in tracking a portion of the sales, provides no insight into transactions involving customers who are not members of the loyalty program or who decline to provide identifying information such as a telephone number.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, an intermediary device is configured to be installed between a point of sale device (e.g., cash register, order entry terminal, internet merchant transaction server, etc.) and a purchase recording device (e.g., standard printer, receipt printer, facsimile, internet merchant purchase confirmation server, electronic mail server, etc.). A point of sale device, in general, refers to any computing device involved in building transaction information identifying at least product/service information and purchase quantity. A purchase recording device, in general, refers to any computing device involved in receiving transaction information prepared by a point of sale device. The intermediary device, in some implementations, is configured for hardwiring between two computing devices, such as a cash register and a receipt printer. For example, the intermediary device may include one or more cable ports (e.g., serial, parallel, universal serial bus (USB), etc.) for connecting the two computing devices via the intermediary device. In some implementations, the intermediary device is configured for wireless installation between a point of sale computing device and a purchase recording computing device. For example, the intermediary device may include one or more antennas for collecting data transmitted wirelessly (e.g., via wireless Ethernet, Bluetooth&#xae;, WiFi&#x2122;, etc.) between computing devices. In other implementations, the intermediary device is configured as a software solution, for example for installation within a computing device functioning as a point of sale device or a computing device functioning as a purchase recording device.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The intermediary device, in some implementations, is configured as a pass-through device. In one operating mode of the intermediary device, information transmitted from the first computing device to a second computing device (and vice-versa) transmits across the intermediary device without obstruction or alteration. In this example, even if the intermediary device loses power, data continues to transmit between the first computing device and the second computing device. In behaving as a pass-through device, rather than an intercept and forward device, for example, the intermediary device does not impede the flow of information between the point of sale device and the purchase recording device. In other words, the intermediary device is not a possible point of failure in the communication between the point of sale device and the purchase recording device.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In one aspect, the invention is directed to an apparatus including: a first I/O port; a second I/O port of a same type as the first I/O port, wherein the second I/O port is connected to the first I/O port such that data passed into the first I/O port is allowed to pass through the apparatus to the second I/O port unimpeded in at least a first operating mode; a processor; and a non-transitory computer readable medium storing instructions thereon wherein the instructions, when executed, cause the processor to: collect information passed from a first computing device connected to the first I/O port to a second computing device connected to the second I/O port, identify, from the information, transaction data; and provide, to a third computing device, the transaction data.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In certain embodiments, the first computing device includes a point of sale terminal and the second computing device includes a purchase recording device. In certain embodiments, the apparatus further includes a third I/O port, wherein the third I/O port is configured for connection to the third computing device; and providing the transaction data includes transmitting the transaction data via the third I/O port. In certain embodiments, the apparatus further includes a communication port, wherein the communication port is configured to connect to a network communications device, and providing the transaction data includes transmitting the transaction data via the network communications device. The network communications device may include one of a modem, a router, a hub, and a gateway, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In certain embodiments, the apparatus further includes an antenna, wherein providing the transaction data includes transmitting the transaction data via the antenna. In certain embodiments, a connection between the second I/O port and the first I/O port is configured to pass data through the apparatus while the apparatus is disconnected from all power sources. In certain embodiments, each of the first I/O port and the second I/O port includes a serial connector. In certain embodiments, the apparatus further includes a third I/O port and a fourth I/O port, wherein: the fourth I/O port is connected to the third I/O port such that data passed into the third I/O port is allowed to pass through the apparatus to the fourth I/O port unimpeded in at least a first operating mode, and each of the third I/O port and the fourth I/O port includes a USB connector.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In certain embodiments, in a second operating mode, the instructions cause the processor to: buffer at least a portion of the data received at the first I/O port; and forward at least a portion of the buffered data to the second computing device via the second I/O port. In certain embodiments, in the second operating mode, the instructions cause the processor to introduce injection data to the second computing device via the second I/O port prior to forwarding the at least a portion of the buffered data. In certain embodiments, buffering the portion of the data includes temporarily storing the portion of the data in a buffer region of a storage medium. In certain embodiments, the non-transitory computer readable medium includes the storage medium.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is contemplated that combinations of the above features may be used in the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another aspect, the invention is directed to a method including: collecting, by an intermediary device installed between a point of sale computing device and a second computing device, information passed from the point of sale computing device to the second computing device, wherein the intermediary device is configured to collect at least a portion of the information while the information passes between the point of sale computing device and the second computing device unimpeded by the intermediary device; identifying, from the information, transaction data; and providing, to an external computing device, the transaction data.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In certain embodiments, the method further includes: identifying, from the information, printing instructions; and responsive to identifying the printing instructions, buffering the information, identifying injection information for injecting into a print stream, wherein the print stream is provided by the point of sale computing device to the second computing device, and injecting the injection information prior to transmission of a portion of the print stream to the second computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In certain embodiments, the method further includes: identifying, from the transaction data, sensitive information; and prior to providing the transaction data, applying a security algorithm to the sensitive information. In certain embodiments, the sensitive information includes payment information. In certain embodiments, the security algorithm includes a strong one-way hash.</p>

<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The features and advantages of the present disclosure will become more apparent from the detailed description set forth below when taken in conjunction with the drawings, in which like reference characters identify corresponding elements throughout. In the drawings, like reference numbers generally indicate identical, functionally similar, and/or structurally similar elements.</p>
<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Throughout the description, where apparatus, devices, and systems are described as having, including, or comprising specific components, or where processes and methods are described as having, including, or comprising specific steps, it is contemplated that, additionally, there are apparatus, devices, and systems of the present invention that consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited components, and that there are processes and methods according to the present invention that consist essentially of, or consist of, the recited processing steps.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">It should be understood that the order of steps or order for performing certain action is immaterial so long as the invention remains operable. Moreover, two or more steps or actions may be conducted simultaneously.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">According to some embodiments of the present disclosure, an intermediary device is configured to be installed between a point of sale device (e.g., cash register, order entry terminal, internet merchant transaction server, etc.) and a purchase recording device (e.g., standard printer, receipt printer, facsimile, internet merchant purchase confirmation server, electronic mail server, etc.). A point of sale device, in general, refers to any computing device involved in building transaction information identifying at least product/service information and purchase quantity. A purchase recording device, in general, refers to any computing device involved in receiving transaction information prepared by a point of sale device. The intermediary device, in some implementations, is configured for hardwiring between two computing devices, such as a cash register and a receipt printer. For example, the intermediary device may include one or more cable ports (e.g., serial, parallel, universal serial bus (USB), etc.) for connecting the two computing devices via the intermediary device. In some implementations, the intermediary device is configured for wireless installation between a point of sale computing device and a purchase recording computing device. For example, the intermediary device may include one or more antennas for collecting data transmitted wirelessly (e.g., via wireless Ethernet, Bluetooth&#xae;, WiFi&#x2122;, etc.) between computing devices. In other implementations, the intermediary device is configured as a software solution, for example for installation within a computing device functioning as a point of sale device or a computing device functioning as a purchase recording device.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The intermediary device, in some implementations, is configured as a pass-through device. In one operating mode of the intermediary device, information transmitted from the first computing device to a second computing device (and vice-versa) transmits across the intermediary device without obstruction or alteration. In this example, even if the intermediary device loses power, data continues to transmit between the first computing device and the second computing device. In behaving as a pass-through device, rather than an intercept and forward device, for example, the intermediary device does not impede the flow of information between the point of sale device and the purchase recording device. In other words, the intermediary device is not a possible point of failure in the communication between the point of sale device and the purchase recording device.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a block diagram of an example system <b>100</b> for collecting and manipulating transaction data at point of sale includes an intermediary device <b>102</b> installed between a point of sale (POS) terminal <b>104</b> and a receipt printer <b>106</b> (e.g., purchase recording device). The intermediary device <b>102</b> is configured to communicate transaction data to an analysis server <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Information shared between the point of sale device <b>104</b> and the receipt printer <b>106</b>, in some implementations, is collected by the intermediary device <b>102</b>. For example, the intermediary device <b>102</b> may copy a data stream <b>110</b> passing between the POS terminal <b>104</b> and the receipt printer <b>106</b>. The data stream <b>110</b> may be formatted, in some examples, as a serial port data stream, parallel port data stream, or USB port data stream. In other examples, the data stream <b>110</b> may be formatted as an Ethernet data stream, WiFi&#x2122; data stream, or Bluetooth&#xae; data stream (e.g., in a solution involving a wireless connection between the point of sale terminal <b>104</b> and the receipt printer <b>106</b>). Depending upon the formatting type, for example, the intermediary device <b>102</b> uses a different extraction algorithm <b>112</b> to extract information such as transaction data from the data stream <b>110</b>. Various extraction algorithms <b>112</b>, in some examples, may include de-packetizing, reordering, decompressing, filtering, optical character recognition (OCR), and categorizing elements within the data stream <b>110</b>. For example, transaction data may be separated from device commands.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">The intermediary device <b>102</b> analyzes the information, in some implementations, using one or more analysis algorithms <b>114</b>. The analysis algorithms <b>114</b>, in some examples, may include algorithms used to identify various categories of purchase information (e.g., product information, customer information, payment method information, terminal identification, store identification, salesperson identification, timestamp, etc.) and to recognize command information (e.g., beginning of print stream).</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The analysis algorithms <b>114</b> of the intermediary device <b>102</b>, in some implementations, include one or more methods for analyzing the content of the information passed from the point of sale terminal <b>104</b> to the receipt printer <b>106</b>. In some examples, the intermediary device <b>102</b> may identify a product type within the product information, a balance amount, and/or a purchase quantity to determine additional information for injection as printable information to provide to the receipt printer <b>106</b>. In a particular example, the intermediary device <b>102</b> may recognize a threshold dollar amount spent by the customer and inject printable information including a purchase credit for use during a later purchase.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In some implementations, the intermediary device <b>102</b> is configured with one or more transformation algorithms <b>116</b> used to transform at least a portion of the intercepted information. For example, the intermediary device <b>102</b> may recognize and encrypt transaction fulfillment information (e.g., credit card number, bank routing number, network payment service identification information, etc.). The intermediary device <b>102</b>, in one example, may encrypt all collected and (optionally) analyzed data prior to providing the data to the analysis server <b>108</b>. In other examples, the intermediary device <b>102</b> may include transformation algorithms <b>116</b> for compressing transaction data, filtering transaction data, recognizing textual information in a graphics format through optical character recognition (OCR), and/or packetizing transaction data for transmission to the analysis server <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In some implementations, the intermediary device <b>102</b> is configured to upload purchase data <b>120</b> to the analysis server <b>108</b>. The purchase data <b>120</b>, in some examples, may include product identifiers, product name, product price, product quantity, a terminal identifier, a cashier identifier, at least a portion of the remittance information (e.g., credit card number, etc.), one or more discounts applied to the purchase, product return information, account credit information, and a timestamp. The intermediary device <b>102</b>, in some implementations, includes one or more transmission algorithms <b>118</b> for transferring transaction data to the analysis server <b>108</b>. The transmission algorithms <b>118</b>, in some examples, can include one or more wireless communication algorithms, one or more network-enabled communication algorithms, one or more messaging algorithms, and one or more security algorithms for transmission of transaction data. In some implementations, the intermediary device <b>102</b> transfers the purchase data <b>120</b> to the analysis server <b>108</b> at the completion of a particular transaction (e.g., upon collection of payment for a purchase, crediting of an account for a return, etc.). The purchase data <b>120</b>, in some implementations, is transferred to the analysis server <b>108</b> by the intermediary device <b>102</b> periodically (e.g., every X transactions, after Y amount of data has accrued in a storage region of the intermediary device <b>102</b>, after Z amount of time has passed, upon being polled by the analysis server <b>108</b>, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">For transmission of the purchase data <b>120</b>, in some implementations, the intermediary device <b>102</b> is connected to a separate transmission device (e.g., modem, router, etc.) for transmitting collected information to the analysis server <b>108</b>. The analysis server <b>108</b>, in some examples, may be connected to the transmission device (not illustrated) via a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), Bluetooth&#xae;, WiFi&#x2122;, or internet connection. The transmission algorithms <b>118</b>, for example, may include one or more connection algorithms for connecting to a separate transmission device.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In some implementations, the analysis server <b>108</b> analyzes the purchase data <b>120</b> using an offer matching engine <b>122</b> to identify one or more offers correlating to the purchase data <b>120</b>. The offer matching engine <b>122</b>, for example, may access a database <b>126</b> including one or more of store data <b>128</b><i>a</i>, offer data <b>128</b><i>b</i>, and product data <b>128</b><i>c </i>for use in identifying one or more offers matching the purchase data <b>120</b>. The offer matching engine <b>122</b>, for example, may correlate products in the purchase data <b>120</b> to product categories via the product data <b>128</b><i>c</i>. In another example, the offer matching engine <b>122</b> may identify offer data <b>128</b><i>b </i>related to a particular store, time of day, product name, or other information referenced within the purchase data <b>120</b> and/or derived from the purchase data <b>120</b>. The offer data <b>128</b><i>b</i>, in some examples, may include one or more coupons, promotions, and/or rewards that are each applicable to types of information included within transactional data (e.g., product identifier, product name, product type, product category, product manufacturer, store, timestamp, etc.). In a first example, the offer matching engine <b>122</b> may identify the purchase of a package of baby diapers within the purchase data <b>120</b> and match the product to a retailer coupon for diaper wipes. In another example, the offer matching engine <b>122</b> may determine that the purchase is occurring between 6:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. and match a coffee kiosk promotion to the purchase data <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In some implementations, the analysis server <b>108</b> provides offer information <b>130</b> to the intermediary device <b>102</b> for printing to the receipt printer <b>106</b>. The offer information <b>130</b>, in some examples, may include one or more of an image file, text data, printer-ready formatted data, and printer instructions (e.g., positioning, formatting, alignment, watermarking, etc.). In other implementations, the offer information <b>130</b> contains an identification of an offer stored upon the intermediary device <b>102</b>. The offer information <b>130</b> or the offer identified by the offer information <b>130</b> may be printed upon the transaction receipt or as a second document (e.g., coupon, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The intermediary device <b>102</b>, in some implementations, is configured to monitor information passed from the POS terminal <b>104</b> to the receipt printer <b>106</b> and to inject additional data for transmission to the receipt printer <b>106</b>. For example, one of the analysis algorithms <b>114</b> may be configured to recognize the beginning of print commands and to intercept the print job. The intermediary device <b>102</b>, in this example, may be configured to buffer print data destined to the receipt printer <b>106</b> and to inject print injection information <b>132</b> (e.g., the offer information <b>130</b> or print instructions based upon the contents of the offer information <b>130</b>) for printing by the receipt printer <b>106</b>. The printer inject information <b>132</b>, in some examples, may include a coupon, offer code, watermark, logo, personalized information (e.g., retailer logo, holiday greeting, etc.), or computer-readable indicia configured to provide, upon reading, an offer and/or other information.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">In some implementations, the intermediary device <b>102</b> is programmed to inject particular printer inject information <b>132</b> regardless of offer information <b>130</b> being provided by the analysis server <b>108</b>. For example, the intermediary device <b>102</b> may be configured to include a particular logo, watermark, computer-readable indicia, or text message upon each receipt or each of a particular type of receipt (e.g., each product return receipt, each product purchase receipt, etc.). The intermediary device <b>102</b>, in some implementations, includes an offer matching algorithm. For example, rather than or in addition to the offer matching engine <b>122</b> of the analysis server <b>108</b>, the intermediary device <b>102</b> may perform matching based upon transaction data. For example, the intermediary device <b>102</b> may be programmed to print a rewards certificate for each purchase over $50.00.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Two or more intermediary devices, in some implementations, feed collected information into the analysis server <b>108</b>. For example, a separate intermediary device may be installed at each point of sale terminal within a single physical location (e.g., store, etc.) or at a number of point of sales terminals at a number of locations (e.g., store branches, franchise outlets, etc.). The analysis server <b>108</b>, further to this example, may be configured to collect and analyze information collected from all of the two or more intermediary devices installed by a particular entity (e.g., retailer, agency, corporation, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">In some implementations, a purchase analytics engine <b>124</b> provides statistical analysis and reporting of purchase behavior. For example, the analysis server <b>108</b> may collect information provided by one or more intermediary devices, store the information within the database <b>126</b>, and query the collected information in view of additional database information (e.g., product information, customer information, store information, etc.) to derive business insight. The statistical analysis, in some implementations, is provided by an analytics product or service. For example, the collected data may be imported to an analytics tool such as Google Analytics by Google, Inc. of Menlo, Park or a retail management system (RMS) such as Microsoft Dynamics RMS by Microsoft Corp. of Redmond, Wash. The system <b>100</b>, in some implementations, includes a customized retail transaction analytics system. For example, the system may include a tool for reviewing transactional data, customer data, store data, and other information through a report-based analytics software tool designed to function with data collected by intermediary devices such as the intermediary device <b>102</b>. A user at a terminal <b>134</b> (e.g., browser, monitor attached to the analysis server <b>108</b>, handheld computing device, desktop computing device, or other computing device capable of presenting graphical analysis information) may review analytics information <b>136</b> provided by the analysis server <b>108</b> and/or derived from information obtained by the analysis server <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">While the transaction data collected by the system <b>100</b>, in various implementations, is configured for use in deriving analytics information on many levels such as, in some examples, a product level, a store level, a POS-terminal level, a timeframe level, and a promotion level, the system <b>100</b> does not include a method for tracking behaviors at an individual customer level. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a second example system <b>150</b> combines features of the system <b>100</b> with an enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> in communication with a loyalty terminal <b>154</b> configured to collect customer information <b>156</b>. Customer information <b>156</b>, when available (e.g., when a customer is a member of a loyalty rewards program or otherwise offers unique identifying information such as a telephone number), is collected prior to completion of a transaction such that customer information may be associated with the transaction data (e.g., purchase data <b>120</b> as collected by the enhanced intermediary device, similar to the collection process described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>). The customer information <b>156</b>, in some examples, may be received by the loyalty terminal <b>154</b> by swiping a loyalty card <b>158</b> in a card reader portion of the loyalty terminal <b>154</b>, entering a customer identification number such as a telephone number into a keypad portion of the loyalty terminal <b>154</b>, or receiving a wireless transmission (e.g., Bluetooth&#xae;, near field communication (NFC), radio-frequency identification (RFID), etc.) containing the customer information <b>156</b> from an application executing upon a mobile device <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In some implementations, the loyalty terminal <b>154</b> receives the purchase data <b>120</b><i>a </i>from the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b>. The loyalty terminal <b>154</b>, for example, may provide the purchase data <b>120</b><i>a </i>within a threshold time period (e.g., five minutes, ten minutes, etc.) from providing the customer information <b>156</b> to the analysis server <b>108</b>. For example, based upon relative timestamps of the transmission of the customer information <b>156</b> and the purchase data <b>120</b><i>a</i>, the analysis server <b>108</b> may identify which customer information correlates to which transaction. In other examples, the loyalty terminal <b>154</b> appends the customer information <b>156</b> to the purchase data <b>120</b><i>a </i>prior to providing the purchase data <b>120</b><i>b </i>to the analysis server <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">In other implementations (not illustrated), the loyalty terminal <b>154</b> and the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> transmit the customer information <b>156</b> and the purchase data <b>120</b><i>a </i>separately. For example, the loyalty terminal <b>154</b> may allocate a unique identifier associated with the transaction to the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b>, and the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> may append the unique identifier to the purchase data <b>120</b> prior to providing the purchase data <b>120</b> to the analysis server <b>108</b>. In this circumstance, the analysis server <b>108</b> can associate the customer information <b>156</b> with the purchase data <b>120</b> based upon a matching unique identifier. In another example, based in part upon a relative time stamp of each of the customer information <b>156</b> and the purchase data <b>120</b><i>a</i>, and based further in part upon unique identifiers associated with both the loyalty terminal <b>154</b> and the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b>, the analysis server <b>108</b> can associate particular customer information <b>156</b> with particular purchase data <b>120</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Using the combination of the customer information <b>156</b> and the purchase data <b>120</b>, the offer matching engine <b>122</b> of the analysis server <b>108</b>, in some implementations, accesses historic transaction data associated with the customer identified by the customer information <b>156</b> to be used in analysis of the purchase data <b>120</b>. For example, the offer matching engine <b>122</b> may combine present purchase data <b>120</b> with historic purchase data in determining a credit, reward, or offer to provide to the customer. In a particular example, the offer matching engine <b>122</b> may combine a current purchase of two burritos with historic purchase data identifying the purchase of eight burritos to identify that a free burrito credit should be rewarded to the customer (e.g., in a buy ten get one free offer program). The offer matching engine <b>122</b>, further to the example, could provide injection data (not illustrated), including a free burrito credit, to the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> for injection within a print stream destined to the receipt printer <b>106</b> (e.g., similar to the process described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> in relation to the injection data <b>132</b>). In another example, the offer matching engine <b>122</b> may identify customer mailing information from customer data records <b>128</b><i>d </i>within the database <b>126</b> and initiate the mailing of a reward or offer to the customer's address.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In some implementations, the offer matching engine <b>122</b> provides offer information <b>162</b> to an electronic account (e.g., mobile account accessible via a mobile device application, online account accessible via an Internet browser, etc.) associated with the customer identified within the customer information <b>156</b>. For example, the customer can execute a mobile application or visit a loyalty program web site to review offers provided in relation to a loyalty program managed by the analysis server <b>108</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In some implementations, a user of the mobile device <b>160</b> may download and install a mobile device application configured to provide offers and promotions from one or more retailers. For example, the mobile device application may function as a loyalty rewards program (e.g., in addition to or in lieu of the loyalty rewards card <b>158</b>). For example, the mobile device application may provide customer information <b>156</b><i>a </i>(e.g., via a wireless transmission from the mobile device <b>160</b>) at the loyalty terminal <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">In some implementations, information collected from one or more intermediary devices is used to match offers for a customer. For example, based upon purchase history at a particular store, across a number of store locations, and/or at a variety of retail outlets (e.g., retailers owned by a same entity), the analysis server may identify one or more offers to provide to a particular customer.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The loyalty rewards program user interface (e.g., mobile application, browser application, etc.), in some implementations, is configured to maintain two or more loyalty rewards program within the same electronic account. For example, the user may download a same mobile device application for participation in a coffee shop loyalty rewards program and a car wash loyalty rewards program.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">In some implementations, the loyalty program electronic account receives electronic receipt data <b>168</b> transmitted by the analysis server <b>108</b>. For example, an electronic receipt generation engine <b>164</b> of the analysis server <b>108</b> may generate the electronic receipt <b>168</b> based upon the purchase data <b>120</b> provided by the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b>. The electronic receipt <b>168</b>, in some implementations, may be issued to the mobile computing device <b>160</b> via a mobile device messaging system. In other implementations, the electronic receipt <b>168</b> may be received by a mobile device application or browser-based application (e.g., as part of the loyalty rewards program).</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">In some implementations, rather than receiving both the electronic receipt <b>168</b> and a paper receipt, the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> is configured to block the print data from transmission to the receipt printer <b>106</b>. For example, based upon a command issued by the electronic receipt engine <b>164</b> of the analysis server <b>108</b>, the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> may intercept print instructions from the POS terminal <b>104</b> destined for the receipt printer <b>106</b>. In some implementations, a customer may opt for electronic-only receipts via an electronic account configuration option. For example, within user preferences, the customer may select electronic receipt only. The electronic receipt engine <b>164</b>, when preparing the electronic receipt <b>168</b>, may access customer data <b>128</b><i>d </i>associated with the customer information <b>156</b> and determine that the customer does not wish to receive a printed receipt. The electronic receipt engine <b>164</b> may issue a command to the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> to block the printing of the paper receipt at the receipt printer <b>106</b>. In some implementations, the command is relayed to the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> through the loyalty terminal <b>154</b>. In other implementations, the command is provided directly to the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> (e.g., through a wired or wireless connection between the analysis server <b>108</b> and the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The purchase analytics engine <b>124</b>, through the use of the loyalty terminal <b>154</b>, has the ability to track analytics at the customer level. For example, the customer data <b>128</b><i>d</i>, in some implementations, includes demographic information such as, in some examples, region (e.g., based upon address, portion of address, area code, and/or region of stores frequented by customer), age information (e.g., age, age range, date of birth, etc.), family information (e.g., number of children, ages of children, spouse, pets, etc.), and income level. At least a portion of the demographic information, in some implementations, is collected in part when signing the customer up for the loyalty program electronic account or upon installation of the loyalty program mobile application. In some implementations, a portion of the demographic information is derived from purchase habits (e.g., a monthly dog food purchase is indicative of one or more pets, etc.). This information may be used, for example, to present enhanced analytics information <b>166</b> to a user at the terminal <b>134</b>. In some implementations, the information may be analyzed using the Recency Frequency Monetary Value (RFM) method for analyzing customer behavior based upon transactional information.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Although the intermediary device <b>102</b> and the enhanced intermediary device <b>154</b> are illustrated as being positioned between the point of sale terminal <b>104</b> and the receipt printer <b>106</b>, in other implementations, the intermediary device <b>102</b> and/or the enhanced intermediary device <b>154</b> may be implemented as software services installed upon one or both of the point of sale terminal <b>104</b> and the receipt printer <b>106</b>. For example, a software application for collecting and analyzing transaction information may be installed upon the receipt printer <b>106</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">Although the intermediary device <b>102</b> and the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> are illustrated as being hardwired between the point of sale terminal <b>102</b> and the receipt printer <b>106</b>, in other implementations, the intermediary device <b>102</b> and/or the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> may be configured to collect wireless communications between the point of sale terminal <b>104</b> and the receipt printer <b>106</b>, for example using an Ethernet, WiFi&#x2122;, or Bluetooth&#xae; connection. Similarly, the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b>, in some implementations, may be configured to communicate wirelessly with the loyalty terminal <b>154</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A through 2C</figref> are block diagrams of example hardware configurations for a device for collecting and manipulating transaction data at point of sale. The illustrated hardware configurations, for example, include configurations which may be suitable for functionality as the intermediary device <b>102</b> as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> or the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a device <b>200</b> includes a set of serial ports <b>202</b> (e.g., DE-9, DIN-8, RS-232, UART, D-type, D-subminiature, RS-422, Mini-DIN, 8P8C, 10P10C, DH10, etc.), a set of parallel ports <b>204</b> (e.g., SCSI-1, SCSI-2, SCSI-3, SCSI-5, DB-25, DC-37, DD-50, CN-50, HDCN60, Wide SCSI, Very High Density Cable Interconnect (VHDCI), etc.), and a set of USB ports <b>206</b> (e.g., USB standard 1.1, 2.0, or 3.0, Type A or Type B, Mini-A or Mini-B, Micro-USB, etc). The device <b>200</b>, in some implementations, is connected to a first serial port compliant device at the serial port <b>202</b><i>a </i>and to a second serial port compliant device at the serial port <b>202</b><i>b</i>. The device <b>200</b>, in this configuration, is configured to permit communication of data issued by the first serial port compliant device to the second serial port compliant device through the connection to the serial ports <b>202</b>. The device <b>200</b>, in other implementations, is configured to enable communication between a first parallel port compliant device and a second parallel port compliant device through connection to the parallel ports <b>204</b>. Similarly, the device <b>200</b>, in further implementations, is configured to enable communication between a first USB compliant device to a second USB compliant device through connection to the USB ports <b>206</b>. Although illustrated in relation to the example serial, parallel, and USB ports, in other implementations, the device <b>200</b> may include one or more sets any style of port commonly used in connecting point of sale computing devices to purchase recording computing devices such as, in some examples, an ISDN connector, an Ethernet connector, a registered jack (RJ) (e.g., RJ11, RJ14, RJ21, RJ45, RJ48, etc.), or a Personal System/2 (PS/2) connector.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In some implementations, the device <b>200</b> derives power through the connection of the external devices. For example, the device <b>200</b> may derive power off of the USB connection between a first USB compliant device connected to the first USB port <b>206</b><i>a </i>and a second USB compliant device connected to the second USB port <b>206</b><i>b</i>. In other implementations, the device <b>200</b> includes a separate power supply such as, in some examples, an internal battery, or a wire and plug connectable to a power socket supply. In further implementations, the device <b>200</b> is connected to a separate piece of equipment, such as a docking station, that is in communication with a power supply.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The device <b>200</b>, in some implementations, is configured to pass data between devices connected one of the sets of ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> even in the event of loss of power to the device <b>200</b>. For example, should a battery of the device <b>200</b> lose power or a plug connection to an external power supply become disconnected, data will continue to transfer between a set of ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, or <b>206</b> providing communication between connected computing devices.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The device <b>200</b>, in some implementations, includes a separate connection for transferring information collected from the data passed between one of the sets of ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. For example, the device <b>200</b> may include a wireless transmitter for transferring information to a separate computing device over a wireless communication path (e.g., WiFi&#x2122;, WiMAX&#x2122;, Bluetooth&#xae;, Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) text message, wireless Ethernet, etc.). The device <b>200</b>, in some implementations, may collect wireless communications between a point of sale computing device and a purchase recording computing device using a wireless transmitter.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">In some implementations, the device <b>200</b> includes a port (not illustrated) for connecting with a communication device, such as a router or modem. For example, the device <b>200</b> may include a modem port, an Ethernet port, a mini-USB connector, or another connection to a communication device for communication of transaction data via a network such as, in some examples, a LAN, WAN, Intranet, Internet, cellular, GSM, or other network.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">In some implementations, a device for collecting and manipulating transaction data at point of sale is configured for connection to an additional computing device, such as the server <b>108</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref> or the loyalty terminal <b>154</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a device <b>220</b> includes the set of serial ports <b>202</b>, the set of parallel ports <b>204</b>, and the set of USB ports <b>206</b>. Additionally, the device <b>220</b> includes a USB port <b>222</b> for connection to a loyalty terminal device.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The USB port <b>222</b>, in some implementations, is used to connect a user computing device to the device <b>220</b> for configuration and/or troubleshooting purposes. For example, a user may connect a personal computing device to the USB port <b>222</b> to configure one or more offers for an offer matching algorithm of the device <b>220</b>. In another example, a user may upload injection information such as logos, images, greetings, watermark overlays, and other graphical or textual components that the device <b>220</b> can inject for printing to a printing device connected to one of the ports <b>202</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>b</i>. A user, in a further example, may retrieve statistics regarding the device <b>220</b>, install a software update to the device <b>220</b>, or review historic status and error messages accumulated by the device <b>220</b> while collecting, analyzing, and transmitting transaction data.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">In some implementations, the USB port <b>222</b> is connected to a loyalty terminal, such as the loyalty terminal <b>154</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The device <b>220</b>, in some examples, can receive power (e.g., off of the USB line connecting the device <b>220</b> to the loyalty terminal), commands, and/or communication access (e.g., network access) via the loyalty terminal. For example, the loyalty terminal may forward transaction data provided by the device <b>220</b> to a separate computer for analysis purposes (e.g., the analysis server <b>108</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>). An example of a loyalty terminal configured for connection to the device <b>220</b> via the USB port <b>222</b> is described in greater detail in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, a block diagram of an example internal configuration of a device <b>240</b> for collecting and manipulating transaction data at point of sale is illustrated. The device <b>240</b> includes the set of serial ports <b>202</b>, the set of parallel ports <b>204</b>, and the set of USB ports <b>206</b>, as well as the USB port <b>222</b>. Within the device <b>240</b>, a microprocessor <b>242</b> includes a series of modules for collecting, analyzing, transforming, and transmitting transaction data communicated between a first computing device connected to one of the ports <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>a</i>, and <b>206</b><i>a </i>and a second computing device connected to the matching port <b>202</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>b </i>of a connected pair of ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. As illustrated, each set of ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> is directly connected via one or more data lines (e.g., depending upon the style of port). For example, the serial ports <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>202</b><i>b </i>are connected via a single data line for the serial passing of data, while the parallel ports <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b </i>are connected via a set of eight data lines for parallel passing of data.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In other implementations, the parallel ports <b>204</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>b </i>are implemented using Universal Asynchronous Receivers (UARTs) (not illustrated). For example, a first UART <b>204</b><i>a </i>may reduce a parallel data stream to a serial form for ease of data collection, while a second UART <b>204</b><i>b </i>may produce a parallel data stream from the serial form for receipt by a connected printing device. In some examples, an RS-232, RS-422, or RS-485 UART pair may be used to translate parallel communications to serial and back for data collection and injection purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">In a full hardware configuration, other lines would be connected between sets of ports such as, in some examples, ground, voltage, control signal lines, and other lines typically connected to one or more of the ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b> to enable their functionality. Although not illustrated, the microprocessor <b>242</b> collects information from one or more additional lines, in some implementations, to monitor the communication stream between a point of sale computing device and a purchase recording computing device. For example, the microprocessor may collect control communication from a control line configured between a set of ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. For simplification, however, only data lines from which the microprocessor <b>242</b> is configured to collect data are illustrated.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The microprocessor <b>242</b> includes extraction modules <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>246</b><i>a</i>, and <b>248</b><i>a </i>for extracting data off of the one or more data lines connecting sets of ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. For example, a serial extraction module <b>244</b><i>a </i>is configured to extract data being transmitted across the serial data line between the set of serial ports <b>202</b>. The extraction modules <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>246</b><i>a</i>, and <b>248</b><i>a</i>, in some implementations, are configured to extract a data stream between two ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, recognize a formatting of the data (e.g., based upon the type of port), and extract transaction data from the formatting (e.g., depacketize, reorder, etc.). In a first mode of operation, in some implementations, the extraction modules <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>246</b><i>a</i>, and <b>248</b><i>a </i>are configured to extract data while allowing the data transmission to continue unimpeded. For example, the extraction modules <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>246</b><i>a</i>, and <b>248</b><i>a</i>, when in pass-through mode, may copy information while it passes between a point of sale computing device to a second computing device and vice-versa. The copying operation, for example, occurs in real time and without obstruction to or alteration of the information. In this manner, for example, the intermediary device <b>240</b> may collect transaction data without posing the threat of being a point of failure in the transactional operations.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">In some implementations, the extraction modules <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>246</b><i>a</i>, and <b>248</b><i>a </i>are additionally configured to delay or block the transmission of a portion of the data being passed between the respective set of ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. For example, a parallel extraction module <b>246</b><i>a </i>may temporarily store a portion of the data within a data buffer <b>252</b> portion of a storage media of the device <b>240</b>. The delay or blockage of transmission, in some implementations, may be enabled via an external command. For example, a USB communication module <b>256</b> may receive a command from a separate computing device connected to the USB port <b>222</b>. Responsive to the command, the USB communication module <b>256</b> may provide a signal for the device <b>240</b> to begin buffering or blocking the transmission of data. In some implementations, prior to buffering and/or blocking data, the active extraction module <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>246</b><i>a</i>, or <b>248</b><i>a </i>may watch for and recognize the beginning of a particular type of data stream between the respective ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, or <b>206</b>. For example, a USB extraction module <b>248</b><i>a </i>may recognize a print command destined for the USB port <b>206</b><i>b </i>and begin to buffer or block print stream data destined to the device connected to USB port <b>206</b><i>b</i>. By functioning as a pass-through device unless buffering and/or blocking print stream data, for example, the device <b>220</b> may collect transaction data without impeding communication between the two connected devices. The pass-through mode, for example, allows collection of transaction data without the possibility of the intermediary device <b>220</b> becoming a point of failure (e.g., because data continues to flow between the respective ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, and <b>206</b> unchanged and unimpeded by the extraction modules <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>246</b><i>a</i>, and <b>248</b><i>a</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In some implementations, buffering of the data stream between a respective set of ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, or <b>206</b> may be achieved through a data buffering module <b>266</b>. The data buffering module <b>266</b>, for example, may intercept an incoming data stream (e.g., received through one of the ports <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>a</i>, or <b>206</b><i>a</i>, temporarily buffer the information to the data buffer <b>252</b> portion of the storage media. Further to the example, the data buffering module may provide, at a later time, portions of the buffered data stream to a respective injection module <b>244</b><i>b</i>, <b>246</b><i>b</i>, and <b>248</b><i>b </i>for injection to the respective port <b>202</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, or <b>206</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">In some implementations, in addition to extraction of data, one or more injection modules <b>244</b><i>b</i>, <b>246</b><i>b</i>, and <b>248</b><i>b </i>may be configured to inject data onto one or more data lines connecting a respective set of ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>. For example, a USB injection module <b>248</b><i>b </i>may inject data onto the USB data lines to be delivered to a device connected to the USB port <b>206</b><i>b</i>. In some implementations, the injection modules <b>244</b><i>b</i>, <b>246</b><i>b</i>, and <b>248</b><i>b </i>may be configured to &#x201c;spoof&#x201d; the device connected to the sending port <b>202</b><i>a</i>, <b>204</b><i>a</i>, or <b>206</b><i>a</i>. For example, for instructions injected upon the parallel lines connected to parallel port <b>204</b><i>b</i>, a parallel injection module <b>246</b><i>b </i>may manipulate a data header to mimic data being sent by the device connected to the parallel port <b>204</b><i>a</i>. In some implementations, spoofing includes altering header information in buffered data. For example, to inject information in the middle of a USB print stream, print data destined out the USB port <b>206</b><i>b </i>after the point of injection may have modified header information to maintain a recognizable sequence of data packets received by a device connected to the USB port <b>206</b><i>b</i>. In some implementations, spoofing includes altering and/or adding control messages passed between the point of sale computing device and the purchase recording computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">In some implementations, data for injection via one of the injection modules <b>244</b><i>b</i>, <b>246</b><i>b</i>, and <b>248</b><i>b </i>is received from an external device. For example, as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, offer information may be provided by an external computing device (e.g., the analysis server <b>108</b>) and received by the device <b>240</b> (e.g., over the USB port <b>222</b> or an antenna <b>254</b>). Injection data, in some implementations, is determined by the device <b>240</b>. For example, an offer matching module <b>268</b> may match information contained within transaction data extracted by one of the extraction modules <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>246</b><i>a</i>, <b>248</b><i>a </i>and provide one or more matching offers (e.g., as identified from offer records <b>272</b><i>b </i>stored within a data store <b>250</b>) to the correlating injection module <b>244</b><i>b</i>, <b>246</b><i>b</i>, <b>248</b><i>b </i>for presentation at a computing device connected to the selected port <b>202</b><i>b</i>, <b>204</b><i>b</i>, <b>206</b><i>b</i>. For example, offer information may be printed to a receipt by a receipt printer connected to port <b>204</b><i>b </i>by injecting offer information into a print stream using the parallel injection module <b>246</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">Prior to matching an offer, in some implementations, data extracted by one of the extraction modules <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>246</b><i>a</i>, <b>248</b><i>a </i>may be analyzed by a data analysis module <b>260</b>. The data analysis module <b>260</b>, for example, may recognize portions of transaction data, such as product names, quantities, and prices. The data analysis module <b>260</b>, in some implementations, categorizes transaction data by portions of a record (e.g., payment instrument information versus product purchase listing versus remittance information, etc.). In some implementations, the data analysis module <b>260</b> provides the identified elements of the transaction data to a data storage module <b>258</b> for storage within one or more purchase records <b>272</b><i>a </i>of the data storage medium <b>250</b>. The data storage module <b>258</b>, in some implementations, associates transaction data in a database form within the storage media <b>250</b>. The transaction data, in some implementations, is stored in a format that is later retrievable by identification of a unique transaction. For example, each transaction may be uniquely identified by the combination of a timestamp and POS terminal identifier.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">In some implementations, the device <b>240</b> transmits transaction data stored within the data storage medium <b>250</b> to an external computing device. A data transmission module <b>262</b>, for example, may be used to transmit data via the USB communications module <b>256</b> or the antenna <b>254</b>. In some examples, data may be transmitted on a per-transaction basis, periodically, upon request by an external device (e.g., a command received by the USB communications module <b>256</b>), or at the point when the data storage medium <b>250</b> is reaching a threshold capacity.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">Prior to transmitting the data via the data transmission module <b>262</b>, in some implementations, a data transformation module <b>270</b> transforms the transaction data for transmission. For example, the data transformation module <b>270</b> may encrypt, compress, filter, and/or packetize transaction data prior to transmission. In some implementations, one or more transformation techniques may be applied to the transaction data prior to storage within the data store <b>250</b>. For example, upon identification of payment instrument information, such as credit card information, the data transformation module <b>270</b> may apply a security algorithm, such as a strong one-way hash, to the payment instrument information prior to storage and/or transmission of the transaction data. In some implementations, the security algorithm is compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">In some implementations, the device <b>240</b> includes a self diagnostic module <b>264</b> for collecting statistical information regarding the performance of the device <b>240</b>, providing external debugging of the device <b>240</b>, and/or providing access to one or more configuration parameters of the device <b>240</b>. For example, a user may connect a computing device to the device <b>240</b> via the USB port <b>222</b> to access configuration, diagnostics and/or statistics information related to the device <b>240</b>. The connected computing device, for example, may be installed with a program configured to communicate with the self diagnostic module <b>264</b>. The self diagnostic module <b>264</b>, in some examples, includes telemetric information such as a unique identifier of the device <b>240</b>, a state (e.g., on, off, passive collection, active injection, active blocking, etc.), an up time (e.g., length of time since last power cycle and/or timestamp of last power cycle), a version number of the device <b>240</b> and/or a software installation of the device <b>240</b>, an amount of data collected, an amount of data transmitted, an amount of data injected, timestamps associated with the most recent data collection/transmission/injection, an identification of a loyalty terminal communicating with the device <b>240</b>, one or more errors reported by the device <b>240</b>, and a data storage capacity of the device <b>240</b> (e.g., quantity of data stored, disk space available, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some implementations, a user program designed to interface with the self diagnostic module <b>264</b> includes an offer module for configuring the offer matching module <b>268</b> with parameters for matching and serving offers. The offer module, for example, may provide the user with a method for adding offers to the offer records <b>272</b><i>b. </i></p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">In some implementations, two or more intermediary devices such as the device <b>240</b> are configured to share information. For example, a master intermediary device may receive configuration parameters through a user program interface, and the master intermediary device may share the configuration parameters (e.g., offer records <b>272</b><i>b</i>, network connection parameters, etc.) with one or more slave intermediary devices. The slave intermediary devices, in some implementations, include a simpler configuration than the master intermediary devices. For example, a slave intermediary device may lack a component for communication with the user program. Further to this example, the master intermediary device may receive and store telemetric information provided by one or more slave intermediary devices. In another example, a slave intermediary device may lack the data analysis module <b>260</b>. For example, data may be collected by one or more slave intermediary devices, then transmitted to the master intermediary device for analysis. Other implementations of capability-sharing between master and slave intermediary devices are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Although described in relation to collecting transaction data shared between two wired devices connected via one of the sets of ports <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>, <b>206</b>, in other implementations, the device <b>240</b> is configured to extract transaction data communicated wirelessly between a point of sale computing device and a purchase recording computing device. For example, additional modules may include a wireless Ethernet extraction module, a WiFi&#x2122; extraction module, and/or a Bluetooth&#xae; extraction module. Additionally, in other implementations, injection modules may be provided for injecting information into a wireless communication stream between a point of sale computing device and a purchase recording computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a block diagram of an example hardware configuration for a loyalty terminal <b>300</b> for collecting and communicating customer information at point of sale, such as the loyalty terminal <b>154</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. The loyalty terminal <b>300</b> includes a display region <b>302</b> inviting a user to &#x201c;Swipe member card or enter phone number.&#x201d; The member card or phone number, for example, may be used to derive customer information, as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> (e.g., mobile device <b>160</b> providing customer information <b>156</b><i>a</i>, loyalty card <b>158</b> providing customer information <b>156</b><i>b</i>). The phone number, for example, may be entered using a keypad <b>304</b>, while the member card may be swiped through a swipe trough <b>306</b>. In other implementations, rather than swiping a card, the card may be read using a near field communication (NFC), Bluetooth&#xae;, or other short distance wireless communication method. For example, a loyalty card may be implanted with a short range communication device such as an RFID chip. In further implementations, machine-readable indicia on the loyalty card may be read using an optical scanning functionality of the loyalty terminal <b>300</b>. For example, upon presenting the loyalty card to the display region <b>302</b>, an optical scanner may scan information displayed upon the loyalty card. In some implementations, a mobile application executing upon a smart phone device may transmit a telephone number to the loyalty terminal <b>154</b> through a wireless transmission such as NFC and Bluetooth&#xae;.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">The loyalty terminal <b>300</b>, in some implementations, is connected to an intermediary device such as the device <b>220</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> to enable association between transaction data collected by the intermediary device and the customer information collected by the loyalty terminal <b>300</b>. In some implementations, the loyalty terminal <b>300</b> includes a communication port (e.g., a modem port, an Ethernet port, a mini-USB connector, or another connection to a communication device) for communication of customer identification data and, optionally, transaction data via a network such as, in some examples, a LAN, WAN, Intranet, Internet, cellular, GSM, or other network.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In some implementations, the loyalty terminal <b>300</b> includes an antenna and built-in communications module for communicating information via a network. In some examples, the loyalty terminal <b>300</b> may be configured to communicate customer information and, optionally, transaction data via wireless transmission (e.g., WiFi&#x2122;, WiMAX&#x2122;, Bluetooth&#xae;, Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) text message, wireless Ethernet, etc.). In other implementations, the loyalty terminal includes a network port for connecting directly (e.g., via an Ethernet cable, etc.) or indirectly (e.g., via a modem or other communication device) to a communications network.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The loyalty terminal <b>300</b>, in some implementations, includes a USB port <b>308</b> for connection to the device <b>220</b>. For example, the loyalty terminal <b>300</b> may act as a power source and communication feed for the device <b>220</b>. For power, in some implementations, the loyalty terminal <b>300</b> includes a power connector (e.g., outlet plug, etc.) <b>310</b>. In other implementations, the loyalty terminal may be battery operated or derive power through connection to a separate device, for example via a USB connection to a point of sale terminal or computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In some implementations, the loyalty terminal <b>300</b> collects information for adding a new customer to a loyalty program and transmits the customer information to a separate computing device. For example, the loyalty terminal <b>300</b> may present a series of questions to a new customer such as, in some examples, name, mailing address, telephone number, and email address of a new customer. In response to establishing a new customer account, in some implementations, the loyalty terminal <b>300</b> may present instructions for installing a loyalty rewards program mobile application. For example, the loyalty terminal <b>300</b> may present information within the display area <b>302</b> including machine-readable indicia for retrieving the uniform resource locator (URL) or other network address information to download an installation program. For example, an optical scanner function of the mobile device of the user may be used to scan machine-readable indicia (e.g., bar code, QR code, etc.) presented within the display area <b>302</b> of the loyalty terminal <b>300</b>. In some implementations, the separate computing device may provide instructions for opening an electronic account with the loyalty rewards program through a browser application or for installing the loyalty rewards program mobile application. For example, the separate computing device may send an email to a provided email address containing the URL for accessing a browser application or downloading the mobile application installation program.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">In some implementations, the loyalty terminal <b>300</b> may present user options regarding the current transaction. For example, the loyalty terminal <b>300</b> may present, within the display region <b>302</b>, the option of having an electronic receipt provided to the customer in addition to or in lieu of a paper receipt. In some implementations, responsive selection by the customer of the option to only receive an electronic receipt, the loyalty terminal <b>300</b> issues a command to the device <b>200</b> to block print instructions from reaching an attached printing device.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">Although described in relation to messages displayed within a display region, in some implementations, the loyalty terminal <b>300</b> includes a voice response program for speaking instructions to a customer and receiving natural language responses related to customer identification and transaction options.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref> illustrate a flow chart of an example method <b>400</b> for extracting, transforming, and transmitting data in a device for collecting and manipulating transaction data at point of sale. Portions of the method <b>400</b> can be executed by an intermediary device such as the intermediary device <b>102</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> or the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">In some implementations, the method <b>400</b> begins with collecting data passed between a point of sale computing device and a second computing device (<b>402</b>). The data is collected, in some modes, without impeding transmission of the data between the point of sale computing device and the second computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">In some implementations, information is extracted from the collected data (<b>404</b>). For example, information may be depacketized, reordered, and otherwise identified from within a collected data stream. Extraction of the information, for example, may be implemented by one of the extraction modules <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>246</b><i>a</i>, <b>248</b><i>a </i>as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">If transaction data is identified (<b>406</b>), and the transaction data is scheduled to be transmitted (<b>408</b>), in some implementations, at least a portion of the transaction data is transformed for transmission (<b>410</b>). Transaction data may be identified, for example, by the data analysis module <b>260</b> as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. In some examples, the transaction data may be categorized into one or more types of information (e.g., purchase data, remittance data, discount data, etc.), encrypted, compressed, filtered, and/or packetized prior to transmission. One or more of the data transformations, for example, may be applied by the data transformation module <b>270</b> as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">In some implementations, the transaction data may be provided for analysis by a separate computing device (<b>412</b>). The separate computing device, for example, may include the analysis server <b>108</b> as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. The transaction data may be provided across a wired or wireless connection to the separate computing device. In some implementations, the transaction data may be supplied to the separate computing device over an antenna, such as the antenna <b>254</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. In other implementations, the transaction data may be provided via the USB port <b>222</b> by the USB communications module <b>256</b>, as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">If, instead, the transaction data is not to be immediately transmitted (<b>408</b>), in some implementations, the transaction data may be stored (<b>414</b>). For example, the data storage module <b>258</b> may store the transaction data within the data storage medium <b>250</b> (e.g., as purchase data records <b>272</b><i>a</i>) as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. In some implementations, a portion of the transaction data may be transformed prior to storage. For example, transaction records may be compressed, filtered, and/or encrypted prior to storage by the transformation module <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106">Whether or not transaction data was identified (<b>406</b>), in some implementations, the method <b>400</b> may continue by determining whether print instructions were received (<b>416</b>). If print instructions have been received (<b>416</b>), in some implementations, the method <b>400</b> continues in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> with determining whether there is print data to be injected (<b>418</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107">If print data is to be injected (<b>418</b>), in some implementations, injection information may be identified for injecting into a print stream (<b>420</b>). The injection information, in some examples, may include an offer, rebate, greeting, watermark, logo, or other information for printing upon a receipt, purchase agreement, return slip, or other communication commonly printed by a POS terminal. In some implementations, the injection information is determined by the offer matching module <b>268</b>, described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>. For example, the offer matching module <b>268</b> may match one or more offer records <b>272</b><i>b </i>to transaction data identified by the data analysis module <b>260</b>. In some implementations, the injection information is received from an external computing device, such as the analysis server <b>108</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. For example, the injection information may be received via the USB communication module <b>256</b> over the USB port <b>222</b> or via the wireless antenna <b>254</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">In some implementations, data provided by the point of sale computing device for the second computing device may be buffered prior to forwarding to the second computing device (<b>422</b>). For example, rather than functioning in pass through mode where data is extracted without impeding communication between the point of sale computing device and the second computing device, the device may enter a second mode where data is buffered prior to being delivered to the second computing device. In some implementations, the data buffering module <b>266</b>, described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>, may buffer the data extracted by one of the extraction modules <b>244</b><i>a</i>, <b>246</b><i>a</i>, <b>248</b><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">In some implementations, prior to forwarding a portion of the data to the second computing device, injection information is injected into the print stream for printing at the second computing device (<b>424</b>). In some implementations, one of the injection modules <b>244</b><i>b</i>, <b>246</b><i>b</i>, <b>248</b><i>b </i>injects the injection information into the data being supplied to the second computing device. Injecting information into the print stream, in some implementations, may involves transforming the information to allow it to be recognized by the second computing device as print information. For example, the injection information may be packetized, ordered, or formatted in a manner to match the buffered data stream. In some implementations, transformation of the injection information includes adding header information to spoof the injected information as having been supplied by the point of sale computing device. The transformation of the injection information, in some implementations, may be accomplished by the data transformation module <b>270</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In some implementations, in addition to transforming the injection information, at least a portion of the buffered print stream is transformed prior to forwarding to the second computing device. For example, to maintain frame order, a frame identifier within subsequent frames may be incremented to take into consideration additional frames injected into the print stream.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">Additionally, to maintain control communication between the point of sale device and the second computing device, in some implementations, one or more control frames are transformed or spoofed. For example, print acknowledgment control data may be modified (e.g., to reduce size of print job to the original print instructions provided by the point of sale device) and/or discarded (e.g., discard control data confirming printing of material never sent by the point of sale).</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0112">In some implementations, rather than injecting print data (<b>418</b>), the method <b>400</b> receives a command to block data from being printed (<b>426</b>). For example, as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, a user receiving the electronic receipt <b>168</b> may wish to suppress the printing of a paper receipt by the receipt printer <b>106</b>. In some implementations, a print suppression command is issued by the analysis terminal to either the intermediary device or the loyalty terminal (which then forwards the command to the intermediary device). A print suppression option, in some implementations, is entered at the loyalty terminal by a customer. The loyalty terminal, in this case, may forward the command to the intermediary device.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0113">In some implementations, print stream data is blocked from reaching the second computing device (<b>428</b>). For example, the enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b> may be configured to block a portion of the data stream <b>110</b> from reaching the receipt printer <b>106</b> to suppress the printing of the receipt. In some implementations, data may be blocked from being printed by the data buffer module <b>266</b> operating in a no-forwarding mode.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0114">Although the method <b>400</b> has been described in relation to a series of steps performed in an example order, in other implementations, one or more of the steps of the method <b>400</b> may be performed in a different order and/or in parallel, and one or more steps may be added to the method <b>400</b>. Furthermore, one or more of the steps of the method <b>400</b>, in other implementations, may be combined or removed. In one example, transaction data may be extracted from print stream information while the print stream information is being blocked or buffered. When transmitting transaction data (<b>408</b>), in some implementations, previously stored transaction data may be accessed and combined with present transaction data for transmission to a separate computing device (<b>412</b>). In some implementations, in coordination with blocking the print stream data, the method <b>400</b> may spoof an acknowledgement of success of printing to supply to the point of sale computing device, such that the point of sale computing device does not attempt to re-send print instructions, (e.g., under the assumption of prior failure). Other modifications of the method <b>400</b> are possible without straying from the intent and purpose of the method <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0115"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref> illustrate a flow chart of an example method <b>500</b> for analyzing data and matching offers in a system for collecting and manipulating transaction data at point of sale. The method <b>500</b> may be performed on transaction data collected by the intermediary device <b>102</b> or enhanced intermediary device <b>152</b>, as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>. The method <b>500</b>, in some implementations, is performed by the analysis server <b>108</b>, described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0116">In some implementations, the method <b>500</b> begins with receiving transaction data regarding one or more transactions conducted at a point of sale computing device (<b>502</b>). The transaction data, for example, may have been collected by an intermediary device installed between a point of sale computing device and a second computing device.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0117">In some implementations, if customer information is received (<b>504</b>), the customer information is associated with the transaction data (<b>506</b>). For example, a unique identifier, such as a telephone number, loyalty card identification, combination of username and password, biometric information, or other uniquely identifying information may be provided within customer information. If this is a new customer, in some implementations, the customer information may include registration information (e.g., name, address, telephone number, etc.). In the example of a new customer, in some implementations, a unique identifier may be associated with the customer information.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0118">In some implementations, the customer information is received within a same transmission as the transaction data. For example, the customer information may be associated with a same communication stream provided to a separate computing device. In other implementations, the customer information is provided separately from the transaction data. The transaction data and the customer information, for example, may be associated with a particular identifier, such as a temporary unique identifier. The customer information (e.g., unique customer identifier), in this example, is associated with the transaction data through the linking of the two sets of information by the temporary unique identifier. In some implementations, the transaction data is associated with the customer information via storage within a database containing both customer records and transaction records.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0119">In some implementations, based upon the customer information, a customer profile is identified (<b>508</b>). For example, information such as, in some examples, customer biographic data, preferences, options, and transaction history may be collected within a customer profile. The customer profile, for example, may be identified by linking the customer identifier to records within a customer database.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0120">Based upon the customer profile, it is determined whether to send an electronic receipt to the customer (<b>510</b>). In some implementations, a customer selects, within preferences, whether to receive electronic receipts. In some implementations, an electronic receipt may be generated based upon information related to the customer identifier (e.g., existence of an email address, phone number for text messaging, identification of an electronic account of a loyalty rewards program, identification of a social networking account, or existence of another method for communicating electronic receipt information to the customer). For example, customers who use a physical loyalty card may not have provided adequate information to receive electronic receipts.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0121">If an electronic receipt is being sent (<b>510</b>), in some implementations, an electronic receipt may be prepared (<b>512</b>). For example, the transaction data may be parsed to identify and format an electronic receipt identifying the purchase of one or more items and/or the return of one or more items.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0122">In some implementations, the electronic receipt is provided to an account associated with the customer profile (<b>514</b>). The account, in some implementations, includes an email address. For example, an electronic receipt may be emailed to a customer. In some implementations, the account includes an electronic account with an online (e.g., browser-based) loyalty rewards program. In some implementations, the account includes a mobile application account. For example, using a loyalty program application, the customer may be provided a tool for organizing and reviewing electronic receipts related to a number of transactions. In some implementations, the loyalty program application is affiliated with a particular retailer or corporate entity. In other implementations, the loyalty program application is a third party application capable of presenting information related to the loyalty programs of one or more retailers. The retailers, for example, may sign up with the third party for management of the loyalty program including providing electronic receipts to customers.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">Whether or not an electronic receipt is issued, in some implementations, the transaction data is analyzed to update loyalty program information associated with the customer profile (<b>516</b>). For example, the transaction data may be analyzed in light of historic transaction data to identify a threshold purchase (e.g., threshold amount of money spent, threshold number of a particular product purchased, threshold number of times purchasing a particular service, etc.). In a particular example, the transaction data may be compared to historic data to determine whether eight rounds of golf have been purchased, in which case a reward for a free bag of balls may be applied to the customer account.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">If a reward level has been reached (<b>518</b>), in some implementations, a reward is issued to the customer (<b>520</b>). In some implementations, if electronic contact information such as, in some examples, an email address, social networking account, loyalty rewards program electronic account, or text message-enabled telephone number is provided, the reward is issued to the customer electronically. For example, an electronic coupon or certificate may be allocated within the loyalty rewards program electronic account of the customer. In another example, a loyalty rewards card associated with the customer account may be credited with the reward. The customer, additionally, in some implementations, may be emailed or text messaged with an alert related to the application of the reward to the loyalty rewards program electronic account or the loyalty card. The reward, in some implementations, may be issued physically. For example, the customer may be mailed a paper coupon or a rewards program card with a reward applied to the balance. In some implementations, the method for issuing the reward may be based in part upon customer preferences. For example, by reviewing the customer profile, it may be determined that the customer prefers to be mailed a physical rewards certificate.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, regardless of whether customer information was received (<b>504</b>) or a reward level was reached (<b>518</b>), in some implementations, the transaction data may be analyzed to identify matching offers (<b>522</b>). In the circumstance that a customer has not been identified, the products, purchase quantity, and/or purchase amount may be analyzed to identify one or more offers to associate with the transaction. For example, based upon identifying that a particular brand of yogurt has been purchased, an offer for a discount towards a frozen yogurt product may be identified. In the circumstance that a customer has been identified, in some implementations, historic transaction data may be reviewed in light of the current transaction data when identifying an offer. For example, if a customer has historically purchased a pedicure one or more times, and the current transaction data does not identify a pedicure, an offer for a discount on a pedicure may be identified.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">If an offer has been identified (<b>524</b>), and customer information has been identified (<b>526</b>), in some implementations, the offer information may be provided to an account associated with the customer profile (<b>528</b>). For example, an offer for a discount pedicure may be emailed to the customer, applied to an electronic account of a loyalty program associated with the customer, text messaged to the customer, or mailed to a home address of the customer.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">If an offer has been identified (<b>524</b>) but no customer has been identified associated with the transaction data (<b>526</b>), in some implementations, the offer information is provided to an intermediary device for injection as print data to a receipt printer (<b>530</b>). As discussed in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, for example, an intermediary device, installed between a point of sale computing device and a printing device, may identify print stream information and inject additional print instructions related to printing the offer. In some implementations, the offer is printed on the receipt supplied to the customer. The offer, in some implementations, is presented on an additional slip of paper.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Regardless of the various decisions made throughout the method <b>500</b>, in some implementations, the transaction data is entered into a database (<b>532</b>). The database, for example, may be queried in relation to analytics software for presenting statistical analysis to a retailer, corporation, or entity regarding historical transactions. In another example, a loyalty rewards program mobile application or browser application may query the database to obtain historical data regarding the transactions of a particular individual, in relation to a particular entity (e.g., retailer, corporation, etc.) or in relation to a number of entities.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Although the method <b>500</b> has been described in relation to a series of steps performed in an example order, in other implementations, one or more of the steps of the method <b>500</b> may be performed in a different order and/or in parallel, and one or more steps may be added to the method <b>500</b>. Furthermore, one or more of the steps of the method <b>400</b>, in other implementations, may be combined or removed. In one example, transaction data may be entered into a database (<b>532</b>) prior to preparing the electronic receipt (<b>512</b>). In another example, the transaction data may not be analyzed to identify matching offers (<b>522</b>) or, if a customer has been identified, the analysis for offers may be done in combination with the analysis for identifying rewards (<b>516</b>). In some implementations, rather than providing offer information to the intermediary device for injection as print data to a receipt printer (<b>530</b>), offer information may be provided to a loyalty terminal such as the loyalty terminal <b>154</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. For example, the loyalty terminal could present a QR code to the customer within a display region of the loyalty terminal (e.g., such as the display region <b>302</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>). Using the mobile device, the customer could scan the QR code to obtain the offer. Similarly, in some implementations, the customer may be presented with reward information at the loyalty terminal. For example, within a display region of the loyalty terminal, reward information may be presented. A customer, for example, may be prompted to swipe a loyalty rewards card to receive a reward credit. In another example, the customer may be prompted to interact with the loyalty terminal to receive a wireless communication including the reward (e.g., to a mobile device). Other modifications of the method <b>500</b> are possible without straying from the intent and purpose of the method <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref> are screen shots of example user interfaces for a browser-based or mobile loyalty rewards application configured to manage a loyalty program customer account and transaction data. The loyalty rewards application, for example, may be installed upon the mobile device <b>160</b> (e.g., as described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>) or accessed via a browser application running on the mobile device <b>160</b>. The loyalty rewards application, in some implementations, is configured to manage electronic receipt information, present a number of offers available through one or more entities associated with one or more loyalty programs, and track rewards accumulated through the one or more loyalty programs. Additionally, in some implementations, the loyalty rewards application is configured to transmit customer identification information to a loyalty terminal, such as the loyalty terminal <b>154</b> described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. Furthermore, in some implementations, the loyalty rewards application is configured to present a customer with statistical analysis regarding transactions and/or issue reminders regarding potential future transactions based in part upon analysis of historic transactions. For example, the loyalty rewards application may be configured to identify that the customer purchases dog food every six weeks and, upon reaching six weeks, remind the customer to pick up a bag of dog food. In some implementations, the loyalty rewards device application is configured to identify geolocation information regarding the mobile device and provide information to the user based in part upon the geolocation information. For example, the loyalty rewards application may be configured to identify a preference of the customer to purchase a morning cup of coffee on a substantially regular basis, recognize that the mobile device is in a different location than a typical neighborhood, and provide an address and/or directions to the nearest coffee shop of the preferred retailer.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, a first screen shot <b>600</b> includes presentation of a number of offers <b>602</b> in relation to a first vendor <b>604</b>. The first screen shot <b>600</b>, in some implementations, is presented to a customer upon selection of the first vendor <b>604</b>. For example, using a drop-down menu <b>606</b>, the customer may switch between a number of vendors. In some implementations, the drop-down menu <b>606</b> presents a number of vendors having loyalty programs managed through the loyalty rewards application. The customer, for example, is a member of the loyalty program of each vendor presented via the drop-down menu <b>606</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">In relation to the first vendor <b>604</b>, the customer is presented with the offers <b>602</b>, each offer being associated with a particular discount and/or reward. A present reward value <b>608</b>, illustrated above the offers <b>602</b>, identifies an accrual of reward credits (e.g., points) related to the first vendor <b>604</b>. As illustrated, in the present example, rewards credits may be used as a cash value during a transaction at the first vendor <b>604</b>. In other implementations, a present reward value <b>608</b> may identify a percentage completion in regards to a particular reward. For example, in the manner of an electronic punch card, the present reward value <b>608</b> may instead identify a total number of a product purchased in relation to the threshold number to obtain a free product (e.g., buy twelve sandwiches, get the thirteenth free). In some implementations, two or more present reward values may be illustrated. For example, in relation to a grocery store with a deli section, the user may accrue points towards a free rotisserie chicken in a buy-on-get-one rewards program, plus a credit for an affiliated gas station based upon total purchases. Any combination and/or number of reward values may be associated with a particular vendor.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">To encourage the customer to earn additional rewards, in some implementations, the first vendor <b>604</b>, in some implementations, provides a variety of offers <b>602</b> (e.g., discounts and rewards opportunities) through the loyalty rewards application. In some implementations, the loyalty rewards application may present only a portion of all existing offers to the customer. In some examples, the offers <b>602</b> may be selected based at least in part on a membership level <b>610</b> (e.g., a relative assessment of how loyal a customer the current customer is to the first vendor <b>604</b>), a time of day (e.g., breakfast offers may be presented until 9:30 a.m., lunch offers may be presented until 2:00 p.m., etc.), a current location of the mobile device in relation to the nearest location of the first vendor <b>604</b> (e.g., only certain branches may participate in particular offers, only particular outlets may feature a particular product such as breakfast items or espresso-based coffees), and/or user profile information (e.g., customer is vegetarian, customer is a diabetic, customer does not own a car, customer has children, customer has no pets, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0135" num="0134">In some implementations, a geolocator capability (e.g., global positioning service (GPS), etc.) of the mobile device may be called upon to determine a current location of the mobile device in relation to the first vendor <b>604</b>. For example, as illustrated a distance indicator <b>612</b> has located a branch of the first vendor <b>604</b> within 152 feet of the mobile device.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0135">Upon selection of a particular offer <b>602</b>, in some implementations, the loyalty rewards application presents the user with detailed information regarding the selected offer <b>602</b>. For example, turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, a screen shot <b>620</b> includes a description of a reward in the form of a number of credits for purchasing a tropical fruit salad. Additionally, a reward availability notice <b>622</b> informs the customer that a credit of 10 points may be applied to the purchase of the tropical fruit salad. An availability message <b>624</b> indicates a relative availability of the tropical fruit salad. In other examples, an availability notification may provide an estimated wait for obtaining an oil change, a number of reservations left for a shoulder massage, or a closest available dealer with a particular product in stock.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Beneath the availability message, a removal control <b>626</b> provides the user the opportunity to remove the offer from the list. Removal of the offer, for example, may be considered as an indication of lack of interest in a particular offer (e.g., the customer dislikes tropical fruit salads). In some implementations, responsive to removal of an offer, the offer will be demoted (e.g., within future presentation of available offers) or will be blocked from being offered to this customer in the future. Upon returning to the first screen shot <b>600</b>, for example, the user should no longer see the tropical fruit salad offer within the offers <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0137">To redeem an offer, in some implementations, the user may present an offer code (not illustrated) and an identification as a member of the loyalty program (e.g., telephone number, loyalty program card, transmission from the loyalty program mobile application to a loyalty terminal, etc.) to redeem one of the offers <b>602</b>, such as the tropical fruit salad offer. In other implementations, an offer may be automatically applied to the electronic account of a member of the loyalty program upon identification of the electronic account at the point of sale. For example, a user may have previously selected (e.g., &#x201c;liked&#x201d;, accepted, or otherwise indicated an interest in) a particular offer good towards a purchase at a vendor. Upon making the particular purchase (e.g., a purchase of a particular item, a purchase of at least a threshold dollar amount, etc.), the electronic account may be automatically credited the reward value of the offer.</p>
<p id="p-0139" num="0138">In some implementations, upon redemption of the offer, the offer no longer appears within the offers <b>602</b>. In some examples, a particular offer may be available to a customer for a single use, upon a particular schedule (e.g., once per week, once per month, etc.), or on a rolling basis (e.g., four weeks after the most recent redemption of the offer).</p>
<p id="p-0140" num="0139">An entity, in some implementations, populates offers for presentation to customers through an offer management interface of a loyalty program vendor program. Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a screen shot <b>700</b> of an example loyalty program and transaction data management application includes an offer management interface <b>702</b>. Through the offer management interface <b>702</b>, a user can define a number of offers for presentation to customers, for example through a loyalty program electronic account. The offer management interface <b>702</b>, as illustrated, includes options of a variety of offer templates <b>704</b> such as a credit towards total purchase offer <b>704</b><i>a</i>, a credit towards product purchase offer <b>704</b><i>b</i>, and a punch card offer <b>704</b><i>c</i>. The offer templates <b>704</b>, in some implementations, are presented to a user in response to selecting a new offer menu <b>706</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0141" num="0140">The new offer menu <b>706</b>, for example, navigates the user through a series of steps in creating a new offer including, for example, an offer type <b>706</b><i>a </i>(e.g., currently active), general settings <b>706</b><i>b</i>, validity period <b>706</b><i>c</i>, offer usage <b>706</b><i>d</i>, customer profile <b>706</b><i>e</i>, purchase history <b>706</b><i>f</i>, and preview <b>706</b><i>g</i>. Within the general settings step <b>706</b><i>b</i>, for example, the user may upload an image related to the offer, write a brief description of the offer, and set a reward value related to the offer (e.g., number of purchase, amount of purchase to award credit, etc.). Moving to the validity period step <b>706</b><i>c</i>, in some implementations, the user may establish a start time and an end time for the offer. Furthermore, in some implementations, the validity period step <b>706</b><i>c </i>may include identifying a reoccurrence of the offer (e.g., every Thursday, every day at noon, etc.). Turning to the offer usage step <b>706</b><i>d</i>, in some examples, the user may specify whether an offer is combinable (e.g., may not be applicable if a credit, coupon, voucher, gift certificate, or other discount is applied to the offer), and/or other terms of validity (e.g., dine in but not takeout, etc.). The personal information step <b>706</b><i>e</i>, in some implementations, provides the user the ability to target a subset of customers based in part upon personal information (e.g., home address region, age group, females, etc.). Turning to the purchase history step <b>706</b><i>f</i>, in some implementations, a user is provided the opportunity to limit an offer to customers based upon purchase history (e.g., customers who have previously made over X dollars in purchases are eligible for the offer, customers who have previously purchased allergy remedies are eligible for the offer, etc.). Finally, at the preview step <b>706</b><i>g</i>, the user may look at a preview of the new offer.</p>
<p id="p-0142" num="0141">At some point during the creation of a new offer (e.g., within the menu steps <b>706</b><i>a </i>through <b>706</b><i>g</i>), the user may suspend work on the new offer. Beneath the new offer menu <b>706</b>, a drafts menu <b>710</b>, when selected, provides the user the opportunity to return to creating a new offer. Upon creation of the new offer, the offer may be added to a set of active offers. Active offers, for example, may be served to users via a loyalty rewards program mobile application, a set of active offers presented via a web site of the entity, or as injection information injected into the print stream as a coupon or reward at the point of sale along with a receipt. An active offers menu <b>708</b>, when selected, may provide the user the opportunity to review, edit, and/or remove existing offers.</p>
<p id="p-0143" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref> are screen shots of example user interfaces for an application configured to present statistical information related to transaction data. The screen shots, in some implementations, illustrate additional functionality of the same loyalty program and transaction data management application illustrated in regard to the screen shot <b>700</b>, described in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0144" num="0143">An analytics interface <b>802</b>, for example, is selected from the loyalty program and transaction data management application, and an offers menu option <b>806</b> is active. Within a main view <b>808</b> of the analytics interface <b>802</b>, a bar graph illustrates relative popularity of offers in relation to the number of times each of the offers has been used by a customer. The bar graph, for example, may have been generated in response to selection of a &#x201c;most popular offers&#x201d; graph option <b>810</b>. For example, the graph option <b>810</b> includes a drop-down menu control for switching the analytic associated with available offers. Other options, in some examples, may include &#x201c;least popular offers&#x201d;, &#x201c;offers most frequently declined by users&#x201d;, and &#x201c;revenue generated per offer.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0145" num="0144">Beneath the graph option <b>810</b>, a timeframe option <b>812</b> of &#x201c;multi-year&#x201d; is illustrated as having been selected. The timeframe option <b>812</b> includes a drop-down menu control for switching between various timeframes. Other options, in some examples, may include &#x201c;past four weeks,&#x201d; &#x201c;one year,&#x201d; and &#x201c;days of the week.&#x201d; Furthermore, although illustrated as a horizontal bar graph (e.g., as presented based upon selection of a horizontal bar graph control <b>818</b>), in some implementations, a user may select a vertical bar graph control <b>814</b> or a vertical three-dimensional bar graph control <b>816</b> to see the data displayed in different formats. Other metrics and graphing formats are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0146" num="0145">In addition to the offers menu option <b>806</b>, additional menu options are available. For example, a dashboard menu option <b>804</b> includes a set of sub-options such as a transactions option <b>804</b><i>a</i>, a products option <b>804</b><i>b</i>, a store locations option <b>804</b><i>c</i>, an employees option <b>804</b><i>d</i>, and a customers option <b>804</b><i>e</i>. Selection of the dashboard menu option <b>804</b>, in some implementations, triggers the display of a dashboard overview of the operations associated with a particular entity, for example as illustrated in relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0147" num="0146">Turning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, a screen shot <b>820</b> illustrates an example dashboard view within the main view <b>808</b> of the analytics interface <b>802</b>. The dashboard view, for example, illustrates a current snapshot of the status of transactions, revenue, and offer activity for the present day. A user may review the dashboard view to obtain a general understanding of recent activity related to a particular store, a region, or all locations, as selected through a scope menu <b>830</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0147">In a top portion of the main view <b>808</b>, a transaction synopsis region <b>822</b> provides an overview of the number of transactions and a value of the transactions, broken out by hourly time periods. In some implementations, the transactions overview may be referenced in relation to a baseline (e.g., 21-day average, monthly average, annual average on Tuesdays, five year average of the particular day of the week in the particular month, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Beneath the transaction synopsis region <b>822</b>, a top product sales region <b>824</b> identifies the N (e.g., ten) most popular products of the day by number of sales. In other implementations, rather than top product sales (e.g., as less expensive items may be purchased more frequently than more expensive items), a list of top products by revenue may be displayed.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">Next to the top product sales region <b>824</b>, a credits overview region <b>826</b> is displayed above an offers overview region <b>828</b>. The credits illustrated within the credits overview region <b>826</b><i>b</i>, in some implementations, relate to credits obtained through a loyalty rewards program. For example, credits may have been earned by a number of customers throughout the day by accepting offers presented within a loyalty program application. In further examples, customers may have earned credits by redeeming offers presented within email messages, paper reward certificates provided to the customers, text message offers transmitted to customers, or other offer transmissions provided to customers by the retailer, entity, or organization. Conversely, credits previously earned by customers of a loyalty program may have been redeemed throughout the given day to purchase products or services. Additionally, in some implementations, a total number of outstanding (e.g., unredeemed) credits held by a number of members of a customer loyalty rewards program may be listed.</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Turning to the offers overview region <b>828</b>, a list of N (e.g., five) offers is listed, where each offer is associated with a metric (e.g., number of customers who redeemed the offer). A pop-up region <b>832</b> is illustrated above a first offer <b>834</b><i>a</i>. The pop-up region <b>832</b>, in some examples, may be presented in response to selection of the first offer <b>834</b><i>a </i>or a mouse-over or hover of the first offer <b>834</b><i>a</i>. Within the pop-up region <b>832</b>, a more detailed synopsis related to the first offer <b>834</b><i>a </i>is presented. In some examples, the detailed synopsis includes a number of times the first offer was viewed by a customer (e.g., served to a display of a loyalty programs mobile device application executing on the mobile device of a customer, served to a browser-based electronic account of a loyalty rewards program, etc.), a number of times the offer was saved by a customer (e.g., selected to be placed in a &#x201c;saved offers&#x201d; section of a loyalty programs application, such that the customer may return to the saved offer to complete a transaction), a number of times the offer was used by a customer (e.g., to complete a transaction), a total sales value associated with the use of the offer, and a percentage metric identifying the relative frequency a user completed a transaction using a previously saved offer. A user may review the offers overview region <b>828</b>, for example, to gain information regarding successful offers. Information on the actual content of the offer, in some implementations, may be provided upon drilling down lower within the analytics (e.g., through selection of the first offer <b>834</b><i>a</i>, selection of the pop-up window <b>832</b>, or search for the first offer <b>834</b><i>a </i>within the offers menu <b>806</b>).</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Additional regions of analytics information are possible. In some implementations, the dashboard view includes a punch card activity overview, a customer traffic overview (e.g., as related to website visits), and a top revenues by location overview (e.g., for a multi-location entity). Additionally, in other implementations, the information may be presented in different formats (e.g., graphically, textually, etc.) or in a different layout. The present layout and information provided within the dashboard view, in some implementations, may be designated in part through program setup options.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, an implementation of an exemplary cloud computing environment <b>900</b> for collection and manipulation of transaction data is shown and described.
