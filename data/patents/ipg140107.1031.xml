<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/505,697, filed Jul. 8, 2011, the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<?RELAPP description="Other Patent Relations" end="tail"?>
<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to the field of tools and, more particularly, to holders for tools.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Tool holders are known to be useful for workers needing to organize, store or carry a group of tools or transport tools to and from a work site for a specific job. In conventional tool holders and tool bags, tools may be scattered haphazardly in a compartment or an initial placement of the tools will be scattered during transport, so that it may be difficult to quickly locate a specific tool when needed. While conventional tool holders and others of the prior art are useful in some instances, there are still numerous deficiencies and the potential for more useful tool holders and tool holder features.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A tool holder according to the invention includes a main panel having a front side and a plurality of sleeves extending from the front side and forming openings, such that a tool can be received through each opening. The plurality of sleeves can include a first sleeve component forming a plurality of peaks and valleys and a second sleeve component coupled to the first sleeve component at a plurality of coupling points. At least one primary opening can be formed between the main panel and the first sleeve component between adjacent valleys. At least one secondary opening can be formed between the second sleeve component and the first sleeve component between adjacent peaks. The valleys of the first sleeve component can also be coupled to the front side of the main panel.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The tool holder can also include a pocket extending from a lower end of the front side of the main panel. The pocket can include an inner cavity for receiving a tool supported by the plurality of sleeves. The pocket and the plurality of sleeves can be separated vertically by a distance adapted for receiving and storing a tool.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The coupling points of the tool holder can be positioned at or between adjacent peaks of the first sleeve component. The coupling points can also be positioned at the peaks of the first sleeve component. The coupling points can also include at least two points between adjacent peaks of the first sleeve component.</p>
