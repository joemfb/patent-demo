<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An end-point device comprises multiple transceivers via which the end-point device associates with multiple access points simultaneously. The access points may belong to communicatively incompatible packet switched data networks. A backbone network communicatively connects all associated access points. The end-point device receives unique network address of an access point from the access point upon association and sends network addresses of other currently associated access points and first rule information to the access point either upon association or prior to detaching from the access point. One or more of the other currently associated access points may direct above action of the end-point device. The end-point device or one of the other access points generates the first rule information. The access point on identifying detachment of the end-point device from it uses one or more of the network addresses of other currently associated access points to deliver data packets to the end-point device via the backbone network and corresponding access point(s). Any one of the associated access points sends second rule information to another of the associated access points via the backbone network wherein the second rule information comprises information regarding pathway to be used, type of data to be delivered, duration of interaction between the access point and the detached end-point device via the backbone network etc.</p>

<p id="p-0014" num="0013">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various aspects of present invention relate to indirect delivery of data to a destination device via a variety of heterogeneous type of data networks when the destination device is unreachable directly.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">A computer, video game box, laptop, phone, PDA (Personal Digital Assistant) and many other types of terminals may be connected to a packet switched data network via an access point. The packet switched data network may be, for example, an EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution) network, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) network, CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) network, IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) 802.11 network, Bluetooth, WiMax network, Internet, Intranet, satellite network, etc. The data packets typically comprise one or combination of real time and/or archived multimedia information such as text, audio, video, picture, and control signal.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The terminal may be associated with more than one access points that belong to the same packet switched data network. Alternately or in addition the terminal may be associated with more than one access points that belong to different packet switched data networks which are communicatively incompatible with each other. The different packet switched communicatively compatible and/or incompatible data networks are communicatively coupled to each other via a backbone network. The terminal receives unique network addresses of the access points from each of the access points upon association. The terminal uses the received network addresses to exchange data packets with corresponding access points. For example the terminal may be associated with a first access point that belongs to an EDGE network, a second access point that belongs to a GSM network and a third access point that belongs to an IEEE 802.11 network. The terminal receives a first network address of the first access point from the first access point upon association with the first access point. The terminal uses the first network address to send data packets to the first access point. Similarly the terminal receives a second network address and a third network address corresponding to the second access point and the third access point respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The terminal may get detached from any of the associated access points at an instant of time. For example the terminal detaches from the first access point that belongs to the EDGE network at the instant of time. Detachment may typically happen if the terminal moves away from service area of the first access point and/or communication link between the first access point and the terminal does not support desired QOS for delivery of the data packets to the terminal at the instant of time. The terminal is henceforth unable to send and/or receive data packets from the first access point. Since the first access point is point of contact between the terminal and the EDGE network, the terminal is henceforth unable to communicate with any node or terminal belonging to the EDGE network.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Further limitations and disadvantages of conventional and traditional approaches will become apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art through comparison of such systems with various aspects of the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">An access point that interacts with a second access point via an upstream backbone network and a variety of heterogeneous type of data networks to deliver data to a downstream destination device when the access point is unable to deliver the data directly to the downstream destination device, substantially as shown in and/or described in connection with at least one of the figures, as set forth more completely in the claims. These and other advantages, aspects and novel features of the present invention, as well as details of illustrative aspects thereof, will be more fully understood from the following description and drawings.</p>

<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic block diagram illustrating an end-point device <b>171</b> in a communication infrastructure <b>100</b> comprising a plurality of access points, <b>141</b>, <b>143</b>, <b>145</b> and <b>147</b>, a few of the plurality of access points, <b>141</b> and <b>147</b> having information necessary for indirect interaction with the end-point device <b>171</b> via a backbone network <b>103</b> in addition to direct interaction with the end-point device <b>171</b>. The EPD (end-point device) <b>171</b> is associated with a first AP (access point) <b>141</b> and a fourth AP <b>147</b>. Association refers to the EPD <b>171</b> and a corresponding AP (i.e., any of the plurality of access points <b>141</b>, <b>143</b>, <b>145</b> and <b>147</b>) exchanging respective network addresses and agreeing to exchange data henceforth using the exchanged network addresses. The EPD <b>171</b> receives a first AP address <b>181</b> from the first AP <b>141</b> when it associates with the first AP <b>141</b>. The first AP <b>141</b> is uniquely identified in the communication infrastructure by the first AP address <b>181</b>. The EPD <b>171</b> in addition receives a fourth AP address <b>183</b> that uniquely identifies the fourth AP <b>147</b> in the communication infrastructure, from the fourth AP <b>147</b> when it associates with the fourth AP <b>147</b>. The EPD <b>171</b> sends the first AP address <b>181</b> and the fourth AP address <b>183</b> to the fourth AP <b>147</b> and the first AP <b>141</b> upon association with the fourth AP <b>147</b> and the first AP <b>141</b> respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Each of the plurality of access points, <b>141</b>, <b>143</b>, <b>145</b>, and <b>147</b> are transceivers. Each of them is adapted to communicate with at least one downstream EPD and an upstream data network. The upstream data network may be a circuit switched data network or a packet switched data network. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> the first AP <b>141</b> interacts with the EPD <b>171</b> and an upstream terrestrial cellular network <b>121</b> that typically is for example, and without limitation, a GSM network, GPRS network, CDMA network, WCDMA network, or EDGE network. A second AP <b>143</b> communicates with an upstream wireless data network <b>123</b> that typically is for example, and without limitation, an IEEE 802.11 network, Bluetooth network or IEEE 802.16 network. A third AP <b>145</b> from the plurality of APs belongs to a satellite data network <b>125</b>, i.e., data flowing between an EPD with which the third AP <b>145</b> is associated and the satellite data network <b>125</b> passes through the third AP <b>145</b>. The fourth AP <b>147</b> communicates with an upstream wired data network <b>127</b> that is a cable data network, fiber optic data network etc.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A first service provider maintains the terrestrial cellular network <b>121</b> and the wireless data network <b>123</b>. A second service provider maintains the satellite data network and the wired data network <b>127</b>. In another embodiment a single service provider maintains all the four data networks <b>121</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>125</b>, and <b>127</b>. In yet another embodiment four data networks <b>121</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>125</b>, and <b>127</b> are maintained by four different service providers. Each of the four data networks <b>121</b>, <b>123</b>, <b>125</b> and <b>127</b> are communicatively coupled to the upstream backbone network <b>103</b> via respective service provider backbone infrastructure. &#x201c;Downstream EPD&#x201d; refers to an EPD that is located away from the backbone network <b>103</b> relative to an AP. &#x201c;Upstream node&#x201d; or &#x201c;upstream network&#x201d; refers to a node or a network that is located nearer to the backbone network <b>103</b> relative to an AP. There exist pathways between the plurality of APs, <b>141</b>, <b>143</b>, <b>145</b> and <b>147</b> via the upstream backbone network <b>103</b>. However out of the plurality of APs, <b>141</b>, <b>143</b>, <b>145</b> and <b>147</b>, the first AP <b>141</b> and the fourth AP <b>147</b> are able to send data to each other using each other's network addresses (i.e., <b>181</b> and <b>183</b>), that has been delivered to first AP <b>141</b> and the fourth AP <b>147</b> by the EPD <b>171</b>, via the backbone network <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The EPD <b>171</b> is adapted to handle packet data transmission and reception. Typical example of an EPD is a phone, PDA, television, PC, laptop, video game box, server etc. The EPD <b>171</b> comprises a first wireless network interface (not shown here) via which the EPD <b>171</b> communicates with the first AP <b>141</b> and a second wired network interface (not shown here) via which the EPD <b>171</b> communicates with the fourth AP <b>147</b>. Each of the plurality of APs <b>141</b>, <b>143</b>, <b>145</b> and <b>147</b> operates pursuant to four communicatively incompatible protocols. The EPD <b>171</b> exchanges data with the first AP <b>141</b> and the fourth AP <b>147</b> using a first protocol and a fourth protocol respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The EPD <b>171</b> at an instance of time decides to disassociate from the first AP <b>141</b>. The EPD <b>171</b> sends detachment notice and rule information to the first AP <b>141</b>. The rule information comprises a rule for use of the fourth AP address <b>183</b> by the first AP <b>141</b>. The first AP <b>141</b> in response to the detachment notice sends subsequent data packets (or units) destined for the EPD <b>171</b> to the fourth AP <b>147</b> via the backbone network <b>103</b> using the fourth AP address <b>183</b> in accordance with the rule information. The data packets (or units) may be generated by the first AP <b>141</b> or may have come to the first AP <b>141</b> from the upstream terrestrial cellular network <b>121</b>. The first AP <b>141</b> being aware of unavailability of downstream direct path to the EPD <b>171</b> encapsulates the data packets (or units) with the fourth AP address <b>183</b> and sends them to the upstream terrestrial cellular network <b>121</b>. The encapsulated data packets reach the fourth AP <b>147</b> via first SP (service provider) backbone infrastructure <b>111</b>, the backbone network <b>103</b>, the second SP (service provider) backbone infrastructure <b>113</b>, and the wired data network <b>127</b>. The fourth AP <b>147</b> determines that the data packets (or units) are destined for the EPD <b>171</b> and subsequently sends the data packets to the downstream EPD <b>171</b> via downstream direct communication link (which is a wired link) to the EPD <b>171</b> and using the fourth protocol. The EPD <b>171</b>, in spite of being detached from the first AP <b>141</b>, receives data packets from the first AP <b>141</b> via the fourth AP <b>147</b> and its second wired network interface (not shown here). The EPD <b>171</b> detaches from the first AP <b>141</b> typically when the EPD <b>171</b> moves away from service area of the first AP <b>141</b>, the EPD <b>171</b> decides to put its first communication I/F (interface) to &#x201c;sleep mode&#x201d;, QOS provided by the operative communication link between the EPD <b>171</b> and the first AP <b>141</b> (which is a wireless link) goes below acceptable level etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In a second embodiment the EPD <b>171</b> sends the rule information to the first AP <b>141</b> along with the fourth AP address <b>183</b>. The rule information may further comprise a request for storing data packets in the first AP <b>141</b> and sending only network parameters to the EPD <b>171</b> via the backbone network <b>103</b> and the fourth AP <b>147</b> until the EPD <b>171</b> re-associates with the first AP <b>141</b>. The first AP <b>141</b>, in response to the detachment notice, uses the rule information and sends the network parameters to the EPD <b>171</b> via the fourth AP <b>147</b> using the fourth AP address <b>183</b> and stores the data packets destined for the EPD <b>171</b> in a memory of the first AP <b>141</b> until the EPD <b>171</b> re-associates with the first AP <b>141</b>. The network parameters may typically include current traffic load on the first AP <b>141</b>, current delay in the terrestrial cellular network <b>141</b>, volume of data awaiting dispatch to the EPD <b>171</b>, control signals necessary for re-association of the EPD <b>171</b> with the first AP <b>141</b> etc. The rule information may further comprise frequency at which the network parameters are to be sent to the EPD <b>171</b> via the fourth AP <b>147</b> until the EPD <b>171</b> re-associates with the first AP <b>141</b>. The first AP <b>141</b> may be associated with one or more EPDs (not shown here) simultaneously. The first AP <b>141</b> sends the data packets destined for the EPD <b>171</b> directly to the EPD <b>171</b> via the downstream wireless link after the EPD <b>171</b> re-associates with the first AP <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In a third embodiment the EPD <b>171</b> is not adapted to send the fourth AP address <b>183</b> to the first AP <b>141</b> when the EPD <b>171</b> associates with the first AP <b>141</b> for first time. The rule information in such case comprises the fourth AP address <b>183</b> in addition to comprising the rule for use of the fourth AP address <b>183</b> by the first AP <b>141</b>. The EPD <b>171</b> in the third embodiment is adapted to send the rule information to the first AP <b>141</b> at any time after association for the first time and prior to disassociation. The rule information thus need not accompany the detachment notice to the first AP <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In a fourth embodiment, the EPD <b>171</b> disassociates from the first AP <b>141</b> without informing the first AP <b>141</b> about the detachment. Such situation arises typically when the communication link between the EPD <b>171</b> and the first AP <b>141</b> fails abruptly or the EPD <b>171</b> is not adapted to send a detachment notice to the first AP <b>141</b> prior to detaching from the first AP <b>141</b>. In the fourth embodiment, the first AP <b>141</b> learns that the EPD <b>171</b> is out of its reach when the first AP <b>141</b> fails to exchange data packets with the EPD <b>171</b> via the downstream wireless link. The first AP <b>141</b> subsequently retrieves network addresses of other APs with which the EPD <b>171</b> is associated from a memory of the first AP <b>141</b>. The first AP <b>141</b> finds the fourth AP address <b>183</b> stored in the memory of the first AP <b>141</b>. The first AP <b>141</b>, instead of sending the data packets destined for the EPD <b>171</b> to the EPD <b>171</b> via the wireless link between the EPD <b>171</b> and the first AP <b>141</b>, encapsulates the data packets with the fourth AP address <b>183</b> and delivers the encapsulated data packets to the fourth AP <b>147</b> via the upstream terrestrial cellular network <b>121</b> and the backbone network <b>103</b>. The fourth AP <b>147</b> subsequently forwards the data packets to the EPD <b>171</b>. The data packets travel from the first AP <b>141</b> to destination, i.e., the EPD <b>171</b> via an upstream pathway that comprises the backbone network <b>103</b> and the fourth AP <b>147</b>. In the fourth embodiment the first AP <b>141</b> decides use of the fourth AP address <b>183</b> after the EPD <b>171</b> disassociates from the first AP <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The first AP <b>141</b> may have a plurality of network addresses of other APs to which the EPD <b>171</b> is currently associated stored in the memory of the first AP <b>141</b>. The first AP <b>141</b>, if adapted to work in multicast mode, chooses to send the data packets destined for the EPD <b>171</b> to all the other APs using respective network addresses when the EPD <b>171</b> detaches from the first AP <b>141</b>. The first AP <b>141</b>, if adapted to operate in unicast mode, sends the data packets to a first AP from the other APs via the backbone network <b>103</b>. If the data packets fail to reach the EPD <b>171</b> then the first AP <b>141</b> sends the data packets again to a second AP from the other APs. The EPD <b>171</b> updates the first AP <b>141</b> about network addresses of the other APs to which the EPD <b>171</b> is currently associated as long as the EPD <b>171</b> remains associated with the first AP <b>141</b>. In the fourth embodiment the first AP <b>141</b> decides use of the plurality of network addresses of other APs once the EPD <b>171</b> disassociates from the first AP <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In a variant of the fourth embodiment the EPD <b>171</b> sends the rule information to the first AP <b>141</b> when the EPD <b>171</b> associates with the first AP <b>141</b> for the first time. The first AP <b>141</b> performs action(s) in accordance with the rule information after the EPD <b>171</b> detaches from the first AP <b>141</b>. In other words the EPD <b>171</b> directs what the first AP <b>141</b> will do when the EPD <b>171</b> disassociates from the first AP <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The rule information is different for different situations. For example and without limitation, the rule information leads the first AP <b>141</b> to request the EPD <b>171</b> for network addresses of other APs with which the EPD <b>171</b> is currently associated when the EPD <b>171</b> gracefully disassociates from the first AP <b>141</b> by informing the first AP <b>141</b> about intended detachment. The rule information leads the first AP <b>141</b> to retrieve the network addresses of the other APs from the memory of the first AP <b>141</b> and/or to request an upstream node for the network addresses of the other APs when the EPD <b>171</b> unexpectedly disassociates from the first AP <b>141</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In a fifth embodiment, the EPD <b>171</b> makes a non-graceful detachment from the first AP <b>141</b>. Subsequently the EPD <b>171</b> sends the rule information to the first AP <b>141</b> via the fourth AP <b>147</b> and the backbone network <b>103</b>. The rule information tells the first AP <b>141</b> to which other AP the first AP <b>141</b> is to send the data packets destined for the EPD <b>171</b>. The rule information may in addition include a time duration for which the first AP <b>141</b> is to continue sending the data packets via the other AP. The rule information may comprise network addresses of a plurality of APs to which the EPD <b>171</b> is currently associated and a plurality of network parameters. The first AP <b>141</b> is adapted to use the plurality of network parameters to select one AP from the plurality of APs and send the data packets destined for the EPD <b>171</b> to the selected AP via the backbone network <b>103</b> henceforth. For example and without limitation the EPD <b>171</b> non-gracefully disassociates from the first AP <b>141</b> and subsequently associates with the second AP <b>143</b>. The EPD <b>171</b> sends the rule information to the first AP <b>141</b> via the second AP <b>143</b>. The rule information in this example comprises network address of the second AP <b>143</b> and the rule of using the network address of the second AP <b>143</b>. The first AP <b>141</b>, in response to the rule information received via the upstream backbone network <b>103</b>, sends the data packets destined for the EPD <b>171</b> to the second AP <b>143</b> via the upstream backbone network <b>103</b> using the received network address of the second AP <b>143</b>. The EPD <b>171</b> that receives the data packets from the first AP <b>141</b> using the first protocol when the EPD <b>171</b> is associated with the first AP <b>141</b> receives the data packets from the second AP <b>143</b> using a second protocol. The first protocol and the second protocol are communicatively incompatible.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In a sixth embodiment, the EPD <b>171</b> has a single communication I/F. The EPD <b>171</b> is associated with the first AP <b>141</b> via the single communication I/F. The EPD <b>171</b> moves to new location that is not serviced by the first AP <b>141</b> and gets detached from the first AP <b>141</b>. The EPD <b>171</b>, as an example, associates with the third AP <b>145</b> via the single communication I/F. A communication I/F is a combination of one or more of a software and hardware. The EPD <b>171</b> sends the rule information to the first AP <b>141</b> via the third AP <b>145</b>. The rule information typically comprises network address of the third AP <b>145</b>. The data packets destined for the EPD <b>171</b> comprise archived and/or real time multimedia information, for example, a television program, music video, picture, movie, video game, file, photo etc.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In a seventh embodiment the first AP <b>141</b> initiates detachment from the EPD <b>171</b>. Such a situation may typically arise when QOS on the operative communication link between the EPD <b>171</b> and the first AP <b>141</b> goes below acceptable level, traffic load on the first AP <b>141</b> exceeds a permissible limit and the first AP <b>141</b> decides to service other node(s) instead of servicing the EPD <b>171</b>, the EPD <b>171</b> remains in the &#x201c;sleep mode&#x201d; for a prolonged period of time. The first AP <b>141</b> retrieves the fourth AP address <b>183</b> from the memory of the first AP <b>141</b> and subsequently sends the rule information to the fourth AP <b>147</b> via the backbone network <b>103</b>. The rule information comprises an identifier and a command directing the fourth AP <b>147</b> to forward all data encapsulated with the identifier to the EPD <b>171</b>. The first AP <b>141</b> subsequently encapsulates the data packets destined for the EPD <b>171</b> with the identifier and sends the encapsulated data packets to the fourth AP <b>147</b> via the backbone network <b>103</b>. The fourth AP <b>147</b> in accordance with the rule information (i.e., the command) forwards the data packets encapsulated with the identifier to the EPD <b>171</b>. The EPD <b>171</b> in spite of being disassociated with the first AP <b>141</b> receives the data packets from the first AP <b>141</b> via the second AP <b>147</b>. In the seventh embodiment the first AP <b>141</b> is originator of the rule information. The rule information in this case flows from the first AP <b>141</b> to the second AP <b>147</b> via the upstream backbone network <b>103</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The first AP <b>141</b> receives the fourth AP network address <b>183</b> from the EPD <b>171</b> directly via the operative communication link between the EPD <b>171</b> and the first AP <b>141</b> or via the upstream backbone network <b>103</b>. The rule information, if generated by the EPD <b>171</b> and destined for the first AP <b>141</b> reaches the first AP <b>141</b> either via the operative communication link or via the upstream backbone network <b>103</b>. The rule information generated by the first AP <b>141</b> and destined for the fourth AP <b>147</b> reaches the fourth AP <b>147</b> via the upstream backbone network <b>103</b>. The first AP <b>141</b> may alternately select to send the rule information to the fourth AP <b>147</b> via the EPD <b>171</b> when the EPD <b>171</b> is associated with the first AP <b>141</b>. The rule information generated by the first AP <b>141</b> in yet another embodiment comprises an instruction for the EPD <b>171</b> asking the EPD <b>171</b> to receive data packets from the fourth AP <b>147</b> after detaching from the first AP <b>141</b> thereby ensuring that the data packets destined for the EPD <b>171</b> that the first AP <b>141</b> will send to the fourth AP <b>147</b> after detachment of the EPD <b>171</b> from the first AP <b>141</b> reaches the EPD <b>171</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic that shows interaction of a mobile end-point device <b>251</b> with an access point <b>211</b> even after the mobile end-point device <b>251</b> moves out of coverage area of the access point <b>211</b>. The access point (AP) <b>211</b>, designated as a first AP, a second AP <b>215</b> and a third AP <b>219</b> are communicatively coupled to each other via an upstream backbone network <b>203</b>. The first AP <b>211</b> covers a first region <b>261</b>, the second AP <b>215</b> covers a second region <b>271</b>, and the third AP <b>219</b> covers a third region <b>281</b>. Different service providers maintain the first AP <b>211</b>, the second AP <b>215</b>, and the third AP <b>219</b>. In another embodiment the first AP <b>211</b>, the second AP <b>215</b> and the third AP <b>219</b> belong to same service provider network. The first AP <b>211</b>, the second AP <b>215</b> and the third AP <b>219</b> use a first protocol, a second protocol and a third protocol to communicate with the upstream backbone network <b>203</b>. Each of three APs, <b>211</b>, <b>215</b> and <b>219</b> are adapted to communicate with more than one downstream end-point device (EPD) simultaneously. The three APs <b>211</b>, <b>215</b> and <b>219</b> exchange data with downstream EPD(s) using the first protocol, the second protocol, and the third protocol respectively. The first protocol, the second protocol and the third protocol are either circuit switched data communication protocol or packet switched data communication protocol. In yet another embodiment the first protocol, the second protocol and the third protocol are communicatively compatible with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">An EPD <b>251</b> is at a location &#x201c;A&#x201d; at a given instant of time. The mobile EPD <b>251</b> is typically, for example and without limitation, a client device such as a laptop, PDA, phone etc. The location &#x201c;A&#x201d; is serviced both by the first AP <b>211</b> and the second AP <b>215</b>. The EPD <b>251</b> has two communication interfaces (I/F). The EPD <b>251</b> associates with the first AP <b>211</b> via a first of the two communication I/Fs and associates with the second AP <b>215</b> via a second of the two communication I/Fs. The EPD <b>251</b> receives a network address of the first AP <b>211</b> from the first AP upon association. The EPD <b>251</b> sends the network address of the first AP <b>211</b> to the second AP <b>215</b>. The second AP <b>215</b> stores the network address of the first AP <b>211</b> in a local storage system <b>217</b>. Similarly the first AP <b>211</b> gets network address of the second AP <b>215</b> from the EPD <b>251</b> and stores it in a local storage system <b>213</b>. The EPD <b>251</b> in addition sends first rule information to the first AP <b>211</b> and second rule information to the second AP <b>215</b>. The first rule information comprises a rule for use of the network address of the second AP <b>215</b> by the first AP <b>211</b>. Similarly the second rule information comprises a rule for use of the network address of the first AP <b>211</b> by the second AP <b>215</b>. The first AP <b>411</b> and the second AP <b>215</b> store the first rule information and the second rule information respectively in their respective local storage systems <b>213</b> and <b>217</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">At a second instant of time the EPD <b>251</b> moves to a location &#x201c;B.&#x201d; The location &#x201c;B&#x201d; is serviced only by the second AP <b>215</b>. The EPD <b>251</b> gracefully disassociates from the first AP <b>211</b> as the EPD <b>251</b> moves from the location &#x201c;A&#x201d; to the location &#x201c;B&#x201d; while remains associated with the second AP <b>215</b>. The EPD <b>251</b> no longer exchanges data with the first AP <b>211</b> via the first communication I/F and using the first protocol, while continues to exchange data with the second AP <b>215</b> via the second communication I/F and using the second protocol. The EPD <b>251</b> sends detachment notice to the first AP <b>211</b> (or any of the three APs <b>211</b>, <b>215</b> and <b>217</b>) when the EPD <b>251</b> gracefully disassociates from the first AP <b>211</b> (or any of the three APs <b>211</b>, <b>215</b> and <b>217</b>). In response to the detachment notice the first AP <b>411</b> uses the first rule information as long as the EPD <b>251</b> remains detached (i.e., disassociated) from the first AP <b>211</b>. The first rule information tells the first AP <b>211</b> to send any data destined for the EPD <b>251</b> via the upstream backbone network <b>203</b> and using the network address of the second AP <b>215</b>. The first rule information further tells the first AP <b>211</b> to selectively send the data to the EPD <b>251</b> via the upstream backbone network <b>203</b>. For example, the first AP <b>211</b> may be guided by the first rule information to send only high priority data such as protocol parameters to the EPD <b>251</b> via the upstream backbone network <b>203</b> as long as the EPD <b>251</b> remains detached from the first AP <b>211</b>. The first AP <b>211</b> encapsulates the protocol parameters with the network address of the second AP <b>215</b> in accordance with the first rule information and transmits the encapsulated protocol parameters to the upstream backbone network <b>203</b> using the first protocol. The first AP <b>211</b> attaches an identifier corresponding to the EPD <b>251</b> with the encapsulated protocol parameters. The upstream backbone network <b>203</b> forwards the encapsulated protocol parameters to the second AP <b>215</b> using the second protocol. The second AP <b>215</b>, using the identifier, determines that the encapsulated protocol parameters coming from the upstream backbone network <b>203</b> are destined for the EPD <b>251</b>. The second AP <b>215</b> subsequently sends the received protocol parameters to the EPD <b>251</b>. The EPD <b>251</b> that receives data from the first AP <b>211</b> via its first communication I/F while at the location &#x201c;A&#x201d;, receives data (in this example the protocol parameters) from the first AP <b>211</b> via the second AP <b>215</b> and its second communication I/F while at the location &#x201c;B&#x201d;. The protocol parameters may typically comprise information corresponding to the first protocol that the EPD <b>251</b> uses when it re-associates with the first AP <b>211</b> at a later instant of time. The EPD <b>251</b> receives data from the second AP <b>215</b> via the second communication I/F while at the location &#x201c;A&#x201d; and also at the location &#x201c;B&#x201d;. The first communication I/F of the EPD <b>251</b> operates pursuant to the first protocol and the second communication I/F of the EPD <b>251</b> operates pursuant to the second protocol. In another embodiment, the EPD <b>251</b> sends the first rule information to the first AP <b>211</b> along with the detachment notice instead of sending the first rule information to the first AP <b>211</b> upon association with the first AP <b>211</b> for first time.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">At a third instant of time the EPD <b>251</b> moves to a location &#x201c;C.&#x201d; The location &#x201c;C&#x201d; is covered only by the third AP <b>219</b>. The EPD <b>251</b> associates with the third AP <b>219</b> via its second communication I/F and exchanges data with the third AP <b>219</b> using the third protocol. The second communication I/F are adapted to operate pursuant to the third protocol also. The EPD <b>251</b> disassociates from the second AP <b>215</b> as the second AP <b>215</b> does not cover the location &#x201c;C.&#x201d; The second AP <b>215</b> and the third AP <b>219</b> do not have a common coverage area. The second rule of information comprises the rule for use of the network address of the first AP <b>211</b> by the second AP <b>215</b>. The EPD <b>251</b>, even if adapted to undergo graceful detachment, in unable to tell the second AP <b>215</b> beforehand where the second AP <b>215</b> should send the data packets destined for the EPD <b>251</b> after the EPD <b>251</b> moves to a location covered by neither by the first AP <b>211</b> and nor by the second AP <b>215</b>. The EPD <b>251</b> upon association with the third AP <b>219</b> receives network address of the third AP from the third AP <b>219</b>. The EPD <b>251</b> while at location &#x201c;C&#x201d; desires to receive data from the first AP <b>211</b> and the second AP <b>215</b> even though the EPD <b>251</b> is out of range of the first AP <b>211</b> and the second AP <b>215</b>. The EPD <b>251</b> sends the network address of the third AP to the first AP <b>211</b> and the second AP <b>215</b> via the third AP <b>219</b> and the upstream backbone network <b>203</b>. The EPD <b>251</b> in addition sends third rule information to each of the first AP <b>211</b> and the second AP <b>215</b> via the third AP <b>219</b> and the backbone network <b>203</b>. The third rule information comprises a rule for use of the network address of the third AP by the first AP <b>211</b> and the second AP <b>215</b>. The first AP <b>211</b> being guided by the third rule information subsequently encapsulates a first data destined for the EPD <b>251</b> with the network address of the third AP <b>219</b> and sends the encapsulated first data to the upstream backbone network <b>203</b> using the first protocol. The encapsulated first data, by virtue of the network address of the third AP attached to it, gets routed by the backbone network <b>203</b> to the third AP <b>219</b>. The third AP <b>219</b> sends the first data to the EPD <b>251</b> using the third protocol. The first data sent by the first AP <b>211</b> reaches the EPD <b>251</b> after traveling along an upstream pathway that runs through the backbone network <b>203</b> and a plurality of heterogeneous data networks (not shown here). The second AP <b>215</b> encapsulates a second data destined for the EPD <b>251</b> with the network address of the third AP and sends the encapsulated second data to the upstream backbone network <b>203</b> using the second protocol. The second data ultimately reaches the EPD <b>251</b> after traveling along another upstream pathway that runs through the backbone network <b>203</b> and the third AP <b>219</b>. The EPD <b>251</b> receives the second data via its second communication I/F that operates pursuant to the third protocol as long as the EPD <b>251</b> remains associated with the third AP <b>219</b>. The EPD <b>251</b> in spite of being detached from the first AP <b>211</b> and the second AP <b>215</b> continues to receive data from the first AP <b>211</b> and the second AP <b>215</b> via the third AP <b>219</b>. In another embodiment the third rule information comprises a request for receiving network parameters associated with the first AP <b>211</b> and the second AP <b>215</b>. The first AP <b>211</b> in response to the third rule information sends a first plurality of network parameters associated with the first AP <b>211</b> to the EPD <b>251</b> via the upstream backbone network <b>203</b> as long as the EPD <b>251</b> remains disassociated from the first AP <b>211</b>. The second AP <b>215</b> similarly sends a second plurality of network parameters associated with the second AP <b>215</b> to the EPD <b>251</b> via the backbone network <b>203</b>. The first plurality of network parameters and the second plurality of network parameters comprise one or more of delay, traffic load, interference level etc. in the network(s) managed by the first AP <b>211</b> and the second AP <b>215</b>, protocol related parameters, for example and without limitation, version number of protocol, maximum supported data rate, bandwidth requirement, encryption requirement etc. The third rule information in addition comprises frequency parameter that defines how frequently the first data, the second data, the first plurality of network parameters and the second plurality of network parameters are to be sent to the EPD <b>251</b> via the upstream backbone network <b>203</b> and the third AP <b>219</b>, priority rules that define type of data that is to be given higher priority while sending via the upstream backbone network <b>203</b>, maximum permissible data transfer rate via the backbone network <b>203</b>, an identifier to be used by the first AP <b>211</b> and the second AP <b>215</b> while sending data destined for the EPD <b>251</b> via the upstream backbone network <b>203</b> etc.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">At a fourth instant of time the EPD <b>251</b> moves to the location &#x201c;B.&#x201d; The EPD <b>251</b> disassociates from the third AP <b>219</b> and re-associates with the second AP <b>215</b>. The EPD <b>251</b> starts receiving data from the second AP <b>215</b> directly via the second communication I/F that at the fourth instant of time operates pursuant to the second protocol. The EPD <b>251</b> sends a fourth rule information to the first AP <b>211</b> via the second AP <b>215</b> asking the first AP <b>211</b> to send data to it using the network address of the second AP henceforth. The EPD in addition sends a fifth rule information to the third AP <b>219</b> via the second AP <b>215</b> instructing the third AP <b>219</b> to send data to it using the network address of the second AP henceforth. The EPD <b>251</b> ensures that it receives data from all the three APs <b>211</b>, <b>215</b> and <b>219</b> even though the EPD <b>251</b> is communicatively associated with the second AP <b>215</b> only.</p>

For example and without limitation, the rule directs the first AP <b>211</b> to retrieve network addresses of other APS stored in the local storage system <b>213</b> when the first AP <b>211</b> discovers that the EPD <b>251</b> is out of its range. The EPD <b>251</b> is communicatively associated with at least one of the other APs even when the EPD <b>251</b> is detached from the first AP <b>211</b>. The first AP <b>211</b> sends data destined for the EPD <b>251</b> to the at least one of the other APs using the corresponding network address and via the upstream backbone network <b>203</b> either in a multicast manner or in a unicast manner.

The EPD <b>381</b> is adapted to collect and store a plurality of network parameters <b>385</b> in its memory. The plurality of network parameters <b>385</b> typically comprise current quality of wireless link between the first AP <b>351</b> and the EPD <b>381</b>, current bit rate supported by the wireless link, current traffic load on the first AP <b>351</b> etc. The EPD <b>381</b> measures and/or receives at least some of the plurality of network parameters <b>385</b> from the first AP <b>351</b>.

The first AP <b>351</b> uses the plurality of network parameters <b>385</b> to allow the EPD <b>381</b> to re-associate with the first AP <b>351</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The first AP <b>351</b> subsequently sends data destined for the EPD <b>381</b> to the EPD <b>381</b> via the Internet backbone <b>303</b> and the second AP <b>371</b> using the second AP address <b>353</b>. The first AP <b>351</b> generates the data destined for the EPD <b>381</b> and/or receives the data from the upstream first node <b>313</b>.

The first AP <b>351</b> encapsulates the data with the second AP address <b>353</b> and sends the encapsulated data to the upstream first node <b>313</b> via its upstream communication I/F <b>352</b>.

The EPD (end-point device) <b>431</b> at a first time instant is associated with a first AP (access point) <b>411</b> and a second AP <b>413</b> simultaneously. The first AP <b>411</b> belongs to a first Internet Service Provider (ISP) network <b>405</b> and operates according to a first protocol <b>445</b>. The second AP <b>413</b> belongs to a second ISP network <b>407</b> and operates pursuant to a second protocol <b>459</b> that are communicatively incompatible with the first protocol <b>445</b>. The first ISP network <b>405</b> and the second ISP network <b>407</b> are communicatively coupled to each other via an Internet backbone <b>403</b>. There exists at least one upstream pathway from the first AP <b>411</b> to the second AP <b>413</b> via the Internet backbone <b>403</b>. Each of the first AP <b>411</b> and the second AP <b>413</b> has at least one upstream communication I/F (interface) via which they (i.e., <b>411</b> and <b>413</b>) communicate with their respective ISP networks (i.e., <b>405</b> and <b>407</b>). The first AP <b>411</b> and the second AP <b>413</b> use their respective upstream communication I/Fs (not shown here) to exchange data via the at least one upstream pathway that runs through the Internet backbone <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Each of the first AP <b>411</b> and the second AP <b>413</b> has at least one downstream communication I/F (not shown here) via which they (i.e., <b>411</b> and <b>413</b>) communicate with the downstream EPD <b>431</b>. The first AP <b>411</b> and the second AP <b>413</b> use their respective downstream communication I/Fs to send and receive data from the EPD <b>431</b> when they remain associated with the EPD <b>431</b>. Association of the first AP <b>411</b> with the EPD <b>431</b> refers to the first AP <b>411</b> assigning a first EPD address <b>441</b> to the EPD <b>431</b> and sending a first AP address <b>455</b> to the EPD <b>431</b>. The first AP <b>411</b> and the EPD <b>431</b> exchange data using the first EPD address <b>441</b> and the first AP address <b>455</b>. The first AP address <b>455</b> uniquely identifies the first AP <b>411</b>. Association of the second AP <b>413</b> with the EPD <b>431</b> leads to assignment of a second EPD address <b>453</b> to the EPD <b>431</b> and the EPD <b>431</b> receiving a second AP address <b>443</b> from the second AP <b>413</b>. The second AP address <b>443</b> uniquely identifies the second AP <b>413</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The EPD <b>431</b> upon association with the first AP <b>411</b> sends the first AP address <b>455</b> to other APs to which the EPD <b>431</b> is currently associated. Similarly the EPD <b>431</b> upon association with the second AP <b>413</b> sends the second AP address <b>443</b> to the other APs to which the EPD <b>431</b> is currently associated. At the first instant of time the first AP <b>411</b> has the second AP address <b>443</b> and the second AP <b>413</b> has the first AP address <b>455</b>. Each of the first AP <b>411</b> and the second AP <b>413</b> has respective communication characteristics <b>447</b> and <b>461</b> stored in respective local memories. The communication characteristics <b>447</b> typically comprise first protocol version number, bit rate supported by the first protocol <b>445</b>, power requirement of the first protocol <b>445</b>, current traffic load on the first AP <b>411</b>, current delay in the first ISP network <b>405</b>, current link quality of wired communication link between the EPD <b>431</b> and the first AP <b>411</b> etc. The communication characteristics <b>461</b> typically comprise second protocol version number, bit rate supported by the second protocol <b>459</b>, power requirement of the second protocol <b>459</b>, current traffic load on the second AP <b>413</b>, delay in the second ISP network <b>407</b>, link quality of wireless communication link between the EPD <b>431</b> and the second AP <b>413</b> etc.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The EPD <b>431</b> disassociates from the first AP <b>411</b> at a second instant of time. The de-association occurs because, for example and without limitation, the wired communication link between the EPD <b>431</b> and the first AP <b>411</b> breaks, the EPD <b>431</b> moves to a location where the wired communication link is not available, the first AP <b>411</b> forces disassociation based on the communication characteristics <b>447</b> etc. The first AP <b>411</b> desires to send data to the EPD <b>431</b> at the second instant of time. The data comprises multimedia information such as audio, video game, television program, music video, file, picture etc. In another embodiment the data comprises control signal and network information only. The EPD <b>431</b> needs the network information and the control signal to re-associate with the first AP <b>411</b> at a later instant of time. The first AP <b>411</b> encapsulates the data i.e., one or more combination of the multimedia information, the control signal and the network information with the second AP address <b>443</b> and sends the encapsulated data to the first ISP network <b>405</b> via its upstream communication I/F (not shown here). The encapsulated data in addition contains a destination identifier. The encapsulated data gets routed to the second AP <b>413</b> after traveling via the Internet backbone <b>403</b> and the second ISP network <b>407</b>. The second AP <b>413</b> removes the second AP address <b>443</b> from the encapsulated data and determines from the destination identifier that the data is destined for the EPD <b>431</b>. The second AP <b>413</b> sends the data to the EPD <b>431</b> via its downstream communication I/F (not shown here) and using the second EPD address <b>453</b>. The EPD <b>431</b> thus receives the data from the first AP <b>411</b> even though the EPD <b>431</b> is detached from the first AP <b>411</b> at the second instant of time. The data reaches the EPD <b>431</b> after traveling via two different ISP networks <b>405</b> and <b>407</b>.</p>

Thus the EPD <b>413</b> is adapted to selectively send one AP address to another. The EPD <b>431</b> is in addition adapted to choose when to send one AP address to another.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The EPD <b>431</b> associates with a third AP <b>415</b> at the second instant of time.

The second AP <b>413</b> gets third AP address <b>457</b> and the third AP <b>415</b> gets the second AP address <b>443</b> from the EPD <b>431</b> by way of their association with the EPD <b>431</b>. Alternately the second AP <b>413</b> and the third AP <b>415</b> get each other's unique address from a server of the second ISP network <b>407</b>. The third AP address <b>457</b> flows form the third AP <b>415</b> to the second AP <b>413</b> via the second ISP network <b>407</b>.

The EPD <b>700</b> is adapted to support wired data communication, that is typically a cable data communication, fiber data communication etc. and to support wireless data communication, that is typically communication using Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11, IEEE 802.16, GSM, GPRS, CDMA, WCDMA, cdma200 technologies. The EPD <b>700</b> sends data to and receives data from corresponding APs via the four upstream communication I/Fs <b>751</b>, <b>761</b>, <b>771</b>, and <b>781</b>. The first AP, the second AP, the third AP, and the fourth AP are directly and/or indirectly communicatively coupled to a backbone network. &#x201c;Upstream communication I/Fs&#x201d; refers to communication I/Fs via which the EPD <b>700</b> interacts with four APs (i.e., the first AP, the second AP, the third AP, and the fourth AP) that are located nearer to the backbone network relative to the EPD <b>700</b>.</p>

The EPD <b>700</b> is assigned a network address by an AP upon association with the AP. The EPD <b>700</b> being associated with the four APs (the first AP, the second AP, the third AP and the fourth AP), has four corresponding network addresses, referred here as EPD network addresses <b>721</b>. The EPD <b>700</b> stores the EPD network addresses <b>721</b> in the storage system <b>707</b>.

The EPD <b>700</b> is further adapted to store communication characteristics <b>719</b> in the storage system <b>707</b>. The EPD <b>700</b> selectively measures the communication characteristics <b>719</b> and/or receives the communication characteristics <b>719</b> from the four associated APs. The communication characteristics <b>719</b> typically comprise interference on communication links between the EPD <b>700</b> and the four APs, power requirement of the EPD <b>700</b>, delay in the CSDN and the PSDN with which the EPD <b>700</b> is currently associated, parameters corresponding to protocols that the EPD <b>700</b> uses to communicate with the four APs, etc. The EPD <b>700</b> further receives a plurality of rules <b>723</b> received from the four associated APs and stores the plurality of rules <b>723</b> in the storage system <b>707</b>.</p>

The EPD <b>700</b> keeps the fourth AP informed about its disassociations and new associations. For example the EPD <b>700</b> detaches from the first AP. The EPD <b>700</b> sends a second rule to the fourth AP via the second wireless upstream communication I/F <b>781</b> informing the fourth AP about its detachment from the first AP.

The third rule, in one embodiment, directs the fourth AP to send only data with low bandwidth requirement to the EPD <b>700</b> after detachment. The third rule additionally directs the fourth AP to send network health to the EPD <b>700</b> once in every two minutes. The third rule also prompts the fourth AP to send data to the EPD <b>700</b> for duration of, for example, ten minutes after detachment. The fourth AP sends data, in accordance with the rules for AP(s) <b>725</b>, to the EPD <b>700</b> via the backbone network and using one of the three delivered addresses, <b>709</b>, <b>711</b> and <b>713</b> after the EPD <b>700</b> detaches from the fourth AP. Detachment typically occurs due to the EPD <b>700</b> moving away from service area of the fourth AP, communication link quality between the fourth AP and the EPD <b>700</b> going below accepted level, the EPD <b>700</b> that typically has a limited number of communication I/Fs, choosing to interact with a fifth AP via the second wireless upstream communication I/F <b>781</b> instead of interacting with the fourth AP etc. The EPD <b>700</b> is further adapted to send a fourth rule (that is part of the rules of AP(s) <b>725</b>) to the fourth AP after detachment.

The upstream communication I/F of the first AP <b>805</b> is so called because the first AP <b>805</b> uses this I/F to communicate with node that is located nearer to the Internet backbone <b>831</b> relative to any EPD with which the first AP is associated (not clear from the figure). The downstream communication I/F of the first AP <b>805</b> is so called because the first AP <b>805</b> uses this I/F to communicate with the associated EPD that is located farther from the Internet backbone <b>831</b> relative to the first AP <b>805</b> (not clear from the figure). &#x201c;Upstream&#x201d; and &#x201c;downstream&#x201d; do not refer to direction of flow of data packets.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">At a first instant of time the first AP <b>805</b> is associated with the EPD <b>861</b>. The first AP interacts with the first AP <b>805</b> via its downstream communication I/F. The EPD <b>861</b> is associated with a second AP <b>851</b> simultaneously. The first AP <b>805</b> receives network address of the second AP <b>851</b> from the EPD <b>861</b> via the downstream communication I/F. The first AP <b>805</b> stores the second AP address in local storage system of the first AP <b>805</b>. At a second instant of time the EPD <b>861</b> detaches from the first AP <b>805</b>. At a subsequent instant the first AP <b>805</b> attempts to send a data packet to the EPD <b>861</b> via its downstream communication I/F. Either the first AP <b>805</b> generates the data packet or the first AP <b>805</b> receives the data packet from the upstream first node <b>821</b> via its upstream communication I/F. The first AP <b>805</b> determines that the EPD <b>861</b> is detached if the attempt to send the data packet fails. The first AP <b>805</b> subsequently retrieves the second AP address from its local storage system and encapsulates the data packet with the second AP address. The first AP <b>805</b> sends the encapsulated data packet to the upstream first node <b>821</b> via its upstream communication I/F. The first AP <b>805</b> operates pursuant to a first protocol. The first protocol is any of a variety of proprietary or standard packet switched data communication protocols. The data packet comprises one of multimedia information, control information, network associated parameter, rule information for the EPD <b>861</b> etc.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The second AP <b>851</b> communicates with the EPD <b>861</b> via its downstream communication I/F and in addition communicates with an upstream second node <b>841</b> via its upstream communication I/F. The second node <b>841</b> is part of a second PSDN and is communicatively coupled to the Internet backbone <b>831</b>. The Internet backbone <b>831</b> receives the encapsulated data packet from the first node <b>821</b> and using the second AP address attached with the encapsulated data packet routes the encapsulated data packet to the second node <b>841</b>. The second node <b>841</b> subsequently sends the encapsulated data packet to the second AP <b>851</b> via the upstream communication I/F of the second AP <b>851</b>. The second AP <b>851</b> removes encapsulation from the encapsulated data packet and determines that the data packet is destined for the EPD <b>861</b>. The first AP <b>805</b> appends an identifier to the data packet to help the second AP <b>851</b> to identify destination of the data packet. The second AP <b>851</b> being currently associated with the EPD <b>861</b> sends the data packet to the EPD <b>861</b> via its downstream communication I/F. The second AP <b>851</b> operates pursuant to a second packet switched data communication protocol. The second protocol is communicatively incompatible with the first protocol. The first AP <b>805</b> in this exemplary case delivers the data packet to the EPD <b>861</b> via heterogeneous PSDNs, the first PSDN and the second PSDN, and the Internet backbone <b>831</b> even when the EPD <b>861</b> is detached from the first AP <b>805</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">If more than one communication path exists from the first node <b>821</b> to the second node <b>841</b> via the Internet backbone <b>831</b> then the first PSDN, the Internet backbone <b>831</b> and the second PSDN cooperatively decide which one from existing pathways to be used for carrying the encapsulated data packet from the first node <b>821</b> to the second node <b>841</b>. A unidirectional communication pathway from the first AP <b>805</b> to the second AP <b>851</b> suffices to support packet data flow in this exemplary case.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091"><b>9</b> is a flow chart illustrating the method of delivering the data packet to the end-point device <b>861</b> by the first access point <b>805</b> via the second access point <b>851</b> and the Internet backbone <b>831</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, wherein a third access point <b>961</b> cooperates in delivering the data packet to the end-point device <b>971</b>. The first AP (access point) <b>905</b> desires to send the data packet to the EPD <b>971</b> via its downstream communication I/F at an instant of time. An attempt to send the data packet via its downstream communication I/F fails and the first AP <b>905</b> retrieves network address of the second AP <b>941</b> from local storage system of the first AP <b>905</b>. The first AP <b>905</b> received the second AP network address from the EPD <b>971</b> at a pervious instant of time when the first AP <b>905</b> was communicatively associated with the first AP <b>905</b>. The EPD <b>971</b> was in addition communicatively associated with the second AP <b>941</b> at the pervious instant of time. The first AP <b>905</b> at the instant of time encapsulates the data packet with the retrieved second AP network address and an EPD identifier and sends the encapsulated data packet to the first node <b>911</b> via its upstream communication I/F on the assumption that the EPD <b>971</b> is communicatively associated with the second. AP <b>941</b> at the instant of time. The encapsulated data packet travels via the first node <b>911</b> (i.e., the first PSDN), the Internet backbone <b>921</b>, the second node <b>931</b> (i.e., the second PSDN) and upstream communication I/F of the second AP <b>941</b> to reach the second AP <b>941</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">As a way of example and without limitation the EPD <b>971</b> detaches from the second AP <b>941</b> prior to the instant of time. The second AP <b>941</b> being unable to send the encapsulated data packet received via its upstream communication I/F to the detached EPD <b>971</b> via its downstream communication I/F at the instant of time retrieves network addresses of other APs from local storage system of the second AP <b>941</b>. The other APs refer to APs with which the EPD <b>971</b> was associated simultaneously while being associated with the second AP <b>941</b>. The second AP <b>941</b> selects network address of a third AP <b>961</b> from the stored addresses of the other APs. The second AP <b>941</b> removes the second AP network address from the encapsulated data packet that the second AP <b>941</b> receives from the first AP <b>905</b> via the Internet backbone <b>921</b> and encapsulates the data packet with the third AP network address. The second AP <b>951</b> sends thus encapsulated data packet to the second node <b>931</b> via the upstream communication I/F of the second AP <b>941</b>. The second node <b>931</b>, using the second AP network address accompanying the encapsulated data packet, forwards the encapsulated data packet to the Internet backbone <b>921</b>. The Internet backbone <b>921</b> delivers the encapsulated data packet to the third AP <b>961</b> via a third node <b>951</b>. The third AP <b>961</b> receives the encapsulated data packet via its upstream communication I/F and transmits the encapsulated data packet to the EPD <b>971</b> that is currently associated with the third AP <b>961</b>, via its downstream communication I/F.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">Each of the first AP <b>905</b>, the second AP <b>941</b>, and the third AP <b>961</b> are communicatively coupled to the Internet backbone <b>921</b> via the first node <b>911</b>, the second node <b>931</b>, and the third node <b>951</b> respectively. The first node <b>911</b> and the first AP <b>905</b> belong to the first PSDN (Packet switched data network). The first AP <b>905</b> may be alternately directly coupled to the Internet backbone <b>921</b>. The first PSDN supports packet switched data communication using a first protocol. The first AP <b>905</b> and the first node <b>911</b> operate pursuant to the first protocol. The second AP <b>941</b> and the third AP <b>961</b> belong to the second PSDN and a third PSDN respectively.

The second PSDN and the third PSDN operate pursuant to a second packet switched data communication protocol and a third packet switched data communication protocol respectively. One or combination of the first protocol, the second protocol, and the third protocol is communicatively incompatible with rest of three protocols. The EPD <b>971</b> exchanges data packets with the first AP <b>905</b> using the first protocol. The EPD <b>905</b> being associated with the third AP <b>961</b> at the instant of time receives the encapsulated data packet that originated at the first AP <b>905</b>, from the third AP <b>961</b> using the third protocol.

<p id="p-0095" num="0094"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart illustrating a method of delivery of detachment command to an upstream access point via an upstream pathway by an end-point device, wherein selection of the upstream pathway depends on status of association of the end-point device with the access point. The EPD (end-point device) communicatively associates with the upstream AP (access point) in a block <b>1001</b>. Association refers to the EPD receiving a unique network address of the AP from the AP and the EPD and the AP agreeing to exchange data using a protocol. The protocol is either a packet switched data protocol or a circuit switched data protocol. The EPD is one of, for example, a fixed client device such as a PC, video game box, a moving client device such as a mobile phone, notebook, a portable client device such as a PDA, a server etc. The AP is a transceiver that has at least one downstream radio and at least one upstream radio. The AP exchanges data with the associated EPD via the at least one downstream radio and directly or indirectly interacts with a backbone network via the at least one upstream radio. The AP is typically a fixed terminal that may in addition be portable.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">In the present embodiment the EPD has a plurality of radios and the EPD is adapted to interact with a plurality of APs using the plurality of radios. For example, the EPD is associated with the AP via a first radio from its plurality of radios. The EPD is simultaneously associated with a secondary AP via a second radio from its plurality of radios. The EPD sends network address of the secondary AP to the AP in a next step <b>1011</b>. The EPD sends the network address of the secondary AP either immediately after association with the AP or immediately before detaching from the AP. The EPD, in another embodiment, keeps the AP updated about network addresses of secondary AP(s) with which the EPD is currently associated by sending the network addresses of the secondary AP(s) to the AP at regular intervals.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">The EPD decides to detach from the AP in a next step <b>1021</b>. The EPD sends a detachment command to the AP. The detachment command comprises a plurality of rules that the AP follows after the EPD detaches from the AP until the EPD re-associates with the AP. The plurality of rules directs the AP to use an alternate pathway to communicate with the EPD after detachment i.e., once the EPD is no longer communicable via the downstream communication I/F of the AP. The plurality of rules comprises type of data the AP sends to the EPD via the alternate pathway, how frequently the AP sends the data to the EPD via the alternate pathway etc. In a first variant of the present embodiment the EPD sends the detachment command to the AP prior to detaching from the AP. In such case the EPD executes the step <b>1011</b> and the step <b>1021</b> prior to detachment from the AP and using the first radio of the EPD. The EPD uses direct upstream path to the AP to send the network address of the secondary AP and the detachment command as shown in a next block <b>1031</b>. In a second variant of the present embodiment the EPD executes the step <b>1011</b> prior to detachment while executes the step <b>1021</b> after detachment. In such embodiment the EPD sends the detachment command to the AP via the secondary AP. All APs including the AP and the secondary AP in the present embodiment are communicatively coupled to each other via the backbone network. The detachment command sent to the secondary AP and destined for the AP gets routed by the backbone network and ultimately reaches destination i.e., the AP. In a third variant of the present embodiment the EPD executes the steps <b>1011</b> and <b>1021</b> after detaching from the AP. In the third variant of the present embodiment the EPD uses the second radio to transmit the network address of the secondary AP and the detachment command to the secondary AP. The EPD selects an indirect pathway via the secondary AP and the backbone network to deliver the detachment command to the AP both in the second variant and the third variant of the present embodiment.</p>
