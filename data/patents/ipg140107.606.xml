<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of assembling a z-bar extension member to a z-bar that negates the need for trimming the z-bar. The apparatus includes an exterior z-bar member having an exterior barrel portion and an interior z-bar member having an interior barrel portion. The interior barrel portion is slidably or snappingly engaged within the exterior barrel portion. Mating structures may be included on the cooperating components to maintain a positional relationship therebetween during assembly. A guard assembly that mounts to the edge of a door or on the end of a door expander to cover the gap between the z-bar and the casing is also disclosed that may be used in conjunction with or as an alternative to the z-bar extension member.</p>

<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to doors. More particularly, the present invention relates to z-bar assemblies for doors.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">A door assembly, such as a storm door, often involves the use of what is commonly referred to as a &#x201c;z-bar.&#x201d; The z-bars are typically formed to mount the door assembly to the jambs or exterior trim of the entry door. Normally there are two z-bars in such an installation: a hinge-side z-bar and a latch-side z-bar. There may also be a z-bar extending over the top of the door that serves as or facilitates a drip cap. The hinge-side z-bar is so named because it accommodates hinges for pivotal mounting of the door. The latch-side z-bar is so named because it is located adjacent the latch side of the door and may serve as part of a system to latch the door in a closed position.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Some manufacturers specify a given door assembly to cover a range of door openings. The door is typically equipped with a door expander or spacer that enables adjustment of the length of the door relative to the opening, as well as the adjustment of the orientation of the lower edge of the door to accommodate door sills and/or door casings that may not be true.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">It is often desired that the z-bars extend over the entire length of the storm door or entry door jambs for reasons of aesthetics, connectivity and energy conservation. Accordingly, the z-bars are typically sized to operatively match a maximum or fully expanded length of the door.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the height of door openings will often vary and will often be less than the full length of traditional z-bars, requiring the installer to trim the ends of the z-bars off. Conventional methods and techniques for trimming z-bars are innately inconvenient and time consuming. In addition, many casings feature a sill having an inclined upper surface that sheds water. The trimmed ends of these traditional z-bars are typically cut to accommodate the incline. A trimming cut that either leaves the z-bar too short or at an improper angle relative to the incline is generally detrimental to the aesthetic and energy conservation qualities of the assembly, and increases the installation time of the door assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Some manufacturers supply z-bars that are intentionally shorter than the minimum length of the door so that z-bar does not have to be cut to fit the height of the door frame during installation. Such an approach is disclosed in U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2006/0150524 to Kibbel et al. While this approach negates the need for cutting the z-bar to length, it does not address the aforementioned detriments to aesthetics and energy conservation.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">A z-bar assembly that avoids the problems that can result from shortened z-bars, and augments a more efficient installation procedure would be welcome.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Various embodiments of the invention include a z-bar having an extender for adjusting the length of the overall z-bar assembly. The length of the z-bar is generally undersized, with the extender slidably attached to provide a telescoping adjustment to the overall length of the assembly without need for trimming. The extenders may have substantially the same profile as the z-bar to maintain aesthetic appearance and functionality. The various embodiments may be applicable to both hinge-side and latch-side z-bars.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In one embodiment, a door assembly comprises a door casing or frame including a door jamb and a sill, at least one z-bar member mounted to the casing, and a z-bar extension member or extender mounted to the z-bar member and extending beyond the end of the z-bar member. One end of the z-bar assembly may be factory cut or otherwise formed to accommodate sill incline angles standard in the industry.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, the z-bar assembly includes an exterior z-bar member with an exterior barrel portion, and an interior z-bar extension member with an interior barrel portion. The interior barrel portion of the extension member is slidably engaged within the exterior barrel portion of the z-bar member, enabling the extender to selectively extend beyond the end of the exterior z-bar member.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, the z-bar extension member is made of a resilient material and is mounted on the exterior of the z-bar member by snapping engagement over the barrel portion of the z-bar member.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In another embodiment, the z-bar or z-bar extension member may include one or more score lines extending laterally across the z-bar extension member. The z-bar extension member can be snapped off or otherwise truncated at a selected score line to modify the length of the z-bar extension member. The score lines may also serve as a guide for cutting the z-bar or z-bar extension to a unique length between score lines.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">In other embodiments, the z-bar extension member includes a base portion on one end. The base portion may be formed integrally with the z-bar extension member, and may define an obtuse angle with respect to the z-bar extension member to substantially match the incline angles of sills standard in the industry.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In certain embodiments, the interior and exterior z-bar members are formed with mating structures such as, but not limited to, projections and apertures or detents and grooves that cooperate to at least temporarily maintain the mated structures in a generally linear positional relationship with respect to each other to assist in the installation and adjustment of the assembly. In other embodiments, structures or cut-away portions may define slots for slidable engagement that imparts a friction between the interior and exterior z-bar members, thereby aiding in holding the adjustment of the length of the assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">In some embodiments, the interior z-bar extension member may be sized and configured such that it is under generally constant resistance within the exterior z-bar member, creating friction and restricting, but not prohibiting, movement of the extension member.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An embodiment is also disclosed wherein a guard assembly may be mounted on a vertical edge of the door, the guard assembly having a shield portion that extends at least partially over the z-bar or z-bar assembly. The guard assembly may extend the length of the vertical edge or only a portion thereof to cover at least a corresponding portion of the gap that exists between the vertical edge of the door and the z-bar assembly. The guard assembly may also take the form of an end cap that mounts to and covers an end of the door expander, to retain insulation within the door expander and/or to prevent debris such as dirt and salt from entering the door expander.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref>, a door assembly <b>30</b> including an exterior door <b>32</b>, a door frame or casing <b>34</b> and an extended z-bar assembly <b>36</b> having a z-bar <b>38</b> and a z-bar extension member <b>40</b> is depicted in one embodiment of the invention. The exterior door <b>32</b>, which may be a storm door or a screen door, may include a door expander <b>44</b> and a hinge member <b>46</b>. The door frame or casing <b>34</b> may include an exterior trim or door jamb <b>52</b>, a sill <b>54</b> and a header (not depicted). The sill <b>54</b> may have an inclined upper surface <b>56</b>. The z-bar <b>38</b> may be dimensioned so that a gap <b>57</b> exists between an end of the z-bar <b>38</b> and the sill <b>54</b>. The gap <b>57</b> is bridged by the z-bar extension member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 8</figref>, various embodiments of the extended z-bar assembly are depicted. In one embodiment, the z-bar <b>38</b> includes a flange portion <b>60</b>, a barrel portion <b>62</b>, a web portion <b>64</b> and a projecting portion <b>66</b>. The z-bar <b>38</b> may also be characterized as having an inward-facing surface <b>67</b> (e.g. the surface that generally faces the door jamb <b>52</b>) and an outward-facing surface <b>68</b> (i.e. the surface opposite the inward-facing surface <b>67</b> that generally faces away from the door jamb <b>54</b> to which the z-bar <b>38</b> is mounted).</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">An embodiment of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may include an extender flange portion <b>70</b>, an extender barrel portion <b>72</b>, an extender web portion <b>74</b> and an extender projecting portion <b>76</b>. Not all of these portions are necessary in the construction of a z-bar extension member; some portions may be omitted and still provide effective extension of the z-bar assembly for functional or aesthetic purposes. Like the z-bar <b>38</b>, the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may also be characterized as having an inward-facing surface <b>77</b><i>a </i>and an outward-facing surface <b>77</b><i>b</i>. The z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may be slidably engaged with the z-bar <b>38</b>. Note that some embodiments depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 through 8</figref> do not include the extender flange portion <b>70</b> (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 through 8</figref>). Also, the ends <b>79</b> of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may be substantially square with respect to a longitudinal axis <b>82</b> of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>, an embodiment of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> having ends <b>79</b> that define an oblique angle <b>80</b> relative to the axis <b>82</b> of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> is depicted. The oblique angle <b>80</b> may be provided at just one end of the z-bar extension member, thereby defining a component that accommodates either the hinge side or the latch side of the door assembly <b>30</b> (but not both) without need for cutting an angle. The oblique angle <b>80</b> may also be provided on both ends, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, in which case the same z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may be used on the hinge side or the latch side of the door assembly <b>30</b>. The z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may also include an extender flange projection <b>78</b> that projects outward from the extender flange portion <b>70</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> illustrate the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> as being located inside the z-bar <b>38</b>. The extended z-bar assembly <b>36</b> may also be configured so that at least a portion of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> is positioned over the z-bar <b>38</b>. Also, if the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> is formed of a resilient material, the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> can be flexed and snapped into or over the z-bar <b>38</b>, depending on the configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Also, the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 through 3</figref> illustrate the gap <b>57</b> as existing between the z-bar <b>38</b> and the sill <b>54</b>. In another embodiment, a gap may exist between the z-bar <b>38</b> and the header (not depicted), and the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> installed to bridge therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">Functionally, the z-bar extension member enables the z-bar <b>38</b> to be fabricated with a length that is intentionally shorter than the length of the door jamb <b>52</b>. The barrel portion <b>62</b> of the z-bar <b>38</b> and the extender barrel portion <b>72</b> of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> cooperate to guide the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> in an in-line or telescoping manner along the longitudinal axis <b>82</b> to bridge the gap between the z-bar <b>38</b> and the sill <b>54</b>. The extender flange projection <b>78</b> projects normal to the mounting surface of the door jamb <b>52</b> along the outside edge of the flange portion <b>60</b> and provides an externally accessible means for gripping the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> for positioning during installation of the extended z-bar assembly <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The use of a resilient material for the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> that is mounted over the z-bar <b>38</b> (not depicted) enables installation of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> after the z-bar <b>38</b> has been mounted to the door jamb <b>52</b>. The z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may then be secured in place by means known in the art such as with additional fasteners or with an adhesive.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 through 15</figref>, a variety of other embodiments of the invention are depicted in assembly. The extended z-bar assembly <b>36</b> is attached to the door jamb <b>52</b> of the casing <b>34</b> with fasteners <b>84</b> such as wood screws. The fasteners <b>84</b> may pass through the flange portion <b>60</b> and the web portion <b>64</b> of the extended z-bar assembly <b>36</b> to cover a corner <b>85</b> of the door jamb <b>52</b> that in part defines the exterior opening of the casing <b>34</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The flange portion <b>60</b> may also be formed with a pair of rails <b>87</b> that straddle the fasteners <b>84</b>. A cap strip <b>86</b> may be formed to accommodate the rails <b>87</b> for placement over the heads of the fasteners <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> depict a rib <b>92</b> that projects from the web portion <b>64</b> of the z-bar <b>38</b> toward the door jamb <b>52</b>. The rib <b>92</b> may or may not pass through the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> in final assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">A weather stripping <b>88</b> or other suitable material may be mounted to the face of the projecting portion <b>66</b>. The projecting portion <b>66</b> may be formed with a pair of L-brackets <b>94</b> that define a track <b>96</b> for capturing the base of the weather stripping <b>88</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 15A and 15B</figref>, details of the configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> are depicted. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15A</figref>, the projection portion <b>66</b> is limned as having a projection lip <b>98</b> that is substantially parallel with the projection portion <b>66</b> to define a slot <b>100</b>. The end of the extender projecting portion <b>76</b> is seated within the slot <b>100</b> and captured by the projection lip <b>98</b>. Likewise, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15B</figref> portrays a flange lip <b>102</b> that is substantially parallel with the flange portion <b>60</b> and defines a slot <b>104</b> that captures the edge of the extender flange portion <b>70</b>. The slots <b>100</b> and <b>104</b> may be dimensioned to provide a frictional resistance between the z-bar <b>38</b> and the z-bar extension member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 16 through 18</figref>, another embodiment of the extended z-bar assembly <b>36</b> is illustrated, including a pair of elongate slots <b>108</b> formed on the z-bar extension member <b>40</b>. In the depicted embodiment, one elongate slot <b>108</b> is located near the junction of the extender barrel portion <b>72</b> and the extender web portion <b>74</b>, the other near the junction of the extender projecting portion <b>76</b> and the extender web portion <b>74</b>. The elongate slots <b>108</b> may extend from a proximal end <b>109</b> of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> along a portion of the length of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> to form a tongue portion <b>110</b> of the extender web portion <b>74</b>. The elongate slots <b>108</b> may be substantially parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The weather stripping <b>88</b> can be attached to both the projecting portion <b>66</b> and the extender projecting portion <b>76</b>. The weather stripping may be adhesively attached, or captured by a track or channel such as the track <b>96</b>, or by other means known in the art. The weather stripping <b>88</b> may be pre-installed, running the full length of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b>, and trimmed off when the desired length of the extended z-bar assembly <b>36</b> is established. Alternatively, the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may be assembled without the weather stripping <b>88</b>, and a strip of it provided for trimming and mounting to the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> after the extended z-bar assembly <b>36</b> has been mounted to the door jamb <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In assembly, the extender barrel portion <b>72</b> of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may be inserted into the barrel portion <b>62</b> of the z-bar <b>38</b>. The z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may be formed so that the extender web portion <b>74</b>, and therefore the tongue portion <b>110</b>, overlays an outer face <b>112</b> of the web portion <b>64</b> of the z-bar <b>38</b>. In this configuration, while the extender barrel portion <b>72</b> is engaged with the inward-facing surface <b>77</b><i>a </i>of the barrel portion <b>62</b> of the z-bar <b>38</b>, the tab portion <b>110</b> is engaged with the outward-facing surface <b>77</b><i>b </i>of the web portion <b>64</b> of the z-bar <b>38</b> in an interlacing fashion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 18</figref>). The elongate slots <b>108</b> may be dimensioned to provide a frictional fit between the z-bar <b>38</b> and the z-bar extension member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">The number of elongate slots <b>108</b> is arbitrary, as well as their placement. Consider, for example, a single elongate slot extending parallel to the longitudinal axis <b>82</b>. Such a configuration would enable the extension member <b>40</b> to engage both the inward-facing surface <b>77</b><i>a </i>and the outward-facing surface <b>77</b><i>b </i>of the z-bar. Likewise, more than two elongate slots can also be utilized for interlacing contact between the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> and the z-bar <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 through 22</figref>, various structures for maintaining the lineal relationship between the z-bar <b>38</b> and the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> are illustrated. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> embodiment includes a plurality of mating projections <b>138</b> that extend outward from the extender web portion <b>74</b>. In the embodiment depicted, the mating projections <b>138</b> are in pairs at a given longitudinal location along the longitudinal axis <b>82</b>. The mating projections <b>138</b> of each pair are separated at a lateral spacing <b>139</b>. A plurality of mating apertures <b>140</b> are formed on the web portion <b>64</b> of the z-bar <b>38</b>, also in pairs having a lateral spacing <b>139</b> at a given longitudinal location. The mating projections <b>138</b> are dimensioned to engage with the apertures <b>140</b>. The layout (dimensional spacing) of the mating projections <b>168</b> and the mating apertures <b>140</b> are the same, and the respective pairs can be spaced at equal intervals <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">A similar concept is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. Instead of paired projections and apertures, the web portions <b>64</b> and <b>74</b> can include elongate mating projections <b>142</b> and elongate mating apertures <b>144</b> spaced at uniform intervals <b>145</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">The cross-sectional depiction of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 21</figref> depicts how the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref> can appear after assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">An embodiment of similar concept is portrayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref>. In this embodiment, the extender web portion <b>74</b> is formed with a plurality of detents <b>146</b>, and the web portion <b>64</b> is formed with a plurality of grooves <b>148</b>. The detents <b>146</b> and grooves <b>148</b> can have a uniform spacing <b>150</b> and can be formed to mate or interlock with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">It is noted that the various projections, apertures, detents and notches are not limited to being formed on the components specified in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 through 22</figref>. For example, in the <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref> embodiment, mating projections may be formed on the interior of the web portion <b>64</b> to cooperate with mating apertures formed on the extender web portion <b>74</b>. Also, the detents of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 22</figref> may be utilized in the embodiments of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 and 20</figref>. Furthermore, the positive locking concepts illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 19 through 22</figref> may be incorporated with the sliding tab configuration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 through 16</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In operation, the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may be slid inside the z-bar <b>38</b> until the extended z-bar assembly <b>36</b> is at or near a desired length. Depending on the embodiment utilized, at least a portion of the mating projections <b>138</b>, <b>142</b> or the detents <b>146</b> are then aligned with the nearest corresponding mating apertures <b>140</b>, <b>144</b> or the grooves <b>148</b> and snapped into place. The resolution of the adjustment can be minor fractions of an inch, depending on the spacing of the intervals <b>145</b>, <b>150</b> and the dimension of the mating apertures <b>140</b>, <b>144</b> or grooves <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">For the embodiment that includes the rib <b>92</b>, the rib <b>92</b> serves as a spacer to accommodate the thickness of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b>, thereby augmenting adjustment of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> after the extended z-bar assembly <b>36</b> has been mounted to the door jamb <b>52</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">The slots <b>100</b> and <b>104</b> can serve to secure the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> in slidable engagement with the z-bar <b>38</b> during installation. The slots <b>100</b> and <b>104</b>, if properly dimensioned, also provide a frictional resistance between the z-bar <b>38</b> and z-bar extension member <b>40</b> that temporarily holds the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> in a fixed relationship in line with the z-bar <b>38</b> during the installation process.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The various components of the extended z-bar assembly <b>36</b> may be made of any suitable material such as extruded metal, forged metal, ferrous or non-ferrous metals, or a resilient material such as high density plastic. Extrudable materials include, but are not limited to, aluminum, aluminum alloy and composite resin materials. The z-bar assembly or components thereof may be of a roll formable material, such as aluminum, aluminum alloy or steel.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 23</figref>, another embodiment of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> is depicted wherein the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> further includes a plurality of score lines <b>200</b>. The score lines <b>200</b> may extend laterally across the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> (i.e. across the width of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b>). In some embodiments, score lines <b>200</b> extend across one or more of the flange portion <b>70</b>, the barrel portion <b>72</b>, the web portion <b>74</b>, and the projecting portion <b>76</b> of z-bar extension member <b>40</b>. The score lines <b>200</b> can be formed on one side of z-bar extension member <b>40</b> (e.g. on the inward-facing surface <b>77</b><i>a</i>, as depicted), or alternatively on both sides of z-bar extension member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The score lines <b>200</b> on the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may comprise grooves that extend into the thickness of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b>. In this configuration, the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may be rendered frangible or additionally scored at one of the score lines <b>200</b> for frangible separation. Alternatively, the score lines <b>200</b> may comprise printed guidelines to guide the installer in scoring the z-bar extension member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In operation, the frangible score lines <b>200</b> may enable the length of the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> to be modified by snapping off z-bar extension member <b>40</b> at the desired score line <b>200</b>. In one embodiment, the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may be snapped off by application of a manual force. In another embodiment, additional tools such as clamps or wrenches may be used to assist an installer to snap z-bar extension member to a desired length.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">For z-bar extension members <b>40</b> having the score lines <b>200</b> located only on the inward-facing surface <b>77</b><i>a</i>, the outward-facing surface <b>77</b><i>b </i>may have a smooth finish, which may have desirable aesthetic and maintenance qualities.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">Where guide lines or light score lines are utilized instead of frangible score lines, the installer may cut the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> to any length whether on the guideline or not. The guidelines may provide the installer with sufficient resolution to create a desired cut between the guidelines.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In another embodiment of the invention, the score line concept is applied to the z-bar <b>38</b> (not depicted). That is, a plurality of score lines may be located proximate one or both ends of the z-bar <b>38</b> to enable an installer to readily shorten the z-bar. In this way, the z-bar <b>38</b> may be oversized initially. The scored lines on the z-bar <b>38</b> can be configured in any of the variety of ways discussed in relation to the scored lines <b>200</b> on the z-bar extension member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">During installation, the installer could shorten the scored z-bar <b>38</b> for suitable clearance between the z-bar <b>38</b> and the sill <b>54</b> and /or header. Such clearance, however, may be less than a z-bar manufactured to provide clearance over a variety of door sizes, thus enabling coverage of the clearance gap with a shorter z-bar extension member <b>40</b> (or, in some cases, without need for a z-bar extension member at all). Generally shorter z-bar extension members may provide functional advantages to the door assembly, such as an ability to seal the entire inward-facing surface <b>77</b><i>a </i>with a caulk or sealant to provide a more reliable moisture and/or thermal barrier. The shorter z-bar extension member may also provide aesthetic advantages as well.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">In various embodiments, the length of z-bar extension member <b>40</b> may be modified by additionally scoring and/or cutting the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> using the desired score line <b>200</b> as a guide. Tools may be used to perform this operation, such as a saw, utility knife, hot wire, or other cutting tool. Also, the score lines <b>200</b> may be formed at an obtuse angle relative to the longitudinal axis <b>82</b> to conform to a given sill incline angle after being trimmed (not depicted).</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24 and 24A</figref> through <b>24</b>D, a z-bar assembly <b>230</b> including the z-bar <b>38</b> and a molded z-bar extension member <b>240</b> comprising a moldable material is depicted in an embodiment of the invention. As in the previous embodiments, the molded z-bar extension member <b>240</b> may include an extender flange portion <b>270</b>, an extender barrel portion <b>272</b>, an extender web portion <b>274</b> and an extender projecting portion <b>276</b>. The z-bar extension member <b>240</b> may also be characterized as having an inward-facing surface <b>278</b> and an outward-facing surface <b>280</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">In one embodiment, a base portion <b>284</b> may be attached or integrally formed on one end of the molded z-bar extension member <b>240</b>. For the molded extender <b>240</b>, an integrally formed base <b>284</b> may be effected by the shape of the mold. The base portion <b>284</b> may be generally perpendicular with a longitudinal axis <b>286</b> of the z-bar assembly <b>230</b>. Alternatively, the base <b>284</b> may define an obtuse angle <b>288</b> (i.e. an angle that is greater than 90 degrees), as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 24D</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The extender projecting portion <b>276</b> may include a slot or channel portion <b>290</b> and a deflecting portion <b>292</b>. The channel portion <b>290</b> and the deflecting portion <b>292</b> may be connected through a flexure or hinge portion <b>294</b> such as a living hinge. The base portion <b>284</b> may be formed with an aperture <b>296</b> immediately adjacent the deflecting portion <b>292</b>. In this way, the deflecting portion <b>292</b> is not directly connected to the base portion <b>284</b>, thus enabling the deflecting portion <b>292</b> to rotate about the hinge portion <b>294</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The extender flange portion <b>270</b> may include a pocket structure <b>300</b> sized to accommodate the flange portion <b>60</b>, rails <b>87</b> and cap strip <b>86</b> of an embodiment such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. In cross section, the pocket structure <b>300</b> may form a closed loop (not depicted) or a partially closed loop (as depicted).</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The molded z-bar extension member <b>240</b> is generally comprised of a moldable material. Moldable materials include, but are not limited to, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), nylon, polycarbonate, acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), styrene and delrin. Other moldable materials available to the artisan may be utilized.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087">Functionally, the molded z-bar extension member <b>240</b> may be slidably engaged with the z-bar <b>38</b>. The channel portion <b>290</b> cooperates with the projecting portion <b>76</b> of the z-bar <b>38</b> to help secure the molded z-bar extension member <b>240</b> to the z-bar <b>38</b>. When the door is brought into contact with the deflecting portion <b>292</b>, the deflecting portion <b>292</b> can act as a positive sealing member against the door, thereby serving as a barrier or seal akin to a weatherstrip. Alternatively, the deflecting portion <b>292</b> may be excluded from the z-bar extension member <b>240</b> and weather stripping mounted to the z-bar <b>38</b> left exposed to perform the barrier function. Weatherstrip may also be adhesively attached to the projecting portion <b>276</b> to extend weather barrier protection beyond the end of the z-bar <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The pocket structure <b>300</b> may be dimensioned to surround the lower end of the cap strip assembly (as depicted) or to abut with the cap strip <b>86</b>. The partial loop depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 24</figref> enables any water that enters the pocket from the top to drain out. Alternatively or additionally, slits or holes (not depicted) may be formed at the base of the pocket structure <b>300</b> for the drainage function.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The obtuse angle <b>288</b> between the base potion <b>284</b> and the longitudinal axis <b>286</b> may be formed to correspond with the incline of a sill (e.g. sill <b>54</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). The base portion <b>284</b> may serve as sealing structure that engages a door expander spline at the base of a door expander (not depicted) for a better seal between the door expander spline and the sill.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In other embodiments, the base may be formed separately. In these embodiments, the z-bar extension member and/or separate base may be formed by a process such as molding, extrusion, or roll forming, then glued, fused, fastened or otherwise connected to the molded z-bar extension member.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 25</figref>, a dual base z-bar extension member <b>320</b> having an extension portion <b>322</b>, a first base portion <b>324</b> and a second base portion <b>326</b> is depicted in an embodiment of the invention. The extension portion <b>322</b> may define a longitudinal axis <b>328</b>. The ends may form substantially right angles with respect to the longitudinal axis <b>328</b> (not depicted) or obtuse angles <b>330</b> with respect to the longitudinal axis <b>328</b> (as depicted).</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">Functionally, the dual base z-bar extension member may be severed along a line <b>332</b> between the first and second base portions <b>324</b> and <b>326</b> to provide left side and right side z-bar extension members.

One or more rail portions <b>368</b> may extend in a direction substantially orthogonal to the first major surface <b>356</b>. A shield portion <b>370</b> may extend from the second major surface <b>358</b>. The rail portions <b>368</b> and the shield portion <b>370</b> may be formed integral to the base portion <b>354</b>, and may be flush with the front and back edges <b>364</b> and <b>366</b>. A spacing <b>372</b> may be defined between rail portions <b>368</b> so that the guard assembly <b>352</b> effectively caps a vertical edge <b>373</b> of the door <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">In one embodiment, the guard assembly <b>352</b> may be operatively coupled to the vertical edge <b>373</b> of the door <b>32</b>.

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">The guard assembly may serve as an end cap to the door expander <b>44</b>. The spacing <b>372</b> between the rail portions <b>368</b> may be dimensioned to provide an interference or snap-on fit between the end of the door expander <b>44</b> and the guard assembly <b>352</b>. The guard assembly <b>352</b> may be sized so that the top end <b>360</b> extends above the door expander <b>44</b> and the bottom end <b>362</b> extends below the door expander <b>44</b> so as to cover the end of the door expander <b>44</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 27</figref>, the top end <b>360</b> and/or the bottom end <b>362</b> of the guard assembly <b>352</b> may be formed or cut at an angle <b>374</b> relative to the front edge <b>364</b>. The angle <b>374</b> may correspond to the inclined surface <b>56</b> of the sill <b>54</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097">In assembly, the guard assembly <b>352</b> may be mounted to one or both edges of the door <b>32</b> for engagement with either the hinge side or the latch side z-bar or z-bar assembly. Coverage of the guard assembly <b>352</b> may be along the entire vertical edge or edges <b>373</b> of the door <b>32</b> or just a portion thereof such as the expander <b>44</b>. In an alternative configuration, the rails may be spaced to fit both inside the door expander <b>44</b> while capping the vertical edge <b>373</b> of the door <b>32</b>. The guard assembly <b>352</b> may be placed over the end of the door expander <b>44</b> and adjusted to a position appropriate to provide contact or near contact with the top of the sill <b>54</b> when the exterior door <b>32</b> is closed. The guard assembly <b>352</b> may also be mounted to the end of the door expander <b>44</b> with glue, or with fasteners (not depicted), or by other means available to the artisan.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">To accommodate mounting the guard assembly <b>352</b> with fasteners, the one or more rail portions <b>368</b> may extend over one or more of the faces of the door expander <b>44</b> or the door <b>32</b> at a distance sufficient to accommodate the head of a fastener (not depicted). The various means of mounting the guard assembly <b>352</b> to the door expander <b>44</b> herein disclosed or otherwise known to the artisan may be utilized separately or in combination.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099">For embodiments that include the angle <b>374</b> on the top and/or the bottom end <b>360</b> and <b>362</b>, the guard assembly <b>352</b> may be installed without need for cutting the guard assembly <b>352</b>. When both ends <b>360</b> and <b>362</b> have inclines <b>370</b>, the same guard assembly <b>352</b> may be utilized on either the hinge side or the latch side of the exterior door <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">Functionally, the shield portion <b>370</b> may engage or nearly engage the z-bar <b>38</b> when the door <b>32</b> is in a closed position. The guard assembly <b>352</b> enables the z-bar <b>38</b> to be dimensioned shorter than the length of the door jamb <b>52</b>, and bridges the gap <b>57</b> (e.g. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>) between the z-bar <b>38</b> and the door jamb <b>52</b>. The guard assembly <b>352</b> provides a barrier at the end of the door expander <b>44</b> that inhibits collection of matter such as dirt, sand and salts that may corrode the door expander <b>44</b> over time. The guard assembly <b>352</b> may also enhance the thermal insulative quality of the exterior door assembly in at least two ways. First, the guard assembly <b>352</b> inhibits the flow of air through the door expander <b>44</b>, thereby providing a dead air pocket <b>376</b> within the door expander <b>44</b> and enhancing the thermal resistance of the door assembly <b>30</b>; the dead air pocket <b>376</b> may alternatively be filled with an insulation <b>378</b> that is contained when guard assemblies <b>352</b> are utilized on both ends of the door expander <b>44</b>. Second, the guard assembly <b>352</b> serves as an additional barrier for impeding air flow and inclement elements such as rain and snow into a gap <b>380</b> between the door <b>32</b> and the z-bar assembly <b>36</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 26C</figref>), particularly when the guard assembly <b>352</b> extends over an appreciable length of the vertical edge <b>373</b> of the door <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">The guard assembly <b>352</b> may be utilized without the z-bar extension member <b>40</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 26A through 26C</figref>, or in conjunction with the z-bar extension member <b>40</b> to provide the additional barrier characteristics outlined above.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102">The guard assembly <b>352</b> may be fabricated from a resilient material, such as metal or high density plastic, or from a more compliant material such as a rubber or silicone, or from a combination of resilient and compliant materials. Additionally, the shield portion <b>370</b> may be fitted with weather stripping or other suitable material to provide further insulative characteristics to the door assembly <b>30</b> and to compensate for dimensional intolerances that may occur in fabrication and installation.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In another embodiment, the shield portion <b>370</b> may be connected to the base portion <b>354</b> of the guard assembly <b>352</b> through a hinge portion (not depicted). The hinge portion may be a separate member, such as a spring-loaded pivot pin that connects the base and shield portions <b>354</b> and <b>370</b>, or a living hinge that is integral to the base and shield portions <b>354</b> and <b>370</b>, or by other hinging techniques known to the artisan. The hinge concept can provide compliance between the shield portion <b>370</b> and the z-bar <b>38</b> that compensates for dimensional intolerances that may occur in fabrication and installation, or which develop over time. The hinge concept may find enhanced utility in conjunction with hinge-side z-bars; the tight radius of rotation of the shield portion <b>370</b> about the z-bar <b>38</b> may cause over extension of the flexing of the shield portion <b>370</b> relative to the base portion <b>354</b> of the guard assembly <b>352</b> whenever the exterior door <b>32</b> is partially or fully opened. Repeated over extension may lead to fatigue failure between the shield portion <b>370</b> and the base portion <b>354</b>. The hinge member or hinge portion could be designed to reduce the fatigue of the components, thereby extending the life of the guard assembly <b>352</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">As previously discussed, a z-bar may be mounted to the header of a door casing, defining an upper gap between the z-bar and the header (not depicted). The guard assembly <b>352</b> may be utilized on the top edge of the door <b>32</b> to cover the upper gap when so configured.</p>

All dimensions and aspect ratios depicted in the figures may vary with a potential design and the intended use of a specific embodiment of this invention without departing from the scope thereof.</p>
