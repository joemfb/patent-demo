<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The discussion below is merely provided for general background information and is not intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Aspects of the invention relate to an apparatus for stacking objects. Such stacking apparatuses are used for instance for stacking products on a carrier, such as a pallet or a roller container.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">When stacking products of different dimensions or shapes, the stacking pattern should be optimised in such a way as will enable as many products as possible to be stacked in a stable manner.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">NL 1025826 discloses a palletising apparatus which is used in particular for products having different dimensions. After a stacking layer has been formed, the layer is moved with the aid of a conveyor belt to a stacking area. During that moving the stacking pattern of the formed layer is maintained using means provided especially for the purpose.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">This Summary and the Abstract herein are provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified form that are further described below in the Detailed Description. This Summary and the Abstract are not intended to identify key features or essential features of the claimed subject matter, nor are they intended to be used as an aid in determining the scope of the claimed subject matter. The claimed subject matter is not limited to implementations that solve any or all disadvantages noted in the background.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">An apparatus and method for stacking objects on a carrier is described. The apparatus is provided with a forming platform, a loading platform on which a transport carrier to be loaded can be placed, and a gripper which is movable between the forming platform and the loading platform, wherein the gripper comprises a support frame which is provided with at least one row of parallel forks, which forks comprise an upright to which a beam is attached at a distance beneath the support frame, wherein the beams can be moved backward and forward in their longitudinal direction, wherein each fork is individually adjustable vis-&#xe0;-vis the support frame. The support frame can for instance be provided on two opposing sides with forks comprising an upright to which a longitudinally movable beam is attached at a distance beneath the support frame, wherein the beams can be moved backward and forward longitudinally in the direction of the opposing row of forks, wherein each fork is individually adjustable vis-&#xe0;-vis the support frame.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to obtain a high flexibility, each upright can be provided with an individual drive unit for moving up and down. As a result of this, the various beams can be kept at different levels. When a layer to be stacked is placed on top of a lower, already stacked layer of products of different heights, then the products which are to be placed lower can be maintained in a lower position, so that the height of fall from the beam to the final position in the stack can be kept as small as possible for every product.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Each beam can also be provided with an individual drive unit for moving backward and forward in longitudinal direction. This makes it possible to retract a section of the beams earlier, or to keep a section of the beams retracted while moving the products to be stacked.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">If both the beams and the uprights can be moved individually in a horizontal and a vertical direction, respectively, it becomes possible to stack a wide range of diverse products, which may for instance be of different dimensions, type and/or weight, on one and the same pallet and even in the same stacking layers. Also, compared with the stacking systems known so far, this offers more possible ways of positioning products on a carrier. When products of different heights are stacked, the top side of a stacked layer will form an uneven plane onto which a next layer of products has to be stacked. The products of the next layer to be stacked then have to be put down at different levels. Because of the mutually independent vertical adjustability of the forks, those products, despite the different levels at which they eventually end up, can still be stacked in one go as one layer. This can take place for instance in two steps. On the forming platform the products to be stacked are arranged at the same level. Next, they are lifted up by the gripper, which moves the layer of products to the loading platform. During this movement one or more of the forks can be vertically adjusted in such a way that the products being carried end up at the same relative height as in the stacking layer which is ultimately to be formed. Next, the gripper places the supplied layer on the layer or layers already stacked. The vertical adjustment of the forks in that case thus takes place on the way from the forming platform to the loading platform.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The vertical adjustment rate of the uprights can be for instance up to 1 m/sec, for instance up to 0.8 m/sec. The horizontal adjustment rate of the beams can be higher, for instance up to 2 m/sec, for instance 1.7 m/sec.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Depending on their calculated position in the layer to be stacked, the products to be stacked can be carried by the ends of two opposing beams. This will generally be the case when a product is to be positioned at the centre of a layer to be stacked. By not placing the opposing beams end to end, the ends of the beams can be placed side by side over a particular distance. This can result in as many products as possible being put in place in a single remove, thus saving time.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The gripper can for instance be capable of rotation about a vertical axis, for instance be capable of rotation through an angle of 180 degrees or 360 degrees or more. As a result of this, the ready carrier on which the stack to be formed is placed can be approached from several sides. This makes even more complicated stackings possible.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The gripper can for instance be disconnectable. This makes it possible for the gripper to be replaced by a gripper with a greater capacity when this is called for.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The gripper can be connected to a multi-axial removal apparatus, such as for instance a flexible arm robot.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The stacking apparatus can be modular, in which case the number or the capacity of the forming platforms, loading platforms, and grippers can be varied according to need. If so desired, the lay-out of the stacking apparatus may also be provided with one or more buffer zones.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The forming platform can be provided with parallel grooves of a width which corresponds easily with the width of the beams. As a result of this, the beams can be slid underneath the products to be stacked in order to then be lifted up when the gripper is moved upward.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The beam can be provided with a strap running longitudinally around the beam across the beam's top side and underside, which strap is connected to the upright by two ends. The products to be moved in that case rest on the strap around the beam. When the beam is retracted, the strap stays in place, but is gradually rolled out from under the product. As a result of this, the product does not have to be slid off the beam. This enables more precise positioning of the product when it is stacked. In order to guide the strap properly around the beam, the beam can be provided on the two crosscut sides with a roller guide along which the strap is guided. In order to optimise the grip on the product, the strap can be made of a non-slipping material, such as rubber nitrile (NBR) elastomer, optionally on a core of a carrier strap material such as a polyamide.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">If so desired, the gripper may be provided with a number of vacuum heads which can move up and down. With these the products can be positioned more precisely still during the stacking and the product can be supported during the fall from the beam to the final position in the stack.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The apparatus can be combined with a pre-sorting unit and/or a preferably automated order picking system. This makes it possible to calculate the optimal stacking structure for a particular order already in advance and to have the products supplied in the correct sequence.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">With the aid of one, two or more positioning arms, the supplied products can be put or slid, for instance from a supply strap, onto the forming table in the correct position and in the proper place and, optionally, be turned.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">After a layer has been stacked, the layer can be compressed in order to achieve the desired compacting. The compressing can take place on all four sides of the layer. In order to increase the stability of the stack, a strap made for instance of plastic can be wound around one or more of the stacked layers&#x2014;for instance around every second or third layer. Alternatively, after the stacking the complete stack formed on the carrier can be wrapped, for instance with a foil, before the carrier with the stack is dispatched.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">The stacking apparatus makes it possible for products of very diverse dimensions to be stacked. Small products, say of 10 cm high or wide, as well as large products, say as large as the pallet itself, can be stacked. The stacking of flexible products, such as clothing, can also be performed in an efficient manner. This can be done for instance by positioning products with solid packaging around the periphery of the carrier, in which case the flexible products can then be positioned in the space enclosed by the solid packages.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows an apparatus <b>1</b> for stacking products <b>2</b> on a roller container <b>3</b> or a pallet <b>4</b>. The products <b>2</b> can have different shapes and dimensions. The apparatus <b>1</b> comprises a supply belt <b>5</b> for the supply of the products to be stacked <b>2</b>. The products <b>2</b> are supplied with the aid of a pre-sorting unit by way of a supply pipe <b>6</b> in a sequence which makes it possible to achieve optimal stable stacking. The supply belt <b>5</b> is disposed in a frame <b>7</b>, in which a positioning arm <b>8</b>, which is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, is suspended. The positioning arm <b>8</b> can be moved in a direction parallel with the longitudinal direction X of the supply belt <b>5</b> as well as in a direction Y perpendicular thereto and can in addition be rotated in a direction a about an axis perpendicular to the supply belt <b>5</b>. As a result of this, the positioning arm <b>8</b> is capable of picking up products <b>2</b> supplied from the supply pipe <b>6</b> and of moving and, if necessary, turning them. The thus positioned products <b>2</b> are conveyed onwards by the supply belt <b>5</b> and moved to a forming table <b>9</b>, where they are put in the desired position by a second positioning arm <b>8</b>A. The products <b>2</b> have been positioned such by the positioning arm <b>8</b> as to form a layer to be stacked on the forming table <b>9</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows the forming table <b>9</b> in detail. At the top side, the forming table <b>9</b> is provided with a number of parallel evenly spaced ribs <b>10</b>, which bound continuous grooves <b>11</b> of equal width. At the underside the forming table <b>9</b> is provided with guide profiles <b>12</b> having a U-shaped cross-section. The guide profiles <b>12</b> are parallel with the grooves <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the forming table <b>9</b> is placed on a support frame <b>13</b> with two guide rails <b>14</b> extending in the longitudinal direction of the frame, which guide rails have been mated with the guide profiles <b>12</b> on the underside of the forming table <b>9</b>. As a result of this, the table <b>9</b> can be moved forward and backward between a forming position where the forming table <b>9</b> connects to the supply belt <b>5</b>&#x2014;as shown in FIG. <b>1</b>&#x2014;and a discharge position at the other end of the support frame <b>13</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The apparatus <b>1</b> additionally comprises a loading platform or stacking area <b>20</b> and a gripper head <b>30</b>. The gripper head <b>30</b> can be moved by way of a guide frame <b>31</b> between a position above the stacking area <b>20</b> and a position above the forming table <b>9</b> when this is situated in the discharge position at the end of the support frame <b>13</b>. In both uttermost positions the gripper head <b>30</b> can be moved up and down. The gripper head <b>30</b> is shown in detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows the same gripper head <b>30</b> in the course of carrying a formed layer of products <b>2</b>. The gripper head <b>30</b> comprises a rectangular support frame <b>32</b> suspended from the end of a vertical bearing girder <b>33</b>. The support frame <b>32</b> is provided on two opposing sides with a row of forks <b>34</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows an individual fork <b>34</b>. Each fork <b>34</b> comprises a vertical profile <b>35</b>, into which a telescopically extendable upright <b>36</b> is incorporated which can be moved up and down vis-&#xe0;-vis the vertical profile <b>35</b> with the aid of a drive unit <b>37</b> and a spindle gear (not shown). On the underside of each extendable upright <b>36</b> a shoe <b>38</b> is attached, into which a beam <b>39</b> is slidably incorporated. All beams <b>39</b> are parallel with each other and can be moved backward and forward longitudinally vis-&#xe0;-vis the shoe <b>38</b> by way of a toothed gear rack (not shown) driven by a motor <b>40</b>. All round each beam <b>39</b> there are two parallel non-slipping straps <b>41</b>. The non-slipping straps <b>41</b> go across the top side and the underside of the beam <b>39</b> by way of the crosscut sides of the beam <b>39</b>. Each non-slipping strap <b>41</b> has two ends <b>42</b>, <b>43</b>, which are attached on either side of the shoe <b>38</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As is shown in detail by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the beam <b>39</b> is provided on either end with a bend pulley <b>44</b>, the axis of which is at right angles to the longitudinal direction of the beam <b>39</b>. The non-slipping straps <b>41</b> run round about the bend pulley <b>44</b>. When the beam <b>39</b> is moved backward and forward, the non-slipping straps <b>41</b> remain in place. In this way it is brought about that any products <b>2</b> which are positioned on the beam <b>39</b> do not have to be slid off the beam <b>39</b> when the beam <b>39</b> is retracted. On retracting the beam <b>39</b> the straps <b>41</b> are rolled out from under the product <b>2</b> and the product <b>2</b> remains in the same place.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> the non-slipping strap <b>41</b> consists of two parallel straps. If so desired, however, the strap <b>41</b> may consist of a single strap, or the beam <b>39</b> may be divided into two parallel, individually movable beams.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The uprights <b>36</b> and the beams <b>39</b> are individually movable. This enables a segmented driving of the gripper head <b>30</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">When a layer of products <b>2</b> has been formed on the forming table <b>9</b>, the gripper head <b>30</b> can be moved to the forming table <b>9</b>, in which process all beams <b>39</b> are as fully retracted as possible. The gripper head <b>30</b> can then be positioned over the formed layer. When the beams <b>39</b> are in the same straight line as the grooves <b>11</b> in the forming table <b>9</b>, the beams <b>39</b> can be moved towards each other again by way of the grooves <b>11</b>, into which they can be incorporated with ample clearance. The gripper head <b>30</b> can then lift the formed layer, after which the gripper head <b>30</b> is moved by way of the guide frame <b>31</b> to the stacking area <b>20</b>. This situation is depicted schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. After that, the formed layer of products <b>2</b> is lowered until it comes to rest on a pallet <b>50</b> standing in readiness, optionally on lower layers of products <b>2</b> which have been stacked on the pallet <b>50</b> earlier. The non-slipping strap <b>41</b> does not move with the beams <b>39</b> as they are retracted, so that the products <b>2</b> which are on the beam <b>39</b> do not have to be slid off the beam <b>39</b>. The products <b>2</b> remain in place while the non-slipping straps <b>41</b> are rolled out from under the products by the beam <b>39</b>. The products <b>2</b> are thus posited on the underlying layer.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The uprights <b>36</b> can be controlled independently. As a result of this, the beams <b>39</b> may, if so desired, be kept at different levels, so that some products <b>2</b> can be kept lower than other products <b>2</b>, as is shown for instance in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>. If one or more layers of products <b>2</b> have already been stacked on the pallet <b>50</b>, then the product <b>2</b> which is stacked onto a less high product <b>2</b> can be kept lower than products <b>2</b> which are stacked onto a higher product <b>2</b>. Thus the height of fall is kept as low as possible for all products <b>2</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">If so desired, means may be used to support the products during the stacking. These may for instance be vacuum heads <b>51</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, operably coupled to a vacuum source, not shown.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Alternatively, the beams <b>39</b> can be retracted independently. If the pallet <b>50</b> already holds a previously stacked layer of products <b>2</b> of unequal height, then the beams <b>39</b> on which there are products <b>2</b> which are placed on high products <b>2</b> can be retracted first. After that, the gripper head <b>30</b> can be lowered and a next product <b>2</b> can be posited on a product <b>2</b> on a slightly lower level. Alternatively, a beam <b>39</b> can be retracted in stages, in which case the product <b>2</b> is first placed on the end of the beam <b>39</b>, after which, if necessary, the beam <b>39</b> can be lowered in order to then be retracted further for a next product <b>2</b> to be put in place. Alternatively, the gripper head <b>30</b> can be used to move just part of a layer. The beams <b>39</b> on which there are no products <b>2</b> then in that case can be kept in the retracted position, as is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. Where the beams <b>39</b> have been retracted, the gripper head <b>30</b> can be lowered over upright products <b>2</b> of a previously stacked layer in order to put new products <b>2</b> to be stacked in place on the remainder of the previously stacked layer.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The stacking area <b>20</b> consists of a roller conveyor <b>60</b>. Between the rollers <b>61</b> of the roller conveyor <b>60</b> there are three partitions <b>62</b> which project above the roller conveyor <b>60</b> during the stacking, as is shown in greater detail in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>. On the partitions <b>62</b> is placed the pallet <b>4</b> onto which the products <b>2</b> are stacked. Next to the partitions <b>62</b> a compacting station <b>63</b> is placed. The compacting station <b>63</b> comprises an upright <b>64</b> on which a supporting arm adjustable in height is mounted. On the supporting arm <b>65</b> a horizontal frame work <b>66</b> is mounted, which is dimensioned and positioned such that it can be lowered over a stack of products <b>2</b> on a pallet <b>4</b> on the partitions <b>62</b>. On each of the four inner sides of the frame work <b>66</b> there is a pressure member <b>67</b>. By moving the pressure members <b>67</b> inward, the products <b>2</b> in a stacked layer are moved toward each other and the stack is compacted until the desired degree of compacting is obtained. In order to increase the stability of the stack, a plastic clamping strap can be wound around every second or third layer. After a whole stack of products <b>2</b> has been stacked and compacted, the partitions <b>62</b> are lowered until the pallet <b>4</b> stands on the rollers <b>61</b> of the roller conveyor <b>60</b>, while the frame work <b>66</b> is raised. The pallet <b>4</b> with the stack of products <b>2</b> can then be removed by way of the roller conveyor <b>60</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">After the stacking the complete stack on the carrier is wrapped in a foil in a separate station, before the carrier with the stack is dispatched.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> shows a gripper head <b>60</b> which is especially equipped for use with roller containers <b>70</b>. The gripper head <b>60</b> to this end comprises a support frame <b>61</b>, which is provided with two parallel rectangular grooves <b>62</b> between two plate-shaped crossbeams <b>63</b>, through which the raised sides <b>71</b> of the roller containers <b>70</b> can be slid. The crossbeams <b>63</b> are slightly closer together at the top side than at the underside, enabling the gripper head <b>60</b> to be lowered more easily over the sides <b>71</b> of the roller container <b>70</b>. The beams <b>39</b> of the outermost forks <b>34</b> remain in the retracted position to keep them at a distance from the sides <b>71</b> of the roller container <b>70</b>. The supporting head <b>60</b> can thus be lowered over the sides <b>71</b> in order to put a layer to be stacked on the bottom <b>72</b> of the roller container <b>70</b>, or on a layer previously put in place.</p>
