<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This patent specification relates to structures of photovoltaic cells (also solar cells). More specifically, it relates to structures of photovoltaic cells comprising numerous nanometer-scale wires, rods and/or tubes to increase the junction area for increasing power generation capability per unit area. This also relates to photovoltaic cells comprising with nano or micro scaled-blocks. These photovoltaic cells can be used in commercial, residential, and also industrial applications for power generation.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Photovoltaic cells where light is converted into electric power and fed to external loads, which are electrically connected to the photovoltaic cells, have been prevailing in a wide range of applications such as consumer electronics, industrial electronics, and space exploration. In consumer electronics, photovoltaic cells that consist of materials such as amorphous silicon are used for a variety of inexpensive and low power applications. Typical conversion efficiency, i.e. the solar cell conversion efficiency, of amorphous silicon based photovoltaic cells is in the range of &#x2dc;10% [Yamamoto K, Yoshimi M, Suzuki T, Tawada Y, Okamoto T, Nakajima A. <i>Thin film poly</i>-<i>Si solar cell on glass substrate fabricated at low temperature. Presented at MRS Spring Meeting</i>, San Francisco, April 1998.]. Although the fabrication processes of amorphous silicon based photovoltaic cells are rather simple and inexpensive, one notable downside of this type of cell is its vulnerability to defect-induced degradation that decreases its conversion efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In contrast, for more demanding applications such as residential and industrial solar power generation systems, either poly-crystalline or single-crystalline silicon is typically used because there are more stringent requirements for better reliability and higher efficiency than the applications in consumer electronics. Photovoltaic cells consisting of poly-crystalline and single-crystalline silicon generally offer conversion efficiencies in the range of &#x2dc;20% and &#x2dc;25% [Zhao I, Wang A, Green M, Ferrazza F. <i>Novel </i>19.8% <i>efficient &#x2018;honeycomb&#x2019; textured multicrystalline and </i>24.4% <i>monocystalline silicon solar cell. Applied Physics Letters </i>7998; 73: 1997-1993.] respectively. As many concerns associated with a steep increase in the amount of the worldwide energy consumption are raised, further development in industrial solar power generation systems has been recognized as a main focus for an alternative energy source.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Group II-VI compound semiconductors, for example CdTe and CdS, have been considered for the purpose of creating industrial solar power generation systems, manufactured at a lower cost and moderate conversion efficiency. This approach resulted in a comparable conversion efficiency of &#x2dc;17% [Wu X, Keane J C, Dhere R G, DeHart C, Duda A, Gessert T A, Asher S, Levi D H, Sheldon P. 16.5%-<i>efficient CdS/CdTe polycrystalline thin</i>-<i>film solar cell. Proceedings of the </i>17<i>th European Photovoltaic Solar Energy Conference</i>, Munich, 22-26 Oct. 2001; 995-1000.]. This conversion efficiency is comparable to those for the single crystalline silicon photovoltaic devises; however, the toxic nature of these materials is of great concern for environment.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Group I-III-VI compound semiconductors, such as CuInGaSe<sub>2</sub>, have been extensively investigated for industrial solar power generation systems. This material can potentially be synthesized at a much lower cost than its counterpart, single crystalline silicon. However, a conversion efficiency of &#x2dc;19%, which is comparable to that of single crystalline silicon based cells, can be obtained, thus far, only by combining with the group II-VI compound semiconductor cells [Contreras M A, Egaas B, Ramanathan K, Hiltner I, Swartzlander A, Hasoon F, Noufi R. <i>Progress toward </i>20% <i>efficiency in Cu</i>(<i>In,Ga</i>)<i>Se polycrystalline thin</i>-<i>film solar cell. Progress in Photovoltaics: Research and Applications </i>1999; 7: 311-316.], which again raises issues associated with the toxic nature of these materials.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Photovoltaic cells designed for several exclusive applications, where the main focus is high conversion efficiency, generally consist of group III-V semiconductors, including GaInP and GaAs. In general, synthesis processes of single crystalline group III-V are very costly because of substantial complications involved in epitaxial growth of group III-V single crystalline compound semiconductors. Typical conversion efficiencies of group III-V compound semiconductor based photovoltaic cells, as these types of photovoltaic cells are intended to be, can be as high as &#x2dc;34% when combined with germanium substrates, another very expensive material [King R R, Fetzer C M, Colter P C, Edmondson K M, Law D C, Stavrides A P, Yoon H, Kinsey G S, Cotal H L, Ermer J H, Sherif R A, Karam N H. <i>Lattice</i>-<i>matched and metamorphic GaInP/GaInAs/Ge concentrator solar cells. Proceedings of the World Conference on Photovoltaic Energy Conversion </i>(<i>WCPEC</i>-3), <i>Osaka, May </i>2003; to be published.].</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">All photovoltaic cells in the prior art described above, regardless of what materials the cell is made from, essentially fall into one specific type of structure, described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>. Shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a photovoltaic cell comprising a thick p-type semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and a thin n-type semiconductor layer <b>102</b> formed on an electrically conductive substrate <b>100</b>. A pn-junction <b>103</b> is formed at the interface between the p-type semiconductor layer <b>101</b> and the n-type semiconductor layer <b>102</b>. Incident light <b>104</b> entering the cell generate electron-hole pairs after being absorbed by the p- and also s-type semiconductor layers <b>101</b> and <b>102</b>. The incident light <b>104</b> generates electrons <b>105</b><i>e </i>and holes <b>105</b><i>h </i>in the region near the pn-junction <b>103</b> and also electrons <b>106</b><i>e </i>and holes <b>106</b><i>h </i>in the region far from the pn-junction <b>103</b>. The photogenerated electrons <b>105</b><i>e </i>and <b>106</b><i>e </i>(and holes) (hereafter considering only electronics, i.e. minority carriers in p-type semiconductors, although the same explanation is applicable for holes, minority carriers in n-type semiconductors) diffusing toward the pn-junction <b>103</b> and entering the pn-junction <b>103</b> contribute to photovoltaic effect. The two key factors that substantially impact the conversion efficiency of this type of photovoltaic cell are photo carrier generation efficiency (PCGE) and photo carrier collection efficiency (PCCE).</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The PCGE is the percentage of photons entering a cell which contribute to the generation of photo carriers, which needs to be, ideally, 100%. On the other hand, the PCCE is the percentage of photogenerated electrons <b>105</b><i>e </i>and <b>106</b><i>e </i>that reach the pn-junction <b>103</b> and contribute to the generation of photocurrent. For a monochromatic light, a PCGE of &#x2dc;100% can be achieved by simply making the p-type layer <b>101</b> thicker than the n-type material; however, electrons <b>106</b><i>e </i>generated at the region far away from the pn-junction <b>103</b> cannot be collected efficiently due to many adverse recombination processes that prevent photogenerated carriers from diffusing into the pn-junction <b>103</b>. Thus, the basic structure of current photovoltaic cells has its own limitation on increasing the conversion efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows typical monochromatic light intensity behavior <b>108</b> inside the semiconductor. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the light intensity behavior <b>108</b> inside bulk semiconductor is exponential. The light intensity p at certain depth x can be expressed as p(x)=P<sub>0</sub>exp(&#x2212;&#x3b1;x), where P<sub>0 </sub>is the peak intensity at the surface and a is the absorption co-efficient of the semiconductor in which light is entering. Carriers (not shown here) generated due to light flux <b>112</b> absorbed by the pn-junction <b>103</b> is only drifted by the junction field and can be collected efficiently, whereas, carriers <b>106</b><i>e </i>and <b>106</b><i>h </i>generated due to absorption of light-flux <b>110</b> by semiconductor region <b>101</b> are diffused in all directions. Only those carriers <b>105</b><i>e </i>and <b>105</b><i>h </i>which are generated closer (a distance equal to or less than the diffusion-length of the semiconductor) to pn-junction <b>103</b> can be collected. Those carriers <b>106</b><i>e </i>and <b>106</b><i>h </i>which are generated far away (distance longer than the diffusion-length of the semiconductor) from pn-junction <b>103</b> are recombined and lost. The light flux <b>112</b> is usually lost either by leaving or being absorbed by the substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Both PCGE and PCCE are largely dependent on the material and structure of the photovoltaic cells. Today's photovoltaic cells are structured in such a way that (a) wide ranges of the solar spectrum cannot be absorbed due to material limitations, and (b) PCCE is low due to its inherent structure. For example, the typical conversion efficiency of today's crystal-Si based solar cell is &#x2dc;18%. Wavelengths of the solar spectrum spread from &#x3c;0.1 &#x3bc;m to 3.5 &#x3bc;m, but Si can only absorb &#x2dc;0.4 &#x3bc;m to 0.9 &#x3bc;m of light. &#x2dc;50% of light belonging to the solar spectrum cannot be absorbed by Si due to its inherent material properties. The remaining 32% is lost due to (i) recombination of photogenerated carriers and (ii) loss of light, which is represented by <b>112</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>; these two factors are structurally dependent. If we could reduce these two factors, &#x2dc;50% conversion efficiency could be achieved, even in a Si-based solar cell. If we could capture different wavelengths of light belonging to the solar spectrum by utilizing different alloyed materials, we could increase the conversion efficiency ideally to 100%. Furthermore, if the solar cell detection capability could be extended to the infrared-spectrum, then the solar cell could produce electrical energy not only during the day (while sun is present), but also at night (hereafter defined by when the sun is not out). Additionally, today's solar cell material is not highly radiation-tolerant. Specifically in space applications, photovoltaic cells should be highly radiation tolerant and have structure and material systems which can generate high-power per unit area.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">For both commercial and space applications, therefore, it would be desirable to have photovoltaic cell structures where both the PCGE and PCCE can be increased simultaneously by having a photo absorption region which is thick enough to capture all the photons entering the cell and a pn-junction which is located as close to the photo absorption region as possible. It would be further desirable to have, while maintaining ideal PCGE and PCCE, materials which have photo responses at different spectrums in order to efficiently cover a wide spectrum of light that enters a photovoltaic cell. It would be further desirable to have a large junction area within a given volume of a photovoltaic cell so that generated electric power that is proportional to the junction area can be maximized. It would be further desirable to have solar cells which could generate electric power in both day and night.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">According to the preferred embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a photovoltaic cell comprising of a plurality of nanometer(s) or micrometer(s)-scaled rods <b>201</b> is formed on the supporting substrate <b>200</b> (after having groove). The nanometer(s) or micrometer(s)-scaled rods <b>201</b> can have metallic electrical conduction, p-type or n-type semiconductor electrical conduction. The nanometer(s) or micrometer(s)-scaled rods <b>201</b> are further surrounded by an electronic material <b>202</b> having metallic electrical conduction, p-type or s-type semiconductor electrical conduction. The electronic material <b>202</b> can be a separate material or an electronic material of p or n type formed inside <b>201</b> and <b>200</b>. The electronic material <b>202</b> and the supporting substrate <b>200</b> are electrically connected to electrodes <b>203</b><i>a </i>and <b>203</b><i>b</i>, respectively. The electrode <b>203</b><i>a </i>is intended to serve as a common electrode that connects all rods <b>201</b>. The electrode <b>203</b><i>a </i>is provided for the electronic material <b>202</b>. The electrode <b>203</b><i>a </i>can be transparent (not shown here) and can be formed on the electronic material <b>202</b>. The interface between the nanometer scaled rods <b>201</b> and the electronic material <b>202</b> form pn- or Schottky junctions where built-in potential for both electrons and holes is generated.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Alternatively, according to this invention, the nanometer(s)-scaled rods <b>201</b> can be formed on a separate substrate (not shown here), and the electrode <b>203</b><i>b </i>can be formed on the substrate to have common contact for each nanometer(s)-scaled rod <b>201</b>, necessary for creating a junction.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In way of an example not way of limitation, the nanometer(s)-scaled rods <b>201</b> can be made of n-type semiconductor and the electric material <b>202</b> that surrounds the nanometer(s)-scaled rods <b>201</b> can be made of p-type semiconductor. Incident light <b>204</b> enters the photovoltaic cell through either the electrode <b>203</b><i>a </i>or on the electronic material <b>202</b>. (In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the incident light enters the photovoltaic cell through the electronic material <b>202</b> and not the electrode <b>203</b><i>a</i>). The incident light <b>204</b> travels through the nano-scaled rods <b>201</b>, electronic material (n- or p-type) <b>202</b>, and substrate <b>200</b>. As the incident light <b>204</b> travels through the nano-scaled rods <b>201</b> and electronic material <b>202</b>, numerous electrons <b>205</b><i>e </i>are generated in the region near the electrode <b>203</b><i>a</i>. Portions of light <b>204</b> which pass through the gaps <b>207</b> travel through the electronic material <b>202</b> and the supporting substrate <b>200</b>, which consequentially generates electrons <b>206</b><i>e</i>. Some electrons <b>206</b><i>e </i>are generated closer to electronic material <b>202</b> and are collected, while some of which generate in the region far from the electronic material <b>202</b> and are recombined and lost. It should be pointed out that electrons are apparently generated all over the region along the thickness of the electric material <b>202</b>. In addition, as the incident light <b>204</b> travels through the nanometer(s)-scaled rods <b>201</b>, numerous holes <b>205</b><i>h </i>and <b>206</b><i>h </i>are generated in the rods <b>201</b> and in the substrate <b>200</b>, respectively. It also should be pointed out that holes are apparently generated all over the region along the thickness of the nanometer(s)-scaled rods <b>201</b> and the substrate <b>200</b>. Photogenerated electrons <b>205</b><i>e </i>and <b>206</b><i>e </i>in the electronic material <b>202</b>, rods <b>201</b>, and substrate <b>200</b> diffuse toward pn-junctions, created at the interface between the nanometer(s)-scaled rods <b>201</b> and the electronic material <b>202</b>, and also at the interface between the electronic material <b>202</b> and substrate <b>200</b>. At the pn-junctions, the electrons and the holes are swept away by built-in potential, thus photovoltaic effects set in.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Unlike the conventional solar cell shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, the invention has pn-junctions in the regions on top <b>208</b> of the rods <b>201</b>, on the side <b>210</b> of the rods <b>201</b>, and in the gaps <b>212</b> in between the rods <b>201</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>. The pn-junction formed on the side <b>210</b> of the rods <b>201</b> having a penetration depth of the incident light of H (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2C</figref>), and a variation of the light intensity along the penetration depth <b>214</b> dependent on the penetration depth of the incident light H of the rods <b>201</b>. The light <b>204</b> travels parallel to the direction of the pn-junction formed across side <b>210</b> of the rods and most of the light intensity along the penetration depth <b>214</b> incident on the pn-junction is absorbed and most of the photogenerated carriers can be collected. The light <b>204</b> travels perpendicular to the pn-junctions formed at the top <b>208</b> of the rods <b>201</b> and in the gaps <b>212</b> in between the rods <b>201</b>. Most of the light flux incident on the top of the rods <b>208</b> can also be absorbed. The carriers generated by the light <b>204</b> incident on the top <b>208</b> of the rods can be collected without recombination (ideally). Not all carriers generated by the light <b>204</b> incident on the gaps <b>212</b> in between the rods <b>201</b> can be collected. It is apparent that utilizing the solar cell as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2C</figref> can (i) reduce the recombination and (ii) absorb all photo flux, thereby increasing the conversion efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The apparent advantage of this invention over conventional photovoltaic cells is directly associated with the fact that, unlike conventional photovoltaic cells, large portions of the pn-junctions are almost parallel to the direction to which incident light <b>204</b> travels. As such, the distance all photogenerated carriers in the electronic material <b>202</b>, regardless of where they are generated, have to diffuse in order to reach the pn-junctions is within the range of the distance between two nanometer(s)-scaled rods existing next to each other and that distance is independent of the location where they are generated. Furthermore, the distance all photogenerated carriers in the rods <b>201</b>, regardless of where they are generated, have to diffuse to reach pn-junctions is within the range of the diameter of the nanometer(s)-scale rods <b>201</b>. Only in the gaps <b>212</b> formed in between the rods <b>201</b> does light <b>204</b> travel perpendicular to the pn-junctions and, therefore, not all the carriers can be collected. According to this invention, the recombination can be made zero (ideally) and all photon flux can be absorbed (ideally), and the conversion efficiency can be made &#x3e;50%, even using Si. Conventionally, as explained in the description of the prior art shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, photovoltaic cells have pn-junctions that are perpendicular to the direction to which incident light travels. Therefore, the photogenerated carriers generated in the region far away from pn-junctions need to diffuse a much longer distance (diffusion-length) than photogenerated carriers generated near the pn-junctions, thus having a greater chance to recombine without contributing to photovoltaic effects. Therefore in this invention, PCCE is expected to be much higher than in conventional photovoltaic cells. In addition, it is evident that the total effective area which contributes to photovoltaic effects in this invention can be increased significantly by a few orders (&#x3e;3000), considering 300 mm diameter substrate, 500 &#x3bc;m height rods having 50 nm diameter and 100 nm pitch.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">According to this invention, in way of an example not way of limitation, the supporting substrate <b>200</b> can be n-type Si, on which n-type Si, Si&#x2014;Ge, or Si-based alloyed rods <b>201</b> are formed after making the grooves on the front surface of the substrate <b>200</b>. The p-type dopants can be diffused into the rods <b>201</b> and the substrate <b>200</b> regions can be opened to form the electronic material <b>202</b> of Si p-type. The metal contacts <b>203</b><i>a </i>and <b>203</b><i>b </i>can be formed on the p-type Si <b>202</b>. Conformal deposition of the dielectric material (not shown) can be done for planarization, and in this case silicon oxide or a polymer can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">According to this invention, in way of an example not way of limitation, the supporting substrate <b>200</b> can be Ge, GaAs, InP, GaN, or ZnO on which rods <b>201</b> of same type of material can be formed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an alternative preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a photovoltaic cell comprises a plurality of nanometer(s)-scaled rods <b>301</b> which are electrically connected to a substrate <b>300</b>.

Photogenerated electrons in the electronic material <b>302</b> then diffuse toward pn-junctions in the interface of <b>302</b>/<b>301</b>.

<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Common advantages already described for the photovoltaic cell in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, can be similarly achieved in this embodiment. The only difference is in forming the nano-scaled rods <b>301</b>, which are formed without forming the grooves.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In an alternative preferred embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, a photovoltaic cell comprises a plurality of nanometer(s)-scaled rods <b>401</b> which are electrically connected to a substrate <b>400</b>.

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to this invention, in way of an example not way of limitation, the supporting substrate <b>400</b> can be n-type InP, on which n-type InP or InP-based alloyed rods <b>401</b> are formed on the front surface of the substrate <b>400</b>.

Apparently, in addition to the common advantages already described in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2-FIG</figref>. <b>3</b> over conventional cells in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the additional advantage of the cell in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> is a capability of covering a wide range of the spectrum contained in incident light <b>404</b> and converting a wide range of the spectrum to photogenerated carriers. Dozens of different layers could be stacked to catch photons at all energies, to make absorption wide enough to cover the entire solar spectrum, from lower wavelengths (as low as X-ray) to longer wavelength (e.g. long infrared). The addition of multiple junctions of different materials, which could absorb a wide solar spectrum, plus the increase in the junction area caused by using the rods <b>401</b>, will help to increase the conversion efficiency close to 100% (ideally).
