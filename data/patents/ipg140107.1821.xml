<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates generally to methods and devices usable to deliver energy within the body of a patient. More specifically, the present invention is concerned with a method for creating a channel through a stent graft.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">There are many situations in which it would be desirable to create a channel through a stent graft located in a body of a patient. For example, the following two papers give examples of such procedures: McWilliams et al., &#x201c;In Situ Stent-Graft Fenestration to Preserve the Left Subclavian Artery&#x201d; Journal of Endovascular Therapy Vol. 11, No. 2, pp. 170-174; and McWilliams et al. &#x201c;Retrograde Fenestration of Endoluminal Grafts From Target Vessels: Feasibility, Technique, and Potential Usage.&#x201d; Journal of Endovascular Therapy: Vol. 10, No. 5, pp. 946-952, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In some cases, a graft composed of foreign material including a substantially tubular supporting structure, for example a stent, needs to be positioned within a vessel of the body of the patient. However, because of the configuration of the vessel, side branches extending from the vessel may be obstructed by the graft. Restoration of flow through these side branches is relatively difficult to perform with a percutaneous needle because of the relatively large forces required. Also, the relatively large forces exerted onto the needle create a risk that the needle will pass through the foreign material suddenly and damage adjacent tissues.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Against this background, there exists a need in the industry to provide a novel method for creating a channel through a stent graft.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In contrast to the commonly understood mechanisms of radiofrequency perforation, it has been unexpectedly found that, as described further herein below, a radiofrequency-based apparatus is usable to create channels through foreign materials which may be, for example, substantially synthetic materials.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A method for creating a channel through a foreign material located in a body of a patient, said foreign material defining a material first surface and a substantially opposed material second surface, said channel extending through said foreign material between said material first and second surfaces, said method using an apparatus including an electrode, said method comprising:

    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0000">
    <ul id="ul0002" list-style="none">
        <li id="ul0002-0001" num="0008">positioning said electrode substantially adjacent to said material first surface;</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0002" num="0009">energizing said electrode with a radiofrequency current; and</li>
        <li id="ul0002-0003" num="0010">using said electrode energized with said radiofrequency current to deliver energy into said foreign material to create said channel;</li>

    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0012">Examples of such foreign materials include any cellular-based material (in addition to biological tissue), as well as any synthetic material that absorbs water or that will melt at the operating temperature of the electrode. For example, and non-limitingly, the foreign material has a melting temperature of less than about 150 degrees Celsius. In one particular example the foreign material includes a synthetic material. In another example the foreign material includes a material selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), cotton, a polyester material and fabrics thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0013">In some embodiments of the invention, positioning of said electrode substantially adjacent to said material first surface is performed before energizing said electrode,</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0014">In some embodiments, the method further comprises advancing said electrode into said foreign material towards said material second surface while delivering said energy into said foreign material.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0015">Furthermore, in some embodiments the method further comprises: delivering said energy into said foreign material for a predetermined duration; and stopping delivery of said energy into said foreign material after said predetermined duration. In an example of this, the predetermined duration is from about 0.1 second to about 5 seconds. In a specific example of this, the predetermined duration is from about 1 second to about 2 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0016">Advantageously, the proposed method allows an intended user to relatively easily create the channel using an apparatus that has been advanced through a relatively tortuous path through the body of the patient, as minimal force is required be exerted onto the material with the distal end region of the apparatus in order to create the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0017">In some embodiments of the invention, the proposed method is performed using a sequence of a relatively small number of relatively quick and ergonomic steps using devices substantially similar to existing radiofrequency perforation apparatuses.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0018">In addition, the proposed method is relatively safe for biological tissues adjacent to the foreign material, which minimizes risks of injuring these biological tissues and of creating potentially life-threatening situations.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0019">In some embodiments, the foreign material is included in a septal patch extending across an aperture formed in the septum of the heart of a patient. In other embodiments, the foreign material is included in a stent graft occluding the ostium of a blood vessel.</p>

<p id="p-0018" num="0021">In an example of such embodiments, said first vessel comprises an abdominal aorta and said second vessel comprises a renal artery branching from said abdominal aorta at a renal artery ostium, and said stent graft occludes said renal artery ostium. The method further comprises: positioning said electrode substantially adjacent to said material first surface includes positioning said electrode substantially adjacent to said renal artery ostium outside of said abdominal aorta; and using said electrode energized with said radiofrequency current to deliver said energy into said foreign material to create said channel includes delivering said energy into said stent graft.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0022">In another example of such embodiments, said first vessel comprises an abdominal aorta and said second vessel comprises a renal artery branching from said abdominal aorta at a renal artery ostium, and said stent graft occludes said renal artery ostium. The method further comprises: positioning said electrode substantially adjacent to said material first surface includes positioning said electrode substantially adjacent to said renal artery ostium inside of said abdominal aorta; and using said electrode energized with said radiofrequency current to deliver said energy into said foreign material to create said channel includes delivering said energy into said stent graft.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0023">In still another example of such embodiments, said first vessel comprises a thoracic aorta and said second vessel comprises a left subclavian artery branching from said thoracic aorta at a left subclavian artery ostium, and said stent graft occludes said left subclavian artery ostium. The method further comprises: positioning said electrode substantially adjacent to said material first surface includes positioning said electrode substantially adjacent to said left subclavian artery ostium outside of said thoracic aorta; and using said electrode energized with said radiofrequency current to deliver said energy into said foreign material to create said channel includes delivering said energy into said stent graft.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0024">Furthermore, in another example of such embodiments, said first vessel comprises a thoracic aorta and second vessel comprises a left subclavian artery branching from said thoracic aorta at a left subclavian artery ostium, and said stent graft occludes said left subclavian artery ostium. The method further comprises: positioning said electrode substantially adjacent to said material first surface includes positioning said electrode substantially adjacent to said left subclavian artery ostium inside of said thoracic aorta; and using said electrode energized with said radiofrequency current to deliver said energy into said foreign material to create said channel includes delivering said energy into said stent graft.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0025">In another embodiment, the method further comprises the steps of: monitoring a current output of said electrode; detecting one or more over-currents if the current output exceeds a predetermined magnitude threshold; determining an extent of the over-currents detected before the expiry of a predetermined time period; and controlling the delivery of energy based on the extent of the over-currents detected.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0040" num="0043">Generally speaking, the proposed method is performed for creating a channel through a stent graft located in a body of a patient. The stent graft may include foreign material defining a material first surface and a substantially opposed material second surface and the channel extends through the foreign material between the material first and second surfaces. Typically, the method uses an apparatus including a substantially elongated member defining a proximal end region and a substantially longitudinally opposed distal end region, the substantially elongated member including an electrode located about the distal end region.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0044">The method includes positioning the electrode substantially adjacent to the material first surface; energizing the electrode with a radiofrequency current; and using the electrode energized with the radiofrequency current to deliver energy into the foreign material to create the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0045">For example, the method is usable for restoring blood flow to a blood vessel of a body of a human or animal, the blood vessel being occluded by a foreign material. In this case, the channel is created through the foreign material.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0046">As a feature of the aforementioned aspects, in some embodiments of the invention, the apparatus has a substantially atraumatic distal end, thus reducing the risk of unintentional perforation of a body vessel or other tissues. Also, the use of energy in creating the channel allows for the creation of channels in foreign materials through which creation of such channels is difficult, if not impossible, to perform using mechanical force. In some embodiments, the method is performed using relatively small apparatuses, for example apparatuses having a relatively small diameter, which are therefore relatively easily introduced into relatively small vessels.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0047">With specific reference now to the drawings in detail, it is stressed that the particulars shown are by way of example and for purposes of illustrative discussion of embodiments of the present invention only, and that many alternative embodiments of the invention are within the scope of the appended claims.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0048">For the purposes of this description, the term &#x2018;proximal&#x2019; indicates next to or nearer to the user, and the term &#x2018;distal&#x2019; indicates further away from the user, when the apparatus is in use.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0049">Apparatus</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0050">Structure</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0051">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, one embodiment of an apparatus <b>100</b> according to the present invention includes a substantially elongated member <b>102</b> defining a distal end region <b>104</b> and a proximal end region <b>106</b>. The distal end region <b>104</b> includes a distal tip <b>108</b> and an electrode <b>110</b> located about the distal end region <b>104</b>. The electrode <b>110</b> is usable as a radiofrequency energy delivery component. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the apparatus <b>100</b> further comprises an actuator <b>112</b> for directing at least a portion of the distal end region <b>104</b> in a desired direction.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0052">The elongated member <b>102</b> may be electrically conductive and may be operable to conduct electrical energy to the distal tip <b>108</b>, and more specifically to the electrode <b>110</b>. In such embodiments, the elongated member <b>102</b> is also known as a core wire. In the illustrated embodiments, the elongated member <b>102</b> is at least partially covered with an insulating material <b>114</b> for substantially preventing conduction of electrical energy to surrounding bodily tissue. In accordance with these embodiments, the insulating material <b>114</b> may be made of any of a variety of electrically insulating materials and may have any suitable thickness, provided that the elongated member <b>102</b> is at least partially electrically insulated. In one particular embodiment, the insulating material <b>114</b> is at least about 0.1 mm thick. The elongated member <b>102</b> may comprise a wire that is narrow enough to be navigated through a blood vessel. In some specific embodiments, the elongated member <b>102</b> measures about 0.2 mm to about 1.0 mm in diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0053">In alternative embodiments, the insulating material <b>114</b> is discontinuous at one or more locations along the elongated member <b>102</b>. For example, in one such embodiment, a number of discontinuities in the insulating material <b>114</b>, along the length of the elongated member <b>102</b>, create a &#x2018;banded&#x2019; appearance, wherein insulated regions are interleaved between electrically exposed and conductive regions. In another embodiment, a region of the insulating material <b>114</b> does not completely circumscribe the elongated member <b>102</b>. For example, insulating material <b>114</b> may traverse approximately 180 degrees of the circumference of the elongated member <b>102</b>, leaving the remaining area electrically exposed. Any shape or pattern of discontinuities may be present and the invention is not intended to be limited in this regard. Discontinuities in the insulating material <b>114</b> may affect the distribution of energy, for example current density, around the elongated member <b>102</b> when the elongated member <b>102</b> is used to deliver energy. Embodiments of the present invention comprising such discontinuities may be suitable for specific applications, for example, when it is desirable to deliver energy along a portion of the length of the elongated member <b>102</b> or to focus the delivery of energy to a particular location or target site. In some embodiments, discontinuities in the insulating material <b>114</b> correspond, at least in part, to discontinuities in the structure of the elongated member <b>102</b>. For example, in one specific embodiment, notches, described in greater detail below, are present in the elongated member <b>102</b>, the thickness of the insulating material <b>114</b> being reduced in the vicinity of the notches.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0054">In some embodiments, at least a portion of the proximal end region <b>106</b> of the elongated member <b>102</b> is electrically exposed, such that the elongated member <b>102</b> may be electrically coupled to an energy source, for example using an electrical connector.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0055">In alternative embodiments, the elongated member <b>102</b> is made out of an electrically insulating material. In such embodiments, the insulating material <b>114</b> is typically not required. For example, in some embodiments, the elongated member <b>102</b> is made out of nylon (e.g. Pebax), polyetheretherketone (PEEK), or polypropylene, and at least one electrode <b>110</b> is attached to the distal tip <b>108</b>, the electrode <b>110</b> being electrically couplable to an energy source. In one particular embodiment, the electrode <b>110</b> is electrically coupled to the actuator <b>112</b>, which itself may be made of an electrically conductive material and which may be capable of being electrically coupled to an energy source. Alternatively, one or more electrodes <b>110</b> are attached to the elongated member <b>102</b>, rather than to the actuator <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0056">In some embodiments, at least a portion of the distal end region <b>104</b> is structured to prevent unwanted damage to a body vasculature of a patient when the apparatus <b>100</b> is inserted therethrough. For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the distal tip <b>108</b> may have a substantially atraumatic shape, for example having a blunt or rounded edge, for preventing such damage as the apparatus <b>100</b> is maneuvered through the body vasculature. In other embodiments, the distal tip <b>108</b> may be substantially semispherical, hemispherical, spherical or flattened, or may have any other shape that is unlikely to damage tissues upon contact. Alternatively or in addition, in some embodiments, at least a portion of the distal end region <b>104</b> of the elongated member <b>102</b> has a reduced rigidity relatively to the proximal end region <b>106</b>. The reduced rigidity may serve to further decrease the ability of the elongated member <b>102</b> to puncture tissue, for example the tissue of a vessel wall, with the application of mechanical force. This reduced rigidity may be achieved by, for example, by the inclusion or substitution of a different material in the manufacture of the elongated member <b>102</b>, by reducing the amount of material present in at least a portion of the distal end region <b>104</b>, or by reducing the diameter of the actuator <b>112</b>. Material may be removed, for example, by using a latticework or other discontinuous structural framework, or alternatively by thinning the wall of a portion of the elongated member <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0057">In some embodiments, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the elongated member <b>102</b> defines a lumen <b>116</b>, as will be described further herein below, and the wall thickness of the elongated member <b>102</b> tapers in the portion of distal end region <b>104</b> approaching the distal tip <b>108</b>. For example, the elongated member <b>102</b> may taper from inside to outside, thereby maintaining a consistent outer diameter and having a changing inner diameter. Alternatively, the elongated member <b>102</b> may taper from outside to inside, thereby maintaining a consistent inner diameter and having a changing outer diameter, or from both the inside and the outside thereby having the outer diameter decrease and the inner diameter increase.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0058">As has been mentioned above, the apparatus <b>100</b>, as shown in the illustrated embodiments, includes an electrode <b>110</b> located about the distal end region <b>104</b>. The electrode <b>110</b> may be integral with one or both of the elongated member <b>102</b> and the actuator <b>112</b> or may be otherwise attached to the distal tip <b>108</b>. For example, the distal tip <b>108</b> may be covered with an electrically conductive cap, the cap thus forming the electrode <b>110</b>. In embodiments wherein the electrode <b>110</b> is not integral with one or both of the elongated member <b>102</b> and actuator <b>112</b>, the electrode <b>110</b> may be otherwise electrically coupled to one or both of the elongated member <b>102</b> and actuator <b>112</b> or to another wire operable to electrically couple electrode <b>110</b> to an energy source. For example, in one embodiment, the electrode <b>110</b> is integral with the actuator <b>112</b> and may be associated with the distal tip <b>108</b> by being passed through the elongated member <b>102</b>. Alternatively, when the apparatus <b>100</b> comprises a core wire, as described hereinabove, the electrode <b>110</b> may be integral with the core wire.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0059">The electrode <b>110</b> may be larger or smaller, or may have the same diameter, as the distal tip <b>108</b>. In some embodiments, the electrode <b>110</b> is sized to be operable to generate sufficient heat to create the channel in the foreign material, when energy is supplied to the electrode at a sufficient power level. In the context of the present invention, the term foreign material encompasses any material foreign to the body being treated including synthetic materials. In one specific embodiment, the electrode may measure from about 0.40 mm to about 0.43 mm in diameter and from about 1.2 mm to about 1.5 mm in length.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0060">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, as has been mentioned above, the elongated member <b>102</b> defines a lumen <b>116</b> extending at least partially therethrough. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> shows one embodiment of a centrally located substantially circular lumen <b>116</b> defined by the elongated member <b>102</b>. In alternative embodiments, the lumen <b>116</b> has any other suitable alternative shape and size and may be eccentrically located through the elongated member <b>102</b>. In other embodiments that do not comprise the lumen <b>116</b>, the elongated member <b>102</b> is a substantially solid structure. The lumen <b>116</b> may be sized to receive the actuator <b>112</b> therein, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. For example, in some embodiments, the lumen <b>116</b> is large enough to receive the actuator <b>112</b>, but is not large enough to accommodate other wires, sensors, or the passage of fluid. In further embodiments, the lumen <b>116</b> is sized to receive the actuator <b>112</b> along with one or more wires but is still not be large enough to accommodate fluid flow. In one specific embodiment, the lumen <b>116</b> measures about 0.1 mm to about 1.0 mm in diameter. The flexibility of the elongated member <b>102</b> may be dependent, in part, on the wall thickness of the elongated member <b>102</b>, between an inner diameter defined by the lumen <b>116</b> and an outer diameter. In one particular embodiment, the elongated member <b>102</b> has a wall thickness measuring about 0.01 mm to about 0.2 mm. The flexibility of the elongated member <b>102</b> is also dependant on the outer diameter of the elongated member <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the elongated member <b>102</b> has a beam strength of at least 0.001 lbf as measured by the ASTM E855-90 3-point bent test.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0061">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A</figref>, <b>1</b>B and <b>2</b>, the actuator <b>112</b> is operable to direct at least a portion of the distal end region <b>104</b> in a desired direction. In one embodiment, the actuator <b>112</b> comprises a single pull-wire disposed within the lumen <b>116</b> of the elongated member <b>102</b> and attached to at least one point in the distal end region <b>104</b> of the elongated member <b>102</b>. For example, the actuator <b>112</b> may be attached to the distal end region <b>104</b> at or adjacent to the distal tip <b>108</b>. The actuator <b>112</b> may be relatively thin, in some embodiments, in order to allow the inner diameter of the elongated member <b>102</b> to be reduced, thus potentially reducing the diameter of the apparatus <b>100</b> as a whole. In one particular embodiment, the actuator <b>112</b> measures from about 0.03 mm to about 0.30 mm in diameter.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0062">The actuator <b>112</b> may be attached to the elongated member <b>102</b> such that manipulation of the actuator <b>112</b> via the application of mechanical energy to transmit tension along the length of the actuator <b>112</b> may effect a change in the elongated member <b>102</b>. For example, in some embodiments, manipulation of the actuator <b>112</b> may cause at least a portion of the elongated member <b>102</b> to change shape. Such a change of shape may involve the adoption of a bent configuration, wherein, the term &#x201c;bent&#x201d; is defined to mean having a deviation from a straight line; this may take the form of a rigid bend or a subtler curve, with one or more angles of curvature. In other embodiments, this change of shape may involve a compression, or accordion-like collapsing of the elongated member <b>102</b>, wherein one or more sections of the elongated member <b>102</b> fold or bend backwards. Such an effect may cause the position of the distal tip <b>108</b> to change, without necessarily inducing any deviation of the distal tip <b>108</b> away from the longitudinal axis of the distal end region <b>104</b> (i.e. the distal tip <b>108</b> may still point in its original direction).</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0063">In other embodiments of the present invention, the apparatus <b>100</b> may comprise other means for directing at least a portion of the distal end region <b>104</b> in a desired direction. For example, the apparatus <b>100</b> may comprise one or more electro-magnetic, piezoelectric or hydraulic mechanisms for changing the shape of the elongated member <b>102</b>. In one such embodiment, the apparatus <b>100</b> may comprise at least one magnetically responsive element, which may assist in guiding the apparatus <b>100</b> to a desired direction upon the application of a magnetic field.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0064">In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> includes a pre-formed curved section. In such embodiments, the distal tip <b>108</b> may be directed in a desired direction by applying torque to the proximal end region <b>106</b>. In such embodiments, an actuator may not be required.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0065">With respect now to the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the distal end region <b>104</b> of the elongated member <b>102</b> may contain one or more notches <b>200</b> to aid in a change of shape of the elongated member <b>102</b> when tension is applied through the actuator <b>112</b>. For the purposes of this description, the notches <b>200</b> may be any regions wherein discontinuities are present in the wall of the elongated member <b>102</b>. In some embodiments, the notches <b>200</b> comprise scores, cuts, or other discontinuities in either the inner or outer surface of the wall of the elongated member <b>102</b> that do not completely traverse the circumference of the elongated member <b>102</b>. In alternative embodiments, the notches <b>200</b> comprise regions wherein entire sections of the wall of the elongated member <b>102</b> are absent. In one specific example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, one or more sections of the wall of the elongated member <b>102</b>, each section extending at least 180 degrees around the circumference of the elongated member <b>102</b>, are absent, which may result in a toothed or serrated appearance. Notches <b>200</b> are present, for example, along about 5 mm to about 50 mm of the length of the elongated member <b>102</b>. The notches <b>200</b> may be regularly or irregularly spaced, identically, similarly or dissimilarly sized, oriented at any angle with respect to the elongated member <b>102</b> and may lie at any suitable angles along the elongated member <b>102</b>. The notches <b>200</b> may have abrupt edges or may comprise regions where the thickness of a wall of the elongated member <b>102</b> changes gradually to create a discontinuity.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0066">In other embodiments, the notches <b>200</b> comprise regions composed of a material different than that of the surrounding body of the elongated member <b>102</b>. For example, in one embodiment, the elongated member <b>102</b> is made primarily of stainless steel while the notches <b>200</b> comprise regions of the elongated member <b>102</b> made of a different material, for example an elastic compound. The notches <b>200</b> thus represent discontinuities in the material of the wall of the elongated member <b>102</b>, without necessarily changing the profile or thickness of the elongated member <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0067">The notches <b>200</b> may be operable to assist in directing a change in shape of the elongated member <b>102</b> when a force is applied to the elongated member <b>102</b> through an actuator <b>112</b>. In one such embodiment as described above, the application of tension to the actuator <b>112</b> applies a force to an attachment point at the distal tip <b>108</b>, pulling the attachment point in a proximal direction. As notches <b>200</b> may serve to locally increase the flexibility of the elongated member <b>102</b>, the elongated member <b>102</b> may change shape to, for example, bend preferentially in the direction of the notches <b>200</b> when tension is applied. Thus, in some embodiments, the notches <b>200</b> may be shaped and positioned around the elongated member <b>102</b> such that the elongated member <b>102</b> will adopt a certain specific curve or series of curves when tension is applied to the actuator <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0068">In some embodiments of the present invention, and referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, apparatus <b>100</b> includes a handle <b>300</b> mechanically coupled to the proximal end region <b>106</b> of the elongated member <b>102</b>. The handle <b>300</b> may be suitable for grasping and manipulating the apparatus <b>100</b>, for example during insertion, positioning or guiding thereof, and may, in some embodiments, be operable to facilitate a change in shape of the elongated member <b>102</b>. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, in some embodiments, the handle <b>300</b> comprises a housing <b>302</b>, a first securing component <b>304</b> and a second securing component <b>306</b>. The handle <b>300</b> may further comprise a means for connecting an energy source to one or more of the elongated member <b>102</b>, the actuator <b>112</b> and any other electrical conductor operable to deliver energy to the electrode <b>110</b>. For example, the handle <b>300</b> may comprise an electrical connector for connecting to an energy source. In such embodiments, the electrical connector may be coupled to handle the <b>300</b> via an electrical cable. Alternatively, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, the actuator <b>112</b> may extend from a proximal end of the handle <b>300</b> and may be operable to be electrically coupled to an energy source.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0069">The first securing component <b>304</b> may be operable to secure the handle <b>300</b> to the elongated member <b>102</b>, while the second securing component <b>306</b> is operable to secure the handle to the actuator <b>112</b>. In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3B to 3D</figref>, the second securing component <b>306</b> comprises a clamping apparatus operable to securely engage the actuator <b>112</b>. Actuation of the handle <b>300</b> via, for example, a button <b>310</b>, may effect a change in the relative positions of the first securing component <b>304</b> and the second securing component <b>306</b>, thus causing the elongated member <b>102</b> and/or actuator <b>112</b> to move with respect to one another. However, actuation of the handle <b>300</b> may be achieved using any means for displacing a wire or similar component, including but not limited to one or more of a button, a knob and a switch. Actuation of the handle <b>300</b> may involve the use of mechanical (including linear, rotational and other forces) and/or electrical energy and may be accomplished remotely. In some embodiments, the handle <b>300</b> includes a ratcheting mechanism to maintain tension in the actuator <b>112</b>, for example by maintaining the position of one or more of the first securing component <b>304</b> and the second securing component <b>306</b> following actuation of the handle <b>300</b>. In some embodiments, the handle <b>300</b> may be removable. For example, in one such embodiment, the first and second securing components <b>304</b> and <b>306</b> are each detachable from the elongated member <b>102</b> and the actuator <b>112</b>, respectively. In such embodiments, the handle <b>300</b> may further be re-attachable after having been removed. Furthermore, in such embodiments, the handle <b>300</b> may additionally comprise one or more visual markers and/or one or more locks or other fastening mechanisms to aid in the positioning and attachment of the first securing component and the second securing component <b>306</b> respectively to the elongated member <b>102</b> and the actuator <b>112</b>. Such markers and/or locks may be useful to orient the direction of bending of the elongated member <b>102</b> with respect to the handle <b>300</b>, and to calibrate the actuator <b>112</b> to the amount of tension already present in the actuating mechanism. In embodiments comprising an actuator <b>112</b> that utilizes means other than tension to direct apparatus <b>100</b> in a desired direction, the handle <b>300</b> may be operable to manipulate the actuator to effect the desired change in direction.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0070">In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, any portion of the elongated member <b>102</b>, the actuator <b>112</b>, the notches <b>200</b>, the electrode <b>110</b> or the insulating material <b>114</b> may comprise one or more markers. Such markers may include visual markers, tactile markers, radiopaque markers, radiolucent markers, or any other markers used to aid in the visualization, localization, navigation, insertion, or detection of apparatus <b>100</b>. Markers may be externally applied to a component, and may be of a variety of shapes and structures; they may be raised from the surface of a component or may conform to the surface of the component; and they may be internal to a component. In some embodiments, components may be manufactured in whole or in part from materials that provide a visual or tactile distinction, thus acting themselves as markers. For example, in one embodiment, the insulating material <b>114</b> is manufactured from a radiopaque insulating material or from a material comprising radiopaque fillers. In another embodiment, one or more of the elongated member <b>102</b>, the distal tip <b>108</b>, the electrode <b>110</b> and the actuator <b>112</b> are plated with a radiopaque material, such as platinum or tungsten. In yet another embodiment, a radiopaque marker, such as a band, is welded or otherwise attached to, for example, the distal tip <b>108</b> or the electrode <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0071">In some embodiments, as mentioned hereinabove, any or all of the lumen <b>116</b>, the actuator <b>112</b> and the notches <b>200</b> may not be present in the apparatus, in order, for example, to simplify the process of manufacturing the apparatus <b>100</b> and make it more cost-effective. In addition, in such embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> may have substantially similar mechanical properties when compared to a standard mechanical guide-wire.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0072">In some embodiments of the present invention, the apparatus <b>100</b> further comprises one or more means for guiding the apparatus <b>100</b> within the body of the patient. For example, in one particular embodiment, the apparatus <b>100</b> further comprises an ultrasound transducer (not shown in the drawings) associated with the distal end region <b>104</b>. The ultrasound transducer (not shown in the drawings) may be operable as an intra-vascular ultrasound (IVUS) device, which may assist in determining the position of the apparatus <b>100</b> within a blood vessel, for example. In such an embodiment, the ultrasound transducer (not shown in the drawings) may be electrically connected to an ultrasound generator, for example via one or both of the elongated member <b>102</b> and the actuator <b>112</b>. In another specific embodiment, the apparatus <b>100</b> further comprises at least one optical fiber (not shown in the drawings) which may be optically coupled to an optical coherence reflectometry (OCR) system (not shown in the drawings), which may also assist in determining the position of the apparatus <b>100</b> within a blood vessel, for example. Another example of a suitable device or apparatus is described in application Ser. No. 12/926,292, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0073">Materials</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0074">In embodiments wherein the elongated member <b>102</b> takes the form or includes an electrically conductive core wire, as described hereinabove, it may be made of a biocompatible metal or metal alloy, for example, including, but not limited to, stainless steel or nitinol. The actuator <b>112</b> may be conductive, and may, in some embodiments, have a high tensile strength, thus being able to tolerate the application of sufficient force to cause a change in shape of the elongated member <b>102</b>, when a force is applied to the actuator <b>112</b>. An example of a material that is suitable for the actuator <b>112</b> is nitinol. The insulating material <b>114</b> may be composed from any material capable of providing electrical insulation, including, in some embodiments, Parylene or polytetrofluoroethylene (PTFE). The insulating material <b>114</b> may be applied to the elongated member <b>102</b> by a variety of methods including, but not limited to: being overlain onto the elongated member <b>102</b> and shrunk by the application of heat, being extruded over the elongated member <b>102</b>, and being sprayed or painted onto the elongated member <b>102</b> in liquid form. Suitable materials for radiopaque markers or components include, but are not limited to, high-density metals such as platinum, iridium, gold, silver, tantalum, and tungsten or their alloys, or radiopaque polymeric compounds. Although the above materials are suggested as being suitable options for the manufacture of components of the present invention, the list is by no means meant to be limiting, and any other components with suitable properties may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0075">Method</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0076">In some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> is usable to create a channel in a foreign material located the body of a patient (not shown in the drawings). This channel may be created, in some embodiments, at least partially by the delivery of energy using the electrode <b>110</b>. More specifically, the electrode <b>110</b> is energized with a radiofrequency current and the electrode <b>110</b> is then used to deliver energy into the foreign material to create the channel. In some embodiments, the energy delivered in the foreign material is thermal energy.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0077">Without being limited to a particular theory of operation, it is hypothesized that, in some embodiments, the proposed method is performed when the electrode <b>110</b>, which is energized with a radiofrequency current, heats up to a predetermined temperature. For example, the predetermined temperature may be substantially larger than a melting temperature of the foreign material. Then, thermal energy is transferred from the electrode <b>110</b> to the foreign material to substantially melt the foreign material adjacent to the electrode <b>110</b>, thereby creating a channel through the foreign material. In other embodiments, it is hypothesized that water may be absorbed by the foreign material, and radiofrequency energy that is thereafter delivered to the foreign material may cause vaporization of the water adjacent to the electrode <b>110</b>, thereby creating a channel through the foreign material.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0078">In some embodiments, heating of the electrode <b>110</b> is performed while the electrode <b>110</b> is positioned at a predetermined distance from the foreign material and from biological tissues adjacent to the foreign material. Positioning the electrode at a predetermined distance from the foreign material and from the biological tissues adjacent to the foreign material minimizes risks of injuring the biological tissues adjacent to the foreign material. For example, the predetermined distance is such that thermal energy transfer between the electrode <b>110</b> and either or both of the foreign material and biological tissues adjacent to the foreign material results in a non-damaging increase in temperature thereof. As mentioned hereinabove, the use of a radiofrequency current to heat the electrode <b>110</b> helps in minimizing this heat transfer, and therefore contributes to the practicality of the proposed method as the predetermined distance is then relatively small.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0079">Minimizing injuries to tissues is of paramount importance when performing interventions in patients. Indeed, injuring a tissue typically creates stress and inflammatory responses that may cause irreversible damages to many tissues. In addition, many patients have a relatively sensitive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) and local stresses to tissues can lead in these patients to systemic and psychiatric conditions and diseases. In some embodiments, the proposed method is performed in the heart of the patient. In these cases, these irreversible damages can lead to dysfunctions in the contractile and electrical conductivity properties of the cardiac tissue, which themselves can lead to life-threatening conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0080">It is hypothesized that providing the radiofrequency current to the electrode <b>110</b> within the body creates a layer of water vapor around the electrode <b>110</b>, which reduces thermal transfer between the electrode <b>110</b> and adjacent structures that are sufficiently spaced apart therefrom. This helps in ensuring a relatively fast heating of the electrode <b>110</b> and reduce risks of damaging biological tissues as described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0081">In such embodiments, the electrode <b>110</b> is then moved so as to be substantially adjacent to the foreign material. As the electrode has now attained a temperature substantially higher than the melting temperature of the foreign material, the electrode effectively melts the foreign material to create a channel therethrough.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0082">However, in alternative embodiments of the invention, positioning of the electrode <b>110</b> substantially adjacent to the foreign material, for example to a first surface of the foreign material, is performed before energizing the electrode <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0083">Generally speaking, the aforementioned specifics of the proposed method are typically part of a treatment procedure comprising the steps of: providing the apparatus <b>100</b>, or any other suitable apparatus; inserting at least a portion of the apparatus <b>100</b> into the body of the patient, for example by introducing the distal end region into the body of the patient; positioning the electrode <b>110</b> substantially adjacent to the material first surface; energizing the electrode <b>110</b> with a radiofrequency current; and using the electrode <b>110</b> energized with the radiofrequency current to deliver energy into the foreign material to create the channel. Further embodiments may comprise additional steps of, for example, manipulating an actuator, or otherwise guiding the apparatus <b>100</b> through one or more of the body vasculature of the patient and the channel.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0084">In accordance with embodiments of the treatment method aspects of the present invention, the apparatus <b>100</b> may be a component of a system including an energy source (not shown in the drawings) (such as, for example, the RFP-100 or RFP-200 Baylis Medical RF Puncture Generators, manufactured by Baylis Medical Company Inc., Montreal, Canada), and a grounding pad (not shown in the drawings) or any other return electrode, if operated in a monopolar mode.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> illustrates, in a flow-chart form, one embodiment of a method <b>400</b> in accordance with the present invention. This embodiment comprises: at step <b>402</b>, preparing a patient and a system for treatment; at step <b>404</b>, inserting a portion of the apparatus <b>100</b>, into the body vasculature of the patient; at step <b>406</b>, navigating the apparatus <b>100</b> through the body vasculature to a target site; at step <b>408</b>, changing a of shape, or otherwise reorienting the apparatus <b>100</b> in order to position the electrode <b>110</b>, or any other suitable electrode, adjacent at least a portion of the foreign material; at step <b>410</b>, confirming or otherwise assessing the position of the electrode <b>110</b>; at step <b>412</b>, delivering energy via the apparatus <b>100</b> to create a channel in the foreign material; at step <b>414</b>, advancing the apparatus <b>100</b>, for example the distal end region <b>104</b> and the electrode <b>110</b>, through the channel; at step <b>416</b>, assessing the position of the electrode <b>110</b> or any other portion of the apparatus <b>100</b> after it has been advanced through the channel; and, at step <b>418</b>, performing an additional procedure at or around the target site. The reader skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the patient may be a human or an animal and that one or more of these steps may not necessarily be performed in a given procedure or that one or more of these steps may be performed in a different order, as will be further clarified hereinbelow.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0086">In step <b>402</b>, preparing a patient for treatment may include, but is not limited to one or more of: visualizing one or more treatment sites within the body of the patient using fluoroscopy, x-ray, contrast media, labeled markers such as radioactive compounds or solutions, using endoscopy procedures, using ultrasound, using Doppler imaging, or any other visualization method; characterizing the vascular system of the patient by measuring blood or serum levels of various compounds; measuring vascular pressure; and undertaking any other measuring or monitoring technique that may provide information that may be useful during any other step of the method. In step <b>402</b>, preparing a system for treatment may include, but is not limited to one or more of: connecting a treatment apparatus, for example the apparatus <b>100</b> as described above, to an energy source; connecting a grounding pad or other return electrode to the energy source; placing the grounding pad or return electrode on the body of the patient; passing the actuator <b>112</b> through the elongated member <b>102</b> (in some embodiments, the actuator <b>112</b> may be permanently threaded through the elongated member <b>102</b>, thus obviating this step), if the apparatus <b>100</b> comprises the actuator <b>112</b>; securing the handle <b>300</b> to the actuator <b>112</b> and the elongated member <b>102</b> (in some embodiments, the handle <b>300</b> may be permanently connected to the elongated member <b>102</b> and the actuator <b>112</b>, thus obviating this step); and attaching one or more additional components to the apparatus <b>100</b>. As mentioned above, one or more of these steps may not be performed in a particular procedure, depending on the apparatus <b>100</b> being used and the specific procedure being performed.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0087">The step <b>404</b> of inserting the apparatus <b>100</b> into the body vasculature of the patient may comprise percutaneously inserting the apparatus <b>100</b> into a blood vessel of the body vasculature through which the apparatus may be navigated to the target site. For example, in some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> may be inserted into a femoral artery or vein or a subclavian artery or vein. The apparatus may be inserted directly into the blood vessel or may be inserted through a guiding catheter or sheath.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0088">The step <b>406</b> of navigating the apparatus <b>100</b> through the body vasculature to a target site may involve advancing the apparatus <b>100</b> through the body vasculature to the target site. In some specific embodiments, in which the apparatus is inserted through a guiding sheath or catheter, the sheath or catheter may initially be navigated to the target site, for example by initially inserting a guidewire to the target site and then tracking the sheath/catheter over the guidewire. Once the sheath/catheter is in place, the guidewire may be removed and the apparatus <b>100</b> may be inserted through the sheath/catheter. Step <b>406</b> may additionally involve any of a variety of visualization techniques, including those techniques mentioned above for visualizing one or more treatment sites within the body of the patient. In one embodiment, the apparatus <b>100</b> may be furnished with one or more radiopaque markers, which may aid in the visualization of the apparatus <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0089">The step <b>408</b> of affecting a change of shape in the apparatus <b>100</b> may be required, for example if the step of navigating the apparatus <b>100</b> does not position the apparatus <b>100</b> sufficiently precisely. This step is, in some embodiments, accomplished by effecting a change of shape in the distal end region <b>104</b> of the elongated member <b>102</b>, as described hereinabove. In some embodiments, it may be desirable to approach the foreign material substantially perpendicularly, for example at an angle of about 80 degrees to about 100 degrees, and step <b>408</b> is usable to control this angle.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0090">The step <b>410</b> of confirming a position of the apparatus <b>100</b> may involve visualizing the position of one or more portions of the apparatus <b>100</b> within the body of the patient. For example, radiopaque markers included in the apparatus <b>100</b> may be visualized using fluoroscopy. Alternatively, or in addition, radiopaque contrast may be injected, for example through the guiding sheath/catheter, in order to confirm the position of the apparatus <b>100</b>. Furthermore, in some embodiments, the apparatus <b>100</b> may include a pressure sensor (not shown in the drawings) operatively coupled to the distal end region of the apparatus for measuring a pressure at or around the distal end of the apparatus. In such embodiments, blood pressure may be reassured in order to confirm the position of the apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0091">The step <b>412</b> of delivering energy may include an optional step of measuring, assessing or sensing the composition of the foreign material to be penetrated. For example, in one embodiment, the apparatus <b>100</b> may be used as part of an impedance monitor to determine the impedance of the material to be penetrated. The impedance value thus measured may then be compared to known impedance values of various materials in order to determine the composition of the material to be penetrated. Then, energizing the electrode <b>110</b> is performed, in some embodiments, at least in part, in a manner depending on the composition of the foreign material. For example, the electrode <b>110</b> may be energized at various power levels, depending on the nature of the foreign material. Alternatively, a change in impedance may indicate that the material in contact with the apparatus has changed. For example, a lower impedance may indicate that the apparatus is in contact with a metallic or otherwise conductive portion of a stent or scaffold, as opposed to the graft material associated with the stent/scaffold. In such a situation, a user may reposition the apparatus until a suitable impedance measurement is recorded indicating that the apparatus is substantially adjacent to the foreign material through which the channel is to be created.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0092">Alternatively, tactile feedback may be used to assist in determining the material in contact with the apparatus. For example, a user may use tactile feedback to determine whether the apparatus is in contact with metallic material of a stent/scaffold or more flexible graft material, through which a channel may be created. Alternatively, or in addition, imaging techniques (for example OCR and/or IVUS) may be used to determine the composition of material in contact with the apparatus <b>100</b>. As described hereinabove, the composition of the material to be penetrated may determine the initial parameters of energy delivery.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0093">The step <b>412</b> of delivering energy via the apparatus <b>100</b> to create a channel in the foreign material comprises, in one embodiment, delivering electromagnetic energy (for example electric energy in the radiofrequency (RF) range) to the electrode <b>110</b>. In one specific embodiment, the RF current provided may have a frequency in the range of from about 300 kHz to about 1 MHz, and more specifically, in very specific embodiments of the invention, of from about 460 kHz to about 500 kHz, and may be delivered with a power of at least about 5 W at a voltage of at least about 75 Volts (peak-to-peak).</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0094">In some embodiments, one or more parameters may be measured substantially while energy is being delivered and/or the device is being advanced. For example, impedance may be measured substantially continuously or at predetermined intervals during energy delivery and/or advancement of the apparatus and a change in impedance may lead to a change in energy delivery. In one particular example, a drop in impedance may indicate that the apparatus is contacting a metallic portion of a stent/scaffold and energy delivery may be stopped so that the device may be repositioned. The change in energy delivery may be automatic or may be manually performed by the user.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0095">In some embodiments of the invention, the energy may be delivered for a predetermined amount of time before stopping the delivery of the energy. In other embodiments, the intended user may decide, during the course of the procedure, on the amount of time during which energy should be delivered. The intended user's decision may depend, for example, on one or more of tactile feedback, impedance measurements, pressure measurements, predetermined information regarding the material being penetrated (e.g. the thickness of the material) or the preferences of the intended user. In one example, if a user feels that the device has penetrated through the foreign material he may stop delivering energy. In some embodiments, the amount of time during which energy is delivered is from about 0.1 seconds to about 5 seconds. In a more specific embodiment of the invention, the amount of time during which energy is delivered is from about 1 second to about 2 seconds. During these periods of time, the energy may be delivered continuously or as a pulsed waveform.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0096">The step <b>414</b> of advancing the apparatus through the channel may comprise applying a longitudinal force to the proximal end region <b>106</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b> in order to advance the distal end region <b>104</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b> through the channel. Alternatively, mechanical or magnetic means for advancing the apparatus may be used. In some embodiments, step <b>414</b> occurs at least partially concurrently with step <b>412</b>, such that the apparatus is advanced while energy is being delivered.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0097">Following step <b>414</b>, the position of the apparatus <b>100</b>, after passing through the channel, may be confirmed at step <b>416</b>. Step <b>416</b> may be performed in substantially the same manner as step <b>410</b>, described hereinabove.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0098">The step <b>418</b> of performing another treatment procedure may involve, in some embodiments, one or more of: introducing a balloon catheter, a dilator or other means for dilation of the channel, to the target site, for example overtop of or through the apparatus <b>100</b>; introducing a stent or other supporting structure to the target site, for example overtop of or through the apparatus <b>100</b>; delivering a pharmaceutical compound to the target site; delivering energy to create a lesion or coagulate tissue or fluid in the vicinity of the target site; introducing embolic coils; placing an IVUS or OCR probe for visualization; or adding or removing any other material to or from the site. In addition, this step may further comprise removal and possible re-attachment of the handle <b>300</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b>, in order to allow for the introduction of another device to the treatment site. As mentioned hereinabove, in alternative embodiments of the invention, the electrode <b>110</b> is energized after having been positioned adjacent to the foreign material.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0099">Embodiments of the treatment procedure described above may be particularly useful to create a channel through material of a stent graft occluding one or more vessels of a patient's body. Several examples of such applications are noted hereinbelow. While these examples have been described in specific detail, one of skill in the art will appreciate that embodiments of the present invention may be utilized in various other procedures and applications.</p>

<heading id="h-0008" level="1">Example 1</heading>
<p id="p-0097" num="0100">In a first example, an embodiment of a proposed method is used to create a channel <b>512</b>, seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref>, within a septal patch <b>510</b> made of foreign material, the septal patch <b>510</b> defining a material first surface <b>514</b> and a substantially opposed material second surface <b>516</b>. The channel <b>512</b> extends between the material first and second surfaces <b>514</b> and <b>516</b>. The septal patch <b>510</b> extends across an aperture <b>518</b> defined by the septum <b>520</b> of the heart <b>500</b> of the patient, for example an atrial septum or a ventricular septum. For example, the septal patch <b>510</b> covers the aperture and extends in a plane outside of the septum <b>520</b>. In other examples, the septal patch <b>510</b> extends inside the aperture <b>518</b>. Some of these procedures may involve patients that have had a septal defect repaired with the septal patch <b>510</b>. In some cases, such patients may suffer from one or more conditions which require access to the left side of the heart for treatment to be performed. In such situations, access to the left side of the heart may be gained by creating the channel <b>512</b> in the septal patch <b>510</b>. In such embodiments, the septal patch <b>510</b> may be made of a foreign material selected from the group consisting of polyethylene terephthalate (PET, for example Dacron&#xae;), cotton, a polyester material and fabrics thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0101">With reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>, the apparatus <b>100</b> is inserted through the inferior vena cava <b>502</b> into the right atrium <b>506</b> of the heart <b>500</b>. In alternative embodiments, access to the right atrium may be achieved via the superior vena cava <b>504</b> as described, for example, in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/265,304 (Filed on Nov. 3, 2005), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> shows the apparatus <b>100</b> positioned in the right atrium <b>506</b> with the electrode <b>110</b> located substantially adjacent the material first surface <b>514</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> shows the apparatus <b>100</b> positioned in the left atrium <b>508</b> after being advanced through the channel <b>512</b>. In this particular embodiment, radiofrequency energy may be delivered, for example, at about 5 W for a period of less than about 5 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0102">In a further example application, an embodiment of a method according to the present invention may be useful, for example, to create a channel within a graft composed of foreign material. In some embodiments, the graft is associated with a substantially tubular supporting structure, for example a stent, located within an elongated vessel of the body of the patient. In some such embodiments, the method is performed in order to restore blood flow to a branch of the elongated vessel being occluded by the graft material, thus substantially preventing fluid communication between the branch and the elongated vessel, by creating a channel through the material.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0103">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A</figref>, <b>6</b>B, <b>7</b>A and <b>7</b>B, methods for in-situ creation of a channel through a stent-graft are illustrated. In the illustrated embodiments, a stent-graft <b>606</b>, composed of a foreign material, has been placed to cover an aneurysm <b>604</b> in an abdominal aorta <b>600</b>. As shown in these figures, stent-graft <b>606</b> occludes the renal arteries ostia <b>605</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0104">This positioning of the stent-graft <b>606</b> is typically necessitated by an inadequate, i.e. too short, proximal neck of the abdominal aorta <b>600</b>. One of the greatest challenges of stent-grafting an abdominal aortic aneurysms <b>604</b> is to obtain a long proximal attachment site to ensure a good seal without occluding the renal or supra-aortic vessels. If a long proximal site is unavailable, the ostia of the renal and/or supra-aortic vessels may become occluded by the stent-graft <b>606</b>. The present invention provides a method for creating a transluminal in-situ channel in order to restore blood flow to any vessels that do become occluded during the course of such a procedure.</p>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Example 2</heading>
<p id="p-0102" num="0105">With reference first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>, an antegrade approach to in-situ channel creation is provided. In this approach, the distal end region <b>104</b> is introduced into the body of the patient through the body vasculature inside the thoracic cavity, or in other words from a position superior to the diaphragm of the patient, and advanced towards the abdominal aorta <b>600</b> in which the electrode <b>110</b> is then positioned. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref> shows the electrode <b>110</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b> positioned in the abdominal aorta <b>600</b> substantially opposite the renal artery ostium <b>605</b>, which is occluded by the stent-graft <b>606</b>. At this point, energy may be delivered from an energy source through the electrode <b>110</b> in order to create a channel <b>608</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, in or through the stent-graft <b>606</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> shows the electrode <b>110</b> after it has been advanced through the channel <b>608</b> into the renal artery <b>602</b>. Creation of the channel allows for fluid communication and restoration of blood flow between the abdominal aorta <b>600</b> and the renal artery <b>602</b>. At this point, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the channel <b>608</b> may be dilated using one or more of a dilator and a balloon (for example a cutting balloon) and a stent may be placed across the channel <b>608</b> to maintain the patency of the renal artery <b>602</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0106">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, a retrograde approach is illustrated. In this approach, introducing the distal end region <b>104</b> into the body of the patient includes introducing the distal end region into the body vasculature and through the renal artery <b>602</b> towards the abdominal aorta <b>600</b>. In such an embodiment, positioning the electrode <b>110</b> substantially adjacent to a material first surface then includes positioning the electrode <b>110</b> substantially adjacent to the renal artery ostium <b>605</b> outside of the abdominal aorta <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0107">With reference first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the electrode <b>110</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b> is positioned in the renal artery <b>602</b> at the renal artery ostium <b>605</b>, which is occluded by the stent-graft <b>606</b>. At this point, energy may be delivered from an energy source through the electrode <b>110</b> in order to create a channel <b>608</b> in or through the stent-graft <b>606</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> shows the electrode <b>110</b> after it has been advanced through the channel <b>608</b> into the abdominal aorta <b>600</b>. As mentioned hereinabove, creation of the channel <b>608</b> may allow for fluid communication and the restoration of blood flow between the abdominal aorta <b>600</b> and the renal artery <b>602</b>. At this point, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the channel <b>608</b> may be dilated using one or more of a dilator and a balloon (for example a cutting balloon) and a stent may be placed across the channel to maintain the potency of the renal artery. It should be noted that in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7A and 7B</figref>, step <b>404</b> of the method comprises obtaining access to renal artery <b>602</b>, for example during a surgical procedure or via a deep puncture.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0108">It should be noted that, although this example has been described in conjunction with treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, a similar method is also contemplated for treating a thoracic aortic aneurysm, whereby a subclavian artery, for example, may become occluded by a stent-graft. Such a condition may be more easily treated using a retrograde approach, by inserting an apparatus through the subclavian artery towards the aorta. In addition, vessels other than the renal arteries <b>602</b> may be occluded by an abdominal aortic stent-graft, for example the mesenteric arteries (not shown in the drawings). Alternatively, similar embodiments of the method may be practiced in other situations whereby a vessel ostium (or any portion of an elongated vessel, tube and/or duct) in a patient's body is occluded by a foreign material.</p>
<heading id="h-0010" level="1">Example 3</heading>
<p id="p-0106" num="0109">With reference now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8D</figref>, alternate methods for in-situ creation of a channel through a stent-graft are illustrated. In the illustrated embodiments, a stent-graft <b>806</b>, composed of a foreign material, has been placed to cover an aneurysm <b>804</b> in a section of the descending aorta, more specifically, within the thoracic aorta <b>800</b>. As shown in these figures, the stent-graft <b>806</b> occludes the opening or ostium <b>805</b> of the Left Subclavian Artery (LSA) <b>802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0110">In the illustrated example, the positioning of the stent-graft <b>806</b> at the LSA ostium <b>805</b> is necessitated by the proximity of the LSA ostium <b>805</b> to the site of the aneurysm <b>804</b>. A challenge is generally presented when an aneurysm <b>804</b> occurs within a vessel near an ostium of a side branch vessel, such as the LSA <b>802</b>. It may become difficult to place the stent-graft <b>806</b> within the vessel to ensure protection of the aneurysm <b>804</b> while maintaining patency of the side branch ostium. In one such example, the aneurysm <b>804</b> and the LSA ostium <b>805</b> are located substantially adjacent each other. &#x201c;Adjacent&#x201d; may be taken to mean next to, in proximity to, near to, or in the vicinity of. In one example the aneurysm <b>804</b> and the LSA ostium <b>805</b> are located opposite to one another along the coronal and/or saggital planes. In other words, the aneurysm <b>804</b> and the LSA ostium <b>805</b> are radially opposed to one another. In a further example, the aneurysm <b>804</b> and the ostium <b>805</b> may be positioned axially adjacent to one another. In other words, the aneurysm <b>804</b> and the LSA ostium <b>805</b> may be positioned substantially collinearly with respect to each other. Thus, the proximity of the aneurysm <b>804</b> to the LSA ostium may necessitate the positioning of the stent-graft <b>806</b> such that it covers the aneurysm <b>804</b> but also occludes the LSA ostium. This positioning of the stent-graft <b>806</b> is typically necessitated by an inadequate, i.e. too short, proximal neck of the thoracic aorta <b>800</b>. One of the greatest challenges of stent-grafting a thoracic aortic anerurysm <b>804</b> is to obtain a long proximal attachment site to ensure a good seal without occluding any of the side branch vessels such as the Left Subclavian Artery (LSA) <b>802</b>, the Right Subclavian Artery (RSA) <b>808</b>, Left Common Carotid Artery (LCCA) <b>810</b> or Right Common Carotid Artery (RCCA) <b>812</b>. If a long proximal site is unavailable, then an ostium of a side branch vessel may become occluded by the stent-graft <b>806</b>. For the specific case shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A-8D</figref>, to treat a thoracic aortic aneurysm, the LSA ostium may become occluded by the stent-graft <b>806</b>. This illustrated embodiment of the present invention provides a method for creating a transluminal in-situ channel in order to restore blood flow to any vessels that do become occluded during the course of such a procedure.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0111">With reference first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B</figref>, and <b>8</b>C, a retrograde approach to in-situ channel creation is illustrated. In this approach, introducing the distal end region <b>104</b> of apparatus <b>100</b> into the body of the patient includes introducing the distal end region <b>104</b> into the body vasculature and through the left subclavian artery (LSA) <b>802</b> towards the thoracic aorta <b>800</b>. In one specific example, a guide sheath <b>900</b> is introduced into the body of the patient through the body vasculature and advanced into the LSA via the left brachial artery. The sheath <b>900</b> is advanced till a distal end of the sheath <b>900</b> is located about 5 cm from the stent-graft <b>806</b>. The apparatus <b>100</b> according to an embodiment of the present invention, along with a guide catheter (not shown), is then be inserted through the guide sheath <b>900</b>. The distal end region <b>104</b> of apparatus <b>100</b> is then advanced towards the LSA such that the electrode <b>110</b> is positioned adjacent the stent-graft <b>806</b> that is occluding the LSA ostium <b>805</b>. In such an embodiment, positioning the electrode <b>110</b> substantially adjacent to a material first surface includes positioning the electrode <b>110</b> substantially adjacent to the LSA ostium <b>805</b> outside of the thoracic aorta <b>800</b>. In some embodiments, a curved guide catheter or a centering mechanism may be used to direct the apparatus <b>100</b> towards the center of the LSA to position electrode <b>110</b> at the desired target location. In one example, a balloon catheter may be used to centre the apparatus <b>100</b> within the vessel.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0112">When creating a channel through a stent-draft such as stent-graft <b>806</b>, a strut <b>807</b> of the stent forming the stent-graft <b>806</b> may obstruct advancement of apparatus <b>100</b> through the stent-graft <b>806</b>. In some embodiments of the present invention, a guide catheter is used to direct the apparatus <b>100</b> around the strut <b>807</b>, as follows: The guide catheter and apparatus <b>100</b> may be aligned with the stent such that they are positioned against the strut <b>807</b>. Gentle buckling of the catheter/apparatus assembly may be used to confirm that the catheter/apparatus assembly is positioned against the stent. The guide catheter may be incrementally adjusted around the strut <b>807</b> such that it is no-longer blocked by the strut <b>807</b>. In some embodiments, a Right Anterior Oblique (RAO) view under fluoroscopic imaging may be used to guide the catheter and the apparatus <b>100</b> to the appropriate position.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0113">Once the electrode is positioned appropriately, energy is delivered through the electrode <b>110</b> to puncture through the graft to create a channel <b>808</b> there-through. In some embodiments, the energy may be applied at a voltage of about 400 Vrms, with a duty cycle of 25 ms ON/975 ms OFF. In one particular example, energy is applied using the Baylis RFP-200 Generator at a high power setting for 2 seconds to puncture the graft/fabric of the stent-graft. In another example, it may be sufficient to deliver energy twice at durations of 1 second. The apparatus <b>100</b> may then be advanced into the stent-graft <b>806</b> under fluoroscopic guidance. In some embodiments, the energy may be delivered with the power being in the range of between about 30 Watts to about a 100 Watts; and the voltage may be in the range of between about 300 Vrms to about 500 Vrms. In some embodiments the energy may be applied for duration of at least 25 ms. Furthermore, in some embodiment the ON period of the duty cycle may range from between about 25 ms to about 1000 ms.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0114"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8D</figref> shows the electrode <b>110</b> after it has been advanced through the channel <b>808</b> into the thoracic aorta <b>800</b>. As mentioned hereinabove, creation of the channel <b>808</b> may allow for fluid communication and the restoration of blood flow between the thoracic aorta <b>800</b> and the LSA <b>802</b>. At this point, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the channel <b>808</b> may be dilated using one or more of a dilator and a balloon (for example a cutting balloon) and a stent may be placed across the channel to maintain the patency of the LSA. It should be noted that in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8B and 8C</figref>, step <b>404</b> of the method comprises obtaining access to LSA <b>802</b>, for example during a surgical procedure or via a deep puncture.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0115">An additional challenge that may be faced when creating a channel through a stent-graft using radiofrequency energy is contact of the energized electrode with a strut, for example strut <b>807</b>, of the stent-graft <b>806</b>. Embodiments of the present invention provide a method for indicating a metal contact error if the electrode <b>110</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b> is in contact with the strut <b>807</b>. In accordance with such embodiments, the energy delivery system prevents delivery of energy when the electrode <b>110</b> is positioned adjacent to or in contact with the metallic strut <b>807</b> but allows the apparatus <b>100</b> to delivery energy near the electrically conductive strut <b>807</b> of the stent-graft <b>806</b>. This allows the physician to continue to deliver energy from the electrode <b>110</b> and steer the electrode <b>110</b> away from the strut <b>807</b>. Thus, the orientation or position of the electrode <b>110</b> may be re-adjusted by moving it around or away from the metal strut <b>807</b>, while power is being delivered. This allows the user to deliver energy from electrode <b>110</b> while it is positioned close to the metallic strut <b>807</b>, allowing electrode <b>110</b> to cut through the stent-graft <b>806</b>, but generating a &#x201c;metal detect&#x201d; error if the electrode <b>110</b> is in contact with the metallic strut <b>807</b> or close enough to produce undesired arcing.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0116">With reference first to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9A and 9B</figref>, an antegrade approach to in-situ channel creation is provided. In this approach, the distal end region <b>104</b> is introduced into the body of the patient through the body vasculature and advanced towards the thoracic aorta <b>800</b> in which the electrode <b>110</b> is then positioned. In one specific example, femoral access is used to guide the distal end region <b>104</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b> into the lumen of the stent-graft <b>806</b> that is positioned within the thoracic aorta. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> shows the electrode <b>110</b> of the apparatus <b>100</b> positioned in the thoracic aorta <b>800</b> substantially opposite the left subclavian artery (LSA) ostium <b>805</b>, which is occluded by the stent-graft <b>806</b>. At this point, energy may be delivered from an energy source through the electrode <b>110</b> in order to create a channel <b>808</b>, as seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>, in or through the stent-graft <b>806</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> shows the electrode <b>110</b> after it has been advanced through the channel <b>808</b> into the left subclavian artery (LSA) <b>802</b>. Creation of the channel allows for fluid communication and restoration of blood flow between the thoracic aorta <b>800</b> and the LSA <b>802</b>. At this point, as described above with respect to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the channel <b>808</b> may be dilated using one or more of a dilator and a balloon (for example a cutting balloon) and a stent may be placed across the channel <b>808</b> to maintain the patency of the LSA <b>802</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0117"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a flow chart illustrating an example of such a method. As shown by step <b>1004</b>, an energy delivery device such as apparatus <b>100</b> may be positioned within a region of tissue at a target location within a patient's body. At step <b>1006</b>, an RF power source may be used to supply RF energy to the apparatus <b>100</b>. An energy delivery parameter, for example the current output from the ground return pathway of the apparatus <b>100</b>, is monitored. The measured values of the current are compared to a predetermined current range or magnitude threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0118">At step <b>1008</b>, the measured current is analyzed to determine if it is greater than the predetermined threshold or range. If the current has peak currents that exceed the current magnitude threshold or normal operational currents, at step <b>1010</b> an excess current or over-current is recorded. If the monitored current is within the range of normal operational currents (below the predetermined current threshold), then the delivery of energy through the energy delivery device will not be interrupted and energy delivery can continue at step <b>906</b> and the current can continue to be monitored. At step <b>1012</b>, a determination is made to assess whether or not the extent of over-currents recorded within a time period is greater than a predetermined sensitivity threshold and, if it is, then the energy delivery may be adjusted at step <b>1014</b>. In one example, adjustment of the energy delivery comprises stopping the delivery of energy. In some embodiments, the extent of over-currents recorded may be determined in terms of the sum or magnitude of the over-currents recorded. In other embodiments, the extent of over-currents recorded may be determined in terms of the number or quantity of over-currents recorded. If the extent of over-currents is below the sensitivity threshold, then at step <b>1006</b> the energy delivery is continued while monitoring the current. Such a method as described above can thereby be utilized to prevent delivery of energy to the electrode when it would be detrimental to the patient to do so, for example when the electrode is positioned too close to a strut of the stent graft. Further details regarding the generation of a &#x201c;metal detect&#x201d; error as described hereinabove are found in U.S. provisional application No. 60/827,446, previously incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0119">A method for transluminal in-situ channel formation, for example as described herein, allows for more accurate placement of the channel, less reliance on preoperative imaging, increased availability and decreased cost of a &#x201c;universal&#x201d;, non-customized graft, and eventually, more accessibility for a greater number of patients to the advantages of endovascular repair. As well, the technique could be used as a &#x2018;salvage&#x2019; procedure when inadvertent coverage of side branches occurs. Most importantly, it would allow more accurate placement of the channels with the stent-graft in place in the aorta, rather than based on preoperative radiographic imaging.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0120">The methods of the present invention provide a surprising and unexpected result in that energy, for example radiofrequency electrical energy is usable to create a channel in foreign material within the body of the patient, including, for example, synthetic material substantially not composed of cellular-based biological tissue (although it may, in some embodiments, be covered with live cells if, for example, it has been implanted in the body for a sufficient amount of time). In addition, embodiments of the present invention may minimize the risk of accidental puncture or perforation of a blood vessel or other bodily structure. Furthermore, embodiments of the present invention provide for the creation of a channel without requiring a mechanical tear of the foreign material. The methods of the present invention may also be useful in other applications, including, in general, wherever foreign material in a patient's body should be penetrated.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0121">Many other methods and particular applications may be used with an apparatus of the present invention, and some embodiments of the method of the present invention may be used with an apparatus other than that specifically described in the &#x201c;APPARATUS&#x201d; section of this application.</p>
