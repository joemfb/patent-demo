<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Bidirectional iterative beam forming techniques are described. An apparatus may include a wireless device having an antenna control module operative to initiate beam formation operations using an iterative training scheme to form a pair of communications channels for a wireless network, the antenna control module to communicate training signals and feedback information with a peer device via the transceiver and phased antenna array using partially or fully formed high rate channels, and iteratively determine antenna-array weight vectors for a directional transmit beam pattern for the phased antenna array using feedback information from the peer device. Other embodiments are described and claimed.</p>

Recent innovations in Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) communications operating at the 60 Gigahertz (GHz) frequency band promises several Gigabits-per-second (Gbps) throughput within short ranges of approximately 10 meters. Because of the large signal attenuation and limited transmission power, many 60 GHz devices will rely on antenna arrays with high directivity gain to achieve the 10 meter coverage. These devices use techniques to steer a &#x201c;beam&#x201d; from a transmitter antenna array around obstacles to find the best path to a receiver antenna array, thereby directing much of the antenna gain towards the receiver antenna array. Techniques to discover and direct energy between antenna arrays of peer devices is typically referred to as &#x201c;beam forming&#x201d; or &#x201c;beam steering&#x201d; or &#x201c;beam searching.&#x201d; Beam forming generally attempts to steer an antenna beam at a transmitter while at the same time focusing a receiver antenna in the direction of incoming power from the transmitter. Conventional beam forming protocols, however, typically take a significant amount of training time before a final high-speed communication channel is established between peer devices. Consequently, techniques designed to reduce overhead associated with training time are desirable.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Various embodiments may be generally directed to bidirectional iterative beam forming techniques for wireless communication systems. Some embodiments may be particularly directed to an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol designed to concurrently generate bidirectional communication channels between two or more wireless devices over a wireless network, such as a 60 Ghz mmWave wireless video area network (WVAN) or wireless personal area network (WPAN), for example. Such networks are sometimes referred to as &#x201c;piconets&#x201d; due to their limited transmission ranges and participating devices. The enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol generates additional antenna gain for directional antenna transmissions, thereby allowing training and feedback information to be communicated at a higher data rate, resulting in reduced training time and overhead in setting up bidirectional communication channels between two wireless devices.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Since the path loss at 60 GHz band is relatively high and the efficiency of power amplifiers at 60 GHz is relatively low (e.g., CMOS power amplifiers), directional transmission is needed to achieve the desired coverage area (e.g., approximately 10 meters). Namely, the antenna array gain from both transmit and receive beam forming is needed to acquire the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for reliable data communications. A beam forming protocol is typically used to find the optimal phase values which maximize receiver SNR, received power or other criterion.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Currently, there are several different types of beam forming protocols for implementing directional transmission techniques. A first directional transmission technique is referred to as a sector scan. It forms several directional beams using predefined weights. Calibration is required, however, in order to form the requisite beams. Another technique is based on singular value decomposition (SVD), which typically does not require calibration. SVD allows transmission over selected singular values by using the singular vectors for antenna patterns. In particular, the singular vector associated with the largest Eigen value typically works well. It is worthy to note, however, that in order to select the singular values and singular vectors, a device typically has to have an estimation of the entire MIMO channel, e.g., the channel from every antenna element at the transmitter to every antenna element at the receiver end. While the SVD technique provides improved performance, it needs feedback information due to lack of channel reciprocity. This potentially introduces channel delay into the SVD directional transmission technique.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">A piconet typically implements two general types of communications transmissions, each having different transmission envelopes or characteristics. For example, a first type of transmission may be a directional transmission and a second type of transmission may be an omni-directional transmission. The different types of transmissions may occur at different transmission rates. For example, directional transmissions may be performed using a higher rate channel, and the second type of transmission may be performed using a lower rate channel. In a WirelessHD network, for example, the directional transmissions may be performed using a high rate physical (HRP) channel, and the second type of transmission may be performed using a low rate physical (LRP) channel. The HRP channel may achieve a higher rate than the LRP channel, in part, through the utilization of larger amounts of bandwidth.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Since the location of a pair of devices is unknown during initialization, conventional techniques typically utilize a combination of LRP channels and HRP channels for beam forming operations. For example, one conventional technique utilizes a beam forming protocol for phased array antennas that is based on an iterative training scheme. In one embodiment, for example, the iterative trainings scheme may comprise a power iteration scheme. This beam forming protocol designed for one way high rate data transmissions over a HRP channel, where the reverse link suffers from low rate data transmissions over a LRP channel. Feedback information for the iterative search process is transmitted over the LRP channel, which dramatically slows down beam forming operations. This may be acceptable for applications where high rate data transmissions are needed in only one direction, such as for video traffic from a media source to a media sink. For applications where high rate data communications are needed in both directions, such as for computing centric applications, however, this introduces unwarranted delay in beam forming operations.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">To solve these and other problems, various embodiments implement an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol to perform bidirectional beam forming operations to reduce training overhead and link latency during beam forming operations. Some embodiments delay feedback information until two-way transmit (or receive) beam forming weights are trained, and then send the feedback over a beam formed link with a higher rate (e.g., HRP channel). This may reduce or eliminate the need to use a LRP channel for beam forming operations. Additionally or alternatively, some embodiments interleave transmit and receive beam forming operations to allow use of partially trained links to communicate feedback information at a higher data rate. This reduces the need to use an LRP channel during beam forming operations.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In one embodiment, for example, a wireless device may include a phased antenna array communicatively coupled to a transceiver. The wireless device may further include an antenna control module communicatively coupled to the transceiver and the phased antenna array. The antenna control module may be arranged to perform beam formation operations using an iterative training scheme to form a pair of communications channels between the wireless device and a peer device. For example, the antenna control module may be arranged to communicate training signals and feedback information with the peer device via the transceiver and phased antenna array. The information is communicated using almost exclusively high rate channels, or through partial use of low rate channels to bootstrap setup of the high rate channels. This reduces training time for the devices. The antenna control module iteratively determines antenna-array weight vectors (AWVs) for a directional transmit beam pattern for the phased antenna array using feedback information from the peer device. Once trained the wireless devices may be used for high-speed bidirectional data communications.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Additionally or alternatively, the antenna control module of a wireless device may initiate bidirectional beam formation operations using an iterative training scheme to form a pair of communications channels for a wireless network. The antenna control module may be arranged to interleave transmit and receive beam forming operations for a first wireless device and a second wireless device to allow feedback information received by the first wireless device from the second wireless device to be communicated over a higher data rate channel (e.g., HRP channel).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The wireless devices as described herein may coordinate operations between each other. The coordination may involve the uni-directional or bi-directional exchange of information. In some embodiment, the information can be implemented as signals. For example, training information may comprise training signals or sequences. Further embodiments, however, may alternatively employ data messages. The terms &#x201c;training information&#x201d; and &#x201c;feedback information&#x201d; are meant to include both signals and data messages, depending on a given implementation. The embodiments are not limited in this context.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Embodiments of the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol provide several advantages over conventional beam forming techniques. For example, the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol trains both directions of the communications link, allowing for a more structured process prior to a bidirectional operation that is more symmetric, such as in a PC environment. This provides superior performance relative to conventional beam forming protocols that allows the receiver of the high rate transmission to answer (e.g., ACKs etc.) in a low rate dedicated physical layer (PHY) that may not require training of the reverse link. In another example, the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol exploits resources more efficiently. The feedback provided during each iteration is based on partially trained antenna arrays. In yet another example, an external listening device can identify transmissions from both ends of the link. This situation is beneficial when an independent station wishes to assess the amount of interference it is going to suffer from the regarded link. If only one side of the link does the transmission, however, then the station has knowledge about interference only about the forward link and not about the reverse link. These are only a few examples of the advantages provided by the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol, and it may be appreciated that many other advantages exist as well.</p>

<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The communications system <b>100</b> may communicate information in accordance with one or more standards as promulgated by a standards organization. In one embodiment, for example, various devices comprising part of the communications system <b>100</b> may be arranged to operate in accordance with one or more of the WirelessHD&#x2122; specifications, standards or variants, such as the WirelessHD Specification, Revision 1.0d7, Dec. 1, 2007, and its progeny as promulgated by WirelessHD, LLC (collectively referred to as the &#x201c;WirelessHD Specification&#x201d;).

<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The communications system <b>100</b> also may be arranged to operate in accordance with standards and/or protocols for media processing. Examples of media processing standards include, without limitation, the High Definition Television (HDTV) standards as defined by the ITU Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R), such as the Recommendation BT.709-5, Parameter Values for the HDTV Standards For Production and International Programme Exchange, published April 2002, the Digital Video Broadcasting Terrestrial (DVB-T) broadcasting standard, the ITU/IEC H.263 standard, Video Coding for Low Bitrate Communication, ITU-T Recommendation H.263v3, published November 2000 and/or the ITU/IEC H.264 standard, Video Coding for Very Low Bit Rate Communication, ITU-T Recommendation H.264, published May 2003, Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) standards (e.g., MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG-4), and/or High performance radio Local Area Network (HiperLAN) standards.

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the communications system <b>100</b> may comprise a transmitter node <b>102</b> coupled to a plurality of receiver nodes <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>-<i>n</i>, where n may represent any positive integer value. In various embodiments, the transmitter node <b>102</b> and the plurality of receiver nodes <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>-<i>n </i>may be implemented as various types of wireless devices. Examples of wireless devices may include, without limitation, an IEEE 802.15.3 piconet controller (PNC), a controller, an IEEE 802.11 Private Basic Service Set (PBSS) Control Point (PCP), a coordinator, a station, a subscriber station, a base station, a wireless access point (AP), a wireless client device, a wireless station (STA), a laptop computer, ultra-laptop computer, portable computer, personal computer (PC), notebook PC, handheld computer, personal digital assistant (PDA), cellular telephone, combination cellular telephone/PDA, smartphone, pager, messaging device, media player, digital music player, set-top box (STB), appliance, workstation, user terminal, mobile unit, consumer electronics, television, digital television, high-definition television, television receiver, high-definition television receiver, and so forth.

Some embodiments for an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol are discussed in the context of using phased antenna arrays. The enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol may be used with any type of antenna having a need for feedback information, and the embodiments are not limited in this respect. For example, while some aspects of an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol are designed to enable a phased antenna array at both ends of the link, a switched-sector antenna (e.g., an antenna with predefined few directions that can switch from one direction to another) may still use this protocol.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">For purposes of illustration and not limitation, examples for an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol may be given with reference to WirelessHD networks, protocols and devices. It may be appreciated, however, that an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol may be implemented with other types of networks, protocols and devices. For example, an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol may be implemented for a NGmS network, protocol or devices, and still fall within the intended scope of the embodiments. The embodiments are not limited in this context.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In various embodiments, the transmitter node <b>102</b> and the receiver nodes <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>-<i>n </i>may comprise or form part of a wireless network <b>106</b>. In one embodiment, for example, the wireless network <b>106</b> may comprise a WVAN as defined by the WirelessHD Specification. In the context of a WVAN, both nodes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may be implemented as WirelessHD compliant devices. In a WVAN, the transmitter node <b>102</b> may be communicatively coupled to one or more receiver nodes <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>-<i>n</i>. In accordance with the WirelessHD Specification and nomenclature, one or both of the nodes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may be implemented as a coordinator or a station. A coordinator is normally, but not always, a device that is a sink for media information (e.g., audio or video data). The coordinator typically includes a display, and in some cases a media storage device such as a personal video recorder (PVR), media server, or STB. A station may comprise a device that either has media information that it can source or sink, potentially at the same time.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Although some embodiments may be described with the wireless network <b>106</b> implemented as a WVAN network for purposes of illustration, and not limitation, it can be appreciated that the embodiments are not limited in this context. For example, the wireless network <b>106</b> may comprise or be implemented as various types of wireless networks and associated protocols suitable for a WPAN, a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN), a Wireless Metropolitan Area Network, a Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN), a Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) network, a radio network, a television network, a satellite network such as a direct broadcast satellite (DBS) network, and/or any other wireless communications network configured to operate in accordance with the described embodiments.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">As shown in the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the transmitter node <b>102</b> may be coupled to receiver nodes <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>-<i>n </i>by wireless communication links <b>108</b>-<i>n</i>. A particular wireless communication link (e.g., wireless communication link <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>) may be arranged to establish one or more common or dedicated connections between the transmitter node <b>102</b> and a particular receiver node (e.g., receiver node <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>). In various embodiments, a particular wireless communication link (e.g., wireless communication link <b>108</b>-<b>1</b>) may include multiple virtual channels, with each of the virtual channels comprising a point-to-point logical connection from the transmitter node <b>102</b> to a particular receiver node (e.g., receiver node <b>104</b>-<b>1</b>). In various implementations, multiple virtual channels may share a physical link, with each virtual channel comprising dedicated resources or bandwidth of the physical link.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In various embodiments, the nodes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may communicate using a physical layer component (PHY), such as a high-rate PHY (HRP). In one embodiment, for example, the HRP supports multi-Gb/s throughput at a distance of approximately 10 meters through adaptive antenna technology. Because of this, the antenna pattern used for the HRP is highly directional. The HRP is optimized for the delivery of uncompressed high-definition video, although other data can be communicated using the HRP. To support multiple video resolutions, the HRP has more than one data rate defined. The HRP carries isochronous data such as audio and video, asynchronous data, MAC commands, antenna beam forming information, and higher layer control data for A/V devices. It may be appreciated that the use of HRP and LRP are for WirelessHD devices, and other types of PHYs may be used for other types of devices. With respect to the NGmS protocol, for example, the high rate PHY may be referred to as the OFDM PHY or the SC PHY depending on the modulation type, while the low rate PHY is called a CONTROL PHY or a MCS of the SC PHY. In the latter case, the low rate transmissions will be based on wide bandwidth with significant processing gain that renders the transmission more robust. Other types of high rate and low rate PHYs may be used for different types of devices, and the embodiments are not limited in this context.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In various embodiments, the nodes <b>102</b>, <b>104</b> may also communicate using a low-rate PHY (LRP). The LRP is a multi-Mb/s bidirectional link that also provides a relatively short range (e.g., 10 meters). One or more data rates are defined for the LRP, with the lower data rates having near omni-directional coverage while the highest data rates are directional, although this is not necessarily binding. For example, some arrangements may use higher data rates of LRP in almost-omni directional transmissions. Because the LRP has near omni-directional modes, it can be used for both unicast and broadcast connections. Furthermore, because all stations support the LRP, it can be used for station-to-station links for WirelessHD devices, although this may not be possible for NGmS devices. The LRP supports multiple data rates, including directional modes, and is used to carry low-rate isochronous data such as audio, low-rate asynchronous data, MAC commands including the beacon, acknowledgements for HRP packets, antenna beam forming information, capabilities information, and higher layer control data for A/V devices.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In some cases (not all) the HRP and LRP may operate in overlapping frequency bands and so they are coordinated by the MAC. The media access scheme may include a time division multiple access (TDMA) format, a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) format, a TDMA/FDMA format, a code division multiple access (CDMA), a wide-band CDMA (WCDMA) format, an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) format, and so forth. The embodiments are not limited in this context.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The WVAN typically supports two types of devices. In one embodiment, for example, a WVAN may support a coordinator and a station. The coordinator controls the timing in the piconet, keeps track of the members of the WVAN, is able to transmit and receive using the LRP, may be able to transmit data using the HRP, and may be able to receive data using the HRP. A station is able to transmit and receive using the LRP, may initiate stream connections, may be able to transmit data using the HRP, and may be able to receive data using the HRP. A station may be capable of acting as a coordinator in the WVAN. Such a station is referred to as being coordinator capable.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">In addition to the two MAC personalities of coordinator and station, each device in a WirelessHD WVAN will have one of four different PHY capabilities as shown in Table 1 as follows:</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> illustrates one embodiment of iterative training scheme for a wireless system <b>500</b>. Since the path loss in the 60 GHz frequency band is very high and the efficiency of CMOS power amplifiers at 60 GHz is low, directional transmission is needed to achieve the desired 10 meter coverage. The array gain from transmit and receive beam forming operations is needed to acquire the desired SNR for reliable data communications. Currently, there are several different beam forming protocols to acquire directional transmissions. The first beam forming protocol uses the sectored antenna approach, which switches among several preformed beams. The second beam forming protocol uses phased antenna arrays where transmit and receive beams are formed by changing the phases of the input and output signals of each antenna element, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The second beam forming protocol uses an iterative training approach. An iterative training process utilizes training sequences and feedback in successive iterations in order to train transmitters or receivers. The iterative training approach provides the advantage of distributing transmit power to multiple power amplifiers, and the beam can be adaptively steered. It is worthy to note that this discussion is limited to only a single data stream for purposes of clarity, although some embodiments may be implemented for multiple data streams as well. A brief overview of iterative training is provided below to better illustrate and describe the operations and benefits of the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol.</p>

The effective channel matrix incorporates the effects of the transmit/receive weighting matrixes and the wireless channel, and it is the product of the transmit weighting matrix B<sub>t</sub>, wireless channel H<sub>w</sub>, the receive weighting matrix B<sub>r </sub>e.g., H=B<sub>r</sub>H<sub>w</sub>B<sub>t</sub>. The weight entries on the i-th row of B<sub>r </sub>form the i-th effective receive antenna and similarly the weight entries on the i-th column of B<sub>t </sub>form the i-th effective transmit antenna. The entry on the i-th row and j-th column of H is the channel response between the i-th effective receive antenna and the j-th effective transmit antenna. If H is known, then u and v can be computed using the singular value decomposition (SVD) of H. However, H is usually unknown at both transmitter <b>502</b> and receiver <b>504</b> for 60 GHz systems. Consequently, iterative training is used as an efficient scheme to obtain u and v, and which does not require costly training to learn about the whole H.

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Beam forming is needed before the transmission of the data packet. In current protocols and for a P2P scheduled training, and for systems without RF transceiver chain calibration, the beam forming weights of the phased antenna arrays are gradually refined during the beam refinement phase that consumes a significant overhead of about <b>400</b> microseconds (&#x3bc;s), for example. It is desirable to reduce the training overhead as much as possible for high network throughput. In the state of the art, iterative training is the scheme employed for the beam refinement because of its superior performance. It is iterative and each iteration has two steps, e.g., the training of maximum ratio combining (MRC) weights and the training of the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) weights, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> and Equation (2) as follows.

The value for v(i+1) is fed back to the transmitter <b>502</b> for the (i+1)-th iteration. The values for u(i) and v(i) gradually converges to the ideal u and v as each iteration completes.

<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Iterative training is currently used by certain conventional beam forming protocols, such as those currently implemented by the WirelessHD Specification. The conventional beam forming protocol utilized by the WirelessHD Specification, however, introduces a significant amount of training overhead and link latency. It is also designed for training a link in one direction at a time, which may be suitable to digital television sets that are designed to operate mainly as receivers and less as transmitters. A PC environment is different, however, and focus is placed on both transmitting and receiving operations. The enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol reduces link latency for training bidirectional links, and is described in further detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In the illustrated embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6A</figref>, the wireless device <b>202</b> exits the idle state <b>402</b> and enters the beam forming state <b>404</b>.

<p id="p-0070" num="0069">During a first iterative training <b>602</b>-<b>1</b>, the antenna control module <b>208</b> uses the transceiver <b>205</b> and the phased antenna array <b>510</b> of the wireless device <b>202</b> to send training signals, such as training signals <b>613</b>, from the wireless device <b>202</b> to the wireless device <b>204</b> over a downlink (DL) HRP channel <b>352</b>-<b>1</b>. In a typical scenario, multiple training signals are transmitted, while the wireless device <b>202</b> changes its antenna weights at proper times (e.g., at the beginning of every training signal). For example, the antenna control module <b>208</b> sends receiver (Rx) training signals <b>613</b> from the wireless device <b>202</b> to the wireless device <b>204</b> over the DL HRP channel <b>352</b>-<b>1</b> to allow the wireless device <b>204</b> to deduce the MRC weights and form a directional receive beam pattern for a phased antenna array <b>210</b><i>a </i>of the wireless device <b>204</b>.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In a conventional beam forming protocol, the antenna control module <b>208</b> may wait to receive feedback information from the wireless device <b>204</b> over the LRP channel <b>354</b>-<b>1</b>.

The UL HRP channel <b>352</b>-<b>2</b> operates at a much higher data rate than the LRP channel <b>354</b>-<b>1</b>, and therefore using the UL HRP channel <b>352</b>-<b>2</b> for the feedback information reduces training overhead and latency.</p>

<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The wireless devices <b>202</b>, <b>204</b> may continue with the next iterative trainings <b>602</b>-<b>2</b>-<i>m </i>performing similar beam forming or beam refinement operations as used with the first iterative training <b>602</b>-<b>1</b>. For example, for iterative training <b>602</b>-<b>2</b> the operations indicated by arrows <b>619</b> through <b>624</b> are similar to those operations performed as indicated by arrows <b>613</b> through <b>618</b>.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">It is worthy to note that the feedback information provided at arrow <b>617</b> may optionally be moved back and provided during stage <b>616</b>. This may add synchronization overhead, however, because of the transmit/receive switching.</p>

<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol utilizes partially trained links to provide a higher data rate for the feedback information during the feedback stages. In the WirelessHD Specification, by way of contrast, feedback stages after the first one are done using &#x201c;directional&#x201d; mode, which is a selected antenna pattern. With non-calibrated antennas, a random antenna pattern may yield less than 0 dBi in certain directions. The directional mode is expected to be around 0 dBi as it is the best among few random choices. An additional advantage of the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol is that the beamformer need not transfer the selected antenna pattern for the directional mode to the beamformee, since the next time feedback is already going to be over a beamformed link, which is properly trained.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates one embodiment of a phased array antenna <b>900</b>.

<p id="p-0091" num="0090">In some embodiments, the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol may train a subset of antenna elements <b>902</b>-<b>1</b>-<i>p </i>from the phased array antenna <b>900</b>.

For example, similar to the way that the WirelessHD Specification uses to identify the proper antenna pattern index for the directional mode, the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol can add additional information types to certain stages of beam forming operations, such a needed modulation and coding scheme (MCS) for the wireless devices <b>202</b>, <b>204</b>. An information field of defined length (e.g., 3 bits) may be used to communicate the MCS information. The MCS information may be communicated, for example, with the transmitter training signals in either link direction in order to assist in generating the feedback information during the feedback stages. Other types of information other than MCS information may be sent during different stages of the enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol, and the embodiments are not limited in this context.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">In embodiments, the feedback information may correspond to measurements done at the receiver and is largely unaware of the antenna patterns applied by the transmitter.

<p id="p-0104" num="0103">It is worthy to note that although the terms &#x201c;downlink&#x201d; and &#x201c;uplink&#x201d; channels are used when describing some embodiments, these terms are used to differentiate between two different channels being used between two different devices. Alternate terms may include a &#x201c;first&#x201d; channel and a &#x201c;second&#x201d; channel, a &#x201c;forward&#x201d; channel and a &#x201c;reverse&#x201d; channel, and any other suitable labels. Any two channels between any two devices may be used with an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol as described herein, and still fall within the scope of the embodiments. The embodiments are not limited in this context.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104">It is also worthy to note that the increased gain provided by an enhanced bidirectional beam forming protocol may be realized at any point during iterative training operations due to variations in the iterative training operations for different types of protocols (e.g., WirelessHD, NGmS, and so forth), and flexibility in modifying a particular implementation for interleaving operations in support of bidirectional beamforming operations. For example, the increased gain from communicating feedback information as described with reference <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref> may be realized during the first iteration or second iteration depending on a particular implementation. The embodiments are not limited in this context.</p>
