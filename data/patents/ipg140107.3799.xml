<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to a touch panel. In particular, this invention relates to a device for improving the accuracy of the touch point on a touch panel and a method thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Traditionally, the input of an electronic device is implemented by a keyboard or a mouse. However now touch panels are extensively applied to a variety of electronic devices, the user can use fingers or touch pens to click the touch panel to input data to the electronic devices. A sensor located below the touch panel senses the touch point's location to operate the electronic device. According to the detection mechanism for sensing the touch point's location, the touch panel can be divided into a resistive type, a capacitive type, an acoustic wave type, an optical type, and an electromagnetic type. According to the kind of the touch panel, the touch panel can be divided into a touch panel and a touch pad.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For a capacitive touch panel that uses the capacitive type touch detection mechanism, it detects the currents from each sides of the touch point and uses the currents to determine the touch point's location.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Reference is made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, which shows a schematic diagram for detecting the touch point location on the capacitive touch panel in the prior art. The capacitive touch panel <b>10</b> is composed of a transparent substrate layer <b>11</b>, a conductive metallization layer <b>12</b>, an electrode pattern layer <b>13</b>, and an insulation hard plating layer <b>14</b>. The transparent substrate layer <b>11</b> can be a glass. The electrode pattern layer <b>13</b> is formed on the edge of the touch panel <b>10</b> for compensating the electric field distribution above the conductive metallization layer <b>12</b>. Furthermore, when viewed in conjunction with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, each of the four corners of the touch panel <b>10</b> is connected with each of external conducting wires A, B, C, D for receiving each of the AC detection signals, AC<b>1</b>, AC<b>2</b>, AC<b>3</b>, and AC<b>4</b> that are used for determining the touch point location P on the touch panel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The AC detection signals, AC<b>1</b>, AC<b>2</b>, AC<b>3</b>, and AC<b>4</b>, are AC square wave voltage signals or AC sine wave voltage signals, and their amplitude are the same as each other. At this time, each of currents I<b>1</b>, I<b>2</b>, I<b>3</b>, I<b>4</b> respectively flows through each of the external conducting wires A, B, C, and D. By measuring the current variations &#x394;I<b>1</b>, &#x394;I<b>2</b>, &#x394;I<b>3</b> and &#x394;I<b>4</b> at the external conducting wires A, B, C, D of before the user touches the touch point P and of when the user touches the touch point P, the coordinates of the touch point P can be calculated by the following formulas.

<p id="p-0009" num="0008">However, if the touch panel <b>10</b> does not have the electrode pattern <b>13</b>, the distribution of the electric filed of the AC detection signals, AC<b>1</b>, AC<b>2</b>, AC<b>3</b>, and AC<b>4</b> on the touch panel <b>10</b> would be curved, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The electric filed distribution curve in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> forms equipotential lines in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The location of the touch point P would be inaccurate. For overcoming the above problem, a compensation means is applied to the touch panel, such as summing the electrode pattern layer <b>13</b> at the four corners of the touch panel <b>10</b>. The equipotential lines are thereby improved, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and become linear.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">One particular aspect of the present invention is to provide a device for improving the detection accuracy of a touch point on a touch panel and a method thereof, wherein the detection accuracy of the touch panel are improved by the solution for improving the linearity of the electric filed in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In the device for improving the detection accuracy of a touch point on a touch panel, the touch panel is a substantial rectangle orderly surrounded by a first X side, a first Y side, a second X side, and a second Y side, and has a detection layer and a transparent substrate with the same substantial rectangle shape, where the detection layer is transparent and conductive and located above the transparent substrate. The device includes a detection source, a plurality of first and second X external conducting wires, a plurality of first and second Y external conducting wires, a current measurement unit, a current calculation unit, and a coordinate determination unit. The detection source further includes a first detection signal source and a second detection signal source. The plurality of first and second X external conducting wires can be respectively and simultaneously electrically coupled with or simultaneously separated from the first X side and the second X side of the touch panel. When being simultaneously electrically coupled, the touch panel receives a first detection signal of the first detection signal source and respectively generates a first current and a second current on the plurality of first and second X external conducting wires respectively. The plurality of first and second Y external conducting wires can be respectively and simultaneously electrically coupled with or separated from the first Y side and the second Y side of the touch panel. When being simultaneously electrically coupled, the touch panel receives a second detection signal of the second detection signal source and respectively generates a third current and a fourth current on the plurality of first and second Y external conducting wires respectively. The current measurement unit respectively measures the first current, the second current, the third current and the fourth current of the plurality of first and second X external conducting wires and the plurality of first and second Y external conducting wires, wherein the four currents are compared before the user touches the touch point and after the user touches the touch point. The current calculation unit respectively sums the first current, the second current, the third current and the fourth current of the plurality of first and second X external conducting wires and plurality of first and second Y external conducting wires before the user touches the touch point and also when the user touches the touch point. The coordinate determination unit determined an X coordinate and a Y coordinate of the location of the touch point according to the four total currents before the user touches the touch point and the four total currents when the user touches the touch point.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the method for improving the detection accuracy of a touch point on a touch panel, the touch panel is a substantial rectangle orderly surrounded by a first X side, a first Y side, a second X side, and a second Y side and has a detection layer and a transparent substrate with the same substantial rectangle shape, where the detection layer is transparent and conductive and located above the transparent substrate. The method includes the following steps. A plurality of first and second X external conducting wires that have the same quantity are respectively provided around the detection layer located on the first X side and the second X side of the touch panel, and a plurality of first and second Y external conducting wires that have the same quantity are respectively provided around the detection layer located on the first Y side and the second Y side. A first detection signal source and a second detection signal source are provided. The plurality of first and second X external conducting wires are electrically coupled with the detection layer located on the first X side and the second X side of the touch panel, and the plurality of first and second Y external conducting wires are electrically separated from the detection layer located on the first Y side and the second Y side according to the plurality of first and second X external conducting wires receives a first detection signal from the first detection signal source, wherein a first current and a second current are respectively generated on the plurality of first and second X external conducting wires.
