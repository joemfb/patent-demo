<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to light-emitting devices and lighting devices each using a solid light-emitting element.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In a solid light-emitting element in which light is emitted in a medium having higher refractive index than air, incident light from a high refractive index region to a low refractive index region with an angle larger than the critical angle is fully reflected on an interface. A variety of techniques has been developed in order to extract light of the solid light-emitting element efficiently.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">For example, a technique is known in which incident light to a low refractive index region with an angle larger than the critical angle is prevented from being fully reflected repeatedly with the use of a structure in which a high refractive index region is connected to the low refractive index region via an interface that has an uneven structure.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In Non-Patent Document 1, a structure is employed in which a high refractive index glass substrate is combined with a high refractive index lens as a means for increasing light extraction efficiency of a solid light-emitting element.</p>

</ul>
</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In order to increase light extraction efficiency of a solid light-emitting element, a high refractive index component that has an uneven structure on a surface in contact with air is preferably provided between the solid light-emitting element and air. In order to realize such a structure, the uneven structure needs to be formed intentionally at an interface in contact with air, and accordingly, the fabrication process of the light-emitting device is complicated.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In addition, the light-emitting element has a function of converting electric energy into optical energy. A reduction in emission efficiency due to the use of the light-emitting element and a degradation phenomenon thereof are difficult to avoid. In contrast, the uneven structure mainly has a function of controlling reflection of light; thus, degradation is less likely to occur than in the light-emitting element. That is, it can be said that the lifetime as a component included in a light-emitting device differs between the solid light-emitting element and the uneven structure that increases the light extraction efficiency thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Therefore, in the case where the uneven structure is formed so as not to be separated from the light-emitting element, when the performance of the light-emitting element becomes low or when the light-emitting element is degraded or broken, the uneven structure would be wasted together with the light-emitting element. Thus, there is a problem in that the time and energy that have been spent on forming the uneven structure and materials included in the uneven structure would be wasted in vain.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The present invention is made in view of the foregoing technical background. Thus, an object is to provide a light-emitting device having a structure in which a high refractive index component is provided between a solid light-emitting element and air, has an uneven structure on a surface in contact with air, and can be reused.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Another object is to provide a lighting device to which the light-emitting device is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">In order to achieve at least one of the above objects, the present invention focused on how to connect the solid light-emitting element to the uneven structure that is provided in contact with air and has high refractive index. Then, a method by which the uneven structure is connected to the light-emitting element via a high refractive index liquid was arrived at. With the use of the high refractive index liquid, the light-emitting element and the uneven structure can be optically connected to each other and can be physically separated from each other.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">That is, one embodiment of the present invention is a light-emitting device including a substrate having a refractive index of 1.6 or higher and a light-transmitting property to visible light (hereinafter simply referred to as a light-transmitting property), a solid light-emitting element including a light-emitting region having a refractive index of 1.6 or higher on one surface of the substrate, and a component having a refractive index of 1.6 or higher and a light-transmitting property on the other surface of the substrate, wherein the component includes an uneven structure on a surface in contact with air and is connected to the substrate via a liquid having a refractive index of 1.6 or higher and a light-transmitting property.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Another embodiment of the present invention is a light-emitting device including a substrate having a refractive index of 1.6 or higher and a light-transmitting property, a solid light-emitting element including a light-emitting region having a refractive index of 1.6 or higher on one surface of the substrate, and a hemispherical component having a refractive index of 1.6 or higher and a light-transmitting property on the other surface of the substrate, wherein the component is connected to the substrate via a liquid having a refractive index of 1.6 or higher and a light-transmitting property.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to one embodiment of the present invention described above, with the use of a high refractive index liquid, the high refractive index component can be optically connected to the high refractive index substrate without generating a layer with a low refractive index therebetween (e.g., air); thus, high light extraction efficiency can be realized. In addition, with the use of a liquid having fluidity, the component can be detached from the substrate and the component can be reused.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Another embodiment of the present invention is the above-described light-emitting device wherein the solid light-emitting element includes the light-emitting region interposed between a first electrode that is formed over the substrate and has a refractive index of 1.6 or higher and a light-transmitting property and a second electrode overlapping with the first electrode, and wherein the light-emitting region includes a light-emitting layer containing a light-emitting organic compound.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">According to one embodiment of the present invention described above, light emission can be extracted with high efficiency from a light-emitting region which is spread out in a plane, through a first electrode having a light-transmitting property. In addition, with the use of a liquid having fluidity, the component can be detached from the substrate and the component can be reused.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Another embodiment of the present invention is a lighting device including the light-emitting device in a light-emitting portion.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">According to one embodiment of the present invention, it is possible to provide a light-emitting device having a structure in which a high refractive index component is provided between a solid light-emitting element and air, has an uneven structure on a surface in contact with air, and can be reused.</p>

<heading id="h-0007" level="1">Embodiment 1</heading>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">In this embodiment, a light-emitting device which is one embodiment of the present invention is described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1A and 1B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A and 2B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>.</p>
<p id="h-0008" num="0000">&#x3c;Basic Structure of Light-Emitting Device&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is an example of a cross-sectional view of a light-emitting device, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> is an example of a plan view of the light-emitting device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The light-emitting device of this embodiment includes a solid light-emitting element <b>100</b>, a high refractive index substrate <b>102</b>, a high refractive index liquid layer <b>104</b>, and a high refractive index component <b>103</b>. Light emitted from the solid light-emitting element <b>100</b> is extracted through the high refractive index component <b>103</b> to an outside <b>105</b> (e.g., into air).</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Since the light-emitting device of this embodiment includes the high refractive index liquid layer <b>104</b>, the high refractive index component <b>103</b> can be optically connected to the high refractive index substrate <b>102</b> without generating a layer with a low refractive index therebetween (e.g., air); thus, high light extraction efficiency can be realized. In addition, with the use of a liquid having fluidity, the component can be detached from the substrate and the component can be reused.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The high refractive index component <b>103</b> is fixed to the high refractive index substrate <b>102</b> so as to be detachable.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Extraction through the high refractive index component <b>103</b> can prevent the phenomenon that incident light from a high refractive index medium to a low refractive index medium with an angle larger than the critical angle is fully reflected and the light extraction efficiency is decreased, which improves the light extraction efficiency.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">As the solid light-emitting element <b>100</b>, a material with a refractive index of 1.6 or higher, such as a LED (light-emitting diode), an organic EL (electroluminescence) element, or an inorganic EL element, can be used. Examples in each of which an organic EL is used for the solid light-emitting element <b>100</b> are described in detail in Embodiment 2. There is no limitation on a planar shape of the solid light-emitting element; the planar shape may be a polygonal shape such as a square illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref> or a circular shape illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The high refractive index substrate <b>102</b> can be formed using a material that has a light-transmitting property to visible light (hereinafter simply referred to as a light-transmitting property) and a refractive index of 1.6 or higher, preferably higher than or equal to 1.7 and lower than or equal to 2.1. It is possible to use a high refractive index glass substrate (e.g., a glass substrate containing lanthanum or the like) whose refractive index is controlled by an impurity component in the glass.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The high refractive index liquid layer <b>104</b> can be formed using a liquid that has a light-transmitting property and a refractive index of 1.6 or higher, preferably higher than or equal to 1.7 and lower than or equal to 2.1. Examples of the liquid having a refractive index of 1.6 or higher include a catalytic liquid (a refractive index liquid) that contains sulfur and methylene iodide and has a refractive index of 1.75 to 1.78, a catalytic liquid (a refractive index liquid) that contains 1-bromonaphthalene and methylene iodide and has a refractive index of 1.70, and the like. Note that a liquid used for the high refractive index liquid layer <b>104</b> may be a material that exhibits fluidity at temperatures of higher than or equal to &#x2212;20&#xb0; C. and lower than or equal to 200&#xb0; C. For example, it is possible to use a material that does not exhibit fluidity at room temperature but exhibits fluidity by being heated to be detachable.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The high refractive index component <b>103</b> can be formed using a material that has a light-transmitting property and a refractive index of 1.6 or higher, preferably higher than or equal to 1.7 and lower than or equal to 2.1. The light-emitting device illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> includes the hemispherical high refractive index component <b>103</b>; however, there is no limitation on the shape, and a spherical component <b>111</b> having a spherical surface wider than a hemispherical surface may also be used (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>). With a spherical surface wider than a hemispherical surface, an area of a portion where light is extracted is increased, so that the light extraction efficiency can be improved. Alternatively, a component <b>112</b> having a plurality of uneven structures may be formed with the use of a microlens array or the like (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Examples of the material that can be used for the high refractive index components <b>103</b>, <b>111</b>, and <b>112</b> include glass, resin, and the like. Examples of the high refractive index resin include resin containing bromine, resin containing sulfur, and the like. For example, sulfur-containing polyimide resin, episulfide resin, thiourethane resin, brominated aromatic resin, or the like can be used.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Such a material can be formed into a hemispherical shape or the like by using etching, an electron beam, a laser beam, a mold, or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The high refractive index substrate and the high refractive index component preferably have a shape such that they can be fixed to each other (e.g., the high refractive index component can be inserted in or cover the high refractive index substrate) because in that case, the high refractive index component and the high refractive index substrate can be fixed to each other without an adhesive or the like and be easily detached. By fixing the high refractive index component and the high refractive index substrate to each other, leakage or evaporation of the high refractive index liquid layer can be prevented. The high refractive index substrate and the high refractive index component may be fixed to each other with the use of a known sealant, adhesive, or the like as long as they are detachable from each other.</p>

<p id="p-0045" num="0044"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an example of a cross-sectional view of the light-emitting device which is one embodiment of the present invention.

A detailed method for fabricating the organic EL element is described in Embodiment 2.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, over a surface of the high refractive index substrate <b>102</b>, which is opposite to the surface over which the organic EL element is formed, the high refractive index liquid layer <b>104</b> is formed, and sealing is performed with the high refractive index component <b>103</b> which is molded to be hemispherical.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In this embodiment, a depression portion is provided for the high refractive index substrate <b>102</b>, and a high refractive index liquid is poured into the depression portion. After that, the high refractive index component <b>103</b> is adhered and fixed to the high refractive index substrate <b>102</b> with an adhesive. Note that the depression portion may be provided for the high refractive index component <b>103</b> instead of providing the depression portion for the high refractive index substrate <b>102</b>, and a high refractive index liquid may be poured into the depression portion to form the high refractive index liquid layer <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">In the above manner, the light-emitting device of this embodiment can be fabricated.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Note that in this embodiment, the solid light-emitting element (here, an organic light-emitting element) is fabricated over the high refractive index substrate <b>102</b> first; however, the solid light-emitting element may be fabricated after the high refractive index liquid layer <b>104</b> and the high refractive index component <b>103</b> are fixed to the high refractive index substrate <b>102</b>. In this case, a step in which a material used for the high refractive index component <b>103</b> is formed to have an uneven structure such as a hemispherical shape may be performed either before or after the fabrication of the solid light-emitting element.</p>

<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In this embodiment, an example of an organic EL element is described.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A light-emitting element illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> includes the first electrode <b>401</b>, the EL layer <b>403</b> over the first electrode <b>401</b>, and the second electrode <b>405</b> over the EL layer <b>403</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The EL layer <b>403</b> includes at least a light-emitting layer containing a light-emitting organic compound. In addition, the EL layer <b>403</b> can have a stacked-layer structure where a layer that contains a substance having a high electron-transport property, a layer that contains a substance having a high hole-transport property, a layer that contains a substance having a high electron-injection property, a layer that contains a substance having a high hole-injection property, a layer that contains a bipolar substance (a substance having a high electron-transport property and a high hole-transport property), and the like are combined as appropriate.

In addition, in this embodiment, the refractive index of the EL layer <b>403</b> is 1.7 or higher.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Next, a method for fabricating the light-emitting element illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> is described.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">First, the first electrode <b>401</b> is formed. Since light from the EL layer <b>403</b> is extracted through the first electrode <b>401</b>, the first electrode <b>401</b> is formed using a light-transmitting material.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As the light-transmitting material, indium oxide, an alloy of indium oxide and tin oxide (also referred to as ITO), an alloy of indium oxide and zinc oxide (also referred to as IZO), zinc oxide, zinc oxide to which gallium is added, or the like can be used.</p>

Further, a nitride of the metal material (such as titanium nitride) or the like may be used. In the case of using the metal material (or the nitride thereof), the first electrode <b>401</b> may be thinned so as to be able to transmit light.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">Next, the EL layer <b>403</b> is formed over the first electrode <b>401</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, the EL layer <b>403</b> includes the hole-injection layer <b>701</b>, the hole-transport layer <b>702</b>, the light-emitting layer <b>703</b>, the electron-transport layer <b>704</b>, and the electron-injection layer <b>705</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The hole-injection layer <b>701</b> is a layer that contains a substance having a high hole-injection property. As the substance having a high hole-injection property, for example, a metal oxide such as molybdenum oxide, titanium oxide, vanadium oxide, rhenium oxide, ruthenium oxide, chromium oxide, zirconium oxide, hafnium oxide, tantalum oxide, silver oxide, tungsten oxide, or manganese oxide can be used. A phthalocyanine-based compound such as phthalocyanine (abbreviation: H<sub>2</sub>Pc), or copper(II) phthalocyanine (abbreviation: CuPc) can also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">Alternatively, any of the following aromatic amine compounds which are low molecular organic compounds can be used: 4,4&#x2032;,4&#x2033;-tris(N,N-diphenylamino)triphenylamine (abbreviation: TDATA), 4,4&#x2032;,4&#x2033;-tris[N-(3-methylphenyl)-N-phenylamino]triphenylamine (abbreviation: MTDATA), 4,4&#x2032;-bis[N-(4-diphenylaminophenyl)-N-phenylamino]biphenyl (abbreviation: DPAB), 4,4&#x2032;-bis(N-{4-[N&#x2032;-(3-methylphenyl)-N&#x2032;-phenylamino]phenyl}-N-phenylamino)biphenyl (abbreviation: DNTPD), 1,3,5-tris[N-(4-diphenylaminophenyl)-N-phenylamino]benzene (abbreviation: DPA3B), 3-[N-(9-phenylcarbazol-3-yl)-N-phenylamino]-9-phenylcarbazole (abbreviation: PCzPCA1), 3,6-bis[N-(9-phenylcarbazol-3-yl)-N-phenylamino]-9-phenylcarbazole (abbreviation: PCzPCA2), 3-[N-(1-naphthyl)-N-(9-phenylcarbazol-3-yl)amino]-9-phenylcarbazole (abbreviation: PCzPCN1), or the like.</p>

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">In particular, for the hole-injection layer <b>701</b>, a composite material in which an acceptor substance is mixed with an organic compound having a high hole-transport property is preferably used. Note that by the use of the composite material in which an acceptor substance is added to a substance having a high hole-transport property, hole injection from the first electrode <b>401</b> is facilitated, which leads to a reduction in the driving voltage of the light-emitting element. Such a composite material can be formed by co-evaporating a substance having a high hole-transport property and an acceptor substance. The hole-injection layer <b>701</b> is formed using the composite material, whereby hole injection from the first electrode <b>401</b> to the EL layer <b>403</b> is facilitated.</p>

In addition, oxides of metals belonging to Groups 4 to 8 in the periodic table can also be given. Specifically, vanadium oxide, niobium oxide, tantalum oxide, chromium oxide, molybdenum oxide, tungsten oxide, manganese oxide, and rhenium oxide are preferable since their electron-accepting property is high. Among these, molybdenum oxide is especially preferable since it is stable in air and its hygroscopic property is low and is easily treated.</p>

<p id="p-0114" num="0113">The second electrode <b>405</b> is provided on the side opposite to the side from which light is extracted and is formed using a reflective material. As the reflective material, a metal material such as aluminum, gold, platinum, silver, nickel, tungsten, chromium, molybdenum, iron, cobalt, copper, or palladium can be used. Besides, an alloy containing aluminum (an aluminum alloy) such as an alloy of aluminum and titanium, an alloy of aluminum and nickel, or an alloy of aluminum and neodymium, or an alloy containing silver such as an alloy of silver and copper can be used. The alloy of silver and copper is preferable because it has high heat resistance. Further, by stacking a metal film or a metal oxide film in contact with the aluminum alloy film, oxidation of the aluminum alloy film can be suppressed. Examples of a material for the metal film and the metal oxide film include titanium, titanium oxide, and the like. The above materials are preferable because they are present in large amounts in the Earth's crust and inexpensive to achieve a reduction in the cost of manufacturing a light-emitting element.</p>

<p id="p-0123" num="0122">A method for fabricating the light-emitting device of this example is described below.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0123">First, over one surface of a high refractive index substrate <b>1100</b>, a light-emitting element was fabricated. As the high refractive index substrate <b>1100</b>, a glass substrate having a refractive index of 1.806 (S-LAH53 produced by Ohara Inc.) was used.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0124">Then, indium tin oxide containing silicon oxide (ITSO) was deposited by a sputtering method, whereby a first electrode <b>1101</b> functioning as an anode was formed. The thickness thereof was 110 nm and the electrode area was 2 mm&#xd7;2 mm.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0125">As pretreatment for forming the light-emitting element on the substrate <b>1100</b>, after washing of a surface of the substrate with water, UV ozone treatment was performed for 370 seconds.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">After that, the substrate <b>1100</b> was transferred into a vacuum evaporation apparatus where the pressure had been reduced to approximately 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>Pa, and subjected to vacuum baking at 150&#xb0; C. for 1 hour in a heating chamber of the vacuum evaporation apparatus, and then the substrate <b>1100</b> was cooled down for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Next, the substrate <b>1100</b> on which the first electrode <b>1101</b> was formed was fixed to a substrate holder in a vacuum evaporation apparatus such that a surface of the substrate <b>1100</b> on which the first electrode <b>1101</b> was formed faced downward. The pressure in the vacuum evaporation apparatus was reduced to about 10<sup>&#x2212;4 </sup>Pa. Then, on the first electrode <b>1101</b>, 9-phenyl-3-[4-(10-phenyl-9-anthryl)phenyl]-9H-carbazole (abbreviation: PCzPA) and molybdenum(VI) oxide were co-evaporated, whereby a first hole-injection layer <b>1111</b><i>a </i>was formed. The thickness thereof was 100 nm and the weight ratio of PCzPA to molybdenum(VI) oxide was adjusted to 1:0.5 (=PCzPA:molybdenum(VI) oxide). Note that the co-evaporation method means an evaporation method in which evaporation is carried out from a plurality of evaporation sources at the same time in one treatment chamber.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">Next, on the first hole-injection layer <b>1111</b><i>a</i>, PCzPA was deposited to a thickness of 30 nm, whereby a first hole-transport layer <b>1112</b><i>a </i>was formed.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">Further, on the first hole-transport layer <b>1112</b><i>a, </i>9-[4-(N-carbazolyl)]phenyl-10-phenylanthracene (abbreviation: CzPA) and N,N&#x2032;-bis[4-(9-phenyl-9H-fluoren-9-yl)phenyl]-N,N&#x2032;-diphenylpyrene-1,6-diamine (abbreviation: 1,6FLPAPrn) were co-evaporated, whereby a first light-emitting layer <b>1113</b><i>a </i>was formed. The thickness thereof was 30 nm and the weight ratio of CzPA to 1,6FLPAPm was adjusted to 1:0.05 (=CzPA:1,6FLPAPrn).</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">Next, on the first light-emitting layer <b>1113</b><i>a</i>, CzPA was deposited to a thickness of 5 nm and bathophenanthroline (abbreviation: BPhen) was deposited to a thickness of 15 nm, whereby a first electron-transport layer <b>1114</b><i>a </i>was formed.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">Further, on the first electron-transport layer <b>1114</b><i>a</i>, Li was evaporated to a thickness of 0.1 nm, whereby a first electron-injection layer <b>1115</b><i>a </i>was formed.</p>
<p id="p-0133" num="0132">Next, on the first electron-injection layer <b>1115</b><i>a</i>, copper phthalocyanine (abbreviation: CuPc) was evaporated to a thickness of 2 nm, whereby a first intermediate layer <b>1116</b><i>a </i>was formed.</p>
<p id="p-0134" num="0133">Next, on the first intermediate layer <b>1116</b><i>a</i>, PCzPA and molybdenum(VI) oxide were co-evaporated, whereby a second hole-injection layer <b>1111</b><i>b </i>was formed.

<p id="p-0135" num="0134">Next, on the second hole-injection layer <b>1111</b><i>b, </i>4-phenyl-4&#x2032;-(9-phenylfluoren-9-yl)triphenylamine (abbreviation: BPAFLP) was deposited to a thickness of 20 nm, whereby a second hole-transport layer <b>1112</b><i>b </i>was formed.</p>

The thickness thereof was 15 nm and the weight ratio of 2mDBTPDBq-II to PCBA1BP and Ir(mppr-Me)<sub>2</sub>(acac) was adjusted to 1:0.33:0.1 (=2mDBTPDBq-II:PCBA1BP:Ir(mppr-Me)<sub>2</sub>(acac)). Next, on the first layer, 2mDBTPDBq-II and Ir(mppr-Me)<sub>2</sub>(acac) were co-evaporated, whereby a second layer was formed. The thickness thereof was 15 nm and the weight ratio of 2mDBTPDBq-II to Ir(mppr-Me)<sub>2</sub>(acac) was adjusted to 1:0.06 (=2mDBTPDBq-II:Ir(mppr-Me)<sub>2</sub>(acac)).</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0136">Next, on the second light-emitting layer <b>1113</b><i>b, </i>2mDBTPDBq-II was deposited to a thickness of 25 nm and Bphen was deposited to a thickness of 15 nm, whereby a second electron-transport layer <b>1114</b><i>b </i>was formed.</p>

<p id="p-0148" num="0147">The light-emitting element was sealed in a glove box under a nitrogen atmosphere so as not to be subjected to air. After that, at a position that is on a side of the substrate <b>1100</b> on which the light-emitting element was not formed, and that overlaps with a light-emitting region of the light-emitting element, a high refractive index component <b>1200</b> having a light-transmitting property was provided to form the light-emitting device. Note that the high refractive index component <b>1200</b> was formed using a glass substrate having a refractive index of 2.003 (S-LAH79 produced by Edmund Optics Inc.) and has a hemispherical shape with a diameter of 1 cm. In addition, a cross-section of the hemisphere is connected to the high refractive index substrate <b>1100</b> via a catalytic liquid (a refractive index liquid) that contains sulfur and methylene iodide and has a refractive index of 1.78 (produced by Shimazu Device Corporation) (see a high refractive index liquid layer <b>1201</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0148">Power efficiency of the thus obtained light-emitting device was measured with the use of an integrating sphere. When a current density of 5.2 mA/cm<sup>2 </sup>(current was 0.2 mA) was supplied to the solid light-emitting element, it emitted light with a power efficiency of 88.4 lm/W (Lumen per Watt).</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0149">In addition, current density vs. power efficiency characteristics of the light-emitting device shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> indicate that by supplying current with a current density of 0.93 mA/cm<sup>2</sup>, the light-emitting device can obtain a power efficiency of 101 lm/W. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, the vertical axis represents power efficiency (lm/W), and the horizontal axis represents current density (mA/cm<sup>2</sup>).</p>
<p id="p-0151" num="0150">Note that the current density (mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) vs. power efficiency (lm/W) characteristics of the light-emitting device were calculated from current density (mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) vs. current efficiency (cd/A) characteristics in the following manner.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0151">Light emitted by a light-emitting region with a size of 2 mm&#xd7;2 mm of the solid light-emitting element was observed, not through a hemispherical structural body, but through the high refractive index substrate from the vertical direction to the high refractive index substrate, and a driving voltage and the current density (mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) vs. current efficiency (cd/A) characteristics were measured.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0152">Here, it was assumed that the current density of the solid light-emitting element controlled emission intensity of the solid light-emitting element, but did not affect spatial distribution of light emitted from the solid light-emitting element. Further, when a value that is obtained by dividing the current efficiency (cd/A) by the driving voltage (V) is defined, the power efficiency (lm/W) is in proportion to the value obtained by dividing the current efficiency (cd/A) by the driving voltage (V). Accordingly, when the value obtained by dividing the current efficiency (cd/A) by the driving voltage (V) is multiplied by a proportionality constant, the current density (mA/cm<sup>2</sup>) vs. power efficiency (lm/W) characteristics can be obtained.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0153">Note that the proportionality constant can be obtained in the following manner. In the first step, the current density and the luminance of the solid light-emitting element at a specific driving voltage E<sub>1</sub>(V) were measured, the current efficiency &#x3a6;<sub>1 </sub>(cd/A) was calculated, and the value &#x3a6;<sub>1</sub>/E<sub>1 </sub>was obtained by dividing the current efficiency &#x3a6;<sub>1</sub>(cd/A) by the driving voltage E<sub>1 </sub>(V). In the second step, a hemispherical structural body was provided over the high refractive index substrate via a buffer solution at a position that overlaps with the light-emitting region of the same solid light-emitting element, whereby the light-emitting device was formed. In the third step, the driving voltage E<sub>1 </sub>(V) was applied to the light-emitting device, and power efficiency P<sub>1 </sub>(lm/W) was measured with the use of the integrating sphere. In the fourth step, P<sub>1 </sub>was divided by (&#x3a6;<sub>1</sub>/E<sub>1</sub>), whereby the proportionality constant C was obtained. In this example, the proportionality constant was 8.39 (=88.4 (lm/W)&#xf7;{96.9 (cd/A)&#xf7;9.2 (V)}).</p>
