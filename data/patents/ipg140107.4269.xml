<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to memory integrated circuits, and more particularly to memory circuits that ignore storage errors in random access memory.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Semiconductor memory devices have been widely used in electronic systems to store data. There are generally two types of semiconductor memories, including non-volatile and volatile memories. A volatile memory device, such as a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) or a Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) device, loses its data when the power applied to it is turned off. In contrast, a non-volatile semiconductor memory device, such as a Flash, Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM) or a magnetic random access memory (MRAM), retains its charge even after the power applied thereto is turned off. Therefore, where loss of data due to power failure or termination is unacceptable, a non-volatile memory is used to store the data.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref> is a simplified cross-sectional view of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structure <b>10</b> used in forming a spin transfer torque (STT) MRAM cell. MTJ <b>10</b> is shown as including, in part, a reference layer <b>12</b>, a tunneling layer <b>14</b>, and a free layer <b>16</b>. Reference layer <b>12</b> and free layer <b>16</b> are ferromagnetic layers. Tunneling layer <b>14</b> is a nonmagnetic layer. The direction of magnetization of reference layer <b>12</b> is fixed and does not change. The direction of magnetization of free layer <b>16</b>, however, may be varied by passing a sufficiently large current through the MTJ structure. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, reference layer <b>12</b> and free layer <b>16</b> are assumed to have the same magnetization direction, i.e., they are in a parallel state. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, reference layer <b>12</b> and free layer <b>16</b> are assumed to have opposite magnetization directions, i.e., they are in an anti-parallel state. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1C</figref>, reference layer <b>12</b> and free layer <b>16</b> are assumed to have the same magnetization direction perpendicular to a plane defined by the interface of free layer <b>16</b> and tunneling layer <b>14</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1D</figref>, reference layer <b>12</b> and free layer <b>14</b> are assumed to have opposite magnetization directions perpendicular to a plane defined by the interface of free layer <b>16</b> and tunneling layer <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">To switch from the parallel state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>, to the anti-parallel state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>, the voltage potential of reference layer <b>12</b> is increased relative to that of free layer <b>16</b>. This voltage difference causes spin polarized electrons flowing from free layer <b>16</b> to reference layer <b>12</b> to transfer their angular momentum and change the magnetization direction of free layer <b>16</b> to the anti-parallel state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1B</figref>. To switch from the anti-parallel state to the parallel state, the voltage potential of free layer <b>16</b> is increased relative to that of reference layer <b>12</b>. This voltage difference causes spin polarized electrons flowing from reference layer <b>12</b> to free layer <b>16</b> to transfer their angular momentum and change the magnetization direction of free layer <b>16</b> to the parallel state, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To switch from the parallel state to the non-parallel state or vice versa, the voltage applied to MTJ <b>10</b> and the corresponding current flowing through MTJ must be greater than a respective pair of threshold values. The voltage that must exceed a threshold voltage in order for the switching to occur is also referred to as the switching voltage V<sub>c</sub>. Likewise, the current that must exceed a threshold current in order for the switching to occur is referred to as the switching current I<sub>c</sub>. As is well known, when free layer <b>16</b> and reference layer <b>12</b> have the same magnetization direction (parallel state), MTJ <b>10</b> has a relatively low resistance. Conversely, when free layer <b>16</b> and reference layer <b>12</b> have the opposite magnetization direction (anti-parallel state), MTJ <b>10</b> has a relatively high resistance. Due to the physical properties of an MTJ, the critical current required to change the state of an MTJ from a parallel to an anti-parallel is often greater than the critical current required to change the state of the MTJ from an anti-parallel to a parallel state.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> shows an MTJ <b>10</b> and an associated select transistor <b>20</b> together forming an STT-MRAM cell <b>30</b>. Transistor <b>20</b> is often an NMOS transistor due to its inherently higher current drive, lower threshold voltage, and smaller area relative to a PMOS transistor. As is described further below, the current used to write a &#x201c;1&#x201d; in MRAM <b>30</b> is different than the current used to write a &#x201c;0&#x201d;. The asymmetry in the direction of current flow during these two write conditions is caused by the asymmetry in the gate-to-source voltage of transistor <b>20</b>. Accordingly, a write driver adapted to deliver sufficient current to write a &#x201c;0&#x201d;, may not be able to provide enough current to write a &#x201c;1&#x201d;. Similarly, a write driver adapted to deliver sufficient current to write a &#x201c;1&#x201d; may deliver a current that is greater than what would otherwise be an acceptable current level to write a &#x201c;0&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">In the following description, an MRAM cell is defined as being in a logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; state when the free and reference layers of its associated MTJ are in a parallel (P) state, i.e., the MTJ exhibits a low resistance. This low resistance state is also alternatively shown as R<sub>low </sub>or R<sub>P </sub>state. Conversely, an MRAM cell is defined as being in a logic &#x201c;1&#x201d; state when the free and reference layers of its associated MTJ are in an anti-parallel (AP) state, i.e., the MTJ exhibits a high resistance. This high resistance state is also alternatively shown as R<sub>high </sub>or R<sub>AP </sub>state. Furthermore, in the following, it is assumed that the reference layer of the MTJ faces its associated select transistor, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>. Therefore, in accordance with the discussion above, a current flowing along the direction of arrow <b>35</b> (the up direction) (i) either causes a switch from the P state to the AP state thus to write a &#x201c;1&#x201d;, (ii) or stabilizes the previously established AP state of the associated MTJ. Likewise, a current flowing along the direction of arrow <b>40</b> (the down direction) (i) either causes a switch from the AP state to the P state thus to write a &#x201c;0&#x201d;, (ii) or stabilizes the previously established P state of the associated MTJ. It is understood, however, that in other embodiments this orientation may be reversed so that the free layer of the MTJ faces its associated select transistor. In such embodiments (not shown), a current flowing along the direction of arrow <b>35</b> (i) either causes a switch from the AP state to the P, (ii) or stabilizes the previously established P state of the associated MTJ. Likewise, in such embodiments, a current flowing along the direction of arrow <b>40</b> (i) either causes a switch from the P state to the AP state, (ii) or stabilizes the previously established AP state. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref> is a schematic representation of MRAM <b>30</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> in which MTJ <b>10</b> is shown as a storage element whose resistance varies depending on the data stored therein. The MTJ changes its state (i) from P to AP when the current flows along arrow <b>35</b>, and (ii) from AP to P when the current flows along arrow <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">As described above, the voltage required to switch an MTJ from an AP state to a P state, or vice versa, must exceed a critical value Vc. The current corresponding to this voltage is referred to as the critical current Ic. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> represents the variation in the MTJ state (or its resistance) during various write cycles. To transition from the P state (low resistance state) to AP state (high resistance state), a positive voltage of Vc is applied. Once in the AP state, removing the applied voltage does not affect the state of the MTJ. Likewise, to transition from the AP state to the P state, a negative voltage of Vc is applied. Once in the P state, removing the applied voltage does not affect the state of the MTJ. The resistance of the MTJ is R<sub>high </sub>when it is in AP state and receives no or very small voltage. Likewise, the resistance of the MTJ is R<sub>low </sub>when it is in P state and receives no or very small voltage.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref> shows an MTJ <b>10</b> being programmed to switch from an anti-parallel state (i.e., high resistance state, or logic &#x201c;1&#x201d; state) to a parallel state so as to store a &#x201c;0&#x201d; (i.e., low resistance state, or logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; state). It is assumed that MTJ <b>10</b> is initially in a logic &#x201c;1&#x201d; or AP state. As described above, to store a &#x201c;0&#x201d;, a current I<sub>c </sub>greater than the critical current is caused to flow through transistor <b>20</b> in the direction of arrow <b>40</b>. To achieve this, the source node (SL) of transistor <b>20</b> is coupled to the ground potential via a resistive path (not shown), a positive voltage Vpp is applied to the gate node (WL or wordline) of transistor <b>20</b>, and a positive voltage V<sub>cc </sub>is applied to the drain node (BL or bitline) of transistor <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> is an exemplary timing diagram of the voltage levels at nodes WL, SL, SN and BL during write &#x201c;0&#x201d; operation, occurring approximately between times 25 ns and 35 ns, and write &#x201c;1&#x201d; operation, occurring approximately between times 45 ns and 55 ns, for a conventional MTJ such as MTJ <b>10</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. Supply voltage V<sub>CC </sub>is assumed to be 1.8 volts. Signal WL, as well as signal CS which is a column select signal, are shown as having been boosted to a higher Vpp programming voltage of 3.0 volts. During the write &#x201c;0&#x201d; operation, the voltages at nodes BL, SL and SN are shown as being approximately equal to 1.43 V, 0.34 V, and 0.88 V respectively. During the write &#x201c;1&#x201d; operation, the voltages at nodes BL, SL and SN are shown as being approximately equal to 0.23 V, 1.43 V, and 0.84 V respectively. Although not shown, for this exemplary computer simulation, the currents flowing through the MTJ during write &#x201c;0&#x201d; and &#x201c;1&#x201d; operations are respectively 121 &#x3bc;A and 99.2 &#x3bc;A.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref> shows an MTJ being programmed to switch from a parallel state to an anti-parallel state so as to store a &#x201c;1&#x201d;. It is assumed that MTJ <b>10</b> is initially in a logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; or P state. To store a &#x201c;1&#x201d;, a current L greater than the critical current is caused to flow through transistor <b>20</b> in the direction of arrow <b>35</b>. To achieve this, node SL is supplied with the voltage V<sub>cc </sub>via a resistive path (not shown), node WL is supplied with the voltage Vpp, and node BL is coupled to the ground potential via a resistive path (not shown). Accordingly, during a write &#x201c;1&#x201d; operation, the gate-to-source voltage of transistor <b>20</b> is set to (V<sub>WL</sub>-V<sub>SN</sub>), and the drain-to-source voltage of transistor <b>20</b> is set to (V<sub>SL</sub>-V<sub>SN</sub>).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Because the gate-to-source and drain-to-source voltages of transistor <b>20</b> are higher under the conditions described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 5</figref> than they are under the conditions described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B and 5</figref>, the corresponding current flow through the MTJ is higher when attempting to write a logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; than a logic &#x201c;1&#x201d;. Accordingly, the voltages designed to generate the critical current needed to carry out a write &#x201c;0&#x201d; operation may not be sufficient to carry out a write &#x201c;1&#x201d; operation. An undesirable asymmetry thus exists in the current levels during write &#x201c;1&#x201d; and write &#x201c;0&#x201d; operations. Consequently, a transistor size selected to provide sufficient current to write a &#x201c;0&#x201d; may not provide enough current to write a &#x201c;1&#x201d;. Alternatively, a larger transistor size selected to provide the required current to write a &#x201c;1&#x201d;, may result in generation of excessive current when writing a &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Such an excess current may damage the tunneling layer of the MTJ shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">During redundancy operation, a memory chip may be tested and repaired at the factory (or by the seller) by determining the address locations of defective cells. The defective address locations are then mapped out of the final usable address space by replacing entire rows and/or columns in the regular memory array with redundant rows and/or columns provided on the same chip. The redundancy mapping is accomplished by setting content addressable memory (CAM) bits granular only at the row and/or column level within the addressing/decoding circuitry. The redundancy operation is normally done by special test operation modes that are not made available to the memory's end-user so the memory producer may maintain control of the product quality. Once in the field, memory address locations mapped out by redundancy stay mapped out for the life of the part. In contrast, during normal write operation by an end-use, memory address locations are granular by individual cell and reusable (except for the case of permanently altered memory such as ROM or PROM). Thus, redundancy operations are different than normal write operations done by the end-user.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Error correction codes (ECC) are used to logically process the values of multiple logical bits that are grouped in fixed sized blocks, such as a byte, to be written in a memory. The ECC logic generates additional encoded logical bit values called a checksum or ECC to be stored additionally with the original byte. Each value in the checksum or ECC may be different depending on the values in the byte and the encoding algorithm. The ECC encoding takes additional circuitry and slows performance but enables errors in the original byte to be detected and/or corrected depending on the number of bit errors in the byte, type of encoding and number of additional bits used.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">During write operation, a memory cell may exhibit randomly different write times at different occasions even under the same, stable conditions. Such behavior may not result from wear-out mechanisms that could be screened out during factory testing, but instead, results from probabilistic behavior of the memory cell's write characteristics. Memory cells determined to be defective for non-probabilistic reasons may be removed from a cell population by testing at the factory (by the seller) to scrap bad chips or repair defects by replacing defective cells with redundant cells on-chip during the memory repair step. However, the remaining population may still exhibit probabilistic behavior. Alternatively, after factory shipment to the field and if the chip is in regular use by the end-user, memory systems may be able to flag address locations corresponding to slow to write cells, mapping them out of the usable address space. The end-user mapping of slow to write cells results in a dwindling number of usable address locations over time, since the mapped out cells are not expected to recover to normal. Thus, probabilistic cell behavior would result in either, low factory yield due to depleting limited redundant elements, or depleting the usable address space over time in the field.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">In particular, during write operation, a memory cell may exhibit randomly different write times at different occasions under stable environmental conditions. This behavior may produce an error during writing data into a memory system at random occasions even for the cell population determined to be otherwise defect free. A new memory circuit solution is desired to overcome the probabilistic cell behavior problem.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention, a write circuit is adapted to provide a same logical bit to each of a multitude of memory cells for storage. Each of the multitude of memory cells stores either the bit or a complement of the bit in response to the write circuit. A read circuit is adapted to receive the bits stored in the multitude of memory cells and to generate an output value defined by the stored bits in accordance with a predefined rule. In one embodiment, the predefined rule may be generated by a logic circuit and may be characterized by a statistical mode of the bits stored in the plurality of memory cells. Thus, storage errors in a minority of the physical memory cells (alternatively referred to herein as memory cells or cells), may be ignored at the cost of lower memory density. The storage errors may be due to probabilistic write behavior or due to other storage issues such as data retention errors. In another embodiment, the predefined rule may be characterized by a first weight assigned to bits <b>1</b> and a second weight assigned to bits <b>0</b>. Where one of the values of the logical bit is harder to store in the cell than the other, the predefined rule generated by the logic circuit may decide in favor of the harder to store value. This embodiment includes the previous embodiment's advantages and facilitates ignoring bit storage errors for memory systems with asymmetric storage characteristics.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is an exemplary block diagram of a memory system <b>100</b> and associated circuitry, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Memory system <b>100</b> includes a multitude of array blocks selected by column select drivers, a multitude of global write, a multitude of global sense amps (SA), a multitude of global word line (GWL) circuits, and a control circuit. Each array block may include an array of physical memory cells (memory array tile, or MAT) <b>102</b> whose rows are selected by one or more sub word line (SWL) circuits, and whose columns are selected by one or more local column select circuits (LCS) <b>104</b>. The corners of each block include an array gap area <b>110</b> to be described in further detail below. It should be noted the terms sensing and reading may be used interchangeably herein, as are the terms sense and read.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">Memory array tile <b>102</b> includes many columns, wordlines and cells located at the intersections of the columns and wordlines. Each cell is capable of storing a logical data bit, which corresponds to a value of logical 1 or logical 0. By way of example, some of the embodiments described below will use STT-MRAM cells previously described. For example, the physical memory cell may be a DRAM, SRAM, ROM, PROM, EEPROM, FLASH, FeRAM, PRAM, MRAM, ReRAM, STT-MRAM, or ReRAM (resistive RAM) cell depending on the technology.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is a schematic representation <b>200</b> of portions of a memory system <b>100</b> and associated writing and reading circuitry, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. Schematic representation <b>200</b> includes MAT <b>102</b>, LCS <b>104</b>, array gap <b>110</b>, and a global read/write <b>150</b>. The global SA and global write driver circuitry are included in the Global Read/Write block, which is coupled to GBL and GSL signal lines. GBL and GSL, in turn, are coupled to MBL and MSL, respectively, through a pair of pass transistors in the array gap block under the control of signal ENIO generated by the control logic block. In alternative embodiments, the write driver and/or read circuits may be located in the array gap (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">MAT <b>102</b> includes a number of MRAM cells <b>30</b> whose select transistors are coupled to word lines WL<b>0</b>-WLn driven by the SWL circuits and the GWL circuits described above in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. In reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, the multitude of MRAM cells <b>30</b> are also coupled to a source line (SL) <b>210</b> and a bit line (BL) <b>212</b> pair, which may form part of the column. The MAT includes a multitude of SL and BL pairs selectable by LCS <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">The LCS includes pairs of n-channel select transistors <b>213</b> which couple a selected SL and BL pair in MAT <b>102</b> to a pair of MSL <b>220</b> and MBL <b>230</b> lines under control of a column select (CS) <b>215</b>, a precharge (PRE) <b>235</b>, an isolation top (ISOT), and an isolation bottom (ISOB) signal. The LCS determines whether to couple adjacent MAT <b>102</b> above or below the LCS by enabling one of the respective ISOT or ISOB signals. The top MAT is selected by enabling ISOT and disabling ISOB. One of the multitude of SL and BL pairs is selected by the CS signal driven by the column select drivers, to couple the selected SL and BL pair to the respective MSL and MBL lines. The SL/BL and respective MSL/MBL lines are ready for write or read operation modes when PRE is disabled. MSL <b>220</b> and MBL <b>230</b> are coupled from LCS <b>104</b> to array gap <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">The example shown in schematic representation <b>200</b> includes STT-MRAM cells, but it would be recognized that the embodiment has a broader range of applicability. For example MAT <b>102</b> may include other memory cell types as discussed above. In one embodiment, one of the number of cells may include (i) one current carrying terminal coupled to BL <b>212</b>, (ii) another current carrying terminal coupled to SL <b>210</b> and (iii) a control terminal coupled to the word-line. In another embodiment, one current carrying terminal of one of the number of cells may be connected to a power supply or ground potential directly within the MAT without having to be decoded by a column select signal. In this example, the column may include only one signal line such as the BL signal, while the SL signal is connected to a power supply or ground potential within the MAT without decoding. In this embodiment, the LCS may include only one n-channel select transistor to couple the column BL to the global BL through a single MBL line.</p>

Schematic representation <b>300</b> of portions of a memory system <b>100</b> and associated circuits that ignore storage errors includes two or more physical columns CLW<b>0</b>-CLWc, where c is an integer with a value of two or more representing the number of cells per logical-bit. The CLW<b>0</b>-CLWc are grouped into a logical column CLm, where m is an integer representing the number of logical columns. Each signal CLWc is analogous to the column pair SL/BL referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> and may represent either a pair of lines or a single line as described above depending on the memory cell technology type.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">By way of example, c is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> with four cells/logical-bit. However, c may be increased to better deal with higher storage error rates, at the cost of reduced memory storage density. Conversely, c may be reduced if storage error rates are low. Each of c physical cells <b>303</b>, or cells, is coupled to the cell's corresponding physical column, CLWc. A logical bit located at (n,m) is assigned to c physical cells <b>303</b>, located at the intersection of WLn and logical column CLm. Thus, the total physical memory size is given by the value of n&#xd7;m&#xd7;c cells which is able to store n&#xd7;m logical bits. The memory density is reduced by the factor c compared to conventional single bit per cell memory.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">The physical column CLm in MAT <b>102</b> is coupled to c signal lines in the LCS called (MBL/MSL)W<b>0</b>-(MBL/MSL)Wc through c n-channel select transistors whose control gates are coupled to signal CSm. For the example shown, (MBL/MSL)W<b>0</b>-(MBL/MSL)W<b>3</b> are coupled to corresponding physical columns CLW<b>0</b>-CLW<b>3</b> through four n-channel select transistors <b>310</b>, <b>331</b>, <b>352</b> and <b>373</b> respectively if CSm is selected. Thus, the four cells in the MAT are coupled to (MBL/MSL)W<b>0</b>-(MBL/MSL)W<b>3</b> in the LCS if WLn and CSm are selected. Each of the n-channel select transistors <b>310</b>-<b>373</b> and lines (MBL/MSL)Wc are analogous to n-channel select transistors <b>213</b> and lines MBL/MSL referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Therefore, each signal CLWc and (MBL/MSL)Wc may represent either a pair of signal lines or a single line as described above depending on the memory cell technology type.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">Referring again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, during write operation, write circuits write a value of a single logical bit at location (n,m) into the c cells on logical column CLm through the bus (MBL/MSL)W<b>0</b>-(MBL/MSL)Wc if WLn and CSm are selected. The write circuit writes the same value of the logical bit in each one of c cells at the selected location (n,m). For example, if the logical bit value to be written in location (n,m) is &#x201c;1&#x201d;, a value &#x201c;1&#x201d; is written into each of the selected c cells. Conversely, if the logical bit value to be written is &#x201c;0&#x201d;, a &#x201c;0&#x201d; is written into each of the selected c cells.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The read circuit may include c SA circuits, SA<b>0</b>-SAc, shown as SA<b>0</b>-SA<b>3</b> <b>320</b>, <b>341</b>, <b>362</b> and <b>383</b> respectively, in this example. During read operation, read circuits read a value of a single logical bit stored at location (n,m) from c cells <b>303</b> on logical column CLm through the bus (MBL/MSL)W<b>0</b>-(MBL/MSL)Wc if WLn and CSm are selected. The input of each SAc is coupled to one of the corresponding c cells <b>303</b>, because the input of each SAc is coupled to a corresponding (MBL/MSL)Wc line. The SAc circuits may be located in the global read/write block or locally in the array gap or LCS. Each SAc circuit may also include a reference REF signal input. The output of each SAc is coupled to a corresponding Wc line, which may carry the value of the logical bit stored in the selected cell on physical column CLWc. Each Wc is coupled to program bit register weight comparator (PBRWC) block <b>390</b>, which decides and outputs the desired value of the logical bit stored in the selected c cells on a data read DR signal. The decision (alternatively referred to herein as a predefined rule) is generated by logic circuits within the PBRWC that use the Wc signals as inputs and which may be selected by program input signal lines as described below.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">The c physical cells <b>303</b> and corresponding c n-channel select transistors may be adjacently located on adjacently grouped physical columns within the same MAT as shown. Alternatively, the c physical cells <b>303</b> and corresponding c n-channel select transistors may be non-adjacently located on non-adjacently grouped physical columns within the same MAT by routing the CSm signal line to the desired physical column location (not shown). Non-adjacently located cells may improve immunity to radiation induced soft errors, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> is a schematic representation of portions of a 4-bit wide memory system <b>400</b> and associated program bit register weight comparator circuits, in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. In this example, the c physical cells <b>303</b> and corresponding physical columns CLWc are non-adjacently located in c corresponding memory array blocks. By way of example, c is again four cells/logical-bit. Memory system <b>400</b> includes c memory arrays A-D <b>1020</b>-<b>1023</b> respectively. Each of the c memory arrays may correspond, in part, to the multiple MAT, LCS, SWL and array gap blocks in memory system <b>100</b> previously referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">In reference again to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>, each of the c memory arrays is coupled to a corresponding global R/W <b>150</b> block. Each of the c memory arrays and corresponding global R/W have a physical data bus width equal to w, where w is an integer greater than 0. In this example, w is four bits wide so each of the c memory arrays may be able to simultaneously write four physical cells at a time or read four cells at a time. A data write bus DW&#x3c;0:15&#x3e; is split into a multitude of c data write buses, or four DW&#x3c;0:3&#x3e; buses if c is equal to four, DW_A&#x3c;0:3&#x3e;, DW_B&#x3c;0:3&#x3e;, DW_C&#x3c;0:3&#x3e;, and DW_D&#x3c;0:3&#x3e;, which are coupled directly to each of the c global R/W blocks, respectively. A multitude of c data read buses, or four DR&#x3c;0:3&#x3e; buses if c is equal to four, DR_A&#x3c;0:3&#x3e;, DR_B&#x3c;0:3&#x3e;, DR_C&#x3c;0:3&#x3e;, and DR_D&#x3c;0:3&#x3e; are coupled from each of the c global R/W blocks, respectively, to PBRWC <b>390</b> through DR&#x3c;0:15&#x3e;. Since each logical bit is assigned to four physical cells, the PBRWC outputs DR&#x3c;0:3&#x3e;. Memory system <b>400</b> may be a monolithic integrated circuit or a memory system using a multitude of memory integrated circuits.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> is a schematic representation of PBRWC circuit <b>390</b> referenced in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, in accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, PBRWC circuit <b>390</b> includes a program bit register <b>510</b>, a multitude of weight comparators <b>1</b>-<i>d </i><b>520</b>-<b>550</b>, respectively, and a multiplexor <b>560</b>, where d is a predetermined integer value. The program input is coupled to program bit register (PBR) <b>510</b> which may be a volatile or non-volatile, one-time-programmable (OTP) or re-programmable, data register or other circuit type that outputs a d wide selection bus S&#x3c;1:d&#x3e;. The program input may be provided during chip manufacture, at electrical test, in similar fashion as memory redundancy is programmed. Alternatively, program input may come directly from signals coupled directly from bond pads.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">Each one of the weight comparators d is selected by selecting one of the corresponding S&#x3c;1:d&#x3e; or Sd signals. The non-selected weight comparators d are powered down to save energy. Each one of the weight comparators d is a logic circuit that decides the value of the logical bit DR stored in and assigned to the c physical memory cells <b>303</b>, which are coupled to the weight comparators d via the outputs of the SAc on lines W&#x3c;0:c&#x3e;. One of the desired DRd output from the weight comparators d is chosen by bus S&#x3c;1:d&#x3e; through multiplexor <b>560</b>, which outputs the corrected value of the logical bit on line DR (alternatively referred to herein as value of DR or DR). Thus, the read circuit is able to decide the value of the logical bit stored in the c physical memory cells in accordance with an output of one of the multitude of weight comparators d and the selection of the weight comparator d is made by a program input. This feature allows flexible selection of a variety of DR decision implementations (to be described below) on the same chip depending on manufacturing test results that may optimize the DR decision over processing variations, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The value stored in cells W<b>0</b>, W<b>1</b>, W<b>2</b> and Wc may not exactly match the intended written value of the logical bit due to probabilistic write behavior soon after the write operation or due to data retention loss long after the write operation. The probability of the majority of c cells/logical-bit exhibiting such problems is lower than in a conventional one cell/logical-bit design.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">According to one embodiment, DR is determined by the output of one of the weight comparators d without regard to storage differences between logical values. Then, the value of DR may be characterized by a statistical mode of the bits stored in c cells <b>303</b>. The statistical mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the bits stored in the selected c cells. For c cells assigned per logical bit, there are 2<sup>C </sup>possible permutations of the W<b>0</b>-Wc logical values stored on the cells. The logical value of DR may be assigned to each of the 2<sup>C </sup>permutations of W<b>0</b>-Wc in the form of a logic truth table implemented by one of the weight comparators d. A statistical mode assignment rule for the logical value of DR is defined as follows. For each permutation, the value of DR is assigned to equal the value that occurs most frequently in the bits stored in the Wc values in that permutation. For example, DR is assigned a logic &#x201c;0&#x201d; or bit <b>0</b> if most of the Wc correspond to logic &#x201c;0&#x201d;. Conversely, DR is assigned a &#x201c;1&#x201d; or bit <b>1</b> if most of the Wc correspond to &#x201c;1&#x201d;. The assignment rule may provide an equal number of permutations assigned to a &#x201c;1&#x201d; as to a &#x201c;0&#x201d; and ignores storage errors in a minority of the c cells. In other words, the predefined rule may give equal weight to bits stored as a <b>1</b> and bits stored as a <b>0</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">In some technologies, like STT-RAM, one logical value may be harder to write or store than the other logical value. For example, logic &#x201c;1&#x201d; may be harder to store than a &#x201c;0&#x201d;. According to one embodiment, the predefined rule is characterized by a first weight assigned to bits <b>1</b> and a second weight assigned to bits <b>0</b>. DR may be determined by the output of one of the weight comparators d if one of the values of the logical bit is harder to store in the cell than the other. The predefined rule for the first weight assigned to bits <b>1</b> and the second weight assigned to bits <b>0</b> is defined as follows. The logical value of DR for the easier to store value is assigned to permutations that have a majority, or supermajority, of the Wc values corresponding to the easier to store value. The logical value of DR for the harder to store logical value is assigned to the remaining permutations. Thus, the predefined rule may give unequal weights to bits stored as a <b>1</b> and bits stored as a <b>0</b>. For example, DR is assigned a &#x201c;0&#x201d; if a majority, or supermajority, of the Wc correspond to &#x201c;0&#x201d; and a &#x201c;0&#x201d; is easier to store than a &#x201c;1&#x201d;. One of the weight comparators d and its corresponding logic truth table may thus favor the harder to store value in the unequally weighted predefined rule by assigning more of the possible permutations to the logic value of DR that is harder to store in the cell.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">A corresponding truth table example is shown in Table 1 below, which assumes a &#x201c;1&#x201d; is harder to store in the cells than a &#x201c;0&#x201d; and c is four. Accordingly, there are sixteen total permutations of W<b>0</b>-W<b>3</b>. The weighting condition includes five permutations that each store a &#x201c;0&#x201d; in three or more cells, and eleven permutations that each store a &#x201c;1&#x201d; in two or more cells. The decision implementation allows one of the four cells that is supposed to store a &#x201c;0&#x201d; to be in error but allows up to two of the four cells that is supposed to store a &#x201c;1&#x201d; to be in error. The unequally weighted predefined rule favors the harder to store logic value of &#x201c;1&#x201d;. Thus, it is easier to store a &#x201c;1&#x201d; in the four cells than a &#x201c;0&#x201d;. The logical complement of Table 1 would similarly favor the opposite condition if a &#x201c;0&#x201d; is harder to store in the cells than a &#x201c;1&#x201d;.</p>

Logic circuit <b>550</b> corresponds to one of the weight comparators d <b>550</b> and includes NOR gates <b>615</b>, <b>625</b>, <b>635</b>, <b>645</b>, <b>655</b> and <b>660</b>, and inverters <b>620</b>, <b>630</b>, <b>640</b> and <b>650</b>. Signal lines W<b>0</b>-W<b>3</b> from the SAc are coupled directly and through the inverters to NOR gates <b>615</b>, <b>625</b>, <b>635</b>, <b>645</b> and <b>655</b>, which couple to NOR gate <b>660</b>, which are adapted to implement the logic function described in Table 1 at the output, DRd. Many alternative logic circuit embodiments may be used to implement the truth tables described in the tables herein, the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> may, for example, be implemented with NAND instead of NOR gates.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to one embodiment, DR is determined by the output of one of the weight comparators d if both values of the logical bit are equally harder to store in the cell. Then, the decision in one of the weight comparators d may be characterized by the statistical mode of the values stored in the c cells with equal weighting. The equal weighting rule and its corresponding logic truth table may use an odd number for c. For example, if c is three, there are eight possible permutations which may be equally weighted. Any one bit out of three may be allowed to have a storage error. A corresponding truth table example is shown in Table 2 below. The weighting is equal since four permutations each store a &#x201c;0&#x201d; in two or more cells, and four permutations each store a &#x201c;1&#x201d; in two or more cells. This logic truth table may be implemented using logic circuit <b>550</b> with the W<b>3</b> circuit path eliminating or ignored within one of the weight comparators d.</p>

<p id="p-0083" num="0082">According to one embodiment, DR is determined by the output of one of the weight comparators d if one of the values of the logical bit is much harder to store in the cell than the other. Then, the value of DR may be characterized by a severely weighted supermajority of the values stored in the c cells. A corresponding truth table example is shown in Table 3 below, which assumes a &#x201c;1&#x201d; is much harder to store in the cells than a &#x201c;0&#x201d; and c is three. Accordingly, the weighting condition includes one permutation that stores a &#x201c;0&#x201d; in three cells, and seven permutations that each store a &#x201c;1&#x201d; in one or more cells. The predefined rule allows one of the four cells that is supposed to store a &#x201c;0&#x201d; to be in error but allows up to two of the four cells that is supposed to store a &#x201c;1&#x201d; to be in error. The severely unequally weighted predefined rule greatly favors the much harder to store logic value &#x201c;1&#x201d;. Thus, it is much easier to store a &#x201c;1&#x201d; in the three cells than a &#x201c;0&#x201d;.

<p id="p-0085" num="0084">According to one embodiment, DR is determined by the output of one of the weight comparators d if one of the values of the logical bit is harder to store in the cell than the other but with less difficulty than the example described in Table 3 above. A corresponding logic truth table is shown in Table 4 below, which again assumes a &#x201c;1&#x201d; is harder to store in the cells than a &#x201c;0&#x201d; and the value of c is two. In this case the W<b>3</b> and W<b>2</b> paths in one of the weight comparators d are eliminating or ignored. Alternatively, the memory density of the system may be optimized by designing the system with just two cells assigned per logical bit. Accordingly, the weighting condition includes one permutation that stores a &#x201c;0&#x201d; in two cells, and three permutations that each store a &#x201c;1&#x201d; in one or more cells. This example allows none of the two cells that is supposed to store a &#x201c;0&#x201d; to be in error but allows one of the two cells that is supposed to store a &#x201c;1&#x201d; to be in error. The logical complement of Table 3 would similarly favor the opposite condition if a &#x201c;0&#x201d; is much harder to store in the cells than a &#x201c;1&#x201d;.</p>
