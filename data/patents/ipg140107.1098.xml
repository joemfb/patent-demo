<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of Disclosure</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates to containers in general and in particular to an insulated food storage container having protection for the edges of an applied graphics sheet.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Portable insulated containers, or coolers, as they are commonly referred to as are well known in the art. Conventional cooler construction comprises forming a blow molded outer shell. A vacuum formed inner liner is then placed within the outer shell and the space between the inner liner and outer shell may then be commonly filled with an expanding foam insulation. The inner liner and outer shell are typically connected to each other at their upper ends to sealably contain the insulation. The interior space defined by the inner line provides the storage space for food articles or the like and may be enclosed with a lid which may also be insulated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Conventional coolers typically have a monochromatic outer shell which is the color of the material used to form that shell. As a result, coolers are typically not fully utilized for advertising or displaying of logos and graphics as are typical with other types of consumer products. For example, it is common for sports teams or schools to apply their logos to a variety of merchandise such as mugs, clothes, glasses and the like for sale to their supporters. Sales of such merchandise are often highly desirable both for enhancing the profile of the team as well as permitting these fans to demonstrate their support.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Several difficulties have heretofore limited the ability to apply graphics to the exterior surface of coolers. Cooler are required to be both relatively inexpensive to produce as well as rugged to cope with the impacts and rough treatment such products regularly endure. The rough treatment that coolers endure has limited the ability to apply paint or images directly to the cooler. Such paint would typically not endure the repeated abrasions of the surface of the cooler against various objects and would result in the paint becoming scrapped away in places and therefore visually unappealing. Additionally, the blow molding techniques typically utilized to form conventional coolers results in an uneven surface that is often inadequate for application of a paint or a graphics sheet thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Additionally, graphic bearing sheets have also not previously provided an appropriate solution for applying graphics to coolers. Graphics sheets have edges which may be prone to being caught or hooked on objects. Therefore, any graphic sheets applied to a cooler needs to have these edges protected from such contacts. Previous methods of protecting these edges has been to recess a region into a single flat surface on the cooler body into which the graphics sheet may be applied. This method limits the graphics sheet to a single surface or requires multiple applications to surround the cooler resulting in a broken total image or excessive cost of manufacture. Such graphics sheets are also typically relatively small so as to provide sufficient space around the graphics sheet for the raised protectors. Graphics of this type have not been able to provide a single image that surrounds the entire body of the cooler.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">According to a first embodiment there is disclosed an apparatus for storing articles. The apparatus comprises a container having an open top, a closed bottom and a continuous peripheral wall extending therearound between said top and bottom. The peripheral wall has an exterior surface adapted to have a flexible sheet applied thereto. The flexible sheet has top and bottom opposed edges corresponding to the top and bottom of the container. The apparatus further comprises edge protecting means for protecting at least one of the top or bottom edge of the flexible sheet.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, an insulated storage container or cooler according to a first embodiment as in illustrated at <b>10</b>. The cooler <b>10</b> comprises a cooler body <b>12</b> having an interior compartment <b>14</b> for storing food and the like which is thermally insulated from the external environment. The cooler <b>10</b> may also optionally include a lid <b>4</b> sealably covering the interior compartment <b>14</b>. The cooler <b>10</b> may also optionally include a rotatable handle <b>160</b> or other suitable handle means as are conventional and known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, an exploded view of the cooler body <b>12</b> according to a first embodiment is illustrated. The cooler body <b>12</b> comprises an upright continuous peripheral wall <b>20</b> having interior and exterior surfaces <b>22</b> and <b>24</b>, respectively, extending between top and bottom edges, <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, respectively. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the peripheral wall <b>20</b> is arranged in a continuous loop such that the top edge <b>26</b> defines a top opening <b>30</b> and the bottom edge <b>28</b> defines a bottom opening <b>32</b>. The cooler body <b>12</b> also includes top and bottom caps <b>40</b> and <b>70</b>, respectively, sized and adapted to engage with the top and bottom edges <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> so as to enclose the corresponding top and bottom openings <b>30</b> and <b>32</b>. According to the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the top cap <b>40</b> may optionally include a continuously formed inner liner <b>60</b> therewith. In other embodiments, the inner liner <b>60</b> may be removably secured to the top cap <b>40</b> with fasteners or the like.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the cooler body <b>12</b> is adapted to receive a flexible sheet <b>80</b> therearound having a back surface <b>82</b> and front surface <b>84</b>. An adhesive, such as for example glue, double sided tape or epoxy or the like may be applied to the back surface <b>82</b> so as to adhere the graphic sheet to the exterior surface <b>24</b> of the peripheral wall <b>20</b>. The back surface <b>82</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b> may have a graphics logo, or other type of visual display applied thereto that is visible to a viewer through the graphics sheet from the front surface <b>84</b>. The graphics may be applied to the back surface <b>82</b> by means of direct printing on the back surface <b>82</b>, ink-printing, photo sublimation printing, lithographic printing, screen printing, tempo or pad printing, foil blocking, inkjet printing, hand printing or any other suitable printable methods as are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The flexible sheet <b>80</b> may be formed of any flexible material adapted to have a graphics applied thereto. According to some embodiments, the graphics may be applied to the back surface <b>82</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b>. However it will be appreciated, that the graphics may also be applied to the front surface <b>84</b> or embedded or otherwise formed into the flexible sheet <b>80</b> material itself such as by way of direct printing on the front surface <b>84</b>, photo sublimation printing, lithographic printing, screen printing, tampo printing, foil blocking, inkjet printing, and hand painting or any other suitable printable methods as are known in the art. Examples of suitable materials include, but are not limited to polycarbonate, polyvinyl chloride (PVC), acetate, polyester, polyethylene terephthalate (PET), glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate (PETG), and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) or high-impact polystyrene (HIPS). The flexible sheet <b>80</b> should also be selected to have sufficient toughness and thickness that it is not ripped or excessively damaged by impacts and abrasions. In practice, it has been found that a thickness of between 0.05 and 1 millimeters has been useful although it will be appreciated that other thicknesses will be useful as well.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The flexible sheet <b>80</b> comprises a substantially rectangular sheet of flexible material having top and bottom edges <b>86</b> and <b>88</b>, respectively and first and second ends <b>90</b> and <b>92</b>, respectively. The first and second ends <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> are adapted to be joinable to each other so as to form the graphics sheet into a sleeve for surrounding the peripheral wall <b>20</b>. It will be appreciated that the length of the flexible sheet <b>80</b> will be selected so as to permit the flexible sheet <b>80</b> to closely surround the peripheral wall <b>20</b> when the first and second ends <b>90</b> and <b>92</b> are connected together. The first and second ends may be secured to each other by an adhesive, double sided tape, hot melting or any other suitable bonding method.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the exterior surface <b>24</b> of the peripheral wall <b>20</b> extends between the top and bottom edges <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. In some embodiments, the exterior surface <b>24</b> extends perpendicular from the top and bottom edges <b>26</b> and <b>28</b> so as to facilitate the application of a rectangular graphics sheet thereto. It will be appreciated that in these embodiments, the exterior surface <b>24</b> will be substantially smooth and regular surface. Non-perpendicular surfaces may also be useful in embodiments in which the flexible sheet <b>80</b> is similarly adapted to be closely applied to the exterior surface <b>24</b>. In such embodiments, the exterior surface <b>24</b> may have a taper from the top or the bottom edges <b>26</b> or <b>28</b> of the cooler body <b>12</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>, the container body may have a substantially rectangular planar cross section with rounded or chamfered corners. It will be appreciated however cross-sectional shapes may also be possible such as circular, oval, triangular or octagonal by way of non-limiting example.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">The peripheral wall <b>20</b> may be formed of any suitable material having a surface to which the flexible sheet <b>80</b> may be applied to, such as, without limitation, metals such as steel or aluminum, fiberglass, carbon fiber, or plastics such as polycarbonate, polyethylene, polypropylene or ABS. The exterior surface <b>24</b> should be formed to have sufficient strength to resist impacts and provide strength to the cooler. The selection of this thickness will depend upon the material to be used, however it has been found that a thickness of between 1 and 5 millimeters has been useful when the peripheral wall <b>20</b> is formed from polyethylene.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">According to some embodiments, the height of the flexible sheet <b>80</b> between the top and bottom edges <b>86</b> and <b>88</b> will be selected to be close to but less than the height of the peripheral wall <b>20</b> between its top and bottom edges <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>. In such a configuration, the flexible sheet <b>80</b> may be applied to the peripheral wall <b>20</b> such that the top edge <b>86</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b> is proximate to the top edge <b>26</b> of the peripheral wall. Correspondingly, the bottom edge <b>88</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b> will be proximate to the bottom edge <b>28</b> of the peripheral wall <b>20</b>. Accordingly, the sizing of the top and bottom caps <b>40</b> and <b>70</b> should also be designed so as to properly protect the edges of the flexible sheet <b>80</b>. In practice, it has been found that having a distance of less than 10 mm between the top edge <b>86</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b> and the top edge <b>26</b> of the peripheral wall <b>20</b> and a distance of less than 10 mm between the bottom edge <b>88</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b> and the bottom edge <b>28</b> of the peripheral wall <b>20</b> has been useful.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">According to the present embodiment, an insulating material <b>34</b> may be disposed between the peripheral wall <b>20</b> and the inner liner <b>60</b>. The insulating material <b>34</b> may comprise a preformed insulating shell as further described below, an injected expanding insulating material or other suitable means of providing thermal insulating between the inner liner and the peripheral wall and bottom cap as are known in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">The top cap <b>40</b> comprises an annular ring <b>42</b> having a distal downturned portion <b>44</b>. The top cap <b>40</b> is adapted to have a shape and outline substantially proportionate to the top opening <b>30</b> such that the top cap <b>40</b> may be placed over the top edge <b>26</b> of the peripheral wall <b>20</b>. When placed upon the top edge <b>26</b>, the downturned portion <b>44</b> of the top cap <b>40</b> will overlap a portion of the peripheral wall <b>20</b> and form a void for protecting the top edge <b>86</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b> therebetween as described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">The downturned portion <b>44</b> may overlap the peripheral wall <b>20</b> and flexible sheet <b>80</b> by an amount sufficient to protect and retain the flexible sheet <b>80</b> against the peripheral wall <b>20</b> as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> which should be at least 1 mm. In practice it has been found that an overlap of between 3 and 15 millimeters of the downturned portion upon the flexible sheet <b>80</b> has been sufficient although other overlap distances will be useful as well.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">The bottom cap <b>70</b> comprises a substantially planar member <b>72</b> having an upturned portion <b>74</b> extending around the around the perimeter thereof. The planar member <b>72</b> has top and bottom surfaces <b>76</b> and <b>78</b>, respectively wherein the upturned portion <b>74</b> extends from the top surface <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The bottom cap <b>70</b> has an outline selected to correspond to the cross sectional area of the peripheral wall <b>20</b>. When assembled, the bottom edge <b>28</b> of the peripheral wall <b>20</b> abuts against the top surface <b>76</b> of the bottom cap <b>70</b> such that the upturned portion <b>74</b> surrounds and overlaps a portion of the peripheral wall <b>20</b> to form a void for protecting the bottom edge <b>88</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b> therebetween as described further below.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The upturned portion <b>74</b> may overlap the peripheral wall <b>20</b> and flexible sheet <b>80</b> by an amount sufficient to protect and retain the flexible sheet <b>80</b> against the peripheral wall <b>20</b> which should be at least 1 mm. In practice it has been found that an overlap of between 3 and 15 millimeters of the upturned portion upon the flexible sheet <b>80</b> has been sufficient although other overlap distances will be useful as well.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The cooler body <b>12</b> may be assembled as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> by snugly locating the insulating material <b>34</b> within the peripheral wall <b>20</b>. The flexible sheet <b>80</b> may then be applied to the exterior surface <b>24</b> of the peripheral wall <b>20</b> such that the top edge <b>86</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b> is proximate to the top edge <b>26</b> of the peripheral wall <b>20</b> and a bottom edge <b>88</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b> is proximate to the bottom edge <b>28</b> of the peripheral wall. The bottom cap <b>70</b> may then be secured against the bottom opening <b>32</b> formed by the bottom edge <b>28</b> of the peripheral wall <b>20</b> proximate to a bottom portion <b>36</b> of the insulating material <b>34</b>. The top cap <b>40</b> having the inner liner <b>60</b> connected thereto may then be placed over and connected to the top edge of the peripheral wall <b>20</b> such that the inner liner is closely fitting with the inner surface of the insulating layer.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a detailed cross-sectional view of the bottom cap <b>70</b> applied to the peripheral wall <b>20</b> of the cooler body <b>12</b> showing peripheral wall control webs <b>79</b>. The control webs <b>79</b> extend perpendicularly from the upturned portion <b>74</b> and include a notch <b>77</b> therein. As illustrated, the notch may be located proximate to the upturned portion <b>74</b> and is sized to receive the peripheral wall <b>20</b> and flexible sheet <b>80</b> therein. The notch <b>77</b> and control web <b>79</b> assist in stabilizing the bottom edge <b>28</b> of the peripheral wall <b>20</b> and with controlling flexing thereof. This will be particularly useful in embodiments where the peripheral wall <b>20</b> has a reduced thickness at the top and bottom edge <b>26</b> and <b>28</b>, such as when it is formed as a single piece by injection molding. It will be appreciated that the notch <b>77</b> in the control webs <b>79</b> may also be located spaced apart from the upturned portion <b>74</b> so as to space the peripheral wall <b>20</b> and flexible sheet <b>80</b> inwardly from the upturned portion. It will also be appreciated, that the top cap <b>40</b> may also include similar control webs.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the bottom cap <b>70</b> may optionally include reinforcing ribs <b>75</b>. The reinforcing ribs <b>75</b> may be formed in the planar member <b>72</b> of the bottom cap and serve to strengthen the planar member <b>72</b> from flexing. The height and placement of the reinforcing ribs <b>75</b> may be selected to sufficiently strengthen the cooler body <b>12</b> according to methods known in the art.</p>

<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, an alternative embodiment is illustrated having segmented or intermittent edge protection for the flexible sheet <b>80</b>. As illustrated, the cooler body <b>12</b> includes a segmented bottom cap <b>170</b> having intermittent or discontinuous upturned portions <b>172</b>. The intermittent upturned portions <b>172</b> comprise a plurality of spaced apart wall segments extending from the perimeter of a planar member <b>174</b> of the segmented bottom cap <b>170</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 17 and 18</figref>, the intermittent upturned portions <b>172</b> may be substantially rectangular and include rectangular notches <b>176</b> therebetween so as to form castellations. It will also be appreciated that in other embodiments, the intermittent upturned portions may have other shapes as well, such as, for example, triangular, sinusoidal, or semi-circular by way of non-limiting example. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 17</figref>, the intermittent upturned portions <b>172</b> are sized to overlap the bottom edge <b>88</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b>. As illustrated the bottom edge <b>88</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b> may be exposed within the notches <b>176</b> therebetween although it will be appreciated that an indented edge <b>178</b> forming the base of the notches <b>176</b> may also overlap the bottom edge <b>88</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b>. Although the present embodiment is described with relation to the bottom cap, it will be appreciated that the top cap may also include intermittent downturned portions for overlapping the top edge <b>86</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">Turning now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 19</figref>, an alternative embodiment is illustrated in which the bottom cap <b>70</b> does not overlap the bottom edge <b>88</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b>. As illustrated, a top edge <b>73</b> of the upturned portion <b>74</b> of the bottom cap is proximate to the bottom edge <b>88</b> of the flexible sheet so as to protect the bottom edge from being caught and therefore torn or otherwise damaged. In order to properly protect the flexible sheet <b>80</b>, the top edge <b>73</b> of the bottom cap <b>70</b> should be located within 5 millimetres of the bottom edge of the flexible sheet so as to prevent objects from passing therebetween in such a manner as to permit them to catch or hook the bottom edge of the flexible sheet. It will be appreciated that the top cap <b>40</b> may similarly also be proximate to without overlapping the top edge <b>86</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">According to a further embodiment, the peripheral wall <b>20</b> includes a raised portion <b>190</b> located proximate to the bottom edge <b>28</b> of the peripheral wall as illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 20</figref>. The raised portion <b>190</b> comprises a protuberance from the peripheral wall <b>20</b> and includes a top surface <b>194</b> forming an inside angle <b>198</b> with the exterior surface <b>24</b> of the peripheral wall <b>20</b>. The inside angle <b>198</b> should have a substantially sharp radius such that the bottom edge <b>88</b> of the flexible sheet <b>80</b> may be located proximate to the top surface <b>194</b> of the raised portion. In order to properly protect the flexible sheet <b>80</b>, the bottom edge <b>88</b> of the flexible sheet should be locatable within 5 millimetres of the top surface <b>194</b> of the raised portion <b>190</b> so as to prevent objects from passing therebetween in such a manner as to permit them to catch or hook the bottom edge of the flexible sheet. The raise portion <b>190</b> should also project from the flexible sheet <b>80</b> when applied to the peripheral wall by a distance sufficient to protect the flexible sheet as indicated generally at <b>192</b>. It has been found that a projection of at least 2 millimetres has been sufficient although it will be appreciated that other distances may be useful as well. The peripheral wall may include a shoulder <b>196</b> adapted to receive the bottom cap <b>70</b> between the raised portion <b>190</b> and the bottom edge <b>28</b> of the peripheral wall <b>20</b>.</p>
