<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present invention generally relates to a detection unit of a charged particle imaging system. More particularly, a portion of the detection unit can move into or out of the detection system as imaging condition required.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Moore's law describes a long-term trend in the history of computing hardware, in which the number of transistors that can be placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years. The capabilities of many digital electronic devices are strongly linked to Moore's law: processing speed, memory capacity, sensors and even the number and size of pixels in digital cameras. All of these are improving at (roughly) exponential rates as well. Currently, the design node is shrinking to 22 nm or even smaller, however, this making the defect inspection tool, such as an optical system, hard to detect the anomalies present on the wafer. It is due to the resolution of the conventional light sources used is no longer smaller than the dimension of anomalies. For advancing resolution in defect inspection, a more applicable inspection tool, such as an e-beam inspection tool, is introduced to semiconductor manufacturing processes inspection. Further, in VC (voltage contrast) mode inspection, the e-beam inspection tool can even discover under-layer defect, which is almost impossible for nowadays optical inspection systems. Hence, the e-beam inspection tool becomes more important in semiconductor processes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In a regular anomaly hunting process, large field of view and VC mode inspection, a larger beam current (I<sub>b</sub>) such as several hundreds nano-amperes (nA) are applied in the e-beam inspection systems. Once the anomalies are located, on the other hand, to review and analyze the cause of these anomalies requires high resolution of the e-beam inspection system and a smaller beam current such as several tens of pico-amperes (pA) are applied instead.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Up to the present, the only e-beam system can handle both larger currents and small currents inspection is disclosed by Wang et al. in &#x201c;Charged Particle Beam Detection Unit with Multi Type Detection Subunits&#x201d;, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/715,766 filed on Mar. 2, 2010. The previous multi type design is able to handle the large and small beam currents for both high resolution and high speed requirements. However, it sacrifices the side view function for stereo image.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The present invention provides a detection unit and a system that could perform regular a large range of beam current inspection with stereo image; perform defect review that requires high resolution and small beam current and perform defect review and fine defect inspection with stereo image.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The present invention generally relates to a detection unit of a charged particle imaging system. More particularly, portion of the detection unit can move into or out of the detection system as imaging condition required. With the assistance of a Wein filter (also known as an E&#xd7;B charged particle analyzer), the present invention provides an imaging system that suitable for both low current, high resolution mode and high current, high throughput mode. Merely by way of example, the invention has been applied to a scanning electron beam inspection system. But it would be recognized that the invention could apply to other system using charged particle beam as an observation tool.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">One embodiment of the present invention adopts sectional detection unit integrate to collect signal electrons for a charged particle beam imaging system while performing regular large beam current with stereo image.</p>

<p id="p-0010" num="0009">And yet another embodiment of the present invention, a high gain sectional movable detector is selected to perform anomalies review or fine detail inspection and composes a stereo anomaly image.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This invention provides a method for specimen surface imaging by replacing specified detection area to receiving signal charged particles. The method comprises steps of providing a charged particle beam system to irradiate charged particles onto specimen surface; providing a sectional main detector to receiving the signal charged particles emanating from specimen surface, wherein the detector has at least 2 sections for composing stereo image under regular large beam current, low resolution mode; providing a movable high gain detector set to receiving the signal charged particles emanating from specimen surface, wherein the detector has at least 1 sections for composing image under small beam current, high resolution mode; providing a movable sectional high gain detector to receiving the signal charged particles emanating from specimen surface, wherein the detector has at least 2 sections for composing stereo image under small beam current, high resolution mode; providing a Wein filter or an E&#xd7;B charge particle analyzer to direct the signal charged particles emanating from specimen surface to the detection area set by control computer; providing a control computer to calculate the superimposed magnetic field strength and electrostatic field strength of the Wein filter or the E&#xd7;B charge particle analyzer that divert the emanating electrons according to the incident beam energy and preset imaging requirement; and generating images based on the detected signal particles received by the specified detector.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The sectional main detector in this invention can be a solid state detector, an E-T (Everhart-Thornley) detector, and the movable high gain detector can be a solid state detector. The movable high gain detector can be positioned not over, or near the optical axis where the primary beam passes through, positioned when the low beam current, high resolution mode is selected, or positioned below the main sectional detector when the low beam current, high resolution and stereo image mode is selected.</p>

The signal receiving device comprises a first detector on-axis to the primary beam of the inspection tool, and a second detector movable from outside of a column of the inspection tool into inside of the column.

The metal shell is grounded, and the signal receiving device further comprises a Wein filter to direct the signals from the inspection tool to the second detector.</p>
