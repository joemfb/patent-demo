<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority from and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 2008-92517, filed on Sep. 22, 2008, which is hereby incorporated by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to a panel assembly and a display apparatus having the panel assembly. More particularly, the present invention relates to a panel assembly for improving luminance deviation, and a display apparatus having the panel assembly.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Background</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Generally, liquid crystal display (LCD) apparatuses have small thickness, light weight, and low power consumption, and may be used for large televisions as well as monitors, laptop computers, and cellular phone displays. An LCD apparatus includes an LCD panel and a backlight assembly. The LCD panel displays an image using a liquid crystal, which transmits light depending on an applied electric field. The backlight assembly is disposed under the LCD panel and provides light to the LCD panel.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The backlight assembly includes a lamp that generates light, a socket electrically connected to an electrode of the lamp, a receiving container that receives the lamp and the socket, and an inverter electrically connected to the socket and that applies a driving current to the lamp. The inverter is disposed on one side or both sides of a bottom surface of the receiving container.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A hot electrode of the lamp that corresponds to an area in which the inverter is disposed has a tube current of about 10 mA, and a cold electrode of the lamp that corresponds to an area opposite to the area in which the inverter is disposed has a tube current of about 9 mA. Thus, current deviation may be caused by the inverter, and luminance deviation in the LCD may be caused by the current deviation.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention provides a panel assembly to enhance luminance uniformity.</p>

The panel driving apparatus includes a first gate driving circuit that outputs a first gate signal to the gate line, and a second gate driving circuit disposed in an area that corresponds to an inverter and that outputs a second gate signal to the gate line, the second gate signal being different from the first gate signal.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The present invention also discloses a panel assembly that includes a display panel and a panel driving apparatus. The display panel includes a data line and a gate line extended in a direction that crosses the data line. The panel driving apparatus includes a first gate driving circuit that outputs a first gate signal having a first high level to the gate line, and a second gate driving circuit disposed in an area that corresponds to an inverter and that outputs a second gate signal of a second high level to the gate line, the second high level of the second gate signal being lower than the first high level of the first gate signal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The present invention also discloses a display apparatus that includes a backlight assembly and a panel assembly. The backlight assembly includes a receiving container that receives a light source, and an inverter disposed on the rear surface of the receiving container and that provides driving power to the light source. The panel assembly includes a display panel having a data line and a gate line extended in a direction that crosses the data line, a first gate driving circuit that outputs a first gate signal to the gate line, and a second gate driving circuit disposed in an area that corresponds to the inverter and that outputs a second gate signal to the gate line, the second gate signal being different from the first gate signal.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The present invention is described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the present invention are shown. The present invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein. Rather, these exemplary embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the present invention to those skilled in the art. In the drawings, the sizes and relative sizes of layers and regions may be exaggerated for clarity.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">It will be understood that when an element or layer is referred to as being &#x201c;on,&#x201d; &#x201c;connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, it can be directly on, connected or coupled to the other element or layer or intervening elements or layers may be present. In contrast, when an element is referred to as being &#x201c;directly on,&#x201d; &#x201c;directly connected to&#x201d; or &#x201c;directly coupled to&#x201d; another element or layer, there are no intervening elements or layers present. Like numerals refer to like elements throughout. As used herein, the term &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; includes any and all combinations of one or more of the associated listed items.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">It will be understood that, although the terms first, second, third, etc. may be used herein to describe various elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections, these elements, components, regions, layers and/or sections should not be limited by these terms. These terms are only used to distinguish one element, component, region, layer or section from another region, layer or section. Thus, a first element, component, region, layer or section discussed below could be termed a second element, component, region, layer or section without departing from the teachings of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Spatially relative terms, such as &#x201c;beneath,&#x201d; &#x201c;below,&#x201d; &#x201c;lower,&#x201d; &#x201c;above,&#x201d; &#x201c;upper&#x201d; and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. It will be understood that the spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. For example, if the device in the figures is turned over, elements described as &#x201c;below&#x201d; or &#x201c;beneath&#x201d; other elements or features would then be oriented &#x201c;above&#x201d; the other elements or features. Thus, the exemplary term &#x201c;below&#x201d; can encompass both an orientation of above and below. The device may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein interpreted accordingly.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular exemplary embodiments only and is not intended to be limiting of the present invention. As used herein, the singular forms &#x201c;a,&#x201d; &#x201c;an&#x201d; and &#x201c;the&#x201d; are intended to include the plural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise. It will be further understood that the terms &#x201c;comprises&#x201d; and/or &#x201c;comprising,&#x201d; when used in this specification, specify the presence of stated features, integers, steps, operations, elements, and/or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or more other features, integers, steps, operations, elements, components, and/or groups thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Exemplary embodiments of the invention are described herein with reference to cross-sectional illustrations that are schematic illustrations of idealized exemplary embodiments (and intermediate structures) of the present invention. As such, variations from the shapes of the illustrations as a result, for example, of manufacturing techniques and/or tolerances, are to be expected. Thus, exemplary embodiments of the present invention should not be construed as limited to the particular shapes of regions illustrated herein but are to include deviations in shapes that result, for example, from manufacturing.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">Unless otherwise defined, all terms (including technical and scientific terms) used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. It will be further understood that terms, such as those defined in commonly used dictionaries, should be interpreted as having a meaning that is consistent with their meaning in the context of the relevant art and will not be interpreted in an idealized or overly formal sense unless expressly so defined herein.</p>
