<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure generally relates to a sealant applying apparatus for a liquid crystal display (LCD) substrate, and more particularly, to a sealant applying apparatus for an LCD substrate which features a high applying efficiency; and the present disclosure further relates to a sealant applying method for an LCD substrate that uses the aforesaid sealant applying apparatus for an LCD substrate.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Nowadays, thin film transistor (TFT) LCDs (TFT-LCDs) have become a kind of important displaying platforms in modern IT products and video products. A TFT-LCD generally comprises an array substrate and a color filter (CF) substrate disposed opposite to each other as well as a liquid crystal material sandwiched between the array substrate and the CF substrate. The TFT-LCD operates mainly in the following principles: liquid crystal molecules can twist under the action of a voltage applied across the liquid crystal material between the array substrate and the CF substrate, and different light transmissivity values can be obtained by applying different voltage levels, thus achieving the purpose of displaying.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Currently, the array substrate and the CF substrate are usually assembled together through adhesion by means of a sealant, and electric signals from the CF substrate are connected to circuits on the array substrate primarily via Au balls having a radius on the order of micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In the manufacturing process of an LCD panel, usually a mother substrate of a large size is sliced into a plurality of substrates. In this process, the array substrate and the CF substrate need to be assembled together through use of the sealant. Currently, a primary sealant, a secondary sealant and a conductive medium have to be applied to the array substrate and the CF substrate. The primary sealant, which is disposed outside the displaying region, is mainly used to assemble the array substrate and the CF substrate together. The secondary sealant is mainly used to protect the array substrate and the CF substrate when they are assembled together, and will be removed when the mother substrate is sliced into substrates. The conductive medium is applied on a route of a primary frame and is usually applied during or after the process of applying the primary sealant and the secondary sealant.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Currently, there are mainly two kinds of approaches of applying the sealants and the conductive medium. The first kind of approach is to firstly apply the primary sealant and the secondary sealant and finally the conductive medium is applied; and the second kind of approach is to mix the primary sealant with the conductive medium, then apply the primary sealant and the conductive medium in a single step, and finally the secondary sealant is applied.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">However, the two kinds of approaches described above have the following main problems: firstly, both the first kind of approach and the second kind of approach require at least two applying steps, which consume a long time; and secondly, the second kind of approach which mixes all the conductive medium into the primary sealant consumes a significantly increased amount of the conductive medium, so the material cost is increased, and meanwhile, because the conductive medium is also applied unnecessarily to sites of signal lines, the probability of defective products is increased and quality of the products is degraded.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">To overcome the problems with the prior art that the sealant applying processes for LCD substrates consume a long time and lead to a high material cost, the present disclosure provides a sealant applying apparatus for an LCD substrate and a sealant applying method for an LCD substrate, which allow for uniform application of a sealant, saving of the process time and saving of the material cost.</p>

<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, the conductive medium spraying nozzle moves to predetermined sites in the first predetermined route to apply a conductive medium to the LCD substrate, and is closed after the application of the conductive medium at the predetermined sites is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">According to a preferred embodiment of the present disclosure, the apparatus further comprises an adjusting shaft for adjusting a distance between the first sealant spraying nozzle and the second sealant spraying nozzle.</p>

The sealant applying apparatus <b>1</b> is adapted to apply sealants to an LCD substrate. The LCD substrate is used to fabricate an LCD panel or to be sliced into two or more LCD panels. The sealant applying apparatus <b>1</b> for an LCD substrate comprises a first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b>, a second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> and a conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">The first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> is fixedly spaced apart from the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b>. During the process that the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> move together along a first predetermined route, the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> is opened when it moves to predetermined sites in the first predetermined route to apply a conductive medium <b>18</b> to the LCD substrate, and is closed after the application of the conductive medium <b>18</b> at the predetermined sites is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> is fixedly spaced apart from the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b>. When the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> is applying a first sealant to an adhesion area on the LCD substrate outside a displaying region of the LCD panel, the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> moves along a second predetermined route to apply a second sealant to a slicing area outside the displaying region of the LCD panel.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">A connecting line between the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> is perpendicular to a connecting line between the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b>, which arrangement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. The connecting line between the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> may also be oblique with respect to the connecting line between the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b>, which arrangement is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a schematic front view illustrating the latter way in which the spraying nozzles are arranged in the sealant applying apparatus for an LCD substrate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a distance between the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and a sealant outlet (see below) of a sealant container is equal to that between the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> and the sealant outlet of the sealant container.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The sealant applying apparatus for an LCD substrate <b>1</b> further comprises an adjusting shaft <b>13</b>, a sealant container <b>14</b>, a first sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>100</b>, a second sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>110</b>, a conductive medium spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>120</b>, a conductive medium container <b>15</b> and an alignment mark identifying unit <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The adjusting shaft <b>13</b> is connected with the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> respectively, and is mainly used to adjust a distance between the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> to satisfy requirements of different product manufacturing processes. As an example, the adjusting shaft <b>13</b> may be an telescopic long shaft, in which case the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> are disposed at two ends of the adjusting shaft <b>13</b> respectively. When the distance between the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> needs to be adjusted, the length of the adjusting shaft <b>13</b> can be adjusted by retracting or extending the adjusting shaft <b>13</b>. As another example, the adjusting shaft <b>13</b> may comprise a sliding chute and fixing blocks. The first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> can slide in the sliding chute and positions of the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> are adapted to be fixed in the sliding chute by means of the fixing blocks.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The sealant container <b>14</b> is mainly used to contain and supply a sealant <b>17</b> to the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b>. The sealant container <b>14</b> comprises a sealant outlet (not labeled). The sealant outlet is connected with both the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b>, and is located at a middle position between and having equal distances from the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b>. That is to say, when the sealant <b>17</b> is contained in the sealant container <b>14</b>, a pressure at the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> is equal to that at the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b>. The sealant <b>17</b> forms a primary sealant and a secondary sealant after being applied. The primary sealant is disposed outside the displaying region of the LCD panel, and the secondary sealant is disposed at a periphery of the primary sealant.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The first sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>100</b> is disposed between a spraying outlet of the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the sealant outlet of the sealant container <b>14</b>, and is mainly used to control communication and disconnection between the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the sealant container <b>14</b>. For example, when the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> needs to apply the sealant <b>17</b>, the first sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>100</b> may be controlled to be opened; and when the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> needs not to apply the sealant <b>17</b>, the first sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>100</b> may be controlled to be closed. Similarly, the second sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>110</b> is disposed between a spraying outlet of the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> and the sealant outlet of the sealant container <b>14</b>, and is mainly used to control communication and disconnection between the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> and the sealant container <b>14</b>. For example, when the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> needs to apply the sealant <b>17</b>, the second sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>110</b> may be controlled to be opened; and when the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> needs not to apply the sealant <b>17</b>, the second sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>110</b> may be controlled to be closed. The first sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>100</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>110</b> may be mechanical pilot valves or electronic switch pilot valves.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The conductive medium container <b>15</b>, whose main function is similar to that of the sealant container <b>14</b>, is mainly used to contain and supply the conductive medium <b>18</b> to the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b>. The conductive medium container <b>15</b> comprises an outlet (not labeled) communicating with the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b>. The conductive medium <b>18</b> contained in the conductive medium container <b>15</b> comprises a plurality of Au balls having a radius on the order of micrometers.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">The conductive medium spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>120</b> is disposed between a spraying outlet of the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> and the outlet of the conductive medium container <b>15</b>, and is mainly used to control communication and disconnection between the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> and the conductive medium container <b>15</b>. For example, when the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> needs to apply the conductive medium <b>18</b>, the conductive medium spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>120</b> may be controlled to be opened; and when the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> needs not to apply the conductive medium <b>18</b>, the conductive medium spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>120</b> may be controlled to be closed.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The alignment mark identifying unit <b>16</b> is mainly used to identify alignment marks on the LCD substrate. In order to be aligned accurately when being assembled together or sliced, the LCD substrate is usually formed with the alignment marks. For example, four cross-shaped alignment marks are disposed at four corners of the LCD substrate respectively. The alignment mark identifying unit <b>16</b> may be a charge coupled device (CCD) camera connected with a control device (not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, a schematic view illustrating steps of a preferred embodiment of a sealant applying method for an LCD substrate according to the present disclosure is shown therein. The sealant applying method for an LCD substrate uses the sealant applying apparatus for an LCD substrate <b>1</b> according to the embodiment of the present disclosure to apply sealants to an LCD substrate, and comprises the following steps: moving a first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b>, a second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> and a conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> together, opening or closing the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>12</b> together, moving the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> along a first predetermined route to apply a first sealant to the LCD substrate, and when moving the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> to predetermined sites in the first predetermined route during the process of moving the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> along the first predetermined route, opening the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> to apply a conductive medium <b>18</b> to the LCD substrate and closing the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> after the application of the conductive medium <b>18</b> at the predetermined sites is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The step of moving the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> along the first predetermined route to apply the first sealant to the LCD substrate comprises the following steps: moving the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> along the first predetermined route to apply the first sealant to an area on the LCD substrate outside a displaying region of an LCD panel, and moving the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> along a second predetermined route to apply a second sealant to the area outside the displaying region of the LCD panel. Depending on different process requirements, the step of moving the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> along the second predetermined route to apply the second sealant to the area outside the displaying region of the LCD panel may be carried out at the same time as, before or after the step of moving the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> to apply the first sealant, and may also carried out in only a part of the time when the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> applies the first sealant.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Of course, the method further comprises the following step before the steps of moving the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> along the first predetermined route to apply the first sealant to the LCD substrate and moving the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> along the second predetermined route to apply the first sealant to the LCD panel: identifying the alignment marks of the LCD panel in the LCD substrate; and moving the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> to first predetermined positions (also serving as predetermined sites for applying the conductive medium <b>18</b>, see below) and moving the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> to second predetermined positions (also serving as the predetermined sites for applying the conductive medium <b>18</b>, see below) according to the alignment marks.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a schematic view illustrating how sealants are applied to an LCD substrate according to the sealant applying method for an LCD substrate of the present disclosure is shown therein. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> together, how the sealant applying method for an LCD substrate uses the sealant applying apparatus for an LCD substrate <b>1</b> of the embodiment of the present disclosure to apply a sealant <b>17</b> to an LCD substrate will be described with reference to an example hereinafter. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a top left corner of an LCD substrate <b>2</b> is formed with an alignment mark <b>20</b> which can be identified by the alignment mark identifying unit <b>16</b> so as to identify a starting point for applying the sealant <b>17</b>. The first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> moves along the first predetermined route to apply the sealant <b>17</b> to form a primary sealant <b>21</b> (i.e., the first sealant) located on an inner side, and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> moves along the second predetermined route to apply the sealant <b>17</b> to form a secondary sealant <b>22</b> (i.e., the second sealant). Here, it is assumed that the applying order is A&#x2192;B&#x2192;C&#x2192;D&#x2192;A as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Firstly, after the alignment mark identifying unit <b>16</b> has identified the position of the align mark <b>20</b>, the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> are moved to the point A to get ready for applying the sealant <b>17</b>. In the initial state, the first sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>100</b>, the second sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>110</b> and the conductive medium spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>120</b> are all closed. During the process of moving from the point A to a point B, the first sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>100</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>110</b> are both opened so that the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> applies the primary sealant <b>21</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> applies the secondary sealant <b>22</b>. When the first sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>100</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>110</b> has moved to a position A&#x2032;B&#x2032; located between the point A and the point B, the conductive medium spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>120</b> is opened, and the conductive medium drips to and is applied to the point A under the action of an appropriate pressure applied. Then, the conductive medium spraying nozzle pilot valve <b>120</b> is closed after the application of the conductive medium <b>18</b> at the point A is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">A plurality of other predetermined sites are also disposed in the first predetermined route in addition to the point A. Similarly, after the application from the point A to the point B is completed, the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b> and the second sealant spraying nozzle <b>11</b> keep moving and the conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> moves along with the first sealant spraying nozzle <b>10</b>. The conductive medium spraying nozzle <b>12</b> applies the conductive medium <b>18</b> to the LCD substrate <b>2</b> when moving to the plurality of other predetermined sites respectively (e.g., the point B, a point C and sites between the point B and the point C), and is closed after the application of the conductive medium <b>18</b> at the predetermined sites is completed.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As compared to the prior art, the sealant applying apparatus for an LCD substrate and the sealant applying method for an LCD substrate of the present disclosure apply the primary sealant and the secondary sealant in a single applying step. Moreover, in the process of applying the primary sealant, the conductive medium spraying nozzle is opened to apply the conductive medium to the LCD substrate only when the conductive medium spraying nozzle is moved to the predetermined sites that need to be applied, and is closed after application of the conductive medium at the predetermined sites is completed. That is to say, the application of the primary sealant, the secondary sealant and the conductive medium are completed in one applying cycle, which avoids the problem of consuming much time when the aforesaid application is completed in a plurality of applying cycles and improves the applying efficiency obviously. Furthermore, as the conductive medium and the sealants are contained in separate containers, the conductive medium is applied only to the sites where the conductive medium is needed so that the amount of the conductive medium consumed can be controlled accurately, and this decreases the material cost obviously. When used in the large-size LCD panels such as the 47-inch LCD panel produced on the eighth generation (8G) LCD panel production line, the sealant applying apparatus for an LCD substrate and the sealant applying method for an LCD substrate of the present disclosure have particularly prominent advantages, and can save the labor time and the material significantly.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Accordingly, the sealant applying apparatus for an LCD substrate and the sealant applying method for an LCD substrate of the present disclosure have the advantages of saving both the process time and the material cost.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the structure of the present disclosure without departing from the scope or spirit of the disclosure. In view of the foregoing, it is intended that the present disclosure cover modifications and variations of this disclosure provided they fall within the scope of the following claims and their equivalents.</p>
