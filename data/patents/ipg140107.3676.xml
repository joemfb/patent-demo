<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">The present disclosure relates generally to systems and methods for providing instruction and training for medical devices. More particularly, the disclosure provides instruction and training around alarm behavior in medical devices having alarm management systems.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This section is intended to introduce the reader to various aspects of art that may be related to various aspects of the present disclosure, which are described and/or claimed below. This discussion is believed to be helpful in providing the reader with background information to facilitate a better understanding of the various aspects of the present disclosure. Accordingly, it should be understood that these statements are to be read in this light, and not as admissions of prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the field of healthcare, caregivers (e.g., doctors and other healthcare professionals) often desire to monitor certain physiological characteristics of their patients. Accordingly, a wide variety of monitoring devices have been developed for monitoring many such physiological characteristics. These monitoring devices often provide doctors and other healthcare personnel with information that facilitates provision of the best possible healthcare for their patients. As a result, such monitoring devices have become a perennial feature of modern medicine.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">One technique for monitoring physiological characteristics of a patient is commonly referred to as pulse oximetry, and the devices built based upon pulse oximetry techniques are commonly referred to as pulse oximeters. Pulse oximeters may be used to measure and monitor various blood flow characteristics of a patient. For example, a pulse oximeter may be utilized to monitor the blood oxygen saturation of hemoglobin in arterial blood, the volume of individual blood pulsations supplying the tissue, and/or the rate of blood pulsations corresponding to each heartbeat of a patient. In fact, the &#x201c;pulse&#x201d; in pulse oximetry refers to the time-varying amount of arterial blood in the tissue during each cardiac cycle.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Pulse oximetry monitors have become increasingly complex, providing a variety of settings that are configurable by the end user. For example, the settings that trigger an alarm indication may be selected based on the patient's clinical condition. In particular, the alarm settings used for a relatively healthy and active patient may have a higher threshold for certain types of alarms, while a patient in a critical care setting may have alarm settings that include lower thresholds. Configuring a monitor with improper threshold settings may cause an alarm to be too sensitive and result in nuisance alarms.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SPECIFIC EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">One or more specific embodiments of the present techniques will be described below. In an effort to provide a concise description of these embodiments, not all features of an actual implementation are described in the specification. It should be appreciated that in the development of any such actual implementation, as in any engineering or design project, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-related and business-related constraints, which may vary from one implementation to another. Moreover, it should be appreciated that such a development effort might be complex and time consuming, but would nevertheless be a routine undertaking of design, fabrication, and manufacture for those of ordinary skill having the benefit of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Provided herein are systems and methods for simulating alarm conditions in a medical monitor. These systems for generating simulated alarm conditions may be used in conjunction with an interactive training tool for end users of the medical monitor. As medical devices become increasingly sophisticated and customizable, it is desirable to have a variety of methods of training and instruction for the healthcare professionals who will take advantage of the customizations. In particular, interactive alarm simulators allow caregivers to change alarm settings and experience the relative changes in alarm sensitivity between various alarm settings for a particular patient. The alarm simulators and training tools as provided may also allow caregivers to experience the effect of alarm settings on different types of patients, e.g., patients with a particular clinical profile. Further, caregivers may use the training tool to become more familiar with the alarm settings and alarm acknowledgement tools of the monitor. As provided, the alarm simulators and alarm configuration training tools may be used in lieu of or in conjunction with passive instruction techniques, such video demonstrations, textual based instruction, and demonstration modes on the medical monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Medical device alarms may exhibit a wide range of behaviors based upon physiological conditions as well as settings input by the healthcare professionals and students configuring the machines. For example, a pulse oximetry monitor such as those available from Nellcor Puritan Bennet LLC, may incorporate a SatSeconds&#x2122; alarm management system. Generally speaking, SatSeconds&#x2122; alarm management operates by integrating an area between an alarm threshold and a patient's measured physiological parameters over time. For example, rather than sounding an alarm as soon as the patient's measured SpO<sub>2 </sub>drops below a threshold value, the SatSeconds&#x2122; system measures an area by integrating the difference between a threshold SpO<sub>2 </sub>and the patient's SpO<sub>2 </sub>level when the patient's SpO<sub>2 </sub>level is below the threshold. When the SatSeconds&#x2122; value exceeds a threshold value (e.g., a preset threshold or a user-input threshold), the caregiver may be alerted that the patient's oxygen saturation is too low. A healthcare professional may determine the appropriate SpO<sub>2 </sub>threshold limits as well as the appropriate SatSeconds&#x2122; threshold limits, in a SatSeconds&#x2122; alarm management system. Setting improper SatSeconds&#x2122; thresholds may cause the alarm system to be too sensitive, which may increase an incidence of nuisance alarms.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Additionally, a pulse oximetry monitor or other medical device as provided herein may incorporate saturation pattern detection (SPD). Generally speaking, saturation pattern detection is based on an SPD index (SPDi) created by analyzing SpO<sub>2 </sub>values from the monitor. When the SPDi crosses a threshold, an alarm is triggered. SPD alarms may include a tolerance level input that allows a healthcare professional to select a level of tolerance or sensitivity. For example, in some embodiments, a SPD threshold may be set at 1, 2, or 3 representing a high, medium, and low threshold, respectively. The SPD threshold settings may affect a monitor in multiple ways, e.g., the threshold may determine how certain alarms on the medical device will respond. For example, SPD may be represented by a hollow triangular symbol on the display of a medical device. As the events associated with the alarm, the SPDi values, begin to near the set SPD threshold, the triangular shape may start to fill, to indicate that an SPD threshold is nearing. Additionally, as the threshold is met, an SPD alarm may be triggered. Varying the SPD threshold may provide a wide range of alarm behaviors. As provided herein, the systems and devices may simulate the effects of various SPD settings to facilitate selecting the proper SPD threshold for a particular patient.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">In certain embodiments, the systems and devices provided herein may be employed to instruct healthcare professionals and students regarding the settings of alarm management systems, such as the SatSeconds&#x2122; and SPD alarm management systems. The present techniques may include providing a simulator system for a medical device that will simulate alarm behaviors based upon medical device configuration settings, simulated external stimuli, and/or simulated physiological data provided to the simulator system. Additionally, the simulator system may have a user assessment module that tests the user's ability to i) correctly configure the machines, ii) provide diagnosis based on the machine outputs, and/or iii) provide intervention suggestions based upon the diagnosis.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">With the foregoing in mind, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is an illustration of a simulator system <b>10</b>, which may include a personal desktop computer, laptop computer, handheld device, etc. The simulator system <b>10</b> includes a display <b>12</b> and user inputs <b>14</b>, which may include a mouse, track pad, keyboard, touch screen, etc. The simulator system <b>10</b> may provide a simulator user <b>16</b>, such as a teacher, student, doctor, nurse, or medical technician, with graphical outputs <b>20</b>. As will be discussed in more detail below, the graphical outputs <b>20</b> may include various graphical user interfaces representative of the medical device that is being simulated. In certain embodiments system <b>10</b> may be part of a pulse oximetry monitor or other medical device. In such embodiments, the system <b>10</b> may be accessible via a training menu or demo setting of the pulse oximetry monitor or other medical device and may provide default alarm settings illustrating how the alarms are affected by sensor reading inputs for the particular pulse oximetry monitor or other medical device.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the simulator system <b>10</b> may include, among other things, a display <b>12</b>, user inputs <b>14</b>, one or more processors <b>40</b>, memory <b>42</b>, non-volatile storage <b>44</b>, an audible alarm system <b>46</b>, a simulator module <b>48</b>, and a user assessment module <b>50</b>. The various functional blocks shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> may include hardware elements (including circuitry), software elements (including computer code stored on a computer-readable medium) or a combination of both hardware and software elements. Further, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is only one example of a particular implementation and is merely intended to illustrate the types of components that may be present in the simulator system. Based at least in part upon the plethysmographic waveform data (e.g., stored data), the processor <b>40</b> may calculate the oxygen saturation and/or heart rate using various algorithms, such as those employed by the Nellcor&#x2122; N-600x&#x2122; pulse oximetry monitor. These algorithms may employ certain coefficients, which may be stored in the memory <b>42</b> or other suitable computer-readable storage medium and accessed and operated according to processor <b>40</b> instructions.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">In one implementation, the simulator module <b>48</b> and the user assessment module <b>50</b> in accordance with the present discussion may be developed and implemented using open source tools. Such a system may be developed as a web-based application, allowing distributed access or use of the application. For example, such an implementation may be developed using one or more of Java, Java server pages (JSP), structured query language (SQL), extensible markup language (XML), XML user interface language (XUL) and/or scalable vector graphics (SVG) technologies. In an alternate implementation, the simulator module may include instructions that may be executed by the processor <b>40</b>, and stored on a non-volatile storage media <b>44</b>, such as a CD-ROM or hard drive. In some instances, the non-volatile storage media <b>44</b> may be distributed in a bundle with a medical device the simulator system <b>10</b> simulates. The simulator module <b>48</b> is responsible for receiving inputs and deriving outputs representative of the medical device being simulated.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Further, the stored plethysmographic waveform data may comprise various forms including: a formatted text file, exported data from a medical device, a data file from a trend data creation utility, etc. The stored plethysmographic waveform data may be stored on the non-volatile storage media <b>44</b>, or may be downloaded from an outside source through a network connection. In some embodiments, the simulator system <b>10</b> may intake the stored plethysmographic waveform data through an import screen, requesting the location of a simulated trend data file. In alternative embodiments, the simulator system <b>10</b> may select a data file from a plurality of stored data files based upon a user selection of physiological conditions, e.g. conditions listed in the import screen of the simulator system. For example, the simulator user <b>16</b> may desire to simulate the conditions of pulmonary edema to understand alarm behaviors for a patient with that condition. The user may select pulmonary edema from the list of physiological conditions, and the simulator system will import a simulated data file corresponding to that condition. In addition, a user may associate a physiological condition (e.g. pulmonary edema) with a particular set of stored plethysmographic waveform view. That is, the stored data may be associated with a patient diagnosis or with a particular clinical condition.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">As an alternative to accessing stored plethysmographic waveform data, the plethysmographic waveform data may be at least in part user-created. The simulator system <b>10</b> may include a data creation module that allows a user to plot or draw simulation data. For example, the data creation module may provide a blank trend view window, which may allow a user to input plot or draw points representing points of representative physiological measurements. For example, a user might plot multiple SpO<sub>2 </sub>measurements along a multitude of time positions. Upon entry of all of the measurement points, the data creation module may create a trend line, linking each of the plot points together. Alternatively, the data creation module may simply allow a user to draw a trend line, in the trend view window, without plotting individual measurements. This feature may allow a user to experience alarm settings for a simulated data set that may be relatively exaggerated for training purposes. For example, a user-created data plot may include oxygen saturation values that may be physiologically unlikely for an actual patient but that may be useful for showing the effects of certain alarm limits in extreme cases. In one embodiment, the user may save the simulated views.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">An example of a simulation method <b>70</b> is illustrated in the flowchart depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The method <b>70</b> may be performed as an automated procedure by a system, such as a system <b>10</b> that includes display <b>12</b> and user inputs <b>14</b>. In addition, certain steps of the method may be performed by a processor <b>40</b>, or a processor-based device that may be part of the system <b>10</b> that includes instructions for implementing certain steps of the method <b>70</b>. The simulation method <b>70</b> begins at block <b>72</b> when the simulator module <b>48</b> receives a user input related to an alarm setting. As will be discussed in more detail below, the alarm setting inputs may generally be obtained through an alarm settings configuration menu that is representative of an alarm settings configuration menu of the medical device in question.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">At block <b>74</b>, the simulator module <b>48</b> accesses stored plethysmographic waveform data representative of data obtained from the medical device over a period of time. For example, the stored plethysmographic waveform data may be representative of data acquired by a pulse oximetry sensor over a period of time that may be used to determine physiological parameters such as SpO<sub>2 </sub>levels. Furthermore, the stored plethysmographic waveform data may be of the type used to determine pulse rate, respiration rate based on central drive, SPD index, expired CO<sub>2</sub>, respiration rate based on airflow, and/or photopleth. In particular embodiments, the stored plethysmographic waveform data may be historical data acquired from one or more patients. In addition, the stored plethysmographic waveform data may be raw data, e.g. representative of data provided by a detector of a pulse oximetry sensor, or may be processed data that has undergone conditioning that may improve the signal to noise ratio. Alternatively, the stored plethysmographic waveform data may be in the form of calculated oxygen saturation or any suitable physiological parameter over time. In addition, the data may be synthetic data that has been specifically generated and tailored to the simulator module <b>48</b>. The stored plethysmographic waveform data may include both simulated real-time sensor readings as well as instructions interpretable by the simulator module <b>48</b> as to how alarm settings should be applied to the stored plethysmographic waveform data. Alternatively, the stored plethysmographic waveform data may include pre-calculated alarm indicator values, e.g., an SPD index or integrated SatSeconds&#x2122; value for specific threshold values.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In block <b>76</b>, the simulator module <b>48</b> applies the alarm setting inputs received in block <b>72</b> to the stored plethysmographic waveform data accessed in step <b>74</b>. To apply the alarm settings, the stored plethysmographic waveform data may provide instructions to the simulator module <b>48</b> for application of the alarm setting inputs to the data as appropriate. For example, the system <b>10</b> may execute instructions to calculate alarm trigger points based upon the alarm setting input and the plethysmographic waveform data. For example, the alarm settings may be triggered based on the SatSeconds&#x2122; alarm management system as provided in U.S. Pat. No. 5,865,736; U.S. Pat. No. 6,754,516; and U.S. Pat. No. 7,123,950 or the SPD alarm management system as provided in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2010/0113909 to Batchelder et al., the specifications of both of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety herein for all purposes. In particular, the system <b>10</b> may calculate a physiological parameter from the data and determine if the calculated physiological parameter exceeds certain thresholds associated with alarm events. Applying the alarm settings may involve applying the thresholds and/or triggers to the calculated physiological parameters, which may represent a given time period.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">After the simulator system applies the alarm setting inputs to the stored plethysmographic waveform data, the simulator system displays an output representative of a display of the medical device based on the plethysmographic waveform data with the alarm settings applied, in block <b>78</b>. In certain embodiments, displaying the stored plethysmographic waveform data may include providing a trend view of the stored plethysmographic waveform data over time and providing alarm indicators at points in time when an alarm would trigger in the simulated medical device configured with the alarm setting inputs. In addition, in block <b>80</b>, a simulated alarm output, representative of an actual alarm output of the medical device being simulated, may be provided to the simulator user, based upon the alarm settings and the stored plethysmographic waveform data. The alarm output may include visual alarms and/or audible alarms representative of alarms displayed on the medical device being simulated.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In particular, the system <b>10</b> may facilitate understanding of the effect of various alarm settings on a medical device. To that end, the system <b>10</b> may provide one or more user input screens that are representative of the alarm configuration menus for the device in question. The user may manipulate one or more alarm settings and experience the differences between the settings as they are applied to the patient data. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-6</figref> illustrate examples of alarm settings configuration menus <b>100</b> for a pulse oximetry monitor. The alarm settings configuration menu <b>100</b> provides one example of how alarm input settings may be obtained from the simulator user <b>16</b>. In the illustrated embodiments, the pulse oximetry monitor includes settings for upper SpO<sub>2 </sub>percentage limits <b>102</b> and lower SpO<sub>2 </sub>percentage limits <b>104</b>, a threshold value selector for oxygen saturation related alarms <b>106</b> (e.g., a SatSeconds&#x2122; alarm), a sensitivity value selector for SPD alarms <b>110</b>, as well as upper <b>112</b>, lower <b>114</b>, and delay <b>116</b> thresholds for a heart rate alarm. The selection indicator box <b>120</b> illustrates the setting that may be changed. To change a setting, the simulator user <b>16</b> uses the toggle arrows <b>122</b> to navigate the selection indicator box <b>120</b> to the desired setting to be changed and then choosing the select option <b>124</b>. It is envisioned that, in one embodiment, the user input is representative of the user input during operation of the device in question. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the selection indicator box <b>120</b> surrounds the lower SpO<sub>2 </sub>percentage limit <b>104</b>. After choosing the select option <b>124</b>, the simulator user <b>16</b> may adjust the lower SpO<sub>2 </sub>percentage limit <b>104</b> by selecting the toggle arrows <b>122</b>. Adjusting the upper <b>102</b> and lower <b>104</b> thresholds provides the upper and lower bounds that determine where the SatSeconds&#x2122; alarm should begin integrating an alarm threshold. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the upper threshold <b>102</b> is at 100% and the lower threshold <b>104</b> is at 80%. Any time the sensor readings from the stored plethysmographic waveform rises above the upper threshold (e.g., 100%) or drops below the lower threshold (e.g., 80%), the simulator module <b>48</b> begins to integrate a SatSeconds&#x2122; value progressing towards the SatSeconds&#x2122; threshold.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the simulator user <b>16</b> may navigate the selection indicator box <b>120</b> to select an SPD sensitivity setting <b>110</b>. The SPD sensitivity setting <b>110</b> may include an integer setting, providing various threshold levels for the SPD alarm. For example, the SPD alarm may include four sensitivity or tolerance settings: Off, Low, Medium, and High represented by 0-3, respectively. In high sensitivity mode, the SPD threshold may be reduced, creating an increased potential for an SPD index to breach the SPD threshold, and thus trigger an SPD alarm. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, the simulator user <b>16</b> may increase the SPD sensitivity setting <b>110</b> to 3, thus increasing the sensitivity of the SPD alarm and causing the SPD alarm to become more sensitive.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the simulator user <b>16</b> may adjust the threshold value selector for the oxygen saturation detection alarm <b>106</b>. A decrease in the selected threshold value selector for the oxygen saturation detection alarm <b>106</b> may result in a more sensitive oxygen saturation detection alarm. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the oxygen saturation detection alarm is a SatSeconds&#x2122;. The SatSeconds&#x2122; threshold value has been reduced to 25, thus providing a lower threshold to trigger a SatSeconds&#x2122; alarm. As discussed below, a simulator module may generate a SatSeconds&#x2122; alarm from the stored plethysmographic waveform data based upon simulator instructions. For example, when the stored plethysmographic waveform data generates a SatSeconds&#x2122; value breaches the 25 threshold value, the simulator module <b>48</b> may trigger an alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Based upon the inputs received from the alarm settings configuration menu <b>100</b>, and the stored plethysmographic waveform data, the simulator system <b>10</b> may provide a monitor output <b>180</b> representative of an output of the medical device being simulated. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref> show a simulated monitor output <b>180</b> of a medical monitor with different alarm settings applied to the data. As noted, the stored data may be processed to calculate various physiological parameters, which in turn may be associated with particular alarm limits, e.g., oxygen saturation limits. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates a display output associated with alarm limits selected in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. The upper <b>102</b> and lower <b>104</b> percentage SpO<sub>2 </sub>limits as well as upper <b>112</b> and lower <b>114</b> BPM limits are displayed as upper SpO<sub>2 </sub>limit <b>182</b>, lower SpO<sub>2 </sub>limit <b>184</b>, upper BPM limit <b>186</b>, and lower BPM limit <b>188</b> in the simulated monitor output <b>180</b>. Additionally, the simulated monitor output <b>180</b> may provide an indication <b>190</b> of the current state of the oxygen saturation alarm and an indication <b>192</b> of the current state of the SPD alarm.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As previously discussed, the SPD settings can be adjusted to cause the SPD alarm to be more sensitive. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> shows a simulated output screen in which the SPD alarm indicator <b>192</b> is close to being triggered, based upon this increased alarm sensitivity. Here, the SPD threshold setting <b>110</b> is set to three, thus causing the sensitivity of the SPD alarm to increase The indicator <b>192</b>, in the shape of a triangle, represents an indication of how close an alarm is to triggering. When the triangle is full, the alarm is triggered. The simulator module <b>48</b>, through applying the SPD alarm setting to the stored plethysmographic waveform data, can simulate the display a user would observe based on the selected alarm settings to determine if the thresholds are appropriate. For example, if, upon observing the display, the simulator user <b>16</b> determines that the setting is too sensitive, the user <b>16</b> may adjust the SPD settings to a lower value, e.g., 2 or 1, and re-run the simulation.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> illustrates a simulated monitor output <b>180</b> in accordance with the settings of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>. Here, the SatSeconds&#x2122; setting <b>106</b> has been set to 25, which is a relatively sensitive setting. Increasing the sensitivity of the alarm, may cause the simulator module <b>48</b> to trigger the alarm more frequently when applied to the plethysmographic waveform data. Because the setting decreases the threshold for the oxygen saturation limit alarm, the alarm indicator <b>190</b>, here a SatSeconds&#x2122; indicator represented by a circle, is filled more rapidly by the simulator module <b>48</b>. Once the simulator module <b>48</b> determines that the alarm threshold is breached, the simulator module <b>48</b> completely fills the alarm indicator <b>190</b> and sounds an alarm representative of an alarm of the medical device being simulated.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">As previously discussed, the simulator module <b>48</b> may access the stored plethysmographic waveform data from the non-volatile storage <b>44</b> or from a remote data network. The simulator module <b>48</b> then applies the alarm setting inputs, such as those received from the alarm setting configuration menu <b>100</b>, to the stored plethysmographic waveform data based on instructions supplied from the simulator module <b>48</b> or from the stored plethysmographic waveform data. After applying the alarm setting inputs to the stored plethysmographic waveform data, the simulator module <b>48</b> displays the stored plethysmographic waveform data with the alarm settings applied.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In certain embodiments, the simulator user <b>16</b> may select a simulated trend view representing sensor measurements of a patient over time to understand how these measurements affect the alarm systems in simulated real-time. Providing a time-based playback simulation may help the simulator user <b>16</b> to more clearly understand the alarm trigger frequency over time based upon the alarm settings provided. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 10</figref> A-C illustrate the progression of a trend view <b>194</b> over time. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> shows the data prior to the alarm settings being applied. The time bar <b>196</b> is displayed at the starting position <b>198</b>. In the depicted embodiment, alarm indicators are displayed only as they are triggered. Thus, no alarm indicators are present in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> because simulator playback has not begun. In alternative embodiments, alarm indicators may be displayed as the alarm settings are applied to the stored plethysmographic waveform data, prior to being triggered, to provide an indication of future alarms based upon the current alarm setting inputs.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The simulator user <b>16</b> may initiate playback by selecting a play control provided by the simulator system <b>10</b>. As playback commences, the time bar <b>196</b> begins to progress from the starting position <b>198</b> towards the end position <b>200</b>. In the depicted embodiment, as the simulator playback progresses, simulated alarm outputs <b>202</b> are provided based upon the stored plethysmographic waveform data applied to the alarm settings inputs. For instance, the simulator module may determine that at time position <b>202</b>, an SPD alarm should be triggered based upon the saturation pattern detection threshold alarm settings <b>110</b> applied to the stored plethysmographic waveform data. Thus, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, an SPD alarm indicator <b>203</b> is displayed at time position <b>202</b>. The alarm indicator may provide an indication of when the alarm triggered and the type of alarm that was triggered. For example, as depicted, the alarm indicator may be a shape (e.g., a triangle) which represents an alarm type. The indicator may be displayed at the time position where the alarm triggered. Additionally, in the depicted embodiment, an alarm indication bar <b>204</b> is displayed, further clarifying when the alarm occurred. In addition to the visual alarm indicators, audio alarm indicators (here, represented by a speaker icon) <b>205</b> may be employed. For example, an audio signal representative of an audio signal of the medical device being simulated may be produced through an audible alarm system <b>46</b> in the simulator system <b>10</b>. The audio alarm indicators may be programmed to output an audio signal until the alarm is acknowledged by the user, or may be programmed to deactivate after a certain amount of time.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10C</figref>, the simulator playback is shown as having progressed towards the end position <b>200</b>. At time position <b>207</b>, the simulator module <b>48</b> determines that an oxygen saturation limit alarm should trigger based upon the threshold alarm settings for the oxygen saturation limit alarm <b>106</b>. The simulator system <b>10</b> displays a circle symbol <b>206</b> and an alarm indication bar <b>204</b> at time position <b>207</b>. Additionally, the alarm simulator system <b>10</b> provides an audible alarm indicator <b>205</b> representative of an audible alarm of the medical device being simulated. The system then continues playback, progressing towards the end position <b>116</b>. The alarm indicator <b>205</b> may be deactivated through an alarm acknowledgement button <b>208</b> provided in the simulated monitor output <b>180</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7-9</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">To demonstrate the various effects of the simulated data, the simulator system may include a multi-paneled graphical user interface <b>210</b>, similar to the one depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>. The graphical user interface <b>210</b> may simultaneously provide several graphical windows that may include a trend view window <b>194</b>, a simulated monitor output window <b>180</b>, an alarm settings configuration menu <b>100</b>, playback controls <b>212</b>, external stimuli controls <b>214</b>, and/or a physiological illustration window <b>216</b> capable of illustrating the physiology responsible for the raw data displayed in the trend view <b>194</b>. As previously discussed, the trend view window <b>194</b> may provide an illustration of a simulated patient's recorded sensor readings over time. Further, the simulated monitor output window <b>180</b> may provide a simulated graphical user interface representing a typical output for the medical device being simulated. The simulated monitor output window <b>180</b> is dynamically altered based upon the simulated sensor reading at the time position <b>220</b> where the time bar <b>196</b> is located. As previously discussed, the alarm settings configuration menu <b>100</b> may provide a graphical user interface similar to one that would be found on the simulated medical device, capable of changing the alarm settings. As the trend line changes, due to variations in the stored plethysmographic waveform data over time, the simulator system <b>10</b> may provide a simulated monitor output to the various panels based upon the current time position <b>220</b> of the simulation playback. For example, as the trend line dips below a threshold level, the simulator may provide simulated results of a SatSeconds&#x2122; indicator <b>190</b> filling. As the trend line stays under the threshold, and a calculated SatSeconds&#x2122; threshold is breached, the simulator system may sound an alarm similar to one found in the medical device being simulated. Furthermore, the simulator may illustrate that an alarm has sounded by placing an alarm indicator <b>201</b> in the trend view window <b>194</b>, at the time the alarm sounded.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As the simulation time progresses, the healthcare professional or student may alter the playback rate of the simulation. For example, the user may pause the simulation or replay a portion of the simulation with either the same or different alarm configuration settings. Simulation playback may be controlled through the playback controls <b>212</b>. The playback controls <b>212</b> may include a pause button <b>222</b>, a play button <b>224</b>, a rewind button <b>226</b>, and a fast forward button <b>228</b>. The user may pause playback of a running simulation using the pause button <b>222</b>. Furthermore, the user may reverse playback or speedup playback using the rewind <b>226</b> and fast forward buttons <b>228</b>, respectively. Additionally, the user may control playback through the trend view panel <b>194</b>. The user may drag the time bar <b>196</b> in the trend view panel <b>194</b> to the location where replay is desired. For instance, if the user desires to replay the entire playback, the time bar <b>196</b> may be positioned at the start position <b>198</b> of the trend view <b>194</b>. If the simulator user <b>16</b> desires to make changes to the alarm configuration or external stimuli, the user may alter these settings before or during simulation playback.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In particular embodiments, the simulator module <b>48</b> may apply simulated external stimuli to the stored plethysmographic waveform data. Such external stimuli might include motion disturbances or supplemental O<sub>2</sub>. Disturbance settings may include: no disturbance, motion, arrhythmia, etc. The supplemental O<sub>2 </sub>settings may simulate the effects of particular levels of supplemental O<sub>2 </sub>delivered to the patient. The incorporation of these external stimuli may help the simulator user to understand the effects these inputs may have on the alarm behavior. For example, in many situations, motion may provide inaccurate sensor readings, and may trigger false alarms. Experiencing motion stimuli in the simulator system <b>10</b> may allow the simulator user <b>16</b> to become acquainted with how to accurately configure the alarms to avoid false alarms due to motion. Thus, the external stimuli controls <b>214</b> may be provided to help simulator user <b>16</b> understand how to account for these stimuli in the alarm management system. In the embodiment depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>, the external stimuli controls include a disturbance knob <b>230</b> with four settings A, B, C, and D. Setting A may be assigned to a no disturbance setting that does not affect any change in the simulation when applying the disturbance settings to the stored plethysmographic waveform data. Setting B may simulate sensor reading errors caused by patient motion. In this mode, the simulator module <b>48</b> may decrease SpO<sub>2 </sub>levels in the stored plethysmographic waveform data at certain time positions, to illustrate patient movement causing the sensor readings to drop. Settings C and D may simulate physiological conditions such as arrhythmia or other conditions. The simulator module <b>48</b> may alter the stored plethysmographic waveform data prior to displaying it to the simulator user <b>16</b> based on the physiological condition represented by the disturbance setting. For example, in an arrhythmia scenario, the stored plethysmographic waveform data may be modified to produce a simulated irregular heartbeat before it is presented to the simulator user <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The supplemental O<sub>2 </sub>knob <b>232</b> provides increasing levels of supplemental O<sub>2 </sub>that may be administered to the simulated patient. Setting A may represent no supplemental O<sub>2 </sub>being administered to a patient, while settings B, C, and D provide increasing levels of supplemental O<sub>2</sub>. As the supplemental O<sub>2 </sub>levels are increased, the simulator module <b>48</b> may increase the O<sub>2 </sub>readings displayed in the trend view <b>194</b>. As the supplemental O<sub>2 </sub>levels are reduced, the simulator module <b>48</b> may reduce the O<sub>2 </sub>readings displayed in the trend view <b>194</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In an effort to more clearly demonstrate the physiological condition associated with a particular data set, the simulator system <b>10</b> may include additional clinical information, depicted here in the form of a physiological illustration window <b>216</b>. The physiological illustration window <b>216</b> may provide an anatomical representation <b>234</b> of the physiology causing the displayed trend view <b>194</b>. For example, a simulator system <b>10</b> may simulate an airway obstruction. The simulator system <b>10</b> will import stored plethysmographic waveform data for the airway obstruction physiological condition. Based on the stored plethysmographic waveform data, the trend view <b>194</b> may be derived and displayed. The physiological illustration panel may display the relevant anatomy for the physiological condition, here a trachea <b>236</b> and lungs <b>238</b>. The physiological illustration window may further provide relevant physiological information of the anatomy through animation <b>240</b> or charts <b>242</b>. For example, in the depicted embodiment, the airflow volume over time, illustrated in the chart <b>242</b>, may take into account patient airway obstruction.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In addition, the simulator system <b>10</b> may include a user assessment module <b>50</b> designed to assess a user's understanding of the alarm settings of the medical device under specific conditions for clinical education and documentation purposes. When clinical scenarios are incorporated, the user assessment module <b>50</b> may provide training on the evolution, presentation, and response to therapy of various situations that result in hypoxemia. The user assessment module <b>50</b> may provide an interactive graphical user interface with a preset library of questions and prompts designed to guide the user through analysis, diagnosis, and possible interventions. As the user answers these questions, the simulator system <b>10</b> may immediately respond by providing outputs in line with the possible effects of the user's selections.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">In one embodiment, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the user assessment module <b>50</b> provides a user with a training input screen <b>260</b> via the display <b>12</b> of the simulator system <b>10</b>. The training input screen <b>260</b> includes patient and/or medical treatment characteristics box <b>262</b>, providing characteristics such as the age of a patient <b>264</b>, the treatment location of the patient <b>266</b>, and/or the suspected physiological condition of the patient. The patient characteristics as well as evaluation rules for the user assessment module <b>50</b> may be obtained through training data stored on local non-volatile storage <b>44</b> or through data obtained from a remote network. The simulator user <b>16</b> may input alarm settings <b>268</b> based upon the provided patient and/or medical treatment characteristics provided in the characteristics box <b>262</b>. After the user is done configuring the alarms based upon the characteristic data, the user may then submit the alarm settings configuration for review by the user assessment module <b>50</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the submission occurs upon selecting a &#x201c;submit&#x201d; button <b>270</b> provided in the training input screen <b>260</b>. Upon receiving the submitted alarm configuration settings <b>268</b>, the user assessment module <b>50</b> evaluates the configuration settings <b>268</b> based upon the characteristic data provided in the characteristics box <b>262</b> and the evaluation rules obtained by the user assessment module <b>50</b>. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref>, the user assessment module <b>50</b> may provide a results screen <b>290</b> illustrating the appropriateness of the alarm setting based on the alarm configuration settings <b>268</b> applied to the characteristics in the characteristics box <b>262</b>. In the depicted embodiment, the results screen <b>290</b> provides a settings analysis window <b>292</b> and an explanation window <b>294</b>. The settings analysis window <b>292</b> provides a list <b>296</b> of each of the alarm settings. Each alarm setting includes an indicator <b>298</b> illustrating the appropriateness of the alarm setting. In the depicted embodiment, an exclamation mark indicator <b>300</b> illustrates a possible inappropriate alarm setting. A check mark indicator <b>302</b> illustrates an appropriate alarm setting. The simulator user <b>16</b> is provided an explanation <b>296</b> of the appropriateness of the alarm setting in the explanation box <b>294</b>. For example, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> the patient characteristics provided that the patient was neonatal. The user assessment module <b>50</b> may include evaluation instructions suggesting that the upper SpO<sub>2 </sub>limit should be less than 100% for neonatal patients, e.g., to warn of lung overinflation. Thus, the simulator user <b>16</b> is provided an exclamation mark indicator <b>300</b> on the upper SpO<sub>2 </sub>setting in the settings analysis window <b>292</b>. Further, the user assessment module <b>50</b> provides an explanation of a desired neonatal overinflation warning in the explanation box <b>294</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">For further instruction, the user assessment module may include a graphical clinical decision tree <b>310</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref>. The decision tree <b>310</b> may include parameters <b>312</b> and physiological conditions to be measured <b>314</b>. The parameters <b>312</b> and physiological conditions <b>314</b> may be denoted by different shapes in the decision tree <b>310</b>. For example, parameters <b>312</b> may be displayed in a rectangular shape while physiological conditions <b>314</b> are displayed in an oval shape. The user assessment module <b>50</b> may provide parameters that are outside of normal threshold limits. The decision tree <b>310</b> may include highlighted parameters, illustrating that these parameters are outside the normal threshold limits. Providing the decision tree <b>310</b> with highlighted parameters and/or physiological conditions may assist a simulator user <b>16</b> in stepping through a diagnosis associated with the underlying physiological condition. For example, in the depicted decision tree <b>310</b>, the Arterial O<sub>2 </sub>parameter <b>316</b>, the Saturation Pattern parameter <b>318</b>, the Partial Pressure (PaO<sub>2</sub>) parameter <b>320</b>, the Respiration Rate parameter <b>322</b>, and the Respiratory Effort parameter <b>324</b> are highlighted. These highlighted parameters may direct the user to the proper physiological conditions <b>314</b> and the potential therapies <b>326</b>.</p>
