<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">In the event of a fire, in some examples, a ceiling fan stops its fan blades at a predetermined position so as to avoid obstructing the spray from an overhead sprinkler head. The fan can be stopped by various apparatus including, but not limited to, a spring loaded roller engaging a lobed member to urge the fan to a chosen stop position, an electromechanical brake that grips a rotating member at certain locations, a stationary magnet attracted to one or more iron pads that rotate to certain locations, and a motor controller responsive to a rotational position sensor.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">FIELD OF THE DISCLOSURE</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent generally pertains to ceiling fans and, more specifically, to ceiling fans in the vicinity of an overhead fire sprinkler head.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Ceiling mounted fans are often used for circulating air within large buildings such as warehouses, factories, gymnasiums, churches, auditoriums, convention centers, theaters, and other buildings with large open areas. For fire safety, sprinkler heads are usually installed near the ceiling and are used for spraying water or other fire-suppressing media on any fires that might occur within the building. In the event of a fire, the fans can be turned off to avoid fanning the fire while the sprinklers are activated to quench the fire.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In some cases, a sprinkler head might be installed directly above the fan blades. In such situations, the fan blades might obstruct or interfere with the water spraying from the sprinkler head, regardless of whether the fan blades are rotating or stationary. Although it might be possible to relocate the fan or sprinkler so that they are farther apart, large diameter fans can be particularly difficult to fit among a relatively dense matrix of sprinkler heads.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">A similar interference problem might occur between a ceiling fan and a nearby overhead light fixture. Fan blades rotating underneath a light fixture might not be much of a problem; however, if one of the fan blades stops directly underneath the light when the fan turns off, that single stationary fan blade might block a noticeable amount of light.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Certain examples are shown in the above-identified figures and described in detail below. In describing these examples, like or identical reference numbers are used to identify the same or similar elements. The figures are not necessarily to scale and certain features and certain views of the figures may be shown exaggerated in scale or in schematic for clarity and/or conciseness. Additionally, several examples have been described throughout this specification. Any features from any example may be included with, a replacement for, or otherwise combined with other features from other examples.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-8</figref> show an example of a ceiling fan <b>10</b>, for ventilation, mountable in proximity with a fire sprinkler head <b>12</b> for extinguishing a fire in a building. Fan <b>10</b> being in proximity with sprinkler head <b>12</b> means that when sprinkler head <b>12</b> is activated, spray from sprinkler head <b>12</b> can reach the fan's plurality of fan blades <b>14</b> when fan blades <b>14</b> are rotating.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The term, &#x201c;fire&#x201d; used herein refers to any burning event or state of combustion including, but not limited to, an open flame and flameless smoldering.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Upon sensing a characteristic associated with a fire, a sensor triggers the operation of sprinkler head <b>12</b> so that sprinkler head <b>12</b> sprays a fire-extinguishing fluid (e.g., water) from a supply line <b>16</b> onto the fire. Examples of a characteristic associated with a fire include, but are not limited to, heat, smoke, and light. In some examples, an optical or ionization detector senses smoke and activates a solenoid valve that supplies water to sprinkler head <b>12</b>. In another example, a fusible link on a valve portion of sprinkler head <b>12</b> melts in the presence of heat to activate sprinkler head <b>12</b>. Sprinkler head <b>12</b> is schematically illustrated to represent the aforementioned examples as well as other sprinkler-activating methods commonly known to those of ordinary skill in the art.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">In addition to activating sprinkler head <b>12</b> in the event of a fire, fan <b>10</b> preferably is de-energized or turned off automatically so as not to fan the fire or significantly interfere with the spray pattern of sprinkler head <b>12</b>. In some examples, fan <b>10</b> is automatically turned off in response to a fire-related sensor <b>18</b>, which can be any sensor responsive to a characteristic or event associated with a fire. Sensor <b>18</b>, for instance, can be a water flow sensor in supply line <b>16</b>. When sprinkler head <b>12</b> is open, sensor <b>18</b> provides a signal <b>20</b> upon sensing water flowing through supply line <b>16</b>. In this example, water flowing through supply line <b>16</b> is the characteristic associated with a fire. To turn fan <b>10</b> off, signal <b>20</b> is conveyed to a controller <b>22</b> (e.g., motor starter, electrical contacts, variable frequency drive, etc.) that controls the operation of a motor <b>24</b> via a signal <b>20</b>&#x2032;, wherein motor <b>24</b> includes a fan rotor <b>26</b> (fan rotor <b>26</b> is the rotating portion of the fan). Fan rotor <b>26</b> includes a rotor <b>28</b> inductively coupled to a stator <b>30</b> of motor <b>24</b>, the rotating fan blades <b>14</b>, and any mechanical coupling that might couple rotor <b>28</b> to fan blades <b>14</b>. Motor <b>24</b> rotates fan blades <b>14</b> about an axis <b>32</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">To prevent fan blades <b>14</b> from stopping at a location that significantly interferes with the spray pattern of sprinkler head <b>12</b>, the example fan rotor <b>26</b> disclosed herein is biased to one or more likely stop positions when the fan <b>10</b> is turned off. The expressions, &#x201c;likely stop position&#x201d; and &#x201c;likely stop positions,&#x201d; refer to one or more points or general locations where fan rotor <b>26</b> is intended to stop more often than other points or locations through which fan rotor <b>24</b> passes.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2 and 3</figref>, for instance, when fan <b>10</b> is turned on, fan blades <b>14</b> sweep along a generally circular path <b>34</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). When fan <b>10</b> turns off (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), it may be desirable to have fan blades <b>14</b> purposely avoid stopping at a predetermined point <b>36</b>. The expression, &#x201c;purposely avoids,&#x201d; means the avoidance is intentional and not simply a permanent magnet stepper motor just happening to stop at some discrete circumferential step. Although point <b>36</b> can be any user-chosen point on path <b>34</b>, for the illustrated example, point <b>36</b> is radially inline with sprinkler head <b>12</b> so that none of fan blades <b>14</b> tend to stop directly underneath sprinkler head <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">In other examples, stopping a single fan blade <b>14</b> directly underneath a sprinkler head <b>12</b> might actually create less spray interference and be more desirable than stopping the fan blades <b>14</b> with the sprinkler head <b>12</b> midway between two fan blades <b>14</b>. Thus, selecting point <b>36</b> based on the location of sprinkler head <b>12</b> means that the location of point <b>36</b> is chosen with reference to the location of sprinkler head <b>12</b> but does not necessarily mean that point <b>36</b> and sprinkler head <b>12</b> are radially inline with each other.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">For sake of example, predetermined point <b>36</b> will be inline with sprinkler head <b>12</b>, and the likely stop positions will be wherever fan <b>10</b> stops with sprinkler head <b>12</b> being generally midway between any two fan blades <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. Biasing fan rotor <b>26</b> to stop at any one of four likely stop positions can be accomplished in many different ways within the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4-8</figref>, fan <b>10</b>, for instance, includes a stop mechanism <b>38</b> comprising a lobed member <b>40</b>, a catch mechanism <b>42</b>, and an actuator such as a solenoid <b>44</b> for selectively engaging and disengaging catch mechanism <b>42</b> from lobed member <b>40</b>. When fan <b>10</b> is turned on (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref>, <b>2</b> and <b>5</b>), catch mechanism <b>42</b> disengages lobed member <b>40</b> to enable fan blades <b>14</b> to spin freely. When fan <b>10</b> turns off (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b>), catch mechanism <b>42</b> engages lobed member <b>40</b> to urge fan <b>10</b> to stop at a predetermined desired location. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>6</b>, <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> show catch mechanism <b>42</b> engaged with lobed member <b>40</b>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref> show catch mechanism <b>42</b> disengaged from lobed member <b>40</b>. Depending on the design, either lobed member <b>40</b> or catch mechanism <b>42</b> rotates with fan blades <b>14</b>, while the other one is anchored at a substantially stationary point (e.g., point <b>36</b>). For the illustrated example, a bracket <b>48</b> affixes lobed member <b>40</b> to fan blades <b>14</b>, so lobed member <b>40</b> and fan blades <b>14</b> rotate together as a unit.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">In this example, catch mechanism <b>42</b> includes a roller <b>50</b>; however, other catch mechanisms (e.g., a pawl) are also well within the scope of this disclosure. To mount catch mechanism <b>42</b>, a stationary leaf <b>52</b> of a hinge <b>54</b> is anchored at a fixed point on a substantially stationary housing <b>56</b> within which fan rotor <b>26</b> rotates when fan <b>10</b> is on. A hinge pin <b>58</b> pivotally couples a pivotal leaf <b>60</b> of hinge <b>54</b> to stationary leaf <b>52</b>. An arm <b>62</b> supporting roller <b>50</b> is pivotally attached to pivotal leaf <b>60</b> at a pivot point <b>63</b>. Electric solenoid <b>44</b> or an alternate actuator includes a plunger <b>64</b> connected to arm <b>62</b> and a cylinder <b>66</b> attached to pivotal leaf <b>60</b>. Solenoid <b>44</b> retracting plunger <b>64</b> to the solenoid's <b>44</b> run position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 5</figref> lifts arm <b>62</b> to disengage roller <b>50</b> from lobed member <b>40</b>, thereby enabling fan blades <b>14</b> to spin when fan <b>10</b> is turned on. When fan <b>10</b> turns off, solenoid <b>44</b> extends plunger <b>64</b> to the solenoid's <b>44</b> stop position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4</figref>, <b>6</b> and <b>8</b>, which lowers arm <b>62</b> to move roller <b>50</b> into engagement with lobed member <b>40</b> (see also <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>). To ensure proper blade-stopping operation during a power failure, plunger <b>64</b> preferably is extended by spring force when solenoid <b>44</b> is de-energized.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">To urge fan rotor <b>26</b> to the likely stop position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3</figref>, <b>4</b>, <b>6</b> and <b>7</b>, fan <b>10</b> is de-energized and roller <b>50</b> is forced radially toward lobed member <b>40</b> such that roller <b>50</b> follows an outer peripheral contour <b>68</b> of lobed member <b>40</b>. The radial pressure that roller <b>50</b> exerts against lobed member <b>40</b> urges roller <b>50</b> to settle into one of the valleys <b>68</b>a of peripheral contour <b>68</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>), thus urging fan blades <b>14</b> to coast to stop at those likely positions.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">To force roller <b>50</b> against lobed member <b>40</b>, a stud <b>70</b> extends from stationary leaf <b>52</b> and slidingly protrudes through a hole in pivotal leaf <b>60</b>. A spring <b>72</b> having a larger outer diameter greater than that of the hole through which stud <b>70</b> extends in pivotal leaf <b>60</b> is compressed between a head <b>74</b> of stud <b>70</b> and the outer face of pivotal leaf <b>60</b>. Spring <b>72</b> urges the leaves <b>52</b> and <b>60</b> of hinge <b>54</b> toward each other, thereby urging roller <b>50</b> radially against lobed member <b>40</b>. The flexibility of spring <b>72</b> allows hinge <b>54</b> to pivot open (compare <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6 and 8</figref>), which enables roller <b>50</b> to roll over peaks <b>68</b>b (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) of lobed member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">To adjust the position at which fan rotor <b>26</b> tends to stop in relation to sprinkler head <b>12</b>, hinge <b>54</b> can be relocated and mounted at some other location around housing <b>56</b>. Alternatively, lobed member <b>40</b> can be disconnected from bracket <b>48</b>, shifted rotationally about axis <b>32</b> relative to housing <b>56</b>, and reattached to bracket <b>48</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Although roller <b>50</b> rolls along the outer peripheral contour <b>68</b> of lobed member <b>40</b>, wherein the lobes protrude radially outward from lobed member <b>40</b>, it is also well within the scope of this disclosure to have the lobed member <b>40</b> be wavy vertically, rather than radially, wherein the lobes protrude axially upward and roller <b>50</b> is oriented to roll along the axial wavy face of the lobed member <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In addition, to minimize the forces on the catch mechanism <b>42</b> and fan rotor <b>26</b> from rapid deceleration, a timer (not shown) may be employed to prevent the catch mechanism <b>42</b> from engaging the fan rotor <b>26</b> for some period of time after the fan <b>10</b> is de-energized to enable the fan <b>10</b> to spin down to a slower rotational speed. A rotational sensor (not shown) could be used for some purpose.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">As an alternative to using lobed member <b>40</b> and stop mechanism <b>38</b> to bias the fan rotor <b>26</b> to likely stop positions, another example ceiling fan <b>75</b> includes a disk <b>76</b> connected to rotate with fan blades <b>14</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. To bias fan blades <b>14</b> to stop at one or more likely stop positions, a generally stationary magnet <b>78</b> (permanent or electromagnetic) attracts one or more iron pads <b>80</b> that are attached to disk <b>76</b>. When fan <b>75</b> turns off (or at a later time when fan <b>75</b> has slowed), and fan blades <b>14</b> begin coasting to a stop, iron pads <b>80</b> pass sequentially underneath magnet <b>78</b>. Eventually the rotation of fan blades <b>14</b> becomes sufficiently slow that the magnetic force from magnet <b>78</b> is sufficient to slow and stop pad <b>80</b> underneath magnet <b>78</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 9 and 10</figref>. In this example, there are four pads <b>80</b> distributed 90 degrees apart so that fan blades <b>14</b> tend to stop in the position shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. However, in other examples, any other number of pads <b>80</b> (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.) may be used instead.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">To adjust the position at which fan blades <b>14</b> tend to stop in relation to sprinkler head <b>12</b>, magnet <b>78</b> can be relocated and mounted at some other location around housing <b>56</b>. Alternatively, pads <b>80</b> can be attached to other locations around disk <b>76</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 11 and 12</figref> show an example ceiling fan <b>82</b>, wherein an electrically actuated caliper brake <b>84</b> with a brake pad <b>86</b> replaces magnet <b>78</b> of fan <b>75</b> to bias the fan rotor <b>26</b> to likely stop positions. Brake <b>84</b> is mounted at a generally stationary point on fan <b>82</b>. Brake pad <b>86</b>, which is movable between a run position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>) and a stop position (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), is adapted to frictionally engage any number of raised areas <b>88</b> on a brake rotor <b>90</b> that is mounted to rotate with fan blades <b>14</b>. Raised areas <b>88</b> are of vertical thickness that is greater than the minimum vertical caliper opening of brake <b>84</b> so that brake <b>84</b> can effectively clamp onto any of those raised areas <b>88</b>. To prevent brake <b>84</b> from clamping onto a thinner area <b>92</b> of rotor <b>90</b>, between two raised areas <b>88</b>, the vertical thickness of thinner areas <b>92</b> should be less than the minimum caliper opening of brake <b>84</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">When fan <b>82</b> turns off (or a later time when the fan <b>75</b> has slowed), brake <b>84</b> closes to the minimum caliper opening (stop position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref>), and fan blades <b>14</b> and fan rotor <b>26</b> coast until a raised area <b>88</b> becomes clamped within brake <b>84</b>, thereby stopping fan <b>82</b> at a predetermined likely stop position. When fan <b>82</b> is turned on, brake <b>84</b> opens to the run position of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, wherein brake pad <b>86</b> disengages raised area <b>88</b> to enable fan blades <b>14</b> to spin freely.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 13 and 14</figref> show an example of a ceiling fan <b>94</b> that is biased to a predetermined likely stop position by use of the controller <b>22</b> with a feedback system. Controller <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) selectively (i.e., on/off&#x2014;pulsed or single shot) and/or controllably (i.e., variable speed) energizes motor <b>24</b> in response to a feedback signal <b>96</b> from a rotational position sensor <b>98</b>. Sensor <b>98</b> is schematically illustrated to represent any transducer capable of sensing the position of one or more rotating elements of fan <b>94</b>, wherein examples of rotating elements include, but are not limited to, motor <b>24</b>, rotor <b>28</b>; rotating field, voltage or current; a fan hub <b>100</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>); and the plurality of fan blades <b>14</b>. Examples of sensor <b>98</b> include, but are not limited to, a photoelectric eye, Hall effect proximity sensor, electromechanical limit switch, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In some examples, fan <b>82</b> would be sensor <b>98</b> being a Hall effect sensor that detects the presence of one or more iron pads <b>102</b> on a disc <b>104</b> that rotates with fan blades <b>14</b>. Pads <b>102</b> can be positioned such that fan blades <b>14</b> are at a predetermined likely stop position when one of pads <b>102</b> is aligned with sensor <b>98</b>. Alternatively, pads <b>102</b> can be positioned such that the likely stop position is where sensor <b>98</b> is situated midway between two pads <b>102</b>. Either way, controller <b>22</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>) enables fan <b>94</b> to coast to a stop. If fan <b>94</b> stops at a desired likely stop position, controller <b>22</b> leaves fan <b>94</b> de-energized. If, however, fan <b>94</b> fails to stop at a predetermined likely stop position, then controller <b>22</b> feeds motor <b>24</b> with a brief pulse of current to &#x201c;bump&#x201d; fan <b>94</b> away from its undesirable stop position. If fan <b>94</b> subsequently stops at a desired likely stop position, controller <b>22</b> leaves fan <b>94</b> de-energized; otherwise, controller <b>22</b> gives motor <b>24</b> another brief pulse of current. Such a bump-and-coast method continues until fan <b>94</b> stops at a desired likely stop position.</p>
