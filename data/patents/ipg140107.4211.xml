<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">In the art of computing, individual memory integrated circuits (ICs) are often provided on a dual in-line memory module (DIMM). Often a heat spreader is attached over the memory ICs to dissipate the heat generated by the memory ICs across the length of the DIMM. However, it is often desirable to provide additional cooling.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Typically DIMM sockets are positioned on a motherboard in close proximity to each other, thereby simplifying routing of memory signal traces on the motherboard and minimizing space used by memory. A typical separation between adjacent DIMMs is 10 millimeters.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Two methods known in the art for providing additional cooling are air cooling and liquid cooling. Because of the close spacing of adjacent DIMMs, both methods often use space above the DIMM. Typically, air cooling uses a solid heat conducting metal or vapor chambers and associated tubing to conduct heat from the heat spreader to a heatsink above the DIMM.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Typically liquid cooling uses a suitable liquid, such as propylene glycol or ethylene glycol, mixed with water, to conduct heat from the heat spreader to the liquid. The heat is removed as the liquid is pumped through a channel associated with each DIMM. The liquid is then pumped to a heat exchanger, where heat is removed from the liquid. Typically, tubing is coupled to each DIMM along the top of the top of the DIMM.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">In the foregoing description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details. While the invention has been disclosed with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate numerous modifications and variations therefrom. It is intended that the appended claims cover such modifications and variations as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The Figures show many elements that are members of a plurality of similar elements. In general, individual elements of the plurality will be referenced by a numeral followed by a letter, while similar elements may be referenced collectively or generically by the numeral. For example, a group of blades may be referenced as blades <b>36</b>, and an individual blade may be referenced as blade <b>36</b><i>d</i>, and a blade may be referenced generically as a blade <b>36</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">As discussed in the Background section above, commercially available dual in-line memory module (DIMM) cooling solutions use space above the DIMMs to facilitate cooling. For air cooling, heatsinks are positioned above the DIMMs. Furthermore, cooling fans and air channels are often needed to move air over the heatsinks.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Commercially available liquid cooling solutions have a liquid inlet and outlet for each DIMM. The inlets and outlets, along with the associated tubing, consume space above the DIMMs. Furthermore, the need to connect tubing to the inlet and outlet of each DIMM makes assembly and servicing cumbersome.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In accordance with embodiments of the present invention, a cold plate having a liquid inlet and outlet is provided for each block of DIMMs. DIMM sockets are attached to a motherboard, system board, or other type of circuit board, and may have a standard spacing of 10 millimeters between adjacent DIMM sockets. The cold plate includes a series of blades that are positioned proximate the DIMM sockets such that a surface of a blade is positioned adjacent to a DIMM heat spreader when a DIMM is installed. Note that in other configurations, it is possible to use DIMMs without heat spreaders, with the surface of a blade in direct contact with the individual memory integrated circuits (ICs) on the DIMM.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thermally conductive clips are placed over DIMMs and blades, thereby associating a blade with each DIMM. When the clips are installed, one side of each DIMM is cooled by direct contact with one side of the blade. The other side of the DIMM is cooled by contact with the clip, and a thermal conduction path through the clip, traversing the top of the DIMM and blade, to the other side of the blade, where the clip is in thermal contact with the other side of the blade. Embodiments of the present invention use little additional space compared to a standard bank of DIMMs of the prior art. Installation and servicing are simplified, since the clips are easily removed, and DIMMs can be added or removed, as in the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a functional block diagram of computer <b>10</b>, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Details of the cold plate and clip structures, in accordance with embodiments of the present invention, will be shown in other figures.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Computer system <b>10</b> includes one or more central processing units (CPUs) <b>12</b>, core logic <b>14</b>, DIMMs <b>16</b>, bus <b>18</b>, cold plate and clips <b>20</b> (which includes blades/clips <b>17</b>, liquid inlet <b>22</b>, and liquid outlet <b>24</b>), tubing <b>26</b>, and liquid cooling loop pump/cooling unit <b>28</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">CPUs <b>12</b> represents CPUs know in the art, such as several CPUs in discrete packages and multi-core CPUs in a single package. Core logic <b>14</b> represents core logic known in the art, such as a south bridge, a north bridge, memory controllers, I/O controllers, and the like. As the art of computing continues to advance, some of these functions, such as the memory controllers, are provided in the CPU package. Bus <b>18</b> represents one or more buses known in the art for connecting CPUs <b>12</b>, core logic <b>14</b>, and DIMMs <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Liquid cooling loop pump/cooling unit <b>28</b> pumps and cools liquid coolant using techniques know in the art. Any suitable coolant liquid, such as propylene glycol or ethylene glycol, mixed with water, can be used. The liquid may be cooled using a simple heat exchanger and fan, or by more advanced techniques, such as Peltier coolers or heat pumps. Also note that the function provided by unit <b>28</b> may be implemented at a variety of levels, such as in the computer system, within a rack, within a row of racks, or within a data center.

<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> shows cold plate <b>32</b>, and DIMMs <b>16</b> as in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, with DIMM <b>16</b><i>a </i>installed in DIMM socket <b>34</b><i>a</i>.

Clips <b>42</b> thermally couple DIMMs <b>16</b> to blades <b>36</b>, as will be seen in greater detail below with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> is a sectional view taken along line <b>6</b>-<b>6</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> showing the orientations of the DIMMs <b>16</b>, blades <b>36</b>, and clips <b>42</b>. Note that the sectional view of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows clip <b>42</b><i>a </i>installed.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, dual sided DIMMs <b>16</b><i>a</i>-<b>16</b><i>h </i>with heat spreaders <b>40</b><i>a</i>-<b>40</b><i>h </i>are shown. Accordingly, each DIMM <b>16</b> is inserted in a DIMM socket <b>34</b>, and includes memory ICs <b>44</b> (<b>44</b><i>a</i>-<b>44</b><i>h</i>) on both sides of the DIMM, and a heat spreader <b>40</b>. Those skilled in the art will recognize that single-sided DIMMs may also be used with embodiments of the present invention, and DIMMs without heat spreaders may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Note that clips <b>42</b> urge a first side of each DIMM <b>16</b> into thermal contact with a first side of a cold plate blade <b>36</b>, thereby cooling the first sides of each DIMM <b>16</b>. Each clip <b>42</b> is also in thermal with a second side of a DIMM <b>16</b> and a second side of a blade <b>36</b>, thereby forming thermal conduction paths from the second sides of the DIMMs <b>16</b> to the second sides of the blades <b>36</b>, and cooling the second sides of the DIMMs <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, cold plate <b>32</b> includes a single cooling loop <b>38</b> that traverses a portion of the perimeter of the DIMMs <b>16</b>. Each blade <b>36</b> of cold plate <b>32</b> has two ends coupled to cooling loop <b>38</b>, and blades <b>36</b> and clips <b>42</b> are made of a material having excellent thermal transfer properties, such as copper, aluminum, steel, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">While the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref> having a cooling loop <b>38</b> that traverses a portion of the perimeter of DIMMs <b>16</b> provides acceptable cooling performance, in another embodiment, liquid is routed through each blade of the cold plate. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> shows a block diagram of this embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, blade <b>48</b> of cold plate <b>46</b> represents a first blade in a series of blades, and blade <b>50</b> represents a last blade in the series. Blade <b>48</b> includes channel <b>52</b>, and blade <b>50</b> includes channel <b>54</b>, with each channel carrying cooling liquid through the blade. Cooling loop <b>56</b> is configured to route cooling liquid through the channel of each blade. Accordingly, although the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> is more complex than the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>, the temperatures along the channels <b>52</b> and <b>54</b> tend to be more uniform.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flowchart <b>58</b> illustrating how embodiments of the present invention cool DIMMs. In block <b>60</b>, heat is conducted away from a first side of each DIMM to a blade of the cold plate. In block <b>62</b>, heat is conducted away from a second side of each DIMM to a thermally conductive clip. In block <b>64</b>, heat is conducted from the thermally conductive clips to the blades of the cold plate. Finally, in block <b>66</b> heat is conducted from the blades of the cold plate to the liquid flowing in the liquid cooling loop.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Block <b>68</b><i>a</i>, in conjunction with block <b>66</b>, represents the embodiments shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1-5</figref>. Accordingly, heat is conducted from the ends of the cold plate blades to the liquid cooling loop. Block <b>68</b><i>b</i>, in conjunction with block <b>66</b>, represents the embodiment shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>. Accordingly, cooling liquid is routed through a channel of each blade of the cold plate.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Embodiments of the present invention provide many advantages over the prior art. Liquid cooling loop connections remain fixed as DIMMs are added or removed by simply first removing the clip from each DIMM. In contrast, prior art configurations provide liquid inlets and outlets for each DIMM, thereby causing the addition and removal of DIMMs to be cumbersome and time consuming. With embodiments of the present invention, a single inlet and outlet is provided for a block of DIMMs, and the inlet/outlet connections need only be coupled once during the manufacturing process.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Embodiments of the present invention require little extra space above the DIMMs, as is shown in the figures. Prior art air and liquid cooling solutions often consume space above the DIMMs. In addition, embodiments of the present invention have a system board &#x201c;footprint&#x201d; similar to prior art DIMM blocks. The only extra area required is the area reserved for the cooling loop along the sides of the DIMM block, and the area reserved for the inlets and outlets, and cooling loop connections. Also, space is saved by eliminating the need for cooling fans to direct airflow over the DIMMs. Of course, acoustic levels may also be reduced. Finally, embodiments of the present invention provide for simple memory reconfiguration, since the clips are easily removed from the DIMMs and cold plate blades, thereby providing access to the DIMMs</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the foregoing description, numerous details are set forth to provide an understanding of the present invention. However, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that the present invention may be practiced without these details. While the invention has been disclosed with respect to a limited number of embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate numerous modifications and variations therefrom. It is intended that the appended claims cover such modifications and variations as fall within the true spirit and scope of the invention.</p>
