<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Femtocells are used to allow user terminal devices access to the Internet. Generally, a femtocell establishes a secure tunnel and the user terminal devices communicate with the Internet over the secure tunnel. The secure tunnel increases security of wireless communication between the user terminal devices and the Internet. However, the secure tunnel requires a long time to certificate data from or to the user terminal devices. Therefore, the user terminal devices need to wait for the long time, which decreases accessing speed and customer satisfaction. There remains a heretofore unaddressed need to overcome the limitations described.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">All of the processes described may be embodied in, and fully automated over, software code modules executed by one or more general purpose computers or processors. The code modules may be stored in any type of computer-readable medium or other storage device. Some or all of the methods may alternatively be embodied in specialized computer hardware or communication apparatus.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram of environment of one embodiment of a femtocell <b>10</b> of the present disclosure. In one embodiment, the femtocell <b>10</b> can be used by a user terminal device <b>50</b> to access to the Internet <b>40</b>. In one embodiment, the user terminal device <b>50</b> may be a mobile phone, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a computer, a set-top box, or a connected TV.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a schematic diagram of functional modules of one embodiment of the femtocell <b>10</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. In one embodiment, the femtocell <b>10</b> includes a processor <b>12</b>, a storage system <b>14</b>, a network address translator <b>100</b>, a tunnel communication module <b>102</b>, a determination module <b>103</b>, and a selection module <b>104</b>. The determination module <b>103</b> and the selection module <b>104</b> may comprise computerized codes in the form of one or more programs that are stored in the storage system <b>14</b>. The computerized codes include instructions that are executed by the processor <b>12</b> to provide functions for the determination module <b>103</b> and the selection module <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The network address translator <b>100</b> translates network address for the user terminal device <b>50</b>, and the user terminal device <b>50</b> accesses to the Internet <b>40</b> according to a translated network address. Here, translating the network address indicates translating a LAN IP address to a WAN IP address embedded in each uploading packet from the user terminal device <b>50</b> to the Internet <b>40</b> and translating a WAN IP address to a LAN IP address embedded in each downloading packet from the Internet <b>40</b> to the user terminal device <b>50</b> just like a normal network address translating device (NAT). However, a normal femtocell can not translate network address like such a normal NAT.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The tunnel communication module <b>102</b> establishes a secure tunnel <b>30</b> between the user terminal device <b>50</b> and a femto gateway <b>22</b> to allow the user terminal device <b>50</b> access to the Internet <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The femtocell <b>10</b> allows the user terminal device <b>50</b> access to the Internet <b>40</b> using different methods according to an accessing class of the user terminal device <b>50</b>. The accessing class is a desired goal of the user terminal device <b>50</b> to access to the Internet. The accessing class includes a video streaming service and a web service. For example, if a set-top box or a connected TV uses the femtocell <b>10</b> to play TV programs, the accessing class of the set-top box or the connected TV is the video streaming service. If a mobile phone or a computer uses the femtocell <b>10</b> to browse a website, such as WWW.GOOGLE.COM, the accessing class of the mobile phone or the computer is the web service.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">The determination module <b>103</b> determines the accessing class of the user terminal device <b>50</b>. In one embodiment, the determination module <b>103</b> determines the accessing class of the user terminal device <b>50</b> is the video streaming service according to traffic class. In another embodiment, the determination module <b>103</b> determines the accessing class of the user terminal device <b>50</b> is the web service if a port number of a port of the femtocell <b>10</b> connecting to the user terminal device <b>50</b> is equal to a specified port number, such as <b>80</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">The selection module <b>104</b> selects the network address translator <b>100</b> or the tunnel communication module <b>102</b> to allow the user terminal device <b>50</b> access to the Internet <b>40</b> according to the accessing class of the user terminal device <b>50</b> when the femtocell <b>10</b> is in network traffic jam. The selection of the selection module <b>104</b> can decrease network traffic jam of the femtocell <b>10</b>, which increases the internet accessing speed of the user terminal device <b>50</b>. Hereafter are detail descriptions of the selection of the selection module <b>104</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">When the user terminal device <b>50</b> requires the video streaming service, the selection module <b>104</b> selects the network address translator <b>100</b> to allow the user terminal device <b>50</b> access to the Internet <b>40</b>. In one embodiment, the selection module <b>104</b> receives a request packet for accessing the Internet <b>40</b> from the user terminal device <b>50</b>, controls the network address translator <b>100</b> to translate the Internet protocol (IP) address of the request packet, and then sends the translated request packet to the Internet <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Then, the selection module <b>104</b> receives a response packet from the Internet <b>40</b>, and then selects the network address translator <b>100</b> to allow the user terminal device <b>50</b> access to the Internet <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">When the user terminal device <b>50</b> requires the web service, the selection module <b>104</b> selects the network address translator <b>100</b> or the tunnel communication module <b>102</b> according to a speed of the user terminal device accessing the Internet to allow the user terminal device <b>50</b> access to the Internet <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In detail, the selection module <b>104</b> receives a request packet for accessing the Internet <b>40</b> from the user terminal device <b>50</b>, and controls both the network address translator <b>100</b> and the tunnel communication module <b>102</b> to process the request packet and send the processed request packet to the Internet <b>40</b>. Then, the selection module <b>104</b> obtains a fastest response packet corresponding to the processed request packet from the Internet <b>40</b>, and determines whether the processed request packet corresponding to the fastest response packet is sent by the network address translator <b>100</b> or by the tunnel communication module <b>102</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">If the processed request packet corresponding to the fastest response packet is sent by the network address translator <b>100</b>, that is, the network address translator <b>100</b> is faster than the tunnel communication module <b>10</b> for the user terminal device <b>50</b> accessing the Internet <b>40</b>, then the selection module <b>104</b> closes the secure tunnel <b>30</b> established by the tunnel communication module <b>102</b>, and selects the network address translator <b>100</b> to allow the user terminal device <b>50</b> access to the Internet <b>40</b>.</p>
