<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to Korean Patent Application No. 10-2011-0068116, filed on Jul. 8, 2011, and all the benefits accruing therefrom under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119, the content of which in its entirety is herein incorporated by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Provided are a surface acoustic wave (&#x201c;SAW&#x201d;) sensor system having substantially high sensitivity and integration, and a measurement method using a multiple-transit-echo wave.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">A SAW sensor refers to an element or a device for detecting or measuring an absolute value of a physical quantity or a chemical quantity, a change in physical quantity or chemical quantity, or intensity of a sound, light, or a radio wave from a target using a base and surface sensing technique and a SAW, and for converting them into an electrical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">SAW sensors are classified according to types of targets. For example, the SAW sensors may include a bio sensor for detecting protein, deoxyribonucleic acid (&#x201c;DNA&#x201d;), a virus, a bacterium, a cell, a tissue, and the like, a gas sensor for detecting toxic gas, inflammable gas, and the like, a temperature sensor for detecting temperature, a pressure sensor for detecting pressure, and a humidity sensor for detecting humidity. The SAW sensor may be used in various industrial fields.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Provided are a surface acoustic wave (&#x201c;SAW&#x201d;) sensor system having substantially high sensitivity and integration, and a measurement method using a multiple-transit-echo wave.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">In an embodiment, a SAW sensor system comprises signal generating part providing a first electrical signal to a SAW sensor, wherein the SAW sensor connected to the signal generating part is adapted to convert the first electrical signal into a SAW, output a SAW corresponding to a measurement target when the measurement target contacts a sensing area, and convert the SAW corresponding to the measurement target into a second electrical signal; and a signal measuring part connected to one side of the SAW sensor and detecting a change in the second electrical signal by time-gating a multiple-transit-echo wave.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The SAW sensor may include a piezoelectric substrate, and an input part disposed on one side of the piezoelectric substrate and converting the first electrical signal into the SAW.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The SAW sensor may further include a sensing part and an output part, wherein the sensing part is disposed on the piezoelectric substrate, and the sensing part outputs the SAW corresponding to the measurement target so as to sense the measurement target, and wherein the output part is disposed on another side of the piezoelectric substrate and converts the SAW corresponding to the measurement target into the second electrical signal in the output part.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In another embodiment, A SAW sensor system comprises a SAW sensor; and a signal measuring part, wherein the SAW sensor includes an input part, an output part and a sensing part disposed between the input part and the output part, wherein a SAW from the input part is reflected by a portion of the output part and a first reflected SAW moves toward the input part, wherein the first reflected SAW is further reflected by a portion of the input part and a second reflected SAW moves toward the output part, wherein the second reflected SAW is a N multiple-transit-echo wave with N being three, wherein the output part converts the second reflected SAW into an electrical signal, and wherein the signal measuring part connected to the SAW sensor detects change in the electrical signal by time-gathering the N multiple-transit-echo wave with N being three.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In another embodiment, A measurement method using a multiple-transit-echo wave comprises converting a first electrical signal into a SAW, sensing a target using the SAW, outputting a SAW corresponding to the sensed target, converting the SAW corresponding to the target into a second electrical signal, and detecting a change in the second electrical signal by time-gating the multiple-transit-echo wave.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">According to a measurement method using a multiple-transit-echo wave, sensitivity and integration of a SAW sensor is substantially improved. Thus, the manufacturing cost of the SAW sensor may be significantly reduced because the improved integration needs a less substrate area for the same number of elements.</p>

<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Hereinafter, embodiments of the invention will be described in further detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.</p>
<p id="h-0006" num="0000">Surface Acoustic Wave</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">As used herein, the term &#x201c;surface acoustic wave (&#x201c;SAW&#x201d;)&#x201d; typically refers to a mechanical wave motion rather than an electromagnetic wave, which is generated from movement of particles due to various causes such as external thermal, mechanical, or electrical forces. The SAW typically includes vibration energy concentrated on a surface of an elastic body, and it is propagated along the surface of a solid as an earthquake is propagated along the ground.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A wave propagated through a medium is typically divided into three different components that are a longitudinal wave, a transversal wave and a surface wave. The longitudinal wave is a wave whose moving direction is substantially parallel to the displacement direction of particles. On the other hand, the moving direction of the transversal wave is substantially perpendicular to the displacement direction of particles. The surface wave occurs due to the combination of vectors of the longitudinal wave and the transversal wave.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">Generally, about 90 percent (%) or more of a longitudinal displacement component and a transversal displacement component vanishes within a length of one wavelength from a material surface, and most energy thereof is concentrated within the length of one wavelength from the surface. Thus, the SAW is also called a transversal wave or a Rayleigh wave.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">SAWs are typically classified into shear horizontal SAWs (&#x201c;SH SAWs&#x201d;) and surface transverse waves (&#x201c;STWs&#x201d;) according to types and classified into flexural plate waves (&#x201c;FPWs&#x201d;), Love waves, surface skimming bulk waves, and Lamb waves according to a purpose of use, for example, but is not limited thereto. Among these, the Lamb wave is mainly used for sensing a gas, and the Love wave is mainly used for sensing a liquid, for example.</p>

<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In an exemplary embodiment, a 36&#xb0; YX LiTaO<sub>3 </sub>(&#x201c;LT&#x201d;) substrate may be used.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">As used herein, the term &#x201c;input part <b>200</b>&#x201d; refers to an area which is disposed on one side of the piezoelectric substrate <b>100</b> for converting an electrical signal applied from the signal generating part into a SAW that is a mechanical signal.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">In one exemplary embodiment, the input part <b>200</b> may include an interdigital transducer (&#x201c;IDT&#x201d;). The input part <b>200</b> may further include an electrode pad (not shown) for receiving an electrical signal from the signal generating part (not shown) which is disposed on one end of the input part <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one exemplary embodiment, the input part <b>200</b> may be disposed by patterning a metallic material on the piezoelectric substrate <b>100</b> into a predetermined form. The metallic material may include a thin film metal such as an aluminum alloy, a copper alloy, or gold, for example, but is not limited thereto. In order to prevent corrosion of the metallic material due to exposure to atmosphere or moisture, a protective layer such as an anti-oxidation layer may be disposed on a surface of the metallic material.</p>

<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The SAW sensor may further include a sensing part <b>800</b> and an output part <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">As used herein, the term &#x201c;sensing part&#x201d; is disposed on the piezoelectric substrate <b>100</b> and refers to an area capable of outputting the SAW corresponding to a target with the SAW provided from the input part <b>200</b> when the target contacts the area of the sensing part.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">The sensing part <b>800</b> may be configured by a delay line between the input part <b>200</b> and the output part <b>300</b>, and may include a film form or a cell form.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">When the target is contacted to the surface of the sensing part, due to influence of various types of causes such as pressure, rotator force, shock, tensile force, gravity, mass, evaporation, biochemistry, temperature, humidity, freezing, viscosity, displacement, liquidity, light sensing, optic angle, acceleration, abrasion, contamination, for example, a SAW corresponding to the target may be generated, which is substantially different in frequency, phase, amplitude, or the number of clocks from that of a SAW sent from the input part <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The target may include protein, DNA, viruses, bacteria, cell, tissue, gas, temperature, humidity, for example, but is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">As used herein, the &#x201c;output part <b>300</b>&#x201d; is disposed on one side of the piezoelectric substrate <b>100</b>, and refers to an area capable of converting a mechanical signal into an electrical signal so as to analyze the SAW corresponding to the target which is output and received from the sensing part. In one exemplary embodiment, the output part <b>300</b> may be disposed at an opposite side to the input part <b>200</b> with the sensing part interposed therebetween.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The output part <b>300</b> may have a form which is similar (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref>) to that of the input part <b>200</b> or modified (not shown) from the input part <b>200</b>. The output part <b>300</b> may include an electrode pad (not shown) for outputting a signal to the signal measuring part which may be disposed on one end of the output part <b>300</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The output part <b>300</b> may be disposed by patterning a metallic material on the piezoelectric substrate <b>100</b> into a previously set form. The metallic material is substantially the same as in the input part <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In the embodiment, the SAW sensor may be classified according to types of the target. For example, the SAW sensor may include a bio sensor for detecting protein, DNA, a virus, a bacterium, a cell, a tissue, and the like, a gas sensor for detecting toxic gas, inflammable gas, and the like, a temperature sensor for detecting temperature, a pressure sensor of detecting pressure, and a humidity sensor of detecting humidity, but is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">As used herein, the term &#x201c;signal measuring part&#x201d; refers to an area capable of measuring a change in an electrical signal by time-gating the multiple-transit-echo wave, for example. The changed signal is detected in the output part <b>300</b>. As used herein, the term &#x201c;time gating&#x201d; refers to a technique of selecting and measuring a specific wave which exists at regular time intervals in a generated wave. The signal measuring part may detect the target bound to the sensing part using the detected signal.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">For example, when the target to be measured is contacted to the sensing part, the frequency, phase, amplitude, the number of clocks, or the like of the electrical signal are changed in the output part <b>300</b>. Thus, the signal measuring part may detect the fact that the target is contacted to the sensing part, and may qualitatively or quantitatively analyze the target.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">As used herein, the &#x201c;multiple-transit-echo wave&#x201d; refers to a wave formed such that the SAW from the input part <b>200</b> is reflected between the output part <b>300</b> and the input part <b>200</b>. The multiple-transit-echo wave may be generated when a metallic thin film of the IDT that configures the input part <b>200</b> and the output part <b>300</b> cause discontinuities of impedance and load, and the SAW is reflected by fingers of the IDT. In one embodiment, the impedance has a fixed value during the wave propagation regardless of the number of transitions of the multiple-transit-echo wave, but is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The multiple-transit-echo wave may include N multiple-transit-echo waves where N is an odd number and greater than three such as a triple-transit-echo wave or a quintuple-transit-echo wave, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0066">In the embodiment, in the case of the triple-transit-echo wave <b>500</b>, the SAW from the input part <b>200</b> is reflected by the output part <b>300</b> and moves toward the input part <b>200</b>, and reflected again by the input part <b>200</b> and moves back to the output part <b>300</b>, and then reaches the output part <b>300</b> following a main wave <b>400</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, since the triple-transit-echo wave <b>500</b> passes through the sensing part three times, influence of a medium on the triple-transit-echo wave is about three times the main wave <b>400</b> passing through the sensing part once, and a delay time is also about three times the main wave <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0067">According to the embodiment, a change in an electrical signal may be measured by time-gating, for example, the multiple-transit-echo wave such as the triple-transit-echo wave or the quintuple-transit-echo wave other than the main wave <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0068">When the multiple-transit-echo wave is used for the output signal, compared to when the main wave is used for the output signal, influence of a medium contact on the surface increases, and thus sensitivity of the SAW sensor may be further improved. Furthermore, since the output signal is proportional to the length of the delay line along which the SAW travels, in the case of time-gating the multiple-transit-echo wave, compared to the case of time-gating the main wave, substantially the same output signal may be implemented with a shorter length of the delay line. In one embodiment, the length of a delay line may be longer than one hundred times of the wavelength to have a substantially sufficient sensitivity, but is not limited thereto.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0069">In an exemplary embodiment, the triple-transit-echo wave is time-gated and then measured.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0070">In the embodiment, the signal measuring part may include an apparatus such as a network analyzer, a vector voltmeter, a frequency counter, a phase detector, or an oscilloscope, for example, but is not limited thereto. In an exemplary embodiment, the triple-transit-echo wave is time-gated using the network analyzer.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">According to another embodiment, a measurement method using a multiple-transit-echo wave is provided. The method includes converting an electrical signal into a SAW, sensing a target using the SAW, outputting a SAW corresponding to the sensed target, converting the corresponding SAW into an electrical signal, and detecting a change in the electrical signal by time-gating a multiple-transit-echo wave part. The method may further include detecting the target.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0072">First, the electrical signal is converted to the SAW which is a mechanical signal through the input IDT of the input part <b>200</b>, for example.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">A physical, chemical, or electrical reaction of the SAW may change when the sensing part is contacted to the target. For example, the frequency, phase, amplitude, the number of clocks, or the like of the output signal of the SAW may change.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0074">The changed SAW is converted into the electrical signal through the output IDT of the output part <b>300</b>, for example. If the target is contacted to the sensing part and thus the weight of the sensing part changes, the shear speed of the SAW excited by the input IDT may change.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0075">Then, the multiple-transit-echo wave is time-gated, and a change in frequency, phase, amplitude, or the number of clocks of the electrical signal is measured. In this manner, it is possible to precisely detect a physical property of the target such as pressure, rotator force, shock, tensile force, gravity, mass, evaporation, biochemistry, temperature, humidity, freezing, viscosity, displacement, liquidity, light sensing, optic angle, acceleration, abrasion, or contamination, for example, but is not limited thereto. Further, it is possible to analyze the target qualitatively or quantitatively.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">When the multiple-transit-echo wave is used for the output signal, compared to the case when the main wave is used for the output signal, the sensitivity of the SAW sensor may be further improved.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0077">When the triple-transit-echo wave is used, the influence of medium contacting the surface on the output signal is theoretically about three times higher than that of the case using the main wave. Therefore, the sensitivity of the SAW sensor may be substantially improved about three times when the triple-transit-echo wave is used. Further, since influence of a medium contacting the surface on the quintuple-transit-echo wave may be five times higher than that of the case with the main wave, the sensitivity of the SAW sensor using the quintuple-transit-echo may be substantially improved about five times. However, it is not limited to the theory.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0078">In the case of conducting measurement using the multiple-transit-echo wave, compared to the case of using the main wave, the output signal with a substantially same sensitivity may be obtained with a shorter length of the delay line.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">For example, in the case of the triple-transit-echo wave, the length of the delay line may be reduced to about one-third (&#x2153;) compared to the case of the main wave. Similarly, in the case of the quintuple-transit-echo wave, the length of the delay line may be reduced to about one-fifth (&#x2155;).</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">According to the embodiment, an increased number of sensors may be integrated on the substrate of substantially the same size when the multiple-transit-echo wave is used in the SAW sensor for measuring, and thereby the manufacturing cost for each SAW sensor may be significantly reduced.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">Hereinafter, the exemplary embodiments and experimental examples of the invention will be described in further detail. However, they are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0008" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<heading id="h-0009" level="1">Time Domain Measurement of SAW</heading>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">An electrical signal having a frequency of about 400 Megahertz (MHz) is applied to the SAW sensor shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 and 2</figref> through a signal generator, and a time domain of an output SAW is measured. The result is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The embodiment is demonstrated for example, and an electrical signal having any frequency may be applied to the SAW sensor. In one embodiment, an electrical single having a frequency up to about 1 Gigahertz (GHz) may be applied to the SAW sensor without a substantially large power loss.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, peaks sequentially appear on a time domain in order of an RF feed-through <b>600</b>, the main wave <b>400</b>, the triple-transit-echo wave <b>500</b>, and the quintuple-transit-echo wave <b>700</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">Since the traveling distance of the triple-transit-echo wave is three times longer than that of the main wave, the output signal of the triple-transit-echo wave has been influenced by the medium contacting the surface about three times more. Whereas the output signal of the quintuple-transit-echo wave has been influenced by the medium contacting the surface about five times more because the traveling distance of the quintuple-transit-echo wave is five times longer than that of the main wave.</p>

<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Referring to Table 3 and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, it can be seen that a phase change measured using the triple-transit-echo wave <b>500</b> increases with respect to the concentration variation of Troponin I by about three times or more compared to the case of conducting measurement using the main wave.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">From the results of the above examples, it can be seen that the sensitivity of the SAW sensor is substantially improved when the multiple-transit-echo wave is used, compared to the case of using the main wave. Therefore, the SAW sensor having substantially the same sensitivity may be designed with a shortened length of the delay line, which may significantly reduce the manufacturing cost and/or size of the sensor system because the shorter length of the delay line requires the less substrate area for each SAW sensor and integrates the increased number of SAW sensors within a predetermined substrate area.</p>
