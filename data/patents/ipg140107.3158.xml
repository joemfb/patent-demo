<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The disclosure relates to a non-volatile memory structure and a method for fabricating the same, and in particular relates to a non-volatile static random access memory (SRAM) and a method for fabricating the same.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Due to their high speeds and minimal power consumption, a static random access memory (SRAM) is an essential component of all logic, system-on-chip (SoC) and (multi-chip package) MCP components today. However, even as CMOS technology advances, transistor leakage is becoming a more significant issue, limiting the amount of power reduction from scaling. The use of a non-volatile memory component, such as a resistive random access memory (RRAM), a magnetic random access memory (MRAM), and a phase change memory (PCM), etc. would allow complete shutoff of the static random access memory (SRAM), leading to maximal reduction of leakage standby power in SRAM. Among the non-volatile memory technologies, resistive random access memory (RRAM or ReRAM) is a particularly promising non-volatile memory technology due to its low power consumption and high speed characteristics (e.g., H-Y Lee et al. IEDM 2008, 2010; P-F Chiu et al., VLSI Circuits 2010). Various designs for non-volatile SRAMs have been proposed, including a 6T2R, and 8T2R, etc., where T denotes a transistor and R denotes the resistance-based memory component within the SRAM cell. Often, the included memory components are connected between a transistor and a control line fabricated as a higher metal layer. This will lead to a high risk for plasma etching damage (particularly if the memory is made from oxides) from the antenna effect, as the control line will expose a much larger area to the process plasma than the memory component itself. As a result, for a successful non-volatile SRAM, it is necessary to devise a structure and corresponding manufacturing process to avoid damages thereto, as much as possible.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Thus, a novel non-volatile SRAM and a method for fabricating the same are desired.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">An embodiment of a non-volatile memory structure is provided. The non-volatile memory structure comprises a first contact connected to a first transistor.

A resistance-changing memory material, which includes a material that may switch between higher and lower resistance states, covers and contacts the second contact but not the first contact. A top electrode contacts both the resistance-changing memory material and the first contact. The area of the resistance-changing memory material is substantially larger than the area of its interface with the second contact.</p>

In alternative embodiments, SiGe, bulk semiconductor, strained semiconductor, compound semiconductor, silicon on insulator (SOI), and other commonly used semiconductor substrates can be used for the substrate <b>200</b>. The substrate <b>200</b> may have a desired conductive type by implanting P-type or N-type impurities. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, several isolation structures <b>201</b>, for example, shallow trench isolations (STIs), are formed extending from a surface of the substrate <b>200</b> into an interior of the substrate <b>200</b> as electrical isolations between various electronic devices. Next, a first transistor <b>202</b> and a second transistor <b>204</b> are respectively formed on the substrate <b>200</b>. In one embodiment, the first transistor <b>202</b> and the second transistor <b>204</b> are transistors of a non-volatile SRAM cell. Next, a dielectric layer <b>206</b> is formed on the substrate <b>200</b>, covering the first transistor <b>202</b> and the second transistor <b>204</b> by a deposition method, for example, a spin-coating method, a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method, a physical vapor deposition (PVD) method or a plating method. Next, a photolithography process and an anisotropic etching process are performed to move a portion of the dielectric layer <b>206</b>, so that first and second contact holes <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> are formed through the dielectric layer <b>206</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a source/drain region <b>203</b> of the first transistor <b>202</b> is exposed from a bottom of the first contact hole <b>208</b>, and a source/drain region <b>205</b> of the second transistor <b>204</b> is exposed from a bottom of the second contact hole <b>210</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Next, a conductive material (not shown), such as tungsten (W), aluminum (Al), copper (Cu) or silicides, is filled into the first and second contact holes <b>208</b> and <b>210</b> using a PVD process. Next, a planarization process, for example, a chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) process is performed on the conductive material to remove unnecessary portions of the conductive material above the top surface <b>207</b> of the dielectric layer <b>206</b>, so that first and second contacts <b>212</b> and <b>214</b> are formed through the dielectric layer <b>206</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the first contact <b>212</b> is connected to the first transistor <b>202</b>, and the second contact <b>214</b> is connected to the second transistor <b>204</b>. Due to the planarization process, a top surface <b>213</b> of the first contact <b>212</b> and top surface <b>215</b> of the second contact <b>214</b> are both aligned to the top surface <b>207</b> of the dielectric layer <b>206</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, a resistance-changing memory material <b>216</b> is then deposited by a deposition method, for example, an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method, covering both the first and second contacts <b>212</b> and <b>214</b>. In one embodiment, the resistance-changing memory material <b>216</b> may comprise a RRAM oxide such as HfO<sub>2</sub>. In one embodiment, the resistance-changing memory material <b>216</b> may be formed by a single layer. In another embodiment, the resistance-changing memory material <b>216</b> may be formed by depositing additional layers, including serial resistance layers, whose resistance may be fixed or dynamically controlled by the voltage across it. For example, the resistance-changing memory material <b>216</b> may comprise a first memory material layer <b>216</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> (e.g., HfO<sub>2</sub>) that can switch between a state of higher electrical resistance and a state of lower electrical resistance, and a second memory material layer <b>216</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> above the first memory material layer <b>216</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> whose electrical resistance can be dynamically controlled by the voltage across it (e.g., TiO<sub>2 </sub>or VO<sub>2</sub>). Alternatively, the resistance-changing memory material <b>216</b> may comprise a first memory material layer <b>216</b><i>a</i><b>1</b> that can switch between a state of higher electrical resistance and a state of lower electrical resistance (e.g., TaOx), and a second memory material layer <b>216</b><i>a</i><b>2</b> above or below the first memory material layer whose electrical resistance is fixed (e.g., TaO).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, a portion of the resistance-changing memory material <b>216</b> covering the contact to one of the transistors, for example, the first contact <b>212</b> to the first transistor <b>202</b>, is then removed by an etching process such as a plasma etching process, so that a resistance-changing memory material pattern <b>216</b><i>a </i>is formed covering and contacting the second contact <b>214</b> but not the first contact <b>212</b>. In one embodiment, the second contact <b>214</b> may serve as a bottom electrode of a final RRAM device. During the etching process of the resistance-changing memory material, no damage occurs on an interface between the second contact <b>214</b> and the resistance-changing memory material pattern <b>216</b><i>a</i>, which also serves as an active area of the final RRAM device. This is because, as the resistance-changing memory material <b>216</b> over the first contact <b>212</b> is thinned during the etching process, more plasma current tends to leak to the first contact <b>212</b>, which also presents a low-resistance path to the substrate <b>200</b> (i.e., the first transistor <b>202</b>). Also, boundaries/sidewalls <b>217</b> of the resistance-changing memory material <b>216</b> are far away from the interface between the second contact <b>214</b> and the resistance-changing memory material pattern <b>216</b><i>a</i>. Therefore, the area of the resistance-changing memory material <b>216</b><i>a </i>is substantially larger than the area of its interface with the second contact <b>214</b>. In this embodiment, the resistance-changing memory material pattern <b>216</b><i>a </i>has a planar bottom surface <b>219</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, next, a conductive material (e.g., Ti followed by TiN) (not shown) is entirely formed over the resistance-changing memory material pattern <b>216</b><i>a</i>, also covering the exposed first contact <b>212</b>. The conductive metal may be formed by a deposition method, for example, a physical vapor deposition (PVD) method, an atomic layer deposition (ALD) method or a plating method. The conductive metal is then etched by an etching process, for example, a plasma etching process, to form a top electrode <b>218</b> of a final RRAM device contacting both the resistance-changing memory material pattern <b>216</b><i>a </i>and the first contact <b>212</b>, wherein the top electrode <b>218</b> covers a top surface and a sidewall <b>217</b> of the resistance-changing memory material pattern <b>216</b><i>a</i>, thereby completing formation of one exemplary embodiment of a non-volatile memory structure <b>500</b><i>a </i>of the disclosure. During the etching process for the conductive metal, all the plasma current will go through the first contact <b>212</b> not connected to the resistance-changing memory material pattern <b>216</b><i>a</i>, since it is a much lower resistance path to the substrate <b>200</b>. Meanwhile, sidewall damage of the etching process for the conductive metal is located even further away from the interface between the second contact <b>214</b> and the resistance-changing memory material pattern <b>216</b><i>a </i>than the previous etching process for the resistance-changing memory material pattern <b>216</b><i>a. </i></p>

During the etching process of the resistance-changing memory material, no damage occurs to the interface between the resistance-changing memory material pattern and the contact connecting thereof, which also serves as an active area of the final RRAM device. Because the resistance-changing memory material over the contact not located at the active area is thinned during the etching process, more plasma current tends to leak to the contact not located at the active area, which also presents a low-resistance path to the substrate. Also, boundaries of the resistance-changing memory material are located far enough away from the active area. During the etching process for the top electrode, all the plasma current will go through the contact not connected to the resistance-changing memory material pattern, since it is a much lower resistance path to the substrate. Also, sidewall damage during the etching process for the top electrode is located even further away from the active area. Alternatively, a contact that is not located at the active area is fabricated first, and next the opening for the active area contact is subsequently formed and filled by metal to be etched back or filled by RRAM oxide directly.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The disclosure mitigates process damage from etching for both the well-known antenna effect and the sidewall damage aspects of fabrication, which directly affects device performance.
