<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application claims priority to and the benefit of Korean Patent Application No. 10-2009-0118748 filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Dec. 2, 2009, the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The described technology relates generally to an organic light emitting diode (OLED) device.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Summary of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">One embodiment of this disclosure provides an organic light emitting diode (OLED) device with improved life-span by providing excellent water-proofing ability in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment, and thus minimizes contamination.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to one aspect of this disclosure, an organic light emitting diode device is provided that includes an organic light emitting diode including a first electrode, a second electrode, and an emission layer interposed between the first electrode and the second electrode; a base substrate supporting the organic light emitting diode; and a sealing member disposed on the base substrate while covering the organic light emitting diode. The sealing member includes a fluorinated epoxy sealing material including a fluorinated epoxy resin.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The fluorinated epoxy resin may include a fluorinated resin of an epoxy resin selected from the group consisting of an aromatic epoxy resin, an alicyclic epoxy resin, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The fluorinated epoxy sealing material may further include a copolymer of the fluorinated epoxy resin and a resin selected from the group consisting of a (meth)acryl-based resin, polyisoprene, a vinyl-based resin, a urethane-based resin, a cellulose-based resin, a perylene-based resin, and combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The sealing member may further include a first primer layer interposed between the fluorinated epoxy sealing material and the base substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The sealing member may be formed through a thin film-type encapsulation, method in which the front surface of the organic light emitting diode is coated with the fluorinated epoxy sealing material. The sealing member may further include an inorganic layer formed on top of the fluorinated epoxy sealing material.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The inorganic layer may include an inorganic material of silicon nitride, aluminum nitride, zirconium nitride, titanium nitride, hafnium nitride, tantalum nitride, silicon oxide, aluminum oxide, titanium oxide, tin oxide, cerium oxide, silicon oxynitride (SiON), or combinations thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Also, the sealing member may be formed through a can-type encapsulation method in which the upper surface of the base substrate on the external side of the organic light emitting diode is coated with the fluorinated epoxy sealing material. The sealing member may further include an encapsulation substrate which faces the base substrate and covers the front surface of the organic light emitting diode.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">The encapsulation substrate may be glass, a polymer thin film, or metal.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The sealing member may further include a second primer layer interposed between the fluorinated epoxy sealing material and the encapsulation substrate.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The organic light emitting diode device according to one embodiment may have an improved life-span by having excellent water-proofing ability in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment and thus minimizes contamination, and it may be applied not only to a small display device but also a large-area display device as well.</p>

<p id="p-0026" num="0025">An organic light emitting diode (OLED) device, which is a type of flat panel display device, is encapsulated through a can-type encapsulation method using metal or glass or a thin film-type encapsulation method using an inorganic material or an organic material.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">The can-type encapsulation method using metal or glass includes preparing a base substrate with an organic light emitting diode formed therein and an encapsulation substrate formed on top of the organic light emitting diode to protect the organic light emitting diode from being degraded, coating any one of the base substrate and the encapsulation substrate with a sealing material, laminating the base substrate and the encapsulation substrate with each other, and curing them through heat or light to adhesively fix them onto each other. The sealing material includes an epoxy resin, and the inside of the can produced by laminating the base substrate with the encapsulation substrate is filled with nitrogen. To remove moisture, a moisture absorbent such as P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, BaO, and CaO may be provided to the inside of the can.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The can-type encapsulation method has excellent barrier characteristics and is advantageous in terms of life-span of the organic light emitting diode device. However, due to difficulties in the manufacturing process, there are drawbacks such as high cost, penetration of moisture and oxygen through the sealing material, difficulty in applying the technology to a flexible display device, and difficulty in manufacturing a large-area organic light emitting diode device.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">According to the thin film-type encapsulation method using an inorganic material or an organic material, a sealing material including an epoxy resin is formed to tightly adhere onto the base substrate and the organic light emitting diode. The thin film-type encapsulation method solves most of the problems of the can-type encapsulation method. In short, since the process is simple, it is low cost and it may be applied to a flexible display device and a large-area organic light emitting diode device.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">However, the thin film-type encapsulation method still fails to solve the problem of moisture and oxygen penetration through the sealing material.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">This disclosure will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments are shown. This disclosure may, however, be embodied in many different forms and is not to be construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein.</p>

<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The following examples illustrate this disclosure in more detail. These examples, however, are not in any sense to be interpreted as limiting the scope of this disclosure.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">A glass substrate is coated with a fluorinated epoxy sealing material in a thickness of about 4 &#x3bc;m to thereby prepare a specimen.</p>
<heading id="h-0007" level="1">COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1</heading>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">A specimen is prepared according to the same method as Example 1, except that a general epoxy sealing composition is used instead of a fluorinated epoxy sealing material.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">&#x3c;Assessment of Physical Properties: Measurement of High-temperature and High-humidity Reliability&#x3e;</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">Specimens prepared according to Example 1 and Comparative Example 2 are allowed to stand at a temperature of about 80&#xb0; C. in a humidity of about 95% for about 120 hours, and then their appearances are observed. The results are as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a specimen prepared according to Example 1 for assessing reliability in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a specimen prepared according to Comparative Example 2 for assessing reliability in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref>, specimens using unfluorinated epoxy resin have a large block spot with a wide area, which indicates that organic electro-luminescence (EL) is changed. On the other hand, specimens using fluorinated epoxy resin have a small block spot with a narrow area, which indicates that the specimens using fluorinated epoxy resin have excellent water-proofing ability. Therefore, it is expected that when a sealing material for an organic light emitting display element including fluorinated epoxy resin, the reliability in a high-temperature and high-humidity environment becomes excellent and the contamination of the organic light emitting diode is minimized to thereby improve the life-span of the organic light emitting diode (OLED) device.</p>
