<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This disclosure relates in general to thermal insulation for building structures including residential or commercial buildings, such as single residential houses, condominiums, town houses, and apartment buildings as well as office buildings, plants, warehouses, retail structures, farm buildings and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">It is known to add thermal insulation to the exterior walls and roofs of building structures to reduce the heat loss or gain from the interior of the structure to the outside environment. Insulation, such as fiberglass or cellulose may be placed between the studs, joists or rafters inside walls, ceilings or roofs. Also, batt insulation or insulation blankets may be draped between and over studs, joists or rafters. For example, in the case of a roof, batt insulation may be draped over purlins and roof decking may be attached to the purlins with the batt insulation being compressed between the roof decking and the purlins. Additionally, insulation, such as polystyrene panels, may be placed over the studs, joists or rafters of the exterior of walls or roofs before the application of an exterior finish, such as an exterior siding or roofing.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">In the past, &#x201c;cold bridges&#x201d; formed across insulation panels between the interior of a structure and the exterior environment and was a serious problem creating localized areas of large heat loss or gain. Especially in colder climates, cold bridges through exterior insulation panels attached to the exterior of building structures under siding and shingles has been a serious source of heat loss driving heating costs and localized material damage, for example from condensation causing corrosion, mold, or rot.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Typically, in the past, rigid insulation, such as polystyrene panels, was attached to the exterior of cold formed steel (CFS) and wood studs. Such polystyrene panels typically do not maintain enough stiffness to allow the attachment of exterior finishes such as wood, synthetic or composite siding, or an exterior veneer such as brick, stone, or the like, directly to the polystyrene panels. Exterior finishes and veneers require fasteners attached through the polystyrene panels to the support structure to support the exterior finishes or veneers. The fasteners themselves may act as thermal conductors to form &#x201c;cold bridges.&#x201d; Moreover, these fasteners, which are typically case hardened and not meant to be in bending, typically cantilever through the rigid insulation panels creating openings, particularly over time, in the insulation panels allowing passages, air flow, and moisture transfer. Cold bridges, thus formed, also allow for corrosion and mold to form within the building structure in addition to heat loss.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">What has been needed is an exterior insulation panel, especially in more generally hot or cold climates, that inhibits, if not eliminates &#x201c;cold bridges&#x201d; in such structures, substantially reduce if not eliminate water condensation in the insulation panel and the building structure, and can functionally support exterior finishes and veneers.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Disclosed is an insulation panel that may be used in the construction industry to provide more energy efficient building structures in both cold and hot weather environments by inhibiting &#x201c;cold bridges&#x201d; through the panel between the interior and exterior surfaces. The construction insulation panel comprises a main body formed of a first polymer having an exterior surface and an interior surface forming the opposite major surfaces of an insulating panel; and a mounting structure formed of a second polymer having a higher tensile strength and more rigidity than the first polymer. The mounting structure comprises at least one interior support member adapted to be positioned adjacent the interior surface of the main body, at least one exterior support member adapted to be positioned adjacent the exterior surface of the main body, and a plurality of spaced apart cross members extending between the interior support member and the exterior support member each having at least a virtual or an actual passage adapted to receive a first fastener adapted to fastening the mounting structure to a building structure under compressive loading. As used herein, the term &#x201c;compressive loading&#x201d; is intended to include the application of force upon a relatively compressible material where the material is physically compressed and deforms, or the application of force upon a more rigid material where the material is under physical stress, or a combination of both. In any case, the mounting structure is at least partially disposed within the main body and forms with the main body an insulating panel adapted to be fastened to a building structure and to support an exterior finishing material fastened at the exterior surface of the main body of the insulating panel to inhibit cold bridging.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The mounting structure may have a webbing between cross members so the webbing with the mounting structure forms a truss member. The web may be formed with the cross members as an imbedded truss. In either of the alternatives, the mounting structure may be fully disposed or partially disposed within the main body as desired in the particular embodiment. The mounting structure may be full encapsulated by the main body or a portion of the mounting structure may extend outside the main body. Accordingly, the mounting structure may be encapsulated in the main body or part of the either the interior surface or exterior surface, or both.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The cross members of the insulating panel may have virtual or actual passages therein shaped to cause the insulating panel to be place under compressive loading when fastened by first fasteners to a building structure. Such passages may be all virtual or actual preformed passages. The exterior portions of the first fasteners may be generally flush with or recessed from the exterior surface of the main body when positioned to fasten the insulating panel to a building structure.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The mounting structure may be one interior support member and one exterior support member, e.g., positioned substantially aligned to a building frame structure when the panel is installed, or a plurality of interior support members and a plurality of exterior support members spaced apart and coordinated to support the insulation panel and exterior finish material when fastened on a building structure. For example, the support members of the mounting structure may be spaced apart a distance corresponding to the spacing of wall studs or other building members in a building structure. In any case, the exterior support member is typically adapted to receive a second fastener capable of supporting an exterior building material to the insulating panel. Additionally, the insulating panel may be adapted to accommodate openings in buildings, such as windows or doors. As such, the insulating panel may be cut, trimmed, framed and/or fastened especially for desired windows, doors and other building openings in the desired embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The insulating panel may also have alignment markings disposed on the exterior surface (on the main body and/or the exterior member of the mounting structure) to indicate the location of the cross members and passages therein to facilitate fastening of the insulating panels to a building structure and/or to indicate the location of the exterior support member to facilitate fastening of a exterior finish material to the insulation panel.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">The main body of the insulating panel may include a UV-absorbing additive or have a UV-absorbing coating on the exterior and/or interior surface. The main body of the insulating panel may additionally or alternatively may include an antioxidant additive or coating on the exterior and/o interior surface.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The insulating panels may have at least some of the edge portions off-set so that adjacent panels may be assembled in a building structure overlapped laterally to provide strength and inhibit cold bridges between insulating panels. Additionally, each insulating panel may have a multi-piece mounting structure to adjoin upwardly and downwardly with edge portions of adjacent insulating panel having concave and convex rounded edge portions on opposite edge portions along their length so as to nest within the panel to avoid cold bridging between insulating panels. Alternatively the configuration of such adjoining edge portions may be of any desired complimentary configuration suitable to avoid cold bridging between adjoining edge portions of adjacent insulating panels.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A film adapted to provide durability to the insulating panel may be applied to the exterior surface or interior surface, or both, The durable film may have a pre-applied adhesive or an adhesive applied as the film is applied to the exterior surface and/or the interior surface. The film may provide sufficient strength to the insulating panel that the insulating panels may support workers when the insulating panels are in place on a building structure. This film may be particularly helpful where the insulating panels are adapted to be use as sub-roofing over purlins or roofing rafters.</p>

<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">Referring now to the drawings, there is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> a series of construction insulation sheets or panels <b>10</b> installed on the exterior portion of a building structure <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the construction insulating panel <b>10</b> includes a main body <b>14</b> made of a first polymer and having an exterior surface <b>36</b> and interior surface <b>37</b> forming opposite major surfaces of insulating panel <b>10</b>. The first polymer may be polystyrene, e.g. an extruded polystyrene foam such as Styrofoam&#xae;, polyurethane, polyisocyanurate, or other suitable polymer material. There is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> a mounting structure <b>16</b> and formed of a second polymer having a higher tensile strength and rigidity than the first polymer. The second polymer may be a thermoplastic, such as polypropylene, polystyrene, polyethylene, polyvinylchloride (PVC), or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), or other polymer material. The relative thickness of the main body <b>14</b> may be selected as desired to provide an amount of thermal insulation and/or vapor barrier for the particular embodiment.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">The mounting structure <b>16</b> includes an exterior support member <b>18</b>, an interior support member <b>20</b> and cross-members extending there between. The exterior support member <b>18</b> and the interior support member <b>20</b> may be contiguous members positioned adjacent and along the exterior and interior surfaces of the main body <b>14</b> of the insulating panel <b>10</b>, or a plurality of exterior support members <b>18</b> and the interior support members <b>20</b> spaced apart adjacent and along the exterior and interior surfaces of the main body <b>14</b> of the insulating panel <b>10</b>. In any event, exterior support member <b>18</b> and interior support member <b>20</b> are adapted to provide support for the insulating panel when secured to a building structure with first fasteners <b>30</b> through cross-member <b>22</b> to attach the insulating panel <b>10</b> to the building structure under compressive loading, and finishing exterior materials are attached to the exterior surface of the insulating panel with second fasteners <b>38</b>. A plurality of cross-members <b>22</b> extends between the support exterior support member(s) <b>18</b> and the interior support member(s) <b>20</b> each having at least a virtual passage adapted to receive first fasteners <b>30</b> adapted to fasten the mounting structure <b>16</b> and in turn the insulating panel <b>10</b> to a building structure under compressive loading. Between the exterior and interior support members <b>18</b> and <b>20</b> and cross-members <b>22</b> may be a web <b>24</b> forming a truss <b>26</b>, optionally with cross members <b>22</b> and exterior and interior support members <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>, disposed wholly or partially in main body <b>14</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">Alternatively, the mounting structure <b>16</b> may be formed as separate pieces <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>which are joined together in an assembly of mounting structure <b>16</b> and installation of the insulating panel <b>10</b>. For example, the separate pieces <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>may couple together by mechanical fastening mechanisms, such as screws or slots and tabs, or by chemical bonding, such as adhesives or plastic welding.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Web <b>24</b> may be provided as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 3A</figref> as part of the mounting structure <b>16</b>, with a number of triangular shaped apertures in the mounting structure <b>16</b>. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3A</figref>, adjoining edge portions of mounting structure pieces <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>may be formed to provide a complementary facing structure. Further, the pieces of mounting structure <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>may be configured as separate interlocking pieces <b>16</b><i>a </i>and <b>16</b><i>b </i>that may, for example, snap together at male and female tabs <b>17</b><i>a </i>and <b>17</b><i>b </i>to form mounting structure <b>16</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref>. It is to be understood, that the web <b>24</b> may be in the form of any suitable shaped apertures. To illustrate, webs <b>24</b> may be oval shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3B</figref>, hexagon shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3C</figref>, diamond shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3D</figref>, circle shape as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3E</figref>, or square, rectangle, pentagon, hexagon, or other conic sections, quadrilateral or polygon shape as desired. Alternatively, the mounting structure <b>16</b> may have a solid web as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5 and 6</figref>, in a variety of embodiments, the mounting structure <b>16</b> may be fully disposed within the main body <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the mounting structure <b>16</b> may be at least partially disposed within the main body <b>14</b>. In any case, where the cross-members <b>22</b> are generally disposed within the main body <b>14</b>, the web <b>24</b> optionally with cross-members <b>22</b> and exterior and interior support members <b>18</b> and <b>20</b>, forms a truss <b>26</b> embedded in the main body <b>14</b>. In such a case, during manufacture, the material forming the main body <b>14</b> may be delivered in a foam or fluid state into and through the web <b>24</b> of mounting structure <b>16</b>, and then allowed to solidify or cure in place. Alternatively, the exterior support member <b>18</b> and/or the interior support member <b>20</b> may be contiguous with or part of the exterior surface <b>36</b> and interior surface <b>37</b> of the main body <b>14</b> of the insulating panels <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">As noted, the cross members <b>22</b> in the mounting structure <b>16</b> includes at least virtual passages <b>28</b> extending between the exterior support member(s) <b>18</b> and interior support member(s) <b>20</b> to provide for support of insulating panels with installation of first fasteners <b>30</b>, with the interior support member(s) <b>20</b> attached to the building structure to fasten the insulating panel <b>10</b> to a building structure under compressive loading. Virtual passages are such that openings may be formed there through in the cross member <b>22</b> as first fasteners <b>30</b> are extending through the cross member. Alternatively, the passages <b>28</b> may be all ready formed partial or complete openings in the cross members <b>22</b>. In any case, the first fastener <b>30</b> may be used to extend through the cross members <b>22</b> from the exterior support member <b>18</b> to and through the interior support member <b>20</b> into the building structure material (such as metal or wood stud <b>32</b>), mounting the insulating panel <b>10</b> under compressive loading to the portion of the building structure <b>12</b>, such as cold formed steel (CFS) studs or wood studs. Additionally, it is to be understood that the insulation panel <b>10</b> may be mounted to a cement based building such as concrete masonry units (CMU) or concrete block with any appropriate fasteners as first fasteners <b>30</b>. In any event, the compressive loading may be provided as the first fastener <b>30</b> is seated, or when the first fastener <b>30</b> is secured in place, or both. The level of compressive loading, and when and how it is provided, is dependent on the fastener style of first fastener <b>30</b>, building structure and its composition, and the degree of support needed for any materials fastened by second fasteners <b>38</b> to the insulating panel <b>10</b> in the particular embodiment</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The cross member <b>22</b> may be formed in suitable geometry, such as a polygon as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A and 4B</figref>. The cross member may have passages <b>28</b> formed there though such as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A</figref>, <b>4</b>C, and <b>4</b>E, or may have virtual passages <b>28</b> such as indicated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4B</figref>, <b>4</b>D and <b>4</b>F. Additionally the cross members <b>22</b> may be formed in any suitable size such as relatively large cross members <b>22</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>, or a relatively small cross member <b>22</b>, as show in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">Each cross member <b>22</b> and at least a virtual passage <b>28</b> therein may be shaped to cause the insulating panel to be place under compressive loading when fastened by first fasteners <b>30</b> to a building structure. The passages <b>28</b> are adapted such that an exterior end <b>34</b> of each of the first fasteners <b>30</b> is generally flush with the exterior surface <b>36</b> of the main body <b>14</b> when the first fastener <b>30</b> is received in the passages <b>28</b> for mounting of the insulating panel <b>10</b> to the building structure, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref>, or as shown in the alternative installation in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5A and 5B</figref>. Alternatively, the passages <b>28</b> may be adapted such that the exterior end <b>34</b> of the first fastener <b>30</b> is recessed below the exterior surface <b>36</b> of the main body <b>14</b> when the first fastener <b>30</b> is received in the passage <b>28</b> for mounting of the insulating panel <b>10</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, or alternatively as shown in other installations in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6A and 6B</figref>. In any case, the first fasteners will experience less thermal effects from the environment that an exposed fastener to conduct heat or cold through the insulating panel <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054">The insulating panel <b>10</b> is adapted to be fastened to building structures by first fasteners <b>30</b>, and either interior or exterior building materials, such as finishes like wood, synthetic or composite siding may in turn be fastened to the insulating panel <b>10</b> with second fasteners <b>38</b>. Additionally, an exterior veneer, such as brick, stone or similar exterior building sections, may be fastened to the insulating panel <b>10</b>. The mounting structure <b>16</b> is designed to support a siding load with second with fasteners through the mounting structure <b>16</b> while inhibiting cold bridging. Because of the higher tensile strength and rigidity of the second polymer forming the mounting structure <b>16</b>, as compared to the that of the first polymer forming the main body <b>14</b>, and the compressive loading on fastening with the first fasteners <b>30</b>, the mounting structure <b>16</b> is able to withstand the force(s) exerted by second fasteners <b>38</b> in such a manner as to substantially reduce hole elongation and other effects upon the insulating panel <b>10</b>, as compared to prior insulating panels. This assembly inhibits if not eliminate the formation of cold bridges through the insulating panels, on installation of the insulating panels and an exterior finishing material on the exterior surface of the main body <b>14</b>. In this example, the mounting structure <b>16</b> facilitates attachment without a thermal bridge between the exterior surface and interior surface of the insulating panel.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">As best shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the exterior support member <b>18</b> is adapted to receive the second fastener <b>38</b> for supporting an exterior finishing building material or section <b>40</b> on the insulating panel <b>10</b>. In the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, the exterior building section <b>40</b> includes a brick veneer <b>42</b> attached with a brick tie <b>44</b> to the mounting structure <b>16</b> of the insulating panel <b>10</b>, such as with the second fasteners <b>38</b> to exterior member <b>18</b>. However, by selection of embodiment of the insulating panel <b>10</b>, any suitable exterior finishing material may be supported to the insulating panel <b>10</b> with the mounting structure <b>16</b> and second fasteners <b>38</b>. For example, a stone facade or facade of other material may be supported to the insulating panel <b>10</b> in a similar manner as the brick veneer <b>42</b>. Wood, synthetic or composite siding may be supported to the insulating panel <b>10</b> by second fasteners <b>38</b> that secure the siding to the mounting structure <b>16</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">Additionally, the main body <b>14</b> of the insulating panel <b>10</b> may include a UV-absorbing additive or have a UV-absorbing coating on the exterior surface <b>36</b> and/or the interior surface <b>37</b> to avoid degradation of the insulating panel <b>10</b> from exposure to UV radiation, such as sunlight. Additionally or alternatively, the insulating panel <b>10</b> may include an antioxidant additive or have an antioxidant coating on the exterior surface to avoid degradation from oxidation, such as by exposure to the atmosphere. For example, the additives may be mixed with or included in the polymers that make up the main body <b>14</b>. Alternatively, the additives may be applied to the exterior surface <b>36</b> of the insulating panel <b>10</b> after fabrication.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">During installation, an insulating panel <b>10</b> may be fastened to the portion of a building structure <b>12</b> by insertion of first fasteners <b>30</b> through passages <b>28</b> in the cross members <b>22</b> and into the building structure. The exterior end <b>34</b> of the first fastener <b>30</b> may be generally flush with the exterior surface <b>36</b> of the insulating panel <b>10</b> or exterior end <b>34</b> of the first fastener <b>30</b> may be disposed below the exterior surface <b>36</b> of the insulating panel <b>10</b>. As additional insulating panels <b>10</b> are fastened to the portion of a building structure <b>12</b>, the insulating panels <b>10</b> may be connected by clips <b>46</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, and as will be explained further below. The construction insulating panel may also have at least some of the lateral edge portions of the insulating panels overlap so that adjacent panels on a building structure may be overlapping to further reduce the risk of cold bridges through the insulating panels and to provide for added strength. Additionally, the insulating panels may be formed to overlapping upward and downward at edges portions with corresponding rounded concave and convex edges for more secured fit and nest with like insulating panels positioned above and below.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Exterior building materials <b>40</b> may engage the insulating panels <b>10</b> by second fasteners <b>38</b> engaging the mounting structures <b>16</b>. As shown, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> one or more alignment markings <b>48</b> may be disposed on one of the main body <b>14</b>, particularly in the case where the mounting structure <b>16</b> is largely or entirely disposed within the main body <b>14</b> as most desired to minimize heat transfer, to indicate the location of the mounting structure <b>16</b> for attachment of exterior building sections <b>40</b>. During attachment of the exterior building materials <b>40</b> the second fasteners <b>38</b> may be aligned by a respective alignment marking <b>48</b> with the mounting structure.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6C and 6D</figref>, the insulating panel <b>10</b> may be attached to the roof structure of a building, such as to a metal building frame <b>32</b><i>b </i>via purlins <b>32</b><i>a</i>. The mounting structures <b>16</b> may run laterally across to the purlins <b>32</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6C</figref>, the mounting structures <b>16</b> may run substantially parallel to the purlins <b>32</b><i>a </i>as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6D</figref>, or in any other suitable orientation.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">In any case, a variety of fasteners may be used for first fasteners <b>30</b> with the insulating panels <b>10</b>. For example the first fastener <b>30</b> in the cross member <b>22</b> may be tapered, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, flat, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, or undercut, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7C</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Also, a durable film may have a pre-applied adhesive or an adhesive applied as the film is applied on exterior surface <b>36</b> or interior surface <b>37</b>, or both. The film provided a moisture barrier and also adds durability and strength to the insulating panel. The film may provide sufficient strength to the insulating panel <b>10</b> that the insulating panels may support workers when the insulating panels are in place in a building structure. This film may be particularly helpful where the insulating panels are adapted to be use as sub-roofing over purlins</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">While examples have been explained and illustrated with regard to building sections including CFS studs, it must be understood that building types other than metal or wood buildings structures are contemplated for use with the insulating panels <b>10</b>. The higher tensile strength and rigidity of the second polymer forming the mounting structure, as compared to the tensile strength and rigidity of the first polymer forming the main body <b>14</b>, allows for the transfer of the load of the exterior building materials <b>40</b> to the building structure <b>12</b>, rather than the main body <b>14</b>. The first fasteners <b>30</b> may be seated through the mounting structures <b>16</b> to the building structure <b>12</b> with such force that the mounting structures <b>16</b> are &#x201c;pre-compressed&#x201d;, during installation of the insulating panels <b>10</b> and before attachment of the exterior building materials <b>40</b>. The main body <b>14</b> may thus rebound around the heads of the first fasteners <b>30</b> after the first fasteners <b>30</b> are installed.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0063">In any case, the insulating panels <b>10</b> may be aligned in a saw tooth overlapping fashion, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 8A and 8B</figref>, and/or staggered splice, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> and joined with clips <b>46</b> and a clip fastener <b>50</b>. Additionally, it is to be understood that the joints of adjacent panels may be treated with any appropriate sealing treatment, such as, but not limited to, caulking, taping and the like. The overlapping panels and/or the sealing treatment provide for increased resistance to cold bridges and air or moisture transfer through the insulating panels <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0064">While principles and modes of operation have been explained and illustrated with regard to particular embodiments, it must be understood, however, that this may be practiced otherwise than as specifically explained and illustrated without departing from its spirit or scope.</p>
