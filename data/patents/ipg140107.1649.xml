<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to user interface techniques and, in particular, to a technique for adjusting user's feel of operation.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Enjoying a computer game on a portable game console seems to be common, not to mention on a set-top game console. A user generally makes full use of plural input buttons to play a computer game (hereinafter, a user interface by means of button input is referred to as &#x201c;button interface&#x201d;). In recent years, with the advancements of the computer games, the button interfaces have become more complicated and make the operation of the game difficult. In addition, there is a problem that some space must be allocated for providing buttons in a small-sized game controller.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In order to address the above problem of the button interface, attention is being focused on a user interface using the movement of the game controller or the movement of the portable game console itself, as an input (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;body interface&#x201d;). For instance, an acceleration sensor built in a game controller detects the movement of the game controller. Then, the magnitude of the movement of the game controller itself is reflected on the movement of a game character. The body interface has an advantage in being intuitive and easy to understand.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 11-099284</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">It is to be noted that the body interface is not almighty. This is because the user's intention does not always correspond to the movement of the game controller. For example, a right-handed user may tend to tilt the game controller to the right. Some users are able to move the game controller in a stable manner, but others are not good at it. The inventor of the present invention found a drawback that the body interface that should convey the user's movement properly does not always convey the user's intention properly to the game.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The present invention has been made in view of the inventor's recognition of the problem, and has a general purpose of providing a body interface that can convey the user's intension appropriately.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">An aspect of the present invention provides a user interface apparatus including a sensor adapted to detect a magnitude of a movement of an object so as to convert the movement of a user's hand into an operation amount from an input device for transferring the movement of the user's hand holding a device main body as the operation amount.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">This apparatus acquires a detected value of the sensor from the input device, selects a sensitivity characteristic pattern from a plurality of sensitivity characteristic patterns different in reaction sensitivity of the operation amount with respect to the detected value, refers to the selected sensitivity characteristic pattern, and determines the operation amount corresponding to the detected value acquired.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">With such a processing method, a conversion rule for converting the detected value into the operation amount according to the detected value of the sensor is switched. This allows the adjustment of the operational sensitivity in accordance with the user's operation. The aforementioned sensitivity characteristic pattern described herein may be a data table in which the detected value and the operation amount are previously associated with each other. Alternatively, the sensitivity characteristic pattern may be a formula or rule to convert the detected value into the operation amount, in other words, algorithm.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Optional combinations of the aforementioned constituting elements, and implementations of the invention in the form of methods, processors, apparatuses, systems, recording mediums, computer programs, data structures, etc. may also be practiced as additional may also be practiced as additional modes of the present invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">The invention will now be described by reference to the preferred embodiments. This does not intend to limit the scope of the present invention, but to exemplify the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> schematically shows an execution environment of a computer game according to an embodiment of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">A game device <b>202</b> is a desktop game console. The game device <b>202</b> reads out a program for a computer game from a storage medium such as a DVD-ROM (Digital Versatile Disk-ROM) or CD-ROM, and then executes the program. A monitor <b>204</b> is a common TV monitor and connected to the game device <b>202</b>. The monitor <b>204</b> receives an image signal from the game device <b>202</b>, and displays game images. A game controller <b>200</b> serves as an input device operated by a user to play the computer game, and is connected to the game device <b>202</b>. Hereinafter, a description will be given of a racing game as an example. A user operates a user object <b>206</b>, which functions as a user's own vehicle, via the game controller <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">The game controller <b>200</b> is provided with common input buttons and a built-in acceleration sensor for sensing the movement of the game controller <b>200</b>. When the user tilts the game controller <b>200</b> forward or backward or to the left or to the right, the acceleration thereof is transferred to the game device <b>202</b> as an operating signal. In this manner, the game controller <b>200</b> is provided with both button interface functionality and body interface functionality. In the description below, however, the button interface functionality will be mainly discussed.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> schematically shows a coordinate system with the game controller <b>200</b> located at the center.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">A rectangular coordinate system composed of an x-axis, a y-axis, and a z-axis is virtually provided with the game controller <b>200</b> located at the center thereof. The rectangular coordinate system is a local coordinate system that changes its orientation in accordance with the movement of the game controller <b>200</b>. Each of the axes will now be described.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">(x-axis: Pitch)</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">When viewed from a user holding the game controller <b>200</b>, the x-axis is virtually configured to lie in a direction from left to right. &#x201c;Pitch angle&#x201d; means an angle rotating forward or backward about the x-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">(y-axis: Roll)</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">When viewed from the user holding the game controller <b>200</b>, the y-axis is virtually configured in a direction from back to front. &#x201c;Roll angle&#x201d; means an angle rotating to the right or to the left about the y-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">(z-axis: Yaw)</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">When viewed from the user holding the game controller <b>200</b>, the y-axis is virtually configured in a direction from below to above. &#x201c;Yaw angle&#x201d; means an angle rotating to the right or to the left about the z-axis.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The game controller <b>200</b> includes: an acceleration sensor for detecting accelerations of three axial directions; and a gyro sensor for detecting a rotational motion about the z-axis, namely, an angular velocity of the yawing motion. The acceleration sensor includes: a weight; a beam supporting the weight; and a piezoresistive element formed on the beam. The movement of the game controller <b>200</b> is transferred to the weight. The movement of the weight distorts the beam, and this distortion is detected as a change in the resistance value of the piezoresistive element. By use of the known piezoresistive technique, each of the accelerations in the directions of the x-axis, the y-axis, and the z-axis is respectively detected. The gyro sensor detects the rotational motion of an object, as a change in voltage of a piezoelectric vibrator. As stated, the acceleration sensor and the gyro sensor are general-purpose sensors that employ the known sensing techniques. Hereinafter, the acceleration of the x-axis direction will be referred to as &#x201c;x acceleration&#x201d;. Similarly, the acceleration of the y-axis direction and that of the z-axis direction will be referred to as &#x201c;y acceleration&#x201d; and &#x201c;z acceleration&#x201d;, respectively.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The x acceleration detected by the built-in sensor of the game controller <b>200</b> is converted into a digital value ranging from 0 to 255 (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;x acceleration value&#x201d;), and is transferred as an operating signal. The x acceleration value in the positive direction of the x-axis ranges from &#x201c;127 to 255&#x201d;, and the x acceleration value in the negative direction of the x-axis ranges from &#x201c;0 to 127&#x201d;. Y acceleration and z acceleration also have ranges in the same manner, respectively, and are transferred as y acceleration value and z acceleration value, respectively. Also, the angular velocity detected by the gyro sensor is converted into a digital value ranging from 0 to 255 (hereinafter, referred to as &#x201c;angular velocity value&#x201d;), and is transferred as an operating signal. In this manner, four types of digital values including the x acceleration value, the y acceleration value, the z acceleration value, and the angular velocity value are transferred as an operating signal which is an information relating to the body interface of the game controller <b>200</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically shows the relationship between acceleration and rotational angle.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">As shown in the figure, when the game controller <b>200</b> assumes a basic orientation, the x acceleration is 0 G, the y acceleration is 0 G, and the z acceleration is &#x2212;1 G (where G represents gravity acceleration). When the game controller <b>200</b> makes a rolling motion, the x acceleration and z acceleration increase, although the y acceleration does not change. When the rolling motion angle of the game controller <b>200</b> exceeds 90 degrees and the game controller <b>200</b> starts rotating in the reverse direction, the x acceleration starts decreasing, whereas the z acceleration further increases.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Similarly, even when the pitch angle or the yaw angle changes, the gravity applied in the x-axis direction does not change. However, when the roll angle changes, the x-axis is no longer parallel to the ground surface and the x acceleration value increases. The y acceleration value is changed by the pitching motion, although the y acceleration value is not changed by the roll angle or the yaw angle. The z acceleration value is changed by the roll angle or the pitch angle, although the z acceleration value is not changed by the yaw angle. Since it is actually difficult to specify the yaw angle based on the x, y, or z acceleration value, the yaw angle is determined based on the angular velocity value of the gyro sensor.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">With respect to the racing game described in the present embodiment, the rolling motion changes the x acceleration value to cause the user object <b>206</b> to move to the left or to the right. The roll angle simulates the rotational angle of the wheel. Also, the moving speed of the user object <b>206</b> can be adjusted by the pitch angle. The pitch angle simulates the depression amount of the accelerator or that of the brake. When the game controller <b>200</b> is tilted forward and the y acceleration is increased, it means that the accelerator is pressed and the speed of the user object <b>206</b> is accelerated. Conversely, when the game controller <b>200</b> is tilted backward and the y acceleration is decreased; to put in other words, when the y acceleration is increased in the reverse direction of y-axis, it means that the brake is pressed and the speed of the user object <b>206</b> is decelerated. The button interface such as cross buttons or what is called an analog stick is an input interface for transferring the movement of the user's finger to the user object <b>206</b>. Meanwhile, the body interface according to the present embodiment allows a user to operate the user object <b>206</b> by using the user's wrist or the user's entire body. Such user interface is more intuitive, therefore allowing the user to be absorbed in the game environment with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">In the description below, the x acceleration value and the y acceleration value will be mainly discussed, and controlling by means of the z acceleration value or the angular velocity value will not be mentioned particularly. The control method discussed below by use of the x acceleration value and the y acceleration value involves the principle that is basically same as that of the control method by use of the z acceleration value or the angular velocity value. Shooting games and flight simulation games are considered to be examples of the game type that uses not only the x acceleration value and the y acceleration value but also the z acceleration value and the angular velocity value. In a shooting game, the user interface may be configured such that the object is moved forward or backward or to the left or to the right by the x acceleration value and the y acceleration value and the direction of the gun muzzle is changed by the z acceleration value or the angular velocity value. In a flight simulation game, the user interface may be configured such that the object is made to change the orientation thereof based upon the change in the angular velocity value but the displayed position thereof is not changed.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The x acceleration value and the y acceleration value that have been detected by the game controller <b>200</b> are transmitted to the game device <b>202</b> as operating signals on a regular basis. The above acceleration values are respectively converted into an operation amount by a user interface apparatus <b>100</b>, described later, in the game device <b>202</b>. Hereinafter, the operation amount into which the x acceleration value is converted will be referred to as &#x201c;x operation amount&#x201d;. The y acceleration value, the z acceleration value, and the angular velocity value are respectively converted into &#x201c;y operation amount&#x201d;, &#x201c;z operation amount&#x201d;, and &#x201c;angular velocity operation amount&#x201d;. The operation amount is a parameter representing the magnitude of the force to be exerted on the user object <b>206</b> that is operated in the game environment. Each of the operation amounts in the present embodiment has a numeric value ranging from &#x201c;0 to 255&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">For instance, it is assumed that the game controller <b>200</b> makes a rolling motion to the right and the x acceleration value &#x201c;+190&#x201d; is detected. It is also assumed that the x acceleration value &#x201c;+190&#x201d; is converted into the x operation amount of &#x201c;+110&#x201d; according to a given conversion rule. In this case, the game software determines the moving direction of the user object <b>206</b> in accordance with the x operation amount of &#x201c;+110&#x201d;. In this manner, the movement of the main body of the game controller <b>200</b> is transferred to the user object <b>206</b>. The conversion rule for determining the operation amount based on the acceleration value is defined as &#x201c;sensitivity characteristic pattern&#x201d; described in detail with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and subsequent figures. In the above example, the x acceleration value &#x201c;+190&#x201d; is associated with the x operation amount of &#x201c;+110&#x201d; in the sensitivity characteristic pattern, as will be described later in detail.</p>

In the operation history data are stored the acceleration values and the angular velocity values for a given period of time in the past, for example, for the past three minutes.

A total of four sensitivity characteristic patterns are selected in accordance with the acceleration values and the angular velocity value. It should be understood that the sensitivity characteristic pattern selected for one acceleration value may be identical to that selected for another acceleration value. The input converter <b>124</b> refers to the sensitivity characteristic pattern selected, and determines the operation amount. That is to say, the input converter <b>124</b> converts the x acceleration value into the x operation amount, the y acceleration value into the y operation amount, and the z acceleration value into the z operation amount, respectively. Also, the input converter <b>124</b> converts the angular velocity value to an operation amount. The adjuster <b>126</b> adjusts the converted operation amount.

The content information acquiring unit <b>114</b> acquires various types of information on the game software (hereinafter, simply referred to as &#x201c;content information&#x201d;). The content information is broadly categorized into two types.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The first type includes the type of game software to be executed.

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The second type includes information generated from the computer game being executed. This corresponds to what is called a game event. For example, when the user object <b>206</b> is coming to a hairpin curve or when the moving speed exceeds a predetermined speed, the game software generates a unique game event. A stable driving may be supported in such a manner that the operational sensitivity is increased when the user object <b>206</b> moves at low speed and the operational sensitivity is decreased when the user object <b>206</b> moves at high speed. The content information acquiring unit <b>114</b> acquires the game event and the pattern selector <b>122</b> selects the sensitivity characteristic pattern in accordance with the game event.</p>

Assuming that <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5B</figref> are the operation history data obtained from an identical computer game, it is likely that the user A and the user B are greatly different in their own operational ways.

Conversely, it is not suitable for the user A who changes the x acceleration value considerably to employ the operational characteristic in which even a small change in the x acceleration value considerably influences the x operation amount.</p>

In the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the x acceleration value and the x operation amount are in direct proportion to each other. The maximum value &#x201c;255&#x201d; of the x acceleration value corresponds to the maximum value &#x201c;255&#x201d; of the x operation amount.

Hereinafter, in the sensitivity characteristic patterns, shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, of monotonically increasing functions, the range of the x acceleration value that results when the x operation amount varies from the minimum value to the maximum value will be referred to as &#x201c;actual x acceleration value range&#x201d;.

<p id="p-0068" num="0067">By comparing the above two types of the sensitivity characteristic patterns, the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is greater in the actual x acceleration value change rate than that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>.

<p id="p-0069" num="0068">The sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> may be applied to the user A, who has a wide detected x acceleration value range.

<p id="p-0071" num="0070">Alternatively, from another point of view, the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> may be applied to the user A.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0071">When the sensitivity characteristic pattern having a narrow actual x acceleration value range as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is applied to the user who moves the game controller <b>200</b> considerably like the user A, it is possible to guide the user A to reduce the movement of the game controller <b>200</b>. Since the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> permits varying the x operation amount without changing the x acceleration value considerably, the user A will change the manner of operation to narrow the detected x acceleration value range.</p>

Therefore, by applying the sensitivity characteristic pattern by which the x operation amount gradually changes with respect to the x acceleration value as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, the intention of the user B will be reflected on the operation with ease.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0073">The pattern selector <b>122</b> selects the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> in a case where the x acceleration value exceeds a give threshold value in the operation history data, or selects the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> in the other cases.

<p id="p-0076" num="0075">The sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is desirable for the user D who changes the x acceleration value slowly.

Accordingly, in the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, smallness in the actual x acceleration value change rate matches the smallness in the detected x acceleration value change rate of the user D, thereby providing more comfortable operability.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0076">The pattern selector <b>122</b> selects the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, in a case where the detected x acceleration value change rate in the operation history data exceeds a given threshold value, or selects the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> in the other cases.

However, this is not an essential condition for the sensitivity characteristic pattern. For example, the operation history data is so assumed that the x acceleration values to the right (127 to 255) tend to be greater and those to the left (0 to 127) tend to be smaller. Actually, it is desirable, in some cases, that the operation history of the x acceleration values to the right and that to the left be suitably handled separately, depending on the user's dominant arm. In such case, the pattern selector <b>122</b> may select the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> when the x acceleration value falls within &#x201c;127 to 255&#x201d;, or may select that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> when the x acceleration value falls within &#x201c;0 to 127&#x201d;. With this selection method, it is possible to select the preferable sensitivity character pattern in consideration of a user's physical feature. For a similar reason, the x acceleration value &#x201c;127&#x201d; and the x operation amount &#x201c;127&#x201d; need not be necessarily associated with each other. If a user tends to move the game controller <b>200</b> to the right, the operability will be further improved by associating a given x acceleration value greater than &#x201c;127&#x201d; with the median value &#x201c;127&#x201d; of the x operation amount.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0079">In each of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref> through <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6B</figref>, the median value in the detected x acceleration value range is substantially &#x201c;127&#x201d;. In some cases, however, the median value in the detected x acceleration value range is &#x201c;127&#x201d; or greater, or is &#x201c;127&#x201d; or smaller. The adjuster <b>126</b> may adjust the sensitivity characteristic pattern so that the median value of the x acceleration value actually detected corresponds to the median value of the x operation amount.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0080">An example is that the adjuster <b>126</b> calculates the average value of the x acceleration values during the history period as the median value of the actual x acceleration value range. It is assumed that &#x201c;150&#x201d; is the average value of the x acceleration values. Subsequently, the sensitivity characteristic pattern is displaced horizontally so that the average value &#x201c;150&#x201d; of the x acceleration values corresponds to the median value &#x201c;127&#x201d; of the x operation amount. Such adjustment permits the correspondence between the x operation amount and the x acceleration value to keep track of a change in the detected range of the x acceleration.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0081">The adjuster <b>126</b> may further adjust the selected sensitivity characteristic pattern. For example, when the x acceleration value is outside the range of &#x201c;63 to 191&#x201d; ten times or more during the history period, the pattern selector <b>122</b> selects the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. When the x acceleration value is also outside the range of &#x201c;31 to 223&#x201d; ten times or more, the adjuster <b>126</b> may enlarge the actual x acceleration value range of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> from &#x201c;63 to 191&#x201d; to &#x201c;31 to 223&#x201d;. In association therewith, the actual x acceleration value change rate will also be adjusted. That is to say, when the x acceleration value falls within the range of &#x201c;0 to 31&#x201d;, the x operation amount is set to &#x201c;0&#x201d;. When the x acceleration value falls within the range of &#x201c;223 to 255&#x201d;, the x operation amount is set to &#x201c;255&#x201d;. When the x acceleration value falls within the range of &#x201c;31 to 223&#x201d;, the x operation amount varies from 0 to 255 in direct proportion to the x acceleration value.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0082">When the sensitivity characteristic pattern is selectively changed, the correspondence of the x operation amount to the x acceleration value may not be changed instantly. It is assumed that the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> is selected to replace the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. The adjuster <b>126</b> may change from the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> to the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, gradually narrowing the actual x acceleration value range of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. Changing the sensitivity characteristic pattern slowly allows the user to get accustomed to the change in the feel of operation. The same applies to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and subsequent figures.</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0083">The adjuster <b>126</b> may vary the change speed of the sensitivity characteristic pattern in accordance with an instruction given from the application software. For example, in a scene where a user is demanded to perform a complex operation or a quick operation, the adjuster <b>126</b> changes the sensitivity characteristic pattern relatively slowly. This allows the user to gradually get accustomed to the change in the feel of operation. Conversely, in what is known as a static scene such as a menu selection screen, the adjuster <b>126</b> may change the sensitivity characteristic pattern relatively quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0084">The same applies to a calculating expression for determining the operation amount based on the acceleration value, as well as applying to the data table in which the sensitivity characteristic pattern predetermines the correspondence between the acceleration value and the operation amount. For instance, if the relation x operation amount=a&#xd7;x acceleration value+b is satisfied, one sensitivity characteristic pattern may be changed to another by gradually changing the coefficient a or the coefficient b.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0085">The pattern selector <b>122</b> is capable of selecting the sensitivity characteristic pattern in accordance with the type of game software to be executed. When the computer game to be executed is, for example, an action game requiring high operational sensitivity, the pattern selector <b>122</b> selects the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. When the computer game to be executed is a simulation game in which the operational stability is more important than the operational sensitivity, the pattern selector <b>122</b> selects the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>. When the computer game to be executed is loaded onto the memory of the game device <b>202</b>, the content information acquiring unit <b>114</b> receives the information representing the game type from the game software, and then the pattern selector <b>122</b> selects the corresponding sensitivity characteristic pattern. Which sensitivity characteristic pattern is to be selected by the game software may be communicated to the content information acquiring unit <b>114</b> expressly.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0086">The pattern selector <b>122</b> may select the sensitivity characteristic pattern in accordance with the game event. In a racing game, for instance, if a user changes a tire or suspension of the user object <b>206</b>, the pattern selector <b>122</b> may change the sensitivity characteristic pattern. With such selection method, it is possible to vary the feel of operation based upon the specification selected for the user object <b>206</b>. Also, when the user object <b>206</b> has a high moving speed, the operational sensitivity may be decreased as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, and when the user object <b>206</b> has a low moving speed, the operational sensitivity may be increased as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>. This allows the user to operate the user object <b>206</b> with ease. Since it is likely that importance is put on the straight movement of the user object <b>206</b> at high moving speed, the above selection method enables the operability to meet the user's intension.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0087"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> are shows a second example of the sensitivity characteristic pattern. In the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, when the x acceleration values falls within &#x201c;95 to 159&#x201d;, the x operation amount does not change. Such range of the x acceleration value will be referred to as &#x201c;play range&#x201d;. By providing the play range, the x operation amount is easily set at the median value &#x201c;127&#x201d;. The play range of the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is from &#x201c;111 to 143&#x201d;, which is narrower than the play range of the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0088">The sensitivity characteristic pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is more desirable for the user A with a wide detected x acceleration value range than that shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. For the user A who likes to operate considerably, it seems difficult to return the x operation amount to the neutral value &#x201c;127&#x201d; in a narrow range of the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. Meanwhile, in the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, the wide play range matches the wide detected x acceleration value range of the user A, enabling more comfortable operability.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0089">The sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is desirable for the user B. Since the detected x acceleration value range of the user B is narrow, the user B will realize the slow reaction in a wide play range of the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. Meanwhile, in the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, narrowness in the play range matches the narrowness in the detected x acceleration value range of the user B, thereby allowing more comfortable operability. As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the pattern selector <b>122</b> selects the sensitivity characteristic pattern according to the width of the detected x acceleration value range in the operation history data.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0090">The sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> is more desirable for the user C with a large detected x acceleration value change rate than that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>. For the user C who changes the x acceleration value frequently, it is easier to stabilize the operation in the wide play range of the sensitivity characteristic pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> than in the narrow play range of the sensitivity characteristic pattern as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, allowing the user C more suitable operability.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0091">The sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> is desirable for the user D who changes the x acceleration value slowly. The user D tends to operate the game controller <b>200</b> carefully, so the user D is able to control the x operation amount finely. For this reason, when the play range is wide, the user D will find it difficult to operate the game controller <b>200</b> after all. In the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the narrowness in the play range matches the smallness in the detected x acceleration value change rate of user B, enabling more comfortable operability. As described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the pattern selector <b>122</b> may select the sensitivity characteristic pattern according to the magnitude of the detected x acceleration value change rate in the operation history data.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0092">The adjuster <b>126</b> may further adjust the sensitivity characteristic pattern selected. For example, when the x acceleration value has been outside the range of &#x201c;63 to 191&#x201d; ten times or more, the pattern selector <b>122</b> selects the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>. When the x acceleration value has also been outside the range of &#x201c;31 to 223&#x201d; ten times or more, the adjuster <b>126</b> may further enlarge the play range of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> from &#x201c;111 to 143&#x201d; to &#x201c;63 to 191&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0093">The pattern selector <b>122</b> is capable of selecting the sensitivity characteristic pattern according to the type of the game software to be executed. For instance, when the computer game to be executed is an action game, the pattern selector <b>122</b> selects the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, which has a large play range and allows stable operation. Alternatively, the pattern selector <b>122</b> may select the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, giving priority to the operational sensitivity.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0094">Also, as described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, the pattern selector <b>122</b> may select the sensitivity characteristic pattern according to the game event. For example, when the user object <b>206</b> moves at high speed, the play range is to be enlarged. This can further stabilize the straight movement. Also, in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, even with the same x acceleration value, the corresponding x operation amount may be different between the direction in which the x acceleration value is increased and the direction in which it is decreased. That is to say, the operation stability can be further enhanced by setting the correspondence just like the hysteresis curve.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0095">Both of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref> are point-symmetric graphs with respect to the median value &#x201c;127&#x201d; of the x acceleration value. Similarly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, however, this is not an essential condition for the sensitivity characteristic pattern. In the play range, the x acceleration value of &#x201c;127&#x201d; is not necessarily set at the median value. For example, it is assumed that the x acceleration value to the right tends to be great and that to the left tends to be small in the operation history data. In this case, the operability will be improved by shifting the play range rightward to, for example, &#x201c;107 to 171&#x201d;. The adjuster <b>126</b> may adjust the correspondence of the sensitivity characteristic pattern dynamically, by determining the size and position of the play range according to the width of the detected x acceleration value range or the degree of the detected x acceleration value change rate.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0096">Instead of selecting one of the sensitivity characteristic patterns shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref>, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, any two or more sensitivity characteristic patterns may be selected and combined. For example, the pattern selector <b>122</b> may select the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7B</figref> and that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref>, and then the adjuster <b>126</b> may superimpose the two sensitivity characteristic patterns to normalize the range of the x operation amount to &#x201c;0 to 255&#x201d;. Such processing method permits generating a newly created sensitivity characteristic pattern, in which characteristics of plural sensitivity characteristic patterns are reflected.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0097"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref> show a third example of the sensitivity characteristic pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0098">Unlike <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, the x operation amount in the play range slightly varies in the sensitivity characteristic pattern shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>. The play range is not limited to the range in which the x operation amount does not change at all in spite of the change in the x acceleration value as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8B</figref>, and may be a range in which the change in the x operation amount slows down as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9B</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0099"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> show a fourth example of the sensitivity characteristic pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0100">As described with relation to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref>, etc., the x acceleration value and the x operation amount may be in a proportional relation, whereas the change rate of the x operation amount may be smooth. The increase rate of the x operation amount is small near the x acceleration value &#x201c;127&#x201d; in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref>. In contrast, the change rate thereof is large in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>. It is desirable for the user A who changes the x acceleration value considerably to apply the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> in which the x operation amount slowly changes, and it is desirable for the user B who changes the x acceleration value little by little to apply the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> in which the x operation amount changes quickly.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0101">For the user C who changes the x acceleration value frequently, it is desirable to apply the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> in which the x operation amount slowly changes. In addition, for the user D who changes the x acceleration value slowly and stably, it is desirable to apply the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref> in which the x operation amount changes quickly. It should be understood that the pattern selector <b>122</b> may select any one of the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10A</figref> and that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10B</figref>, according to the type of the computer game to be executed or the game event.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0102"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> and <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> show a fifth example of the sensitivity characteristic pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0103">In the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> and that of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref>, the x operation amount and the x acceleration value do not necessarily correspond to each other on a one-to-one basis. In the graph of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref>, the correspondence between the x acceleration value and the x operation amount presents a waveform. For instance, the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11A</figref> may be applied to a game in which the user object <b>206</b> in a small boat is operated. Since it is difficult to set the x acceleration value for outputting a desired x operation amount, it is possible to provide the feel of operation of maintaining the balance of the user object <b>206</b> while moving the game controller <b>200</b> to the left and to the right. This causes the user to experience loose footing.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0104"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11B</figref> shows the situation in which the sensitivity characteristic pattern represented by a solid line and that represented by a dotted line are switched on a regular basis. The feel of operation that can amuse a user can be expressed in a more realistic manner by dynamically switching plural sensitivity characteristic patterns over the time. Such feel of operation may be available, when the pattern selector <b>122</b> arbitrarily selects the plural types of the sensitivity characteristic patterns. Alternatively, such feel of operation may also be available, when the adjuster <b>126</b> dynamically adjusts the correspondence between the sensitivity characteristic patterns. For example, the dynamically changing feel of operation is available, when the adjuster <b>126</b> increases or decreases the x operation amount on a regular basis in the range from +110% to +90% in the selected sensitivity characteristic pattern.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0105">As stated heretofore, the relation between the x acceleration value and the x operation amount is discussed. The relation between the y acceleration value and the y operation amount, and relation between the z acceleration value and the z operation amount are also determined by selecting the sensitivity characteristic pattern, respectively. Those three types of the sensitivity characteristic patterns may be commonly provided, or may be individually provided. The structure of human wrist makes it easier to change the roll angle of the human wrist considerably than to change the pitch angle thereof. For this reason, a more comfortable feel of operation is obtainable by heightening the operational sensitivity of the y acceleration value and lowering the operational sensitivity of the x acceleration value.</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0106"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> is a graph showing how the relation between the x acceleration value and the x operation amount is changed in accordance with the y acceleration value.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0107"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> shows how the correspondence between the x acceleration value and the x operation amount varies with respect to the y acceleration value. For instance, when the y acceleration value is 255 and the x acceleration value is 255, the x operation amount is 255. When the y acceleration value is 255 and the x acceleration value is 0, the x operation amount is 0. That is to say, the actual x acceleration value range falls within &#x201c;0 to 255&#x201d;. Meanwhile, when the y acceleration value is 127 and the x acceleration value is 191, the x operation amount is 255. When the y acceleration value is 127 and the x acceleration value is 63, the x operation amount is 0. That is to say, the actual x acceleration value range falls within &#x201c;63 to 191&#x201d;. In this way, the pattern selector <b>122</b> may select the sensitivity characteristic pattern having a different actual x acceleration value range based on the y acceleration value.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0108">When the y acceleration value and the x acceleration value are both near 127, in other words, when the game controller <b>200</b> assumes the basic orientation, it is easy for the user to tilt the game controller <b>200</b>. However, the user feels relatively constrained as the user tilts the game controller <b>200</b> forward considerably and then rolls the game controller <b>200</b>. Therefore, when the y acceleration value is large or small, the operation in the direction of making a rolling motion is easily stabilized by enlarging the actual x acceleration value range.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0109">Particularly in a racing game, when the y acceleration value is large and the moving speed of the user object <b>206</b> is high, the stability of the straight movement of the user object <b>206</b> is supported by enlarging the actual x acceleration value range in consideration of operability.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0110">In contrast, the actual x acceleration value range occurring when the y acceleration value is &#x201c;255&#x201d; may be narrower than that occurring when the y acceleration value is &#x201c;127&#x201d;. With such processing method, the operational sensitivity in a constrained orientation can be increased more than that in the basic orientation. Which actual x acceleration value range is selected at which y acceleration value may be determined in accordance with the type of the computer game to be executed or the execution status thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0111">It is assumed that the user tilts the game controller <b>200</b> forward considerably in an application for moving an operation target in a three-dimensional space (e.g., in operating an object such as an airplane or submarine that can be navigated in three dimensions). At this time, it can be said that the user's &#x201c;will to move the operation target straight ahead&#x201d; is represented as &#x201c;considerable forward tilt of the game controller <b>200</b>&#x201d;. In this case, the movement to the left or to the right is not important for the user, or it can even be considered that it is undesirable for the user, as compared to the forward movement of the operation target. Therefore, the operability in which the user's intension is reflected is achieved by reducing the operational sensitivity with respect to the roll angle as the pitch angle of the game controller <b>200</b> becomes larger. With such processing method, the operability can be provided in such a manner that the user's intension speculated from a first operation amount is taken into consideration to adjust the operational sensitivity with respect to a second operation amount.</p>

<p id="p-0126" num="0125">In the present embodiment, the description is given of the process for determining the operation amount based upon the acceleration value; however, the present invention is not limited thereto.

Alternatively, the roll angle or the pitch angle may be detected from the x acceleration value, the y acceleration value, and the z acceleration value, according to the principle described with reference to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The rotation value converter <b>128</b> converts the yaw angle, the pitch angle, the roll angle, into digital values ranging from &#x201c;0 to 255&#x201d;, respectively, based upon the x acceleration value, the y acceleration value, the z acceleration value, and the angular velocity value. The sensitivity characteristic pattern may be a pattern for defining the correspondence between the above rotational angles and the operation amount. In this case, the input converter <b>124</b> refers to the calculated roll angles and the sensitivity characteristic pattern to determine the operation amount. In this way, the operation amount may be determined based upon the rotational angle specified from the acceleration value, instead of the acceleration value detected by the sensor of the game controller <b>200</b>. In the case of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref>, the correspondence between the rolling motion angle and the operation amount may be adjusted in accordance with the magnitude of the pitching motion angle.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0126">In the interface such as a joystick, the movable range of the joystick is physically limited. Meanwhile, in the body interface in which the movement of the game controller <b>200</b> is the input, there is no substantial physical limitation. Therefore, there is the possibility that a user moves the game controller <b>200</b> in an excessively large amount. By changing the sensitivity characteristic pattern, the user is made to recognize the range in which the game controller <b>200</b> is moved implicitly and is guided for optimal operation.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0127">Adjusting the sensitivity characteristic pattern with the above various factors provides the user with the operability suitable for the user, the content type, or the execution status. An additional benefit is that, even if the detection accuracies of the sensors included in the game controller <b>200</b> change over time, the change is automatically corrected. In the present embodiment, the description is given of the game controller <b>200</b> to be connected to the game device <b>202</b>; however, the tilt of the main body of the portable game device may be detected. Also, in the present embodiment, the acceleration values, the angular velocity value, and the magnitude of the rotational angle of the game controller <b>200</b> are detected; however, the input into the body interface is not necessarily limited to the acceleration value or the tilt. The operational sensitivity control method described in the present embodiment is applicable to a case where a magnetic sensor detects the position in a space so as to determine the operation amount with the detected position being the input.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0128">In the present embodiment, the description is mainly given of the sensitivity characteristic pattern having a given form; however, the operational sensitivity may be adjusted by the sensitivity characteristic pattern represented in a free-form curve such as Bezier curve or NURBS curve, as a modification. In addition, the operational sensitivity may be changed by varying the variable that determines the free-form curve, for example, the control point in the Bezier curve.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0129">In the present embodiment, the description is given that the sensitivity characteristic pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7A</figref> is suitable for the input pattern of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5A</figref>; however, it should be understood what type of sensitivity characteristic pattern is to be assigned to what type of input variable may arbitrarily be set in accordance with the design principle.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0130">The description of the invention given above is based upon an embodiment. The embodiment is illustrative in nature and various variations in constituting elements and processes involved are possible. Those skilled in the art would readily appreciate that such variations are also within the scope of the present invention.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0131">The function of an input unit described in the scope of claims is performed by the x input unit <b>132</b> or the y input unit <b>136</b> in the present embodiment. A detected value described in the scope of claims is mainly represented as the acceleration value and the rotational value in the present embodiment.</p>
