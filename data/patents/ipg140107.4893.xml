<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">Optoelectronic modules, such as optoelectronic transceiver or transponder modules, are increasingly used in electronic and optoelectronic communication. Some modules can be plugged into a variety of host networking equipment. Modules typically communicate with a printed circuit board of a host device by transmitting electrical signals to the printed circuit board and receiving electrical signals from the printed circuit board. These electrical signals can then be transmitted by the module outside the host device as optical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">Multi-source agreements (MSAs), such as the C Form-factor Pluggable (CFP) MSA and the Quad Small Form-factor Pluggable (QSFP) MSA, specify, among other things, housing dimensions for modules. Conformity with an MSA allows a module to be plugged into host equipment designed in compliance with the MSA.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Optical signals are typically generated within a transmitter optical subassembly (TOSA) of a module using a laser, such as a vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) or a distributed feedback (DFB) laser. As data rates in modules increase, two or more lasers are often included in a single TOSA. However, as MSAs specify increasingly smaller module housing dimensions, there is less available space for multi-laser TOSAs within the module housing. In addition, multi-laser TOSAs are often relatively expensive and often suffer from relatively high optical loss.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY OF SOME EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">In general, example embodiments of the invention relate to multi-laser transmitter optical subassemblies (TOSAs) for optoelectronic modules. At least some example multi-laser TOSAs disclosed herein exhibit a relatively low size, cost, and optical loss, thus enabling relatively improved overall performance of the optoelectronic modules into which the TOSAs are integrated.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">In one example embodiment, a multi-laser TOSA includes first and second lasers configured to generate first and second optical signals, respectively, a polarization beam combiner (PBC), first and second collimating lenses positioned between the first and second lasers, respectively, and the PBC, a half waveplate positioned between the first laser and the PBC, and a focusing lens. The half waveplate is configured to rotate the polarization of the first optical signal. The PBC is configured to combine the first and second optical signals and transmit the combined first and second optical signals toward the focusing lens.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In another example embodiment, an optoelectronic transceiver module includes a printed circuit board, a receiver optical subassembly (ROSA) in electrical communication with the printed circuit board, and a multi-laser TOSA in electrical communication with the printed circuit board. The multi-laser TOSA includes first and second lasers configured to generate first and second optical signals, respectively, a PBC, first and second collimating lenses positioned between the first and second lasers, respectively, and the PBC, a half waveplate positioned between the first laser and the PBC, and a focusing lens. The half waveplate is configured to rotate the polarization of the first optical signal. The PBC is configured to combine the first and second optical signals and transmit the combined first and second optical signals through the isolator toward the focusing lens.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In yet another example embodiment, a multi-laser TOSA includes first, second, third, and fourth lasers configured to generate first, second, third, and fourth optical signals, respectively, a first PBC, first, second, third, and fourth collimating lenses positioned between the first, second, third, and fourth lasers, respectively, and the first PBC, a first half waveplate positioned between the first and second collimating lenses and the first PBC, a focusing lens, and a second PBC positioned between the first PBC and the focusing lens. The first half waveplate is configured to rotate the polarization of the first and second optical signals. The first PBC is configured to combine the first and third optical signals. The first PBC is also configured to combine the second and fourth optical signals. The second half waveplate is configured to rotate the polarization of the combined second and fourth optical signals. The second PBC is configured to combine the combined first and third optical signals and the combined second and fourth optical signals and transmit the combined first, second, third, and fourth optical signals toward the focusing lens.</p>

<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Example embodiments of the present invention relate to multi-laser transmitter optical subassemblies (TOSAs) for optoelectronic modules. At least some example multi-laser TOSAs disclosed herein exhibit a relatively low size, cost, and optical loss, thus enabling relatively improved overall performance of the optoelectronic modules into which the TOSAs are integrated.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">Reference will now be made to the drawings to describe various aspects of example embodiments of the invention. It is to be understood that the drawings are diagrammatic and schematic representations of such example embodiments, and are not limiting of the present invention, nor are they necessarily drawn to scale.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">1. Example Optoelectronic Module</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Reference is first made to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> which discloses an example optoelectronic module <b>100</b> for use in transmitting and receiving optical signals in connection with a host device (not shown). The module <b>100</b> is one environment in which example embodiments of the invention can be practiced. As disclosed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the module <b>100</b> includes various components, including a bottom housing <b>102</b> configured to mate with a top housing (not shown), a receive port <b>104</b> and a transmit port <b>106</b> defined in the bottom housing <b>102</b>, a printed circuit board (PCB) <b>108</b> positioned within the bottom housing <b>102</b>, a receiver optical subassembly (ROSA) <b>110</b>, and a TOSA <b>112</b>.

It is understood, however, that the TOSA <b>500</b> may alternatively include an odd number of lasers.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">The use of PBCs in each of the example multi-laser TOSAs disclosed herein enables the combination of multiple optical signals with relatively low optical loss. The size and cost of the example multi-laser TOSAs disclosed herein are also relatively low compared to prior art multi-laser TOSAs. One reason for the relatively low size and cost of the example multi-laser TOSAs disclosed herein is that fewer and generally less expensive components are used in the example multi-laser TOSAs disclosed herein. For example, many prior art multi-laser TOSAs require N&#x2212;1 filters and N&#x2212;1 minors, where N is the number of lasers in the TOSA. However, in the example multi-laser TOSAs disclosed herein, the use of the PBCs completely eliminates the need for filters and minors in the example multi-laser TOSAs <b>200</b>, <b>200</b>&#x2032;, <b>300</b>, <b>300</b>&#x2033;, <b>300</b>&#x2032;&#x2033;, <b>400</b>, <b>400</b>&#x2032;, and <b>400</b>&#x2033; and reduces the need by half for filters and minors in the example multi-laser TOSAs <b>300</b>&#x2032; and <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">The use of PBCs in each of the example multi-laser TOSAs disclosed herein thus enables the example multi-laser TOSAs disclosed herein to exhibit a relatively low size, cost, and optical loss. Consequently, optoelectronic modules into which the TOSAs are integrated also exhibit relatively improved overall performance.</p>
