<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD AND BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present invention relates to novel therapeutic methods and pharmaceutical compositions for treating conditions associated with inhibition of interleukin-converting enzyme (ICE).</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Cytokines play an important role in a regulation of the immune system. Several studies indicate that variations in cytokine expression are associated with disease activity in immune mediated or inflammatory disorders, including autoimmune disorders (<i>Acta. Univ. Palacki. Olomuc., Fac. Med. </i>143: 19-29, 2000<i>; Rheumatol. </i>39: 1078, 2000<i>; J. Immunol. </i>167: 5338, 2001), trauma (surgery) (<i>Blood </i>87: 2095-2147, 1996), ischemic diseases (myocardial infarction) (<i>Acta. Univ. Palacki. Olomuc., Fac. Med. </i>143: 19-29, 2000<i>; Cell. Immunol. </i>184: 12, 1998), Alzheimer's disease (<i>Blood </i>87: 2095-2147, 1996), liver diseases (<i>Immunol. Rev. </i>174: 192-209, 2000), rheumatoid arthritis (<i>Arthritis Rheum. </i>44: 275, 2001<i>; J. Rheumatol. </i>28: 1779, 2001), obesity (<i>Shock </i>14: 253, 2000), psoriasis (<i>Arch. Dermatol. Res. </i>293: 334, 2001), and sepsis (<i>Acta. Univ. Palacki. Olomuc., Fac. Med. </i>143: 19-29, 2000<i>; Blood </i>87: 2095-2147, 1996<i>; Shock </i>16: 441, 2000<i>; J. Med. </i>31: 15, 2000).</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">The sepsis syndrome is an excessive, acute inflammatory response to a variety of noxious insults, particularly bacterial infection. The role of cytokines in the pathogenesis of sepsis is complex since both deficient and excessive immune responses have been associated with this syndrome. Pro-inflammatory cytokines are, on the one hand, required locally for effective anti-bacterial effector mechanisms (<i>J. Immunol. </i>145: 3762, 1990<i>; Nature </i>381: 75, 1996<i>; and Infect. Immun. </i>64: 5211, 1996), but on the other hand they are potentially toxic when secreted into the circulation (<i>Nature </i>330: 662, 1987<i>; J. Clin. Invest. </i>89: 1551, 1992). Therefore, the ability to inhibit the production of highly active inflammatory mediators may have a beneficial effect in controlling the development of sepsis. Patients with septic shock who died had higher levels of IL-18 than patients who survived (<i>Shock </i>14: 253, 2000).</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">IL-1&#x3b2; is crucial for the induction of fever and acute-phase response during local tissue damage; in systemic inflammation it contributes to inflammatory reaction (<i>Acta. Univ. Palacki. Olomuc., Fac. Med. </i>143: 19-29, 2000). This cytokine is important in response to tissue damage and infection, but is not required for normal development and homeostasis. Serum levels of IL-1&#x3b2; and IL-1Ra are significantly elevated in severe sepsis (<i>Acta. Univ. Palacki. Olomuc., Fac. Med. </i>143: 19-29, 2000).</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The IL-1 family of cytokines, which include IL-18 and IL-1&#x3b2;, are key hormones of the immune system. Both IL-18 and IL-1&#x3b2; are expressed and produced by various types of cells from hematopoetic and nonhematopoetic lineages, such as dendritic cells, monocytes/macrophages, microglia cells, keratinocytes, intestinal epithelial cells, etc. Recent studies emphasize the pathophysiological role of IL-18 and IL-1&#x3b2; in a variety of neurodegenerative, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, such as inflammation, hemaopoiesis and wound healing (<i>Immunol. Today </i>7: 45-56, 1986).</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Interleukin-18 is an early signal in the development of T-lymphocyte helper type 1 (Th1) responses. It acts together with IL-12 to induce various cytokines, including IFN-&#x3b3;, to activate Th1 cells. IFN-&#x3b3; is in turn responsible for inducing production of the soluble receptor protein, IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), a native down-regulator of IL-18 activity, which specifically binds IL-18 and neutralizes its biological activity in vitro and in vivo (<i>Immunity </i>10: 127, 1999).</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">IL-18 and IL-1&#x3b3; are expressed and produced in an inactive form, which requires activation by protease enzymes. The protease enzymes are divided into four families, (serine-, metallo-, aspartic- and cystein-proteases) based on their catalytic residues and mechanism of action. Whereas serine proteases utilize a nucleophilic hydroxyl of the serine residue and aspartic and metalloproteases posses carboxylates as active functionalities, the cysteine proteases have an active-site thiol-nucleophile.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">The caspase enzymes (Cysteine Aspartic-Specific Proteases) are a family of intracellular cysteine endopepetidases, which cleave their substrates after aspartate residues (<i>Ann. Rev. Immunol. </i>17: 781-828, 1999). The caspases are divided into two classes, based on the lengths of their N-terminal prodomains. Caspases-1,-2,-4,-5,-8, and -10 have long prodomains; and caspases-3,-6,-7, and -9 have short prodomains.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">Caspase 1, which is also known and referred to herein, interchangeably, as interleukin-&#x3b2;-converting enzyme (ICE), is expressed as a proenzyme of 45 kD in many tissues (<i>J. Clin. Immunol. </i>19:1, 1999). Upon stimulation, it undergoes activation by proteolytic cleavage. Active ICE is a tetramer of two non-identical subunits p10 and p20 in 2:2 proportion, which is uniquely responsible for cleaving pro-interleukin-113 (31 or 33 kD), into mature interleukin-1&#x3b2; (IL-1&#x3b2;)(17.5 kD), which consists of the C-terminal 153 residues of the inactive form; and pro-IL-18 (24 kD), which is cleaved at Asp35, into the biologically active 18 kD form (<i>J. Immunother. </i>25: S4-S11, 2002; <i>Nature </i>386: 619, 1997<i>; Science </i>275: 206, 1997). The active cytokine is then released by a non-standard mechanism, since unlike the case with most secretory proteins, the precursor lacks a signal sequence and is not associated with membrane-bound compartments (<i>J. Exp. Med. </i>167: 389-407, 1988).</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">ICE therefore plays an important role in physiological processes mediated by IL-1&#x3b2; and IL-18.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">Various tellurium compounds have been described in the art as having immunomodulating properties. A particularly effective family of tellurium-containing compounds is taught, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,752,614; 4,761,490; 4,764,461 and 4,929,739, whereby another effective family is taught, for example, in a recently filed U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 60/610,660, which are all incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein. The immunomodulating properties of this family of tellurium-containing compounds is described, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,962,207, 5,093,135, 5,102,908 and 5,213,899, which are all incorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">One of the most promising compounds described in these patents is ammonium trichloro(dioxyethylene-O,O&#x2032;)tellurate, which is also referred to herein and in the art as AS101. AS101, as a representative example of the family of tellurium-containing compound discussed hereinabove, exhibits antiviral (<i>Nat. Immun. Cell Growth Regul. </i>7(3):163-8, 1988<i>; AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses. </i>8(5):613-23, 1992), and tumoricidal activity (<i>Nature </i>330(6144):173-6, 1987<i>; J. Clin. Oncol. </i>13(9):2342-53, 1995<i>; J. Immunol. </i>161(7):3536-42, 1998).</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">It has been suggested that AS101, as well as other tellurium-containing immunomodulators, stimulate the innate and acquired arm of the immune response. For example, it has been shown that AS101 is a potent activator of interferon (IFN) in mice (<i>J. Natl. Cancer Inst. </i>88(18):1276-84, 1996) and humans (<i>Nat. Immun. Cell Growth Regul. </i>9(3):182-90, 1990<i>; Immunology </i>70(4):473-7, 1990<i>; J. Natl. Cancer Inst. </i>88(18):1276-84, 1996.)</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">It has also been demonstrated that AS101 induces the secretion of a spectrum of cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-&#x3b1;, and that macrophages are one main target for AS101 (<i>Exp. Hematol. </i>23(13):1358-66, 1995). AS101 was also found to inhibit IL-10 at the m-RNA level, which may cause an increase in IL-12 and IFN-&#x3b3; (<i>Cell Immunol. </i>176(2):180-5, 1997<i>; J.

<p id="p-0018" num="0017">AS-101 has also been shown to have protective effects against lethal and sublethal effects of irradiation and chemotherapy (<i>Blood </i>85: 1555, 1995<i>; J. Nat. Cancer Inst. </i>88: 1276, 1996<i>; In. J. Cancer </i>86: 281, 2000<i>; J. Immunol. </i>156: 1101, 1996<i>; J. Immunol. </i>145: 1507, 1990<i>; Cancer Res. </i>51: 1499, 1991).</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">Moreover, AS101 can inhibit activity of STAT3 (Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3) via IL-10 inhibition (<i>Cancer Res. </i>64: 1843, 2004). When binding of IL-10 to the IL-10 receptor occurs, receptor-associated Janus activated kinase (Jak) tyrosin kinases are activated and stimulate downstream signaling. One of the main transcription factors being activated is STAT3. Activated, phosphorylated STAT3 is translocated to the nucleus and regulates specific gene expression (<i>J. Immunol. </i>155: 1079, 1995). One of the target genes for STAT3 is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (<i>Clin. Cancer Res. </i>8: 945, 2002; <i>Oncogene </i>21: 2000, 2002<i>; Oncogene </i>22: 319, 2003). This factor recently was found to be responsible for IL-18 induction (<i>Cancer Res. </i>64: 304, 2004). Moreover, recently it was found that IL-1&#x3b2; alone (<i>Cancer Sci. </i>94: 244, 2003) and together with oncostatin-M (<i>Oncogene </i>22: 8117, 2003) induces up to sevenfold higher VEGF expression due to their mutual influence on STAT3. The ability of AS101 to down-regulate STAT3, may contribute to the overall inhibitory effect.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">Furthermore, it was found that although AS101 shows no inhibition of serine, metallo, and aspartic proteases, it inhibits cysteine proteases, via a catalytic thiol oxidation (<i>Inorg. Chem. </i>37: 1704-1712, 1998).</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In addition to its immunomodulatory effect, AS101 is also characterized by low toxicity. Toxicity tests have shown that LD50 values in rats following intravenous and intramuscular administration of AS101 are 500-1000 folds higher than the immunologically effective dose.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Hence, while the prior art teaches various primary and secondary roles of tellurium-containing compounds such as AS101 as immunomodulators, it fails to teach the involvement of tellurium-containing compounds in inhibition of caspase-1/IL-1&#x3b2;-converting enzyme (ICE).</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">In view of the findings that a myriad of medical conditions is associated with ICE, there is a widely recognized need for and it would be highly advantageous to have, novel agents that are capable of inhibiting ICE and hence can be beneficially utilized in the treatment of such conditions.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0066" num="0067">The present invention is of methods and compositions comprising tellurium-containing compounds for inhibition of interleukin-&#x3b2;-converting enzyme (ICE).</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0068">The principles and operation of the compositions and methods according to the present invention may be better understood with reference to the accompanying descriptions.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0069">Before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details set forth in the following description or exemplified by the Examples. The invention is capable of other embodiments or of being practiced or carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein is for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0070">As used herein, the phrase &#x201c;tellurium-containing compound&#x201d; encompasses any compound that includes one or more tellurium atoms and exhibits immunomodulating properties.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0071">The phrase &#x201c;immunomodulating properties&#x201d; includes any effect of the compound on the immune response of a subject. Exemplary immunomodulating properties can be manifested, for example, by an effect on cytokines secretion, interleukins production, lymphocytes function, and the like.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0072">While conceiving the present invention, it was postulated that since AS101 can interact with cysteine, affecting thiol oxidation, AS101, as well as other related tellurium-containing compounds may have an effect on ICE, and as a result on two known substrates of ICE, IL-18 and IL-1&#x3b2;.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0073">As shown in the Examples section below, while reducing the present invention to practice it was shown, using substrate specific enzymatic assay, that treatment of caspase-1 with AS101 inhibits enzymatic activity in a concentration dependent manner (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). It was further shown that in freshly isolated human PBMC stimulated with <i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>Cowan strain, AS101 inhibits IL-18 as well as IL-1&#x3b2; secretion (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>). Moreover, it was shown that AS101 inhibits intracellular levels of mature IL-18 in stimulated human keratinocytes (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0074">In order to ensure that the inhibitory effect is mostly due to the direct caspase-1 inhibition at posttranslational level, IL-18 mRNA levels were examined. It was found that AS101 exerts no inhibitory effect at the IL-18 mRNA level (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>), indicating a post-transcriptional mechanism of action.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0075">It was further demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of AS101 does not involves NO and IFN-&#x3b3;, two possible down regulators of IL-18 production. Nitric Oxide (NO) has previously been shown to modulate cysteine proteases activity through S-nitrosylation of their active site cysteine (<i>Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. </i>962: 42-52, 2002). AS101 has been found to be able to produce endogenous NO (<i>Parasite Immunol. </i>18: 297, 1996<i>; Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. </i>1010: 659, 2003). It was therefore postulated that the direct effect of AS101 on caspase-1 and the ability of AS101 to enhance NO levels might have a synergistic effect on caspase-1 inhibition.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0076">In order to examine whether the elimination of NO will abrogate AS101 activity of IL-18 inhibition, the effect of L-NAME, nitric oxide synthase inhibitor was studied. It was surprisingly found, when used in PBMC, that the inhibitory effect of AS101 on IL-18 secretion was not diminished after using L-NAME.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0077">IL-18 production has a self-regulating negative feedback loop. This cytokine can down regulate its own production by inducing the production of a native inhibitor, IL-18BP, through an IFN-&#x3b3; dependent mechanism. Since AS101 has been previously shown to increase IFN-&#x3b3; due to the direct inhibition of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1&#x3b2;, studies were carried out to determine whether the inhibitory effect of AS101 results from induction of IL-18BP directly and/or whether neutralization of IFN-&#x3b3; would abrogate the inhibitory effect of AS101 on IL-18. It was found that AS101 treatment was not able to induce IL-18 production in human HaCat keratinocytes and neutralization of IFN-&#x3b3; in PBMC does not abrogate IL-18 inhibition by AS101 (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>), implying that IFN-&#x3b3; does not play a role in this inhibitory effect of AS101.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0078">Organ injury observed in sepsis is due to the explosive release of cytokines into the plasma. Two of the known cytokines produced during this highly inflammatory reaction are IL-18 and IL-1&#x3b2;. The implications of AS101 inhibition of caspase-1 in vivo and the role of such inhibition in septic shock were therefore considered. In a model of sepsis, mice were treated with AS101 at various concentrations 2 hours following LPS injection. It was shown that AS101 down regulates IL-18 and IL-1&#x3b2; serum levels (see, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>) and increases survival (see <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>).</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0079">At this relatively early point stage of inflammation, there is a rise of inflammatory response mediators, including TNF-&#x3b1;, IL-18, IL-1&#x3b1;, IL-1&#x3b2;, IFN-&#x3b3;. It is therefore suggested that the immunomodulator, AS101, which known for its Th1 response induction via inhibition of IL-10, can also modulate the inflammatory response through a new mechanism of action.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0080">On one hand, moderate inflammation can provide protection against invading pathogens, and it has been shown that AS101 can induce IFN-&#x3b3;, IL-1&#x3b1; and other proinflammatory cytokines. On the other hand, AS101 is capable of attenuating and modulating this response by inhibiting the inflammatory products of ICE, IL-18 and IL-1&#x3b2;.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0081">It is known that the family of cysteine proteases operates in a cascade mechanism, involving first initiators, then effectors. This mechanism of action is well known during apoptotic responses, but it has been found recently that ICE also requires &#x201c;initiators&#x201d;, in particular, caspase-11 and -4, in order to become active (<i>Ann. Rev. Immunol. </i>17: 781-828, 1999). Inhibition of IL-18 and IL-1&#x3b2; maturation in vitro and in vivo by AS101 may be due not only to its effect on caspase-1, but also partly due to its effect on other caspases which are required for the recruitment of ICE.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0082">The data presented herein suggest that AS101, as well as related tellurium-containing compounds, may contribute a significant role in balancing the immune response in many pathophysiological conditions, via inhibition of the caspase-1 (ICE) enzyme.</p>

<p id="h-0013" num="0000">Caspase-1 Activity Enzymatic Assay:</p>
<p id="p-0250" num="0251">DTT, which is present in the commercial enzyme solution, interacts with AS101 and thus would interfere with the inhibition studies. Therefore removal of DTT from the enzyme solution prior to the enzymatic assay was necessary. Gel permeation chromatography was carried out at 4&#xb0; C. 50 &#x3bc;l solution of commercial activated rCaspase-1 was loaded on a 1&#xd7;15 cm Sephadex G-15 column (Pharmacia), preequilibrated with assay buffer containing: 50 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, 0.1% CHAPS, 1 mM EDTA, 10% Glycerol at pH 7.4. The enzyme was eluted with the same buffer (degassed) at 0.5 ml/minute and 500 &#x3bc;l fractions were collected. The enzyme-substrate reaction was measured continuously with 1 min. intervals for a total time of 1 hour at 30&#xb0; C. and was read at 405 nm. The total volume of the reaction was 100 &#x3bc;l and contained as following: 50 &#x3bc;l rCaspase-1 (0.8 U/&#x3bc;l), 25 &#x3bc;l colorimetric substrate (Ac-YVAD-pNA, 200 &#x3bc;M), 25 &#x3bc;l of AS101 at various concentrations (2.5 &#x3bc;M, 5 &#x3bc;M, 10 &#x3bc;M) in assay buffer.</p>

<p id="h-0015" num="0000">RNA Extraction and IL-18 RT-PCR:</p>
<p id="p-0252" num="0253">Total RNA was prepared from treated or non treated human keratinocytes by using Tri-reagent (Sigma Aldrich, Rehovot, Israel).

<p id="p-0254" num="0255">Inhibition of Caspase-1/IL-1-&#x3b2;-Converting Enzyme (ICE) by AS101 in a Concentration-dependent Manner:</p>
<p id="p-0255" num="0256">AS101 was tested for its possible inhibitory activity towards a member of the cysteine protease family, caspase-1 (ICE-Interleukin-&#x3b2;-converting enzyme). The enzymatic reaction was carried out with caspase-1 specific colorimetric substrate, Ac-YVAD-pNA, and in the absence or the presence of AS101 at different concentrations. The enzyme activity was tested for 1 hour and measured at 405 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0256" num="0257">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, measurement of enzymatic activity, expressed as percent residual enzymatic activity, shows that AS101 inhibits ICE activity directly, in a concentration-dependant manner. 0 &#x3bc;M in the graph represents enzyme activity in the absence of AS101, as a positive control. Caspase-1 specific inhibitor (Ac-YVAD-CHO) was added at the concentration of 0.1 &#x3bc;M as an internal control for the assay (data not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0257" num="0258">*p&#x3c;0.05 decrease vs caspase-1(0), **p&#x3c;0.01 decrease vs caspase-1 (0). Results represent means&#xb1;SE of two experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0258" num="0259">Inhibitory Effect of AS101 on the Extracellular Levels of SAC-induced Secretion of Active IL-18 and IL-1&#x3b2; by PMBC:</p>
<p id="p-0259" num="0260">In order to determine whether AS101 is capable of inhibiting two ICE substrates, IL-18 and IL-1-&#x3b2;, SAC (<i>Staphylococcus aureus </i>Cowan strain) was used as a bacterial antigen which can stimulate PMBC to produce and secrete these two highly active inflammatory cytokines. PBMC (2.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml) were treated with various concentrations of AS101 and after 1 hour were stimulated with SAC (10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>V/V). Results represent means&#xb1;SE of three experiments **p&#x3c;0.05 decrease vs SAC; *p&#x3c;0.01 decrease vs SAC. Optimal concentration of SAC for cytokine secretion stimulation was 10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>v/v (data not shown).</p>
<p id="p-0260" num="0261">Treatment with AS101 was shown to decrease SAC-induced secretion levels of IL-18 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref><i>a</i>) and IL-1-&#x3b2; (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>) after 24 hours, in a concentration dependent manner. The decrease in IL-18 and IL-&#x3b2; secretion is significant starting from 0.5 to 1 &#x3bc;g/ml (p&#x3c;0.05) and 1.5 to 2 &#x3bc;g/ml (p&#x3c;0.01).</p>
<p id="p-0261" num="0262">Inhibitory Effect of AS101 on Intracellular Levels of LPS and PMA Induced Active Form of IL-18 in Human HaCat Keratinocytes:</p>
<p id="p-0262" num="0263">IL-18 is constitutively produced by keratinocytes after treatment with LPS or PMA. In order to determine whether the inhibitory effect of AS101 on the formation of the active form of IL-18 is consistent and will repeat itself in another type of cell culture, Western Blot analysis of total cellular proteins from human HaCat keratinocytes was performed using anti-IL-18 antibodies. Concentrations of PMA (10 ng/ml) and LPS (50 ng/ml), were optimal for IL-18 production.</p>
<p id="p-0263" num="0264">Cultured keratinocytes (1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml) were preincubated for 2 hours with AS101 (1 &#x3bc;g/ml) and then treated with PMA or LPS. Expression of IL-18 was assessed by WB analysis while &#x3b1;-tubulin was used as internal control. Each line was loaded with 30 &#x3bc;g of total proteins from human keratinocytes that were either untreated (control) or treated with PMA (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>a</i>) or LPS (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>b</i>) and treated with AS101 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref><i>c</i>).</p>
<p id="p-0264" num="0265">The results show that pretreatment of keratinocytes with AS101 (1 &#x3bc;g/ml) using optimal concentrations of PMA and LPS, produced a decrease in the amounts of the active form of IL-18. These data are representative of three different experiments.</p>
<p id="p-0265" num="0266">Effect of AS101 on mRNA Levels of IL-18 in HaCat Cells:</p>
<p id="p-0266" num="0267">In order to establish whether inhibition of IL-18 production is exerted at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, the effect of AS101 on mRNA IL-18 levels was examined, under experimental conditions similar to those of the previous experiment.</p>
<p id="p-0267" num="0268">Changes at the IL-18 mRNA level were studied when keratinocytes were pretreated with AS101 (1 &#x3bc;g/ml) using optimal concentrations of PMA (10 ng/ml) and LPS (50 ng/ml). Total RNA was isolated from whole cell lysates. GAPDH was used as internal control. Cultured keratinocytes (1&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml) were either untreated (line 1) or treated with PMA at 5 ng/ml and 10 ng/ml (line 2 and 3 respectively) and with LPS at 40 ng/ml and 50 ng/ml (line 4 and 5 respectively).</p>
<p id="p-0268" num="0269">The concentration dependent induction of IL-18 by PMA or LPS at the mRNA level is shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>a</i>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b </i>shows cultured keratinocytes either untreated (line 1) or treated with PMA (10 ng/ml) (line 2) or with LPS (50 ng/ml) (line 4) or pre-incubated for 2 hours with AS101 (1 &#x3bc;g/ml) and then treated with PMA (10 ng/ml) (line 3) and LPS (50 ng/ml) (line 5) respectively. PCR products were amplified for 29 cycles. Changes in mRNA levels were not detected whether pretreated or not with AS101 (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref><i>b</i>). These results confirm that AS101 inhibits IL-18 on a post-transcriptional level. The results show one representative experiment out of two performed.</p>
<p id="p-0269" num="0270">Role of Nitric Oxide in the Ability of AS101 to Inhibit Caspase-1 Activity and Release Mature IL-18:</p>
<p id="p-0270" num="0271">In order to examine whether the elimination of NO will abrogate AS101 activity of IL-18 inhibition, the effect of nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NAME), was studied.</p>

<p id="p-0274" num="0275">Role of IFN-&#x3b3; in the Ability of AS101 to Inhibit Caspase-1 Activity and Release Mature IL-18:</p>
<p id="p-0275" num="0276">In order to investigate the possibility that enhancement of IFN-&#x3b3; levels by AS101 might have a synergistic effect on IL-18 inhibition, rhIFN-&#x3b3; neutralizing antibody (0.1 &#x3bc;g/ml) was delivered to PBMC (2.5&#xd7;10<sup>6 </sup>cells/ml) 2 hours before AS101 (0.5 &#x3bc;g/ml). SAC (10<sup>&#x2212;3 </sup>v/v) was added 1 hour following AS101. Supernatants were collected after 24 hours and evaluated for IL-18 levels.</p>
<p id="p-0276" num="0277">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, neutralization of IFN-&#x3b3; by using anti IFN-&#x3b3; neutralizing antibodies does not abrogate IL-18 inhibition.</p>

<p id="p-0278" num="0279">Plasma Levels of IL-18 and IL-1&#x3b2; in AS101-treated Mice Following Induction of Sepsis:</p>
<p id="p-0279" num="0280">PBS (control) and AS101 at various concentrations were injected into c57BL/6J mice 2 hours following induction of sepsis by LPS (0.5 mg/mouse) treatment. 24 hours after LPS injection, mice were sacrificed and evaluated for plasma concentration of these cytokines in order to determine whether AS101 can inhibit production of IL-18 and IL-1&#x3b2; in vivo.</p>
<p id="p-0280" num="0281">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, at concentration of 5 &#x3bc;g/mouse and 10 &#x3bc;g/mouse, AS101 significantly inhibited levels of these cytokines.</p>
<p id="p-0281" num="0282">Results represent a total of 6 mice/group. **p&#x3c;0.05 decrease vs LPS, *p&#x3c;0.01 decrease vs LPS.</p>
<p id="p-0282" num="0283">Enhanced Survival of AS101-treated Mice Following Induction of Sepsis:</p>
<p id="p-0283" num="0284">In order to study the relationship between the above in vitro and in vivo results and the effect of AS101 on survival of mice following induction of sepsis, AS101 at a concentration of 10 &#x3bc;g/mouse was injected into LPS-induced septic mice at various time points after LPS (0.35 mg/mouse) treatment. Survival was monitored for 9 days.</p>
<p id="p-0284" num="0285">As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref>, it was found that treatment with AS101 had a beneficial effect when injected after sepsis induction, in comparison with AS101 treatment 24 hours before sepsis induction (data not shown). The optimal dose of AS101 was 10 &#x3bc;g/mouse, injected 6 hours following LPS and thereafter every day until the end of the experiment.</p>
