<p id="p-0001" num="0000">A method of reducing waypoints representing a path defined along a route between two endpoints. The route includes a set of critical points including the endpoints and any decision points of the route intermediate the two endpoints. One or more waypoints of the path that are distal each critical point are eliminated, while retaining waypoints that are proximal each critical point.

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This is the first application filed in respect of the present technology.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">TECHNICAL FIELD</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">The present disclosure relates generally to location based services for wireless communications devices and, in particular, to techniques for reducing the waypoints of a path for display on a wireless communications device.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Wireless communications devices such as the BlackBerry&#x2122; by Research in Motion Limited enable users to download map content from web-based data sources such as BlackBerry Maps&#x2122;, Google Maps&#x2122; or Mapquest&#x2122;. Downloaded map content is displayed on a small LCD display screen of the wireless communications device for viewing by the user. The user can pan up and down and side to side as well as zoom in or out. Due to the small display on the device and due to the limited over-the-air (OTA) bandwidth, there is a need to optimize the delivery and handling of the map data.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">With the increasing availability of wireless communications devices having onboard Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers for providing location-based services (LBS), the efficient delivery and handling of map data is increasingly important.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">When the user requests a route between starting and destination locations (that is, the end-points of the route), the server generates a path represented by a series of waypoints between the two user-defined end-points, as well as a set of directions (for example &#x201c;driving instructions&#x201d;) for following the route. Typically, the directions are associated with &#x201c;decision points&#x201d; that are located along the route, for example at each intersection or junction where the user must make a turn or take one of two or more possible roads.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">For the purposes of understanding the present description, the &#x201c;route&#x201d; refers to a sequence of roads, highways, etc. that the user must follow in order to travel between the starting and destination points. The route also provides a context for directions intended to guide the user along the route, and decision points. A &#x201c;path&#x201d; is an abstract representation of the route, which is intended to be graphically superimposed over a map display of all or part of the route, so as to assist the user in identifying and following the route. Typically, the path is represented by a set of waypoints distributed along the route. Representation of the path as a set of waypoints enables simple computation and storage of the path, and allows the path to be overlayed onto the map display with proper scaling. Normally, the set of waypoints defining the path will be downloaded to the wireless communications device as part of the data file containing the route information. In order to reduce demand for processor resources on the wireless communications device, the path is normally displayed as a series of straight line segments (otherwise known as vectors) extending between successive waypoints. The waypoints themselves will not normally be shown on the display.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">A limitation of the conventional methods is that if the path is very long, the number of waypoints may become too large to send over-the-air in a timely fashion. Therefore, if the path contains more than a maximum number of waypoints which can reasonably be transmitted over-the-air in a timely fashion, some waypoints must be removed to reduce the total number of waypoints. A disadvantage of this approach is that reducing the number of waypoints also has the effect of reducing the accuracy with which the path traces the route on a map display. While the waypoints may be accurately &#x201c;pinned&#x201d; to the actual route shown on the map display, the straight line segments of the path display will tend to deviate from the route, and this deviation will tend to increase as the curvature of the route (roads) and/or the separation between the remaining waypoints increases.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Many generalization algorithms are known which are intended to eliminate waypoints while minimizing an overall deviation of the path from the desired route. However, a route through an area with many roads (such as within a city, or at a highway interchange, for example) presents a unique problem, since it is desired that the path follow the actual roads traversed by the route as exactly as possible, even with a reduced set of waypoints. An algorithm that minimizes the overall error of the path, on the other hand, may produce a path that lies close to a road traversed by the route, but not actually on it, and this situation may persist for much of the route between the starting point and the destination point.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<i>b</i>, are maps generated by a well-known mapping service, which illustrate this problem. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>shows a portion of a route <b>2</b> in which the user is directed to exit &#x201c;Moreno Valley Freeway&#x201d; <b>60</b> and merge onto &#x201c;Riverside Freeway&#x201d; <b>91</b>. The actual route <b>2</b> is shown in dashed line. However, as can be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, the path <b>4</b>, shown in solid line, deviates markedly from the route <b>2</b>, due to the reduced set of waypoints used to define the path <b>4</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>shows a portion of a route <b>2</b> within a city, in which the user is directed from 1<sup>st </sup>avenue to the Cabrillo Freeway <b>163</b> via a series of access lanes and on-ramps. As in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, the actual route <b>2</b> is shown in dashed line. The path <b>4</b>, shown in solid line, deviates markedly from the route, due to the reduced set of waypoints. In this case, the deviation is so severe that the path display provides little useful guidance to the user, even though the overall error of the path&#x2014;measured along the entire length of the route&#x2014;has been minimized.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates another example, in which a pair of decision points <b>19</b> and <b>20</b> are shown along a route in which the user is guided onto &#x201c;Berliner Ring&#x201d; via an on-ramp. However, the path fails to follow the on-ramp, and even misses one of the decision points (<b>19</b>, <b>20</b>) altogether, due to the reduced set of waypoints.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present technology provides, in general, a method of reducing waypoints representing a path while ensuring that the path accurately follows a route in the vicinity of decision points.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">Thus, an aspect of the present technology provides a method of reducing waypoints representing a path defined along a route between a starting point and a destination, the path including one or more decision points. In accordance with the present method, the total number of waypoints representing the path is reduced by eliminating one or more waypoints that are distal each decision point of the path, while retaining waypoints that are proximal each decision point.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">Another aspect of the present technology is a computer program product comprising code adapted to perform the steps of the foregoing method when the computer program product is loaded into memory and executed on a processor of a server hosting the wireless communications device.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Yet another aspect of the present technology is a wireless communications device comprising a radiofrequency transceiver for receiving data comprising waypoints representing a path defined along a route between two endpoints, the route including a set of critical points including the endpoints and any decision points of the route intermediate the two endpoints and a processor coupled to memory for eliminating one or waypoints of the path that are distal each critical point, while retaining waypoints that are proximal each critical point.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Yet another aspect of the present technology is a method of displaying a navigation path on a map displayed on a display of a wireless communications device. The method involves steps of sending a request for the navigation path to a server and receiving from the server a reduced point path representing the navigation path for a route between two endpoints the route including a set of critical points including the endpoints and any decision points of the route intermediate the two endpoints, wherein the reduced point path is generated by eliminating one or more waypoints of the path that are distal each critical point while retaining waypoints that are proximal each critical point.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> schematically illustrates a representative network in which the present technique may be employed. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, one or more wireless communications devices <b>100</b> communicate wirelessly with a mobile carrier network <b>220</b> via one or more base station towers <b>210</b>. The wireless communications devices can be wireless handhelds such as the BlackBerry&#x2122; from Research in Motion Limited, but could also be other devices with GPS capabilities such as cellular phones, wireless-enabled PDAs, wireless-enabled laptops, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">As shown by way of example in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, both private and public location-based services (LBS) can be accessed via the mobile carrier <b>220</b>. For example, public LBS can be accessed via the Network Operations Center (NOC) <b>240</b> via a firewall <b>230</b>. NOC <b>240</b> includes a relay <b>242</b>, a public MDS <b>244</b> (e.g. BlackBerry Mobile Data System&#x2122;) which is connected to one or more LBS Network Servers <b>246</b> (each having their own LBS database <b>248</b>). The relay <b>242</b> is also connected via a secure channel <b>250</b> via a firewall <b>252</b> to a Corporate Enterprise System (e.g. BES) and a Corporate MDS Server <b>256</b> which is, in turn, optionally connected to a Corporate LBS Server <b>260</b> (and its database <b>262</b>). The Corporate MDS Server <b>256</b>, in the example shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, also has an Internet connection via another firewall <b>258</b> to the LBS Network Server <b>246</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Wireless communications devices <b>100</b> issue requests for LBS (including map data) to relay <b>242</b>. These requests are passed via the secure channel <b>250</b> through firewall <b>252</b> to the corporate enterprise server <b>254</b> and corporate mobile data system (MDS) server <b>256</b>. The LBS request is then passed via firewall <b>258</b> to a public location-based service (LBS) server <b>246</b> which provides location-based services (LBS) to handle the request. The network may include a plurality of LBS servers where requests are distributed and processed through a load distributing server. The LBS data may be stored on this network server <b>246</b> or in a database <b>248</b>. Private corporate data stored on corporate LBS server(s) <b>260</b> may be added to, or superimposed on, the public data using corporate enterprise system <b>254</b> and corporate MDS server <b>256</b> on the secure return path to the wireless device <b>100</b>. Alternatively, where no corporate servers are provided, the LBS request from the wireless device <b>100</b> may be passed via relay <b>307</b> to the public MDS server <b>244</b>, which sends the request to the public LBS server <b>246</b> providing location-based services in response to the request.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Among other things, the location-based services may include mapping and routing services, including the calculation of a route between starting and destination points provided in the request, selection of decision points and associated steering directions to guide the user along the route, and determination of a path along the route, which enables the route to be highlighted on a map display showing all or part of the route. As noted above, the path will normally be represented as a series of waypoints, which can be downloaded to the wireless communications devices <b>100</b> to facilitate display. This technology can be used in conjunction with turn-by-turn GPS navigation software which not only plots the path to be taken but also shows the real-time position of the device along the path (or elsewhere on the map if the device has diverted off the navigation path).</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram illustrating principal components of a GPS-enabled wireless communications device <b>100</b>. It should be expressly understood that this figure is intentionally simplified to show only certain components; the device <b>100</b> of course includes other components beyond what are shown in the figures. The device <b>100</b> includes a microprocessor <b>102</b> (or simply a &#x201c;processor&#x201d;) which interacts with memory in the form of RAM <b>104</b> and Flash Memory <b>106</b>, as is well known in the art. The device <b>100</b> includes an RF transceiver <b>108</b> for communicating wirelessly with base stations <b>210</b>. The device <b>100</b> includes a GPS receiver chipset <b>110</b> for receiving GPS radio signals transmitted from one or more orbiting GPS satellites. In terms of input/output devices or user interfaces, the device <b>100</b> typically includes a display <b>112</b> (e.g. a small LCD screen), a thumbwheel and/or trackball <b>114</b>, a keyboard/keypad <b>116</b>, a USB <b>118</b> or serial port for connecting to peripheral equipment, a speaker <b>120</b> and a microphone <b>122</b>. In lieu of the keyboard/keypad, the device <b>100</b> may have a touchscreen for receiving user input. Map and path data are received through the RF transceiver <b>108</b>. Controlled by the processor <b>102</b>, the map and path data are then stored in RAM <b>104</b> and displayed on display <b>112</b>. In order to reduce demand on processor resources, the processor <b>102</b> will render the path as a set of straight line segments (or vectors) extending between successive waypoints. Typically, the waypoints and vectors are not annotated on the map display.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">In order to reduce the amount of data that must be transferred to the wireless communications device <b>100</b>, the public LBS server <b>246</b> implements an algorithm for reducing the number of waypoints representing the path. In accordance with the present technique, this algorithm is designed to preferentially eliminate waypoints that are remote (that is, distal) from each of the critical points of the route. In this case, the term &#x201c;critical points&#x201d; should be understood to be a generic reference to the two endpoints and any decision points of the route between the two endpoints. Thus, for example, the route <b>2</b> may be divided into segments, including proximal segments <b>6</b> encompassing each critical point (endpoint or decision point) of the route, and distal segments <b>8</b> extending between adjacent proximal segments, as may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>a</i>. Waypoints can then be eliminated from each of the distal segments <b>8</b>, while preserving the waypoints encompassed by each proximal segment <b>6</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">This arrangement enables the total number of waypoints of the path to be reduced, while at the same time preserving waypoints close to each of the critical points of the route, so that the path will accurately follow the actual route in the vicinity of each critical point of the route, as may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>. Outside of the proximal segments <b>6</b> of the route, the path may deviate from the route, and the amount of deviation may tend to increase as the separation between critical points increases, as may also be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref><i>b</i>. However, this is considered to be acceptable, because along these portions of the route, the user merely needs to follow a road they are currently on. As a result, the user does not need to rely on the path display for navigation, and errors in the path display will not cause serious problems. However, close to decision points and endpoints, where an accurate display of the path is very useful for navigation, the present technique ensures that the path display will properly trace the actual route on the map.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">As may be appreciated, various methods may be used to provide preferential elimination of distal waypoints. In some embodiments, the route may be divided into legs, each of which extends between two adjacent critical points. In this case, waypoints may be eliminated from each leg of the route, starting at the mid-point of the leg and working progressively toward the decision-points at opposite ends of the leg. In a variation on this embodiment, each leg may be weighted according to its length, so that waypoints can be eliminated from the longest legs of the route first.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In the example of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 5</figref><i>a </i>and <b>5</b><i>b</i>, the route is divided into respective proximal segments <b>6</b> associated with each critical point, and distal segments <b>8</b> spanning the gaps between adjacent proximal segments. The set of waypoints lying within the distal segments <b>8</b> can be identified as &#x201c;distal waypoints&#x201d;, and processed to reduce the total number of waypoints of the path. Various methods may be used to process the distal waypoints, such as, for example: progressively eliminating waypoints starting at the mid-point of each leg of the route, as described above: executing a conventional route generalization algorithm, for example to minimize total path error; or simply deleting all of the distal waypoints. In either case, since processing is limited to the set of &#x201c;distal waypoints&#x201d;, the &#x201c;proximal waypoints&#x201d; are preserved, and so the path accuracy in the vicinity of each critical point is retained.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Various methods may be used to define the proximal segments <b>6</b>, or, equivalently, the set of proximal waypoints. In some embodiments, a predetermined number of waypoints (for example, 5) on each side of a critical point may be selected (i.e. the proximal segment is arranged symmetrically about the critical point). In other embodiments, waypoints lying within a predetermined distance (for example 1.6 km (1 mile)) of a critical point may be selected. If desired, the predetermined number (or distance) used to select the proximal waypoints may be different on each side of a critical point (i.e. the proximal segment is arranged asymmetrically about the critical point). Thus, for example, more waypoints may be selected on the near-side of a decision point, as compared to the far-side of the decision point. With this asymmetrical arrangement, the path will more accurately follow the route (or, alternatively, provide accurate route following over a greater distance) as the user approaches the decision point than after the user has passed the critical point.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>show a flowchart illustrating principal steps in a representative process for computing a reduced waypoint path composed of each critical point and including a predetermined number (NumExtraPoints) of proximal waypoints on both sides of each critical point. In the embodiment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>, waypoints of an initial path are computed using known methods, and stored in an array called &#x201c;PathPoints[ ]&#x201d;. The waypoints may conveniently be represented by latitude and longitude coordinates, and the set of waypoints stored in the array PathPoints[ ] will typically include both critical points and waypoints between each successive critical point. It is possible that the conventional path computation algorithms may produce duplicate waypoints, and the array pathPoints[ ] may include such duplicate waypoints. The illustrated algorithm processes the array pathPoints[ ] to eliminate duplicates, as well as identify the proximal waypoints that are needed to define the reduced waypoint path which, at the completion of the algorithm, will be stored in an array called &#x201c;RedPath[ ]&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>a</i>, the algorithm starts with initializing the arrays (at S<b>2</b>), and setting respective index values of each array to 0. As noted above, the array pathPoints[ ] is preloaded with each of the waypoints computed for the route. The other arrays (TempPath[ ] and RedPath[ ]) can conveniently be set to initial values of 0.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">A waypoint is extracted from the pathPoints[ ] array and assigned to a CurrentPoint variable (at S<b>4</b>), and checked to determine whether it is a duplicate (at S<b>6</b>). Clearly, for the first selected waypoint (i.e. n=0), this check must yield a result of &#x201c;no&#x201d;, but for all successive waypoints (i.e. for n&#x3e;0) this check enables elimination of duplicate waypoints. Thus, if a duplicate waypoint is found, the index &#x201c;n&#x201d; is incremented, and the next waypoint extracted from the pathPoints[ ] array and assigned to a CurrentPoint variable as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">If the CurrentPoint is not a duplicate, then the &#x201c;previousPoint&#x201d; value is updated to equal the CurrentPoint (at S<b>8</b>), and then the CurrentPoint is checked to determine if it is the StartPoint of the route (at S<b>10</b>). If the CurrentPoint is the StartPoint, then it is assigned to the reduced waypoint path array RedPath[ ] (at S<b>12</b>), and the next waypoint is selected (S<b>4</b>) from the PathPoints[ ] array for processing.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">If the CurrentPoint is not the StartPoint, then it is loaded into the TempPath[ ] array (at S<b>14</b>), and checked (S<b>16</b>) to determine if it is a critical point of the route. As mentioned above, the &#x201c;critical points&#x201d; of the route include the endpoints (starting and destination points) as well as the decision points along the route. If the CurrentPoint is not a critical point, then the next waypoint is selected from the PathPoints[ ] array (S<b>4</b>) for processing as described above. The non-critical point need not be removed from the TempPath[ ] array; however, the non-critical point is not copied to the RedPath[ ] array. On the other hand, if the CurrentPoint is a critical point, then the TempPath[ ] array will contain the critical point (CurrentPoint) and all of the (non-duplicate) waypoints lying on the route between the previous critical point and the CurrentPoint. In this case, the relevant waypoints must be extracted from the TempPath[ ] array and added to the RedPath[ ] array.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, as an initial step, the TempPath index &#x201c;p&#x201d; is checked (at S<b>18</b>) to determine the number of waypoints stored in the TempPath[ ] array. If p&#x2266;2*NumExtraPoints+1, then all of the waypoints stored in the TempPath[ ] array must be added to the RedPath[ ] array. In the illustrated embodiment, this is accomplished by loading the waypoints TempPath[x=0 . . . p] into the appropriate fields of the RedPath[ ] array (at S<b>20</b>). At the completion of this operation, the TempPath index &#x201c;p&#x201d; is reset to zero (step S<b>22</b>) and, optionally, the values of TempPath[ ] array initialized to zero, in preparation for loading waypoints of the next leg of the route.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">In many cases, the TempPath index &#x201c;p&#x201d; will be greater than 2*NumExtraPoints+1. In such cases, it is desired to load only the first and last NumExtraPoints from the TempPath[ ] array to the RedPath[ ] array. In the illustrated embodiment, this is accomplished by first loading the waypoints TempPath[x=0 . . . (NumExtraPoints&#x2212;1)] into the appropriate fields of the RedPath[ ] array (at S<b>24</b>); and then loading the waypoints TempPath[x=(p&#x2212;(NumExtraPoints+1)) . . . p] into the appropriate fields of the RedPath[ ] array (at S<b>26</b>). At the completion of this operation, the TempPath index &#x201c;p&#x201d; is reset to zero (step S<b>22</b>) and, optionally, the values of TempPath[ ] array initialized to zero in preparation for loading waypoints of the next leg of the route. From the foregoing, it should be apparent that this method processes a number of points on each side of each critical point. These points could represent either a relatively short distance (e.g. in the case where the path is curved) or a relatively long distance (e.g. in the case where the path is straight). In a variant, though, the method could be modified to drop points that are not within a certain predetermined distance (e.g. 50 m, 100 m, etc.) of each critical point.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Once the appropriate waypoints have been loaded into the RedPath[ ] array from the TempPath[ ] array as described above, the CurrentPoint is checked (at S<b>28</b>) to determine if it is the destination endpoint of the route. If it is, then the algorithm terminates, and the RedPath[ ] array contains the complete reduced waypoint path. Otherwise, the next waypoint is selected from the PathPoints[ ] array (at S<b>4</b>), and processing continues as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">In the embodiment illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>, a number (NumExtraPoints) of points on both sides of each critical point are retained in the reduced waypoint path defined by the RedPath[ ] array. As may be seen in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>b</i>, this will result in the reduced waypoint path being characterized by straight line segments extending through each distal segment <b>8</b> of the route. In most cases, this error will be tolerable. However, in some instances, the straight line may depart so far from the actual route that it creates confusion. This issue can be overcome by modifying the algorithm of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>to permit at least some of the distal waypoints to be retained.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">One method of accomplishing this is to limit the maximum permissible angle between line segments making up the reduced waypoint path. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>c </i>illustrates an embodiment in which the algorithm of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b </i>is modified by the insertion, between steps S<b>24</b> and S<b>26</b>, of a process for checking distal waypoints. In the illustration of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>c</i>, all of the steps of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 6</figref><i>a </i>and <b>6</b><i>b</i>, including step S<b>24</b> operate as described above, and so will not be described again. At the completion of step S<b>24</b>, RedPath[r] contains the waypoint most recently added to the reduced waypoint path, which corresponds with the last &#x201c;proximal waypoint&#x201d; of the previous critical point of the route. The next nearest &#x201c;proximal waypoint&#x201d; is associated with the next critical point of the route, and is stored at TempPath[(p&#x2212;(NumExtraPoints+1))]. With this arrangement, the waypoints stored at TempPath[x=x . . . (p&#x2212;NumExtraPoints)] are distal waypoints, and it is desirable to eliminate as many of these points as possible, subject to a maximum angle limitation. Thus, at step S<b>30</b> TempPath[x] is assigned to a temporary variable (CurrPoint). A first line segment LS<b>1</b> is defined (Step S<b>32</b>) between CurrPoint and the most recently saved waypoint RedPath[r], and a second line segment LS<b>2</b> is defined between CurrPoint and the next proximal waypoint at TempPath[x=(p&#x2212;(NumExtraPoints+1))]. The angle between the two line segments is then calculated (at S<b>34</b>) and compared with a predetermined threshold (at S<b>36</b>), which may be selected as desired. If the angle exceeds the threshold, the index &#x201c;r&#x201d; is incremented (at S<b>38</b>) and CurrPoint is added into the reduced waypoint path at RedPath[r] (S<b>40</b>). If the angle is less than the threshold, the CurrPoint is discarded. This process continues until the next proximal waypoint at TempPath[x=(p&#x2212;(NumExtraPoints+1))] is reached (at S<b>42</b>), after which processing continues with step S<b>26</b> as described above.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">From the flowchart presented in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref><i>c</i>, it should be understood that this method can (optionally) involve calculating an angle subtended by a first line segment of the path extending from a current distal waypoint and a previous waypoint of the path, and a second line segment of the path extending from the current distal waypoint and a first proximal waypoint associated with a next critical point of the path. Once the angle has been calculated, the calculated angle is compared to a predetermined threshold. If the calculated angle is greater than the predetermined threshold, then the current distal waypoint is added to the path.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">As will be appreciated, the foregoing methods can be implemented as coded instructions in a computer program product. In other words, the computer program product is a computer-readable medium upon which software code is recorded to perform the foregoing steps when the computer program product is loaded into memory and executed on the microprocessor of the LBS server <b>246</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Alternatively, it is possible for the wireless communications device <b>100</b> to receive raw route or raw path data and to perform the path point reduction on the received data at the wireless device. This alternative approach is beneficial in a high-bandwidth mobile device that has a relatively low-speed processor.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">In other words, the foregoing methods can also be implemented on a wireless communications device or any other mobile device that is capable of receiving routing data and depicting a navigation path along a route between starting and destination endpoints. This wireless communications device <b>100</b> has a radiofrequency transceiver <b>108</b> for receiving data comprising waypoints representing a path defined along a route between two endpoints, e.g. starting and destination points. The route includes a set of critical points including the starting and destination endpoints as well as any decision points of the route that are between the two endpoints.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">The wireless communications device <b>100</b> further includes a processor <b>102</b> coupled to memory <b>104</b>, <b>106</b> for processing the raw data received by eliminating one or waypoints of the path that are distal each critical point, while retaining waypoints that are proximal each critical point. The resulting path has a reduced number of points without sacrificing fidelity in the vicinity of each critical point. This novel technology optimizes the delivery of useful navigation information while minimizing the amount of data that must be communicated over the air to the wireless device.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">Another aspect of this novel technology is a method of displaying a navigation path on a map displayed on a display <b>112</b> of a wireless communications device <b>100</b>. The wireless communications device <b>100</b> communicates or sends a request for a navigation path, routing instructions or map data (that may include the navigation path request) to a map server or routing server. In reply, the wireless communications device <b>100</b> receives from the server a reduced point path representing the navigation path for a route between two endpoints, the route including a set of critical points including the endpoints and any decision points of the route intermediate the two endpoints, wherein the reduced point path is generated by eliminating one or more waypoints of the path that are distal each critical point while retaining waypoints that are proximal each critical point. Therefore, this represents a novel way of efficiently obtaining useful path data for displaying a path on a map on a wireless communications device.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">In one particular variant of this implementation of the technology, the wireless communications device <b>100</b> can be configured to selectively enable this path-point reduction algorithm depending on a variety of factors (e.g. current wireless bandwidth usage) or based on user input. In other words, for example, the user can select to have full (complete) path-point data downloaded for the path or can request that the reduced path-point data be downloaded. This selection can be a setting in the map or navigation application. As another example, the path-point reduction algorithm can be automatically or intelligently activated and/or (for example) deactivated based on the level of wireless transmission activity (bandwidth usage) and/or based on the level of CPU usage of the processor onboard the wireless communications device.</p>
