<p id="p-0001" num="0000">An integrated circuit substrate is designed and fabricated with a selectively applied transmission line reference plane metal layer to achieve signal path shielding and isolation, while avoiding drops in impedance due to capacitance between large diameter vias and the transmission line reference plane metal layer. The transmission line reference plane defines voids above (or below) the signal-bearing plated-through holes (PTHs) that pass through a rigid substrate core, so that the signals are not degraded by an impedance mismatch that would otherwise be caused by shunt capacitance from the top (or bottom) of the signal-bearing PTHs to the transmission line reference plane. For voltage-plane bearing PTHs, no voids are introduced, so that signal path conductors can be routed above or adjacent to the voltage-plane bearing PTHs, with the transmission line reference plane preventing shunt capacitance between the signal path conductors and the PTHs.</p>

<heading id="h-0001" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to integrated circuit internal package interconnects, and more particularly, to a methodology and multi-layer substrate that has improved signal integrity and impedance matching.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">High-density interconnect schemes for processor packages, as well as other very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits typically use a large number of circuit layers to connect one or more dies to electrical terminals disposed on one or more surfaces of the package, as well as to interconnect multiple dies in multi-die packages.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A typical stack-up for a present-day VLSI circuit substrate is fabricated in very thin layers on one or both sides of a rigid core that provides stiffness and stability to integrated circuit substrates, which may then be encapsulated after dies are attached. The core typically includes pass-through vias that have a larger diameter than the vias used between the thin circuit layers and that pass between thin insulating layers. For example, in a substrate having a core 800 &#x3bc;m thick, the diameter of the through vias may be 500 &#x3bc;m in diameter, while the outer layer interconnects may have vias only 50 &#x3bc;m in diameter. The reason for the larger diameter holes through the core is the relative thickness of the core, which makes reliable fabrication and resin/conductive filling of the vias more difficult than for vias between the thin insulating layers in the outer circuit layers that are laminated on the core.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Since the interconnect routing density directly determines the required size of the final package, routing resources are critical in an integrated circuit package and space is at a premium. However, for critical signal paths such as clock and high-speed logic signal distribution, transmission lines must be maintained throughout the signal path in order to prevent signal degradation. Therefore, a reference voltage plane (e.g., ground) metal layer is provided on the surface of the core, with voids around the via and interconnect areas at the surface(s) of the core so that a transmission line is provided for the next signal layer above/below the core surface metal layer(s). As a result, signal path conductors must be routed around the large diameter vias passing through the core which are not connected to the metal layer. Further, the signal path conductors must also be routed away from discontinuities in the metal layers(s) caused by the voids through which the vias pass, since the lack of reference voltage plane metal will cause a change in impedance of the transmission line. Therefore, the number of signal routing channels is severely limited by the presence of the large-diameter vias that extend through the core that provide signal paths, and the large-diameter vias that provide voltage planes other than the voltage plane connected to the core surface metal layer.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">It is therefore desirable to provide a multi-layer integrated circuit, substrate and method that maintain signal integrity and impedance matching in an integrated circuit package while providing an increased amount of signal routing channels.</p>

<heading id="h-0004" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The present invention concerns integrated circuit package substrates and methods of designing and making the substrates that solve impedance matching and isolation problems associated with prior art substrates. Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a top view of a prior art integrated circuit package substrate is shown. A core dielectric layer <b>10</b> is covered by a reference voltage plane (e.g., ground or other power distribution plane) metal layer <b>11</b> through which voids <b>15</b> are provided so that the tops of plated through vias <b>12</b>B, <b>12</b>C and interconnect &#x201c;jog&#x201d; conductor stubs <b>16</b> are electrically isolated from metal layer <b>11</b>. An insulating layer <b>13</b> is disposed atop the metal layer <b>11</b> and signal conductors <b>18</b> are routed in routing channels atop insulating layer <b>13</b>. Plated through reference voltage plane vias <b>12</b>A are electrically connected to metal layer <b>11</b> and therefore have no voids disposed around their top ends. As illustrated, a very limited number of routing channels are available for signal conductors <b>18</b>, as in order to form proper transmission lines, the signal conductors are routed over continuous portions of metal layer <b>11</b>, including areas above the tops of reference voltage plane vias <b>12</b>A. Small diameter vias <b>14</b> provide for connection of signal conductors <b>18</b> to upper layers laminated above the metal layer corresponding to signal paths <b>18</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, an integrated circuit package substrate in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown. The substrate includes a core <b>30</b> including through-via conductors provided by resin-filled plated-through hole (RFPs) <b>32</b>A-<b>32</b>C. Metal layers are formed by plating, deposition or laminating on both sides of core <b>30</b> containing jog stubs <b>34</b>A-<b>34</b>C and areas of reference voltage plane layer <b>31</b>, with an insulating layer <b>35</b> laminated above stubs <b>34</b>A-<b>34</b>C and reference voltage plane layer <b>31</b>, similar to the substrate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. However, in the substrate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref>, a transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b> is laminated, or otherwise deposited, above insulating layer <b>35</b> and a second insulating layer <b>39</b> is laminated, or otherwise deposited, above transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b>. A signal layer including signal path conductors <b>38</b> that are laminated or otherwise deposited above insulating layer <b>39</b>. For each critical signal-bearing RFP <b>32</b>A, large-diameter voids <b>33</b> in transmission line reference plane metal layers <b>37</b> are provided above and below ends of signal-bearing RFPs <b>32</b>A, which substantially eliminates the shunt capacitance from signal-bearing RFP <b>32</b>A to transmission line reference plane metal layers <b>37</b>. While large-diameter voids are devoid of metal, in practice, the voids will generally be filled with dielectric, lamination adhesive or other non-conductive material. Signal-bearing RFPs <b>32</b>A are connected to signal path conductors <b>38</b> by stubs <b>34</b>A and small-diameter vias <b>36</b>A. Without large diameter voids <b>33</b>, the shunt capacitance from the ends of signal-bearing RFP <b>32</b>A to transmission line reference plane metal layers <b>37</b> will cause signal degradation. Voltage plane RFPs <b>32</b>B and <b>32</b>C (and optionally RFPs bearing non-critical signals) have no corresponding large-diameter voids in transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b>, which increases their distributed capacitance by the shunt capacitance from RFPs <b>32</b>B,<b>32</b>C to transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b>, which is generally desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">Reference plane RFP <b>32</b>B, which corresponds to the voltage plane to which transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b> is connected, has a stub <b>34</b>B connecting to transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b> through a small via <b>36</b>B. Blind vias connected to transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b> can further be used in connections to signal path layers added above the layer containing signal conductors <b>38</b>, to provide electrical connection to the particular voltage plane connected to transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b>, if needed. Therefore, no void is needed in transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b> above reference plane RFP <b>32</b>B. Other voltage plane RFPs <b>32</b>C will generally require formation of vias <b>36</b>C extending to other layers above transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b> from stubs <b>34</b>C. Small-diameter voids <b>33</b>A provide connection to other voltage plane RFPs <b>32</b>C and extend only above the ends of stubs <b>34</b>C, for signal routing channels above transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b> above the top ends (and beneath the bottom ends for layers applied beneath core <b>30</b>, not specifically shown) of other voltage plane RFPs <b>32</b>C. Thus, in contrast to the substrate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, the substrate of the present invention provides for routing of signal path conductors <b>38</b> in routing channels extending anywhere above reference plane RFPs <b>32</b>B and other voltage plane RFPs <b>32</b>C that were not available for routing signal path conductors in the substrate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The voltage plane used to provide a reference to transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b> may be a power supply voltage supplying the input/output drivers (the I/O signal reference and/or return voltage) or ground.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2B</figref>, a top view of the integrated circuit package substrate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2A</figref> is shown. Voids <b>33</b> are defined by transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b>, with additional metal removed above signal path stubs <b>34</b>A and small diameter voids <b>33</b>A for vias <b>36</b>A that connect signal path stubs <b>34</b>A to other signal layers. The resulting integrated circuit package substrate has improved isolation between signal path conductors <b>38</b> routed over the continuous portions of transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b>, while eliminating the shunt capacitance from signal-bearing RFPs <b>32</b>A to metal layer <b>37</b>. Increased routing channels are provided in the regions extending over the top ends (or bottom ends) of voltage plane RFPs <b>32</b>B and <b>32</b>C. Thus, the substrate of the present invention provides improved signal performance in signal paths, providing for higher processor or other VLSI circuit operating frequencies, while providing increased routing flexibility by providing more routing channels that can have full signal performance no matter whether signal paths are routed above core RFPs that carry power distribution and/or non-critical signals.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, an expected time domain reflectometer (TDR) display illustrating the advantages of the present invention is shown. The solid line <b>80</b> depicts a reflectometer measurement of a signal path from a signal RFP extending to a signal path, such as signal path <b>18</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. The capacitance is estimated as 0.1 pF and results in an impedance drop from 50 ohms to approximately 41 ohms. The dashed line <b>82</b> represents a TDR display of the impedance from a signal RFP to a signal path such as signal path <b>38</b> of the substrate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2A-2B</figref>. The reduction in capacitance provided by the voids <b>33</b> in transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>37</b> above signal RFPs <b>32</b>A and small-diameter vias <b>33</b>A provide a reduction in the shunt capacitance and consequent reflection, keeping the transmission line impedance of the signal path above 47 ohms.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4A-4G</figref>, a method of making an integrated circuit substrate and integrated circuit in accordance with an embodiment of the invention is shown. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4A</figref>, starting from a core dielectric layer <b>40</b> having via holes <b>41</b> formed therein, holes <b>41</b> are filled with resin/metal to form PTHs <b>42</b>. Stubs <b>44</b> and reference plane areas <b>43</b> are formed on both surfaces of core <b>40</b>, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4B</figref>. An insulating layer <b>45</b> is then applied to one or both sides of the core dielectric layer <b>40</b>, over stubs <b>44</b> as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4C</figref>. Next, insulating layer <b>45</b> is opened to generate small-diameter via holes, forming insulating layer <b>55</b>. Then, metal is added in the small-diameter via holes to form small vias <b>56</b> to connect to voltage plane RFPs as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4D</figref>. Next, a transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>58</b> with voids <b>57</b> is applied as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4E</figref>. Voids <b>57</b>, will generally be filled with dielectric insulating material or lamination adhesive as described above. Both the insulating layer <b>55</b> and transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>58</b> may be applied as laminates, or the insulating layer may be deposited and/or transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>58</b> may be plated atop insulating layer <b>55</b>. Voids <b>57</b> may be pre-formed in transmission line reference plane metal layer <b>58</b> or etched. Next, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4F</figref>, another insulating layer <b>60</b> is applied in a manner similar to that for insulating layer <b>55</b>, and small voids <b>62</b> are formed or pre-formed in insulating layer <b>60</b> for connection to signal RFPs. Finally, blind vias <b>64</b> and a signal layer <b>66</b> are formed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref> that provide electrical connection to signal RFPs. Blind vias <b>64</b> and signal layer <b>66</b> may be formed at the same time, for example, by plating, or blind vias <b>64</b> may be formed first by filling or plating and then signal layer <b>66</b> laminated or plated to connect to blind vias <b>64</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4H</figref>, an integrated circuit in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention is shown. The substrate of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref> is further modified by adding further signal layers, and optionally voltage plane layers on one or both sides of the core dielectric layer <b>40</b>. As illustrated another insulating layer <b>55</b>A and signal layer <b>66</b>A are added, but in practice, numerous other layers may be added. A semiconductor die <b>70</b> is attached to lands or other structures accessible from the top layer of the substrate shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4G</figref> and terminals or lands (not shown) may similarly be added to the bottom side of the substrate after other circuit layers are added. Alternatively, lands can be formed directly on the bottom side of core dielectric layer <b>40</b> or terminals may be attached to the bottom side of RFPs <b>42</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Referring now to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a workstation computer system <b>100</b> is shown in which the methods of the present invention are carried out in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention, according to program instructions that may be embodied in a computer program product in accordance with a present invention, for example program instructions stored on a CD-ROM disc CD. Workstation computer system includes a processor <b>102</b> for executing the program instructions coupled to a memory <b>104</b> for storing the program instructions, data and results used in designing integrated circuit substrates in accordance with embodiments of the present invention. Workstation computer system <b>100</b> also includes peripheral devices such as CD-ROM drive <b>105</b> for reading discs such as CD in order to load the program instructions into workstation computer <b>100</b>. Input devices, such as a keyboard <b>107</b>A and a mouse <b>107</b>B are coupled to workstation computer system <b>100</b> for receiving user input.
