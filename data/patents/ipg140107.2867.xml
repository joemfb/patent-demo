<?BRFSUM description="Brief Summary" end="lead"?>
<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0001">The present application is a U.S. national stage application under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;371 of International Application No. PCT/EP2007/056626 filed Jul. 2, 2007, which claims priority benefit to French patent application FR 06.06166 filed on Jul. 5, 2006, these applications being herein incorporated by reference in their entirety for all purposes.</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0002">The present invention relates to a process for preparing a seed latex of a methyl methacrylate polymer (PMMA), a PMMA seed latex, the preparation of a chlorinated vinyl polymer latex, in particular a vinylidene chloride polymer (PVDC) latex, by emulsion polymerization seeded by means of this seed and a chlorinated vinyl polymer latex.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0003">The use of a PMMA seed latex for radical polymerization in aqueous emulsion of vinylidene chloride (VDC) has long been known.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0004">Thus, Patent FR 1 466 220 describes the polymerization of VDC in aqueous emulsion in the presence of 3.63% or 3.44% by weight, expressed relative to the total weight of the monomers, of a PMMA seed latex prepared by polymerization in aqueous emulsion (Examples 4 and 5) in the absence of an emulsifier or in the presence of a very small amount (1% by weight relative to the monomers) of this emulsifier introduced at the start of the reaction, resulting in a latex of which the polymer particles are characterized by a diameter of 100 to 120 nm.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0005">However, the Applicant has observed that it may be disadvantageous for the properties of the chlorinated vinyl polymer, in particular of the PVDC and those of films produced with this, to carry out the polymerization of the VDC in the presence of a large amount of a PMMA seed latex and/or a PMMA seed latex of which the particles are characterized by too large a diameter. Therefore, there remains a need to develop a PMMA seed latex which is like the latices of a chlorinated vinyl polymer, in particular of a PVDC, prepared by polymerization seeded using this and the films prepared from these latices are characterized by improved-properties.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0006">The synthesis of a PMMA seed latex used for the polymerization of monomers other than chlorinated vinyl monomers, in particular other than VDC, is disclosed in other documents. In particular, R. F. G. Brown and C. Carr describe, in the article entitled &#x201c;Preparation of concentrated monodisperse latex dispersions of predetermined particle size&#x201d; whose reference is Surface Coatings International, Part B: Coatings Transactions, 84 (B4), 293-300, 2001 (CAS 137: 6454), the preparation of a PMMA seed latex requiring small total amounts of emulsifier (from 0.1 to 0.2% by weight relative to the monomers) introduced either at the start or at a later time, resulting in production of a seed latex of which the particles are characterized by a minimum average diameter of 73 nm. These seed latices are then used for the polymerization of (meth)acrylic monomers.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0007">Patent Application JP-A-54103498 describes the synthesis of a PMMA seed according to an in situ process in the polymerization reactor where it is used, without first being isolated, for the subsequent polymerization of (meth)acrylic monomers and the production of ultrafine latices (5 to 50 nm). This process of &#x201c;in situ&#x201d; manufacture of the PMMA seed nevertheless has various disadvantages. Thus, it is characterized by a large variability in the reaction kinetics and in the size of the seed particles. Moreover, it does not allow automation of the seed supply to the polymerization reactor, it lacks reproducibility (lack of precision in the amounts of seed latex actually used in the polymerization) and productivity (necessity of preceding each polymerization cycle by the &#x201c;in situ&#x201d; synthesis of the seed).</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0008">Finally, Patent Application JP-A-54103497 describes the synthesis of an ultrafine PMMA latex (5-50 nm) according to which the total amount of emulsifier introduced into the polymerization does not exceed 3% by weight relative to the total weight of the monomer. This document does not, moreover, indicate anywhere that the latices obtained are seed latices which may be used as a base for manufacturing at least one other latex.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0009">One subject of the present invention is therefore a process for preparing a PMMA seed latex and a process for preparing a chlorinated vinyl polymer latex, in particular a PVDC latex, by means of this seed which do not have the disadvantages of the processes of the prior art, while retaining their advantages.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0010">Firstly, one subject of the present invention is a process for preparing a PMMA seed latex by radical polymerization in aqueous emulsion of methyl methacrylate (MMA) and optionally at least one comonomer, characterized in that the following are used:
<ul id="ul0001" list-style="none">
    <li id="ul0001-0001" num="0011">(A) MMA and optionally at least one comonomer;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0002" num="0012">(B) at least one radical generator;</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0003" num="0013">(C) at least one emulsifier in a total amount of at least 4% by weight relative to the total weight of (A); and</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0004" num="0014">(D) water,
<br/>
which comprises the steps according to which:
</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0005" num="0015">(1) at least one fraction of (B), at least 2.5% by weight of (C) relative to the total weight of (A), at least one fraction of (D) and optionally at least one fraction of (A) are introduced into a reactor; then</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0006" num="0016">(2) the contents of the reactor are reacted, while continuously introducing thereinto the balance of (A), (B), (C) and (D); and</li>
    <li id="ul0001-0007" num="0017">(3) a PMMA seed latex is obtained and isolated.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0018">The expression &#x201c;radical polymerization in aqueous emulsion&#x201d; is understood to mean any radical polymerization process performed in aqueous medium in the presence of at least one emulsifier by way of surfactants and at least one radical generator. This definition specifically encompasses the so-called &#x201c;conventional&#x201d; polymerization in aqueous emulsion in which water-soluble radical generators are used, and also polymerization in microsuspension, also called polymerization in homogenized aqueous dispersion, in which oil-soluble radical generators are used and an emulsion of monomer droplets is prepared by virtue of a powerful mechanical stirring and the presence of emulsifiers.</p>

<p id="p-0147" num="0167">The distribution of the particles of the chlorinated vinyl polymer latex, as determined by hydrodynamic fractionation, is advantageously monomodal.</p>
<p id="p-0148" num="0168">The distribution of the particles of the chlorinated vinyl polymer latex is characterized, in addition, by a coefficient of variation advantageously less than or equal to 12%, preferably less than or equal to 10% and more particularly preferably less than or equal to 8%.</p>
<p id="p-0149" num="0169">The chlorinated vinyl polymer latex according to the invention is characterized, in addition, by the fact that it enables films to be produced that are advantageously characterized by the absence of microcracks.</p>
<p id="p-0150" num="0170">The films obtained are advantageously characterized by a crystallinity, after 1 day at 30&#xb0; C., measured in the manner described in the examples, less than or equal to 1.1.</p>

<p id="p-0153" num="0173">The definitions and preferences defined previously within the context of the process for preparing a methyl methacrylate polymer latex and the process for preparing a chlorinated vinyl polymer apply to the chlorinated vinyl polymer latex according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0174">In particular, the chlorinated vinyl polymer latex according to the invention is preferably a vinylidene chloride polymer latex.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0175">In particular, the methyl methacrylate polymer seed latex is preferably a MMA homopolymer seed latex.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0176">The chlorinated vinyl polymer latex according to the invention is advantageously obtained by the process for preparing a chlorinated vinyl polymer according to the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0177">The methyl methacrylate polymer seed latex is advantageously the methyl methacrylate polymer seed latex according to the invention described previously.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0178">Since the process for preparing a PMMA seed latex according to the invention is an ex situ process, it has the advantage of being characterized by a better reproducibility of the particle size and the polymerization kinetics. Moreover, it is advantageously characterized by the fact that it allows automation of the seed supply to the reactor for polymerization of chlorinated vinyl monomers, in particular VDC. Moreover, it is characterized by a high reproducibility (precision in the amounts of seed latex used in the polymerization) and high productivity in so far as it is not necessary to precede each polymerization cycle by the &#x201c;in situ&#x201d; synthesis of the seed latex. These various advantages are not, on the other hand, presented by an &#x201c;in situ&#x201d; synthesis of the seed latex.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0179">The nanoscale size of the PMMA seed latex furthermore makes it possible to control the diameter of particles of a chlorinated vinyl polymer latex, in particular a PVDC latex, and to prevent the formation of parasite particle populations.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0180">The use of a PMMA seed latex for the polymerization of chlorinated vinyl monomers, in particular VDC, moreover has the advantage of enabling the production of a latex which is suitable for applications in which the current regulations do not allow the use of certain compounds, in so far as PMMA is not excluded by them.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0181">Finally, the PMMA seed latex according to the invention has proved to have the characteristics required in order to be used as a base for the polymerization of chlorinated vinyl monomers, in particular VDC, unlike PVDC-type seed latices.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0182">The process for preparing a chlorinated vinyl polymer latex, in particular a PVDC latex, involving a PMMA seed latex prepared by the process for preparing a PMMA seed latex according to the invention, has the advantage of allowing a considerable gain in the polymerization cycle time of the monomers.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0183">It also makes it possible to quite significantly reduce crusting of polymerization autoclaves. A substantial gain in terms of autoclave cleaning therefore follows, and also an increase in productivity.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0184">This same process makes it possible to obtain latices which are characterized by particle diameters and a thermal stability which are comparable to the latices of the prior art.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0185">Furthermore, the process makes it possible to obtain a latex of chlorinated vinyl polymers, in particular a PVDC latex, which may give rise to the formation of high-quality films, having the barrier properties required for the intended applications, but also a lower crystallization rate and improved flexibility, which is particularly advantageous for the intended applications.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0186">The following examples are intended to illustrate the invention without however limiting the scope thereof.</p>
<p id="h-0002" num="0000">Determination of the Amount of Wet Crust</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0187">The amount of wet crust was determined by collecting the wet crust present inside the polymerization autoclave, especially on its walls and on the stirrer blades. The crust was collected, then weighed in the wet state. The result was expressed in grams.</p>
<p id="h-0003" num="0000">Determination of the Amount of Lumps</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0188">The amount of lumps in the latex was determined by filtering the latex through a filtration pocket having an average opening of 55 &#x3bc;m (supplier: GAF). The wet lumps rejected by this pouch were collected then weighed in the wet state.</p>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">Measurement of the Particle Diameter Distribution</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0189">The particle diameter distribution of the PMMA seed latex and of the non-additivated PVDC latex were measured by hydrodynamic fractionation on a machine sold by Polymer Laboratories: PL-PSDA (particle size distribution analyser).</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0190">The measurement principle is the following:</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0191">An eluent is pumped continuously into a column filled with non-porous polystyrene-divinylbenzene microbeads. The space between the microbeads behaves as a multitude of capillary channels. The sample to be analysed and a marker were introduced into the machine simultaneously by means of a special two-way valve which does not disturb the flow of eluent. The role of the marker (sodium benzoate) is to guarantee a constant elution time regardless of the pressure variations in the column. A laminar-type flow is created in the capillary channels of the column. The large particles move into the area where the flow rate is the highest, the small particles into the area where it is the lowest. The large particles &#x201c;exit&#x201d; first. The concentration of the particles was determined using a UV detector.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0192">The column was integrated into a cartridge. PL sell three types of cartridges: type 1: from 5 nm to 300 nm, type 2: from 20 nm to 1200 nm and type 3: from 500 nm to 2000 nm. For the measurement, a type 2 cartridge was used.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0193">The latex sample to be analysed was diluted at around 1% (enough to have a suitable response from the UV detector) using 230 mm Pasteur pipettes. Before being injected into the machine, the diluted sample was filtered through a 1.2 &#x3bc;m filter.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0194">The average diameter of the particles (d) is defined as the sum of the individual particle diameters divided by the total number of particles. It corresponds to the formula:</p>

The autoclave was closed then subjected to two vacuum operations at 140 mbar absolute pressure.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0217">The stirring speed was then increased to 60 rpm while bringing the mixture to 85&#xb0; C. When the temperature reached 84&#xb0; C., 2100 kg of methyl methacrylate was added at a constant rate over 3 hours while adding 151 l (2.87 g of active material/kg of monomer) of a 40 g/l ammonium persulphate solution at a constant rate over the same 3 hour duration.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0218">After the end of the methyl methacrylate and ammonium persulphate injections, the polymerization was continued until a temperature difference of less than 5&#xb0; C. was obtained between the temperature of the reaction medium and that of the cooling circuit, followed by a post-polymerization of one hour. The stirring speed was then reduced to 20 rpm and the latex was degassed then stripped under vacuum at 65&#xb0; C. for 3 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0219">The solids content of the PMMA seed latex thus polymerized was 32.5%. The average diameter of the particles, determined by hydrodynamic fractionation as described above, was 34 nm. The particle diameter distribution was monomodal with a standard deviation of 6 nm.</p>

The autoclave was then sealed and subjected to two vacuum operations at 100 mbar absolute pressure. Next, successively introduced by suction, were 212 ml of a 50 g/l secondary alkyl sulphonate solution (Mersolat H40 supplied by Bayer), 18.17 kg of vinylidene chloride, 1.83 kg of methyl acrylate and 62 g of acrylic acid.</p>

The injection of ammonium persulphate was maintained until a temperature difference of 2&#xb0; C. was obtained between the temperature of the reaction medium and that of the cooling circuit. At that time, 150 ml of a 33.3 g/l ammonium persulphate solution were added in one go, and the latex was post-polymerized for 60 minutes. The polymerization time was 12 hours.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0223">The latex was then hot-degassed then stripped under vacuum at 70&#xb0; C. During the stripping, the stirring speed was reduced to 110 rpm. After stripping, the latex was cooled to 20&#xb0; C., then filtered through a 55 &#x3bc;m filtration pocket. The following properties of the latex were then adjusted: the surface tension was adjusted to 30-33 mN/m with a 425 g/l Mersolat H40 solution, the pH was adjusted to 2.5-3.5 with a 150 g/l trisodium phosphate solution, post-modified with 38.5 ml/kg of dry matter of Gleitmittel 8645 wax (supplied by BASF) containing 20% of active material and with 16.7 ml/kg of dry matter of a 150 g/l Na<sub>2</sub>OS Promex solution (supplied by YDS) and finally the solids content was adjusted to between 57% and 58%.</p>

<p id="p-0256" num="0279">From analysis of Table 1, it appears that the process according to the invention makes it possible to prepare PVDC latices that are characterized by an improved productivity (reduced polymerization time, reduced amount of crust and lumps) while retaining an identical average particle diameter and a comparable thermal stability and that give rise to the production of films that are characterized by a lower crystallization rate resulting in a better flexibility than those prepared by a process according to the prior art. Furthermore, the films are characterized by a water vapour barrier that is suitable for the desired applications. It may also be observed that the distribution of the average particle diameters is characterized by a smaller standard deviation for the PVDC latex according to the invention (Example 3) than that measured for the latex according to the prior art (Example 5).</p>

<p id="p-0259" num="0282">While the PVDC latex obtained by the process according to the invention described in Example 3 according to the invention is characterized by a monomodal distribution of the particle diameters and an average diameter of these particles of 154 nm, the PVDC latices obtained by the processes described in the Comparative Examples 7, 10, 13 and 15 are characterized by a smaller average particle diameter and, for the last three, by a bimodal distribution of the particle diameters.</p>

<p id="p-0261" num="0284">Finally, while films were able to be produced, and then analysed, from the latex obtained in Example 3, difficulties were encountered during the coating operation for the latices obtained by the processes described in the comparative examples: presence of sludges and coagulates, clogging of the filters and/or films exhibiting microcracks.</p>
