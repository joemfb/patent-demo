<heading id="h-0003" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">The following detailed description refers to the accompanying drawings. The same reference numbers in different drawings may identify the same or similar elements. The following detailed description does not limit the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Exemplary implementations described herein include flexible and dynamic quota-based restriction mechanisms, instead of or in addition to existing fixed or static control mechanisms, that may be used to encourage entertainment device users (e.g., children) to watch/play approved programming/games (i.e., parentally approved) and to follow approved schedules for school and/or homework activities when using their entertainment devices.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> depicts an overview of the use of dynamic and/or quota-based restriction rules for controlling an entertainment device user's interaction with an entertainment device. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, dynamic and/or quota-based restriction rules <b>100</b> may be supplied to an entertainment manager <b>110</b> which may further supply device control signals <b>130</b> to an entertainment device <b>120</b>, based on the dynamic and/or quota-based restriction rules <b>100</b>, for controlling interactions <b>140</b> between a device user <b>150</b> and entertainment device <b>120</b>. Entertainment device <b>120</b> may include a television, a set-top box (STB), a gaming device, a computing device, or the like that provides video programming and/or games to device user <b>150</b>. The dynamic and/or quota-based restriction rules <b>100</b> may include rules input by a &#x201c;supervising&#x201d; user of entertainment manager <b>110</b> who has &#x201c;supervisory&#x201d; authority to set restriction rules with respect to one or more users (alternatively called &#x201c;family members&#x201d; herein). The dynamic and/or quota-based restriction rules <b>100</b> may include, for example, time quotas that specify an amount of time users (i.e., family members) may use certain entertainment devices (e.g., a specific family member may only watch 10 hours of television per week), time quotas that specify an amount of time per activity type that users may use certain entertainment devices (e.g., 2 hours of cartoons per week maximum, 3 hours of educational programming per week maximum, etc.), and/or time quotas based on a customizable calendar (e.g., a personal calendar or a family calendar that sets forth certain restrictions on dates or times).</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">Entertainment manager <b>110</b> may supply device control signals <b>130</b> to entertainment device <b>120</b> based additionally on biometric authentication <b>160</b> of device user <b>150</b>. Biometric authentication <b>160</b> may include any type of technique for authenticating an identity of a user of entertainment device <b>120</b> including, for example, physiological or behavioral biometric authentication techniques. The physiological biometric authentication techniques may include fingerprint, facial recognition, hand/palm geometry, iris/retina recognition, DNA, or odor biometric authentication techniques. The behavioral biometric authentication techniques may include, for example, signature verification or voice recognition. Other biometric authentication techniques, not described here, may also be used.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">As further shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, entertainment manager <b>110</b> may provide suggestions/recommendations <b>170</b> to device user <b>150</b>. The suggestions and/or recommendations <b>170</b> may include suggested/recommended programming and/or games and may be provided based on the quota-based restriction rules and/or based on other factors. As additionally shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, entertainment manager <b>110</b> may provide a record <b>180</b> of device user <b>150</b>'s use of entertainment device <b>120</b> to device user <b>150</b> (or to the &#x201c;supervisory&#x201d; user or other users).

<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The exemplary process may begin with receipt of dynamic and/or quota-based restriction rules and an identification of associated family members (block <b>500</b>). The restriction rules may, for example, specify a total amount of hours that the entertainment device may be used per a certain period of time (e.g., 10 hours of TV programming per week) and/or, a total amount of hours that the entertainment device may be used per week per activity type (e.g., per genre of TV programming, per individual TV program). Rules engine <b>400</b> may receive the restriction rules and the identification of associated family members via a user interface that may be textual, graphical, or a combination of both.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> depicts an exemplary text-based interface <b>600</b> for entry of dynamic and/or quota-based restriction rules associated with watching television programming.

For example, as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref>, a limit <b>620</b> on total hours of watched may be entered into interface <b>600</b>. A limit <b>630</b> on hours watched per genre of TV programming may further be entered into interface <b>600</b>. A limit <b>640</b> on hours watched per specific television program may also be entered into interface <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts an exemplary calendar-based interface <b>700</b> for entry of dynamic and/or quota-based restriction rules. As shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, a &#x201c;supervisory&#x201d; user may enter a family member identifier <b>710</b> into interface <b>700</b> followed by calendar-based restriction rules. The calendar-based restriction rules may include, for example, the specification of a period <b>720</b> on the calendar during which the family member may watch more or less television programming than the base quota. For example, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a period <b>720</b> (e.g., a week) during which the family member may watch an additional 20% more television programming. The calendar-based restriction rules may include, for example, specification of a period <b>730</b> during which use of the entertainment device is restricted each day over a specified time period. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> depicts a period <b>730</b> during which a family member may not watch television programming until 7 pm in the evening (e.g., during school days). The calendar-based restriction rules may further include, for example, specification of certain days on the calendar during which the family member many not use the entertainment device. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref>, for example, depicts a specified day <b>740</b> on the calendar during which the family member is restricted from using the entertainment device.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Returning to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, biometric information associated with each family member may be received (block <b>510</b>). For example, biometric authentication unit <b>410</b> may obtain biometric information from each family member desiring to use the entertainment device. For example, if facial recognition is employed, biometric authentication unit <b>410</b> may use a camera to obtain an image or video of the family members in the vicinity of the entertainment device and may use facial recognition techniques to obtain facial recognition biometric information for each family member. Biometric authentication unit <b>410</b> may supply the biometric information to rules engine <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">The restriction rules, family member identification, and family member biometric information may be stored (block <b>520</b>).

<p id="p-0036" num="0035"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> is a flow diagram illustrating an exemplary process for applying dynamic and/or quota-based restriction rules to family member(s) use of an entertainment device. The exemplary process of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> may be implemented by entertainment manager <b>110</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">The exemplary process may begin with sampling one or more biometrics associated with family member(s) engaged in using an entertainment device (block <b>800</b>). Depending on what biometric authentication technique is used, different biometrics may be sampled. For example, if facial recognition biometric authentication is being used, then a camera may obtain an image or video of a family member and the image or video may be subjected to facial recognition analysis.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">A comparison of the sampled biometrics with stored biometric information may be made to authenticate the family members (block <b>810</b>). Each family member may have previously stored biometric information and the sampled biometrics may be compared with the previously stored biometric information. For example, the results of facial recognition analysis of a family member may be compared with previously stored facial recognition data.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Dynamic and/or quota-based restriction rules associated with the family member(s) may be determined (block <b>820</b>). Rules engine <b>400</b> may retrieve restriction rules from rules DB <b>260</b> that correspond to the family member or members authenticated in block <b>810</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The determined dynamic and/or quota-based restriction rules may be applied to the family member(s) use of the entertainment device (block <b>830</b>). For example, if the determined restriction rules indicate that the authenticated family member has a quota of 10 hours of television programming per week, then entertainment device control unit <b>440</b> of entertainment manager <b>110</b> may block the authenticated family member from watching anymore television programming beyond the 10 hour quota.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Suggestions and/or recommendation may be provided to the family member(s) based on the determined dynamic and/or quota-based restriction rules (block <b>840</b>).

<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The exemplary process may begin with entertainment manager <b>120</b> monitoring and recording a family member's use of entertainment device <b>120</b> (block <b>900</b>). Entertainment monitoring unit <b>430</b> may monitor and record each family member's use of entertainment device <b>120</b> and store the recorded use in memory. The recorded use may include, for example, a number of hours spent with a specific activity type (e.g., 4 hours watching comedy programming, 6 hours playing video games, etc.).</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">The recorded family member's use of entertainment device <b>120</b> may be analyzed (block <b>910</b>). Entertainment monitoring unit <b>430</b> may, for example, analyze the recorded family member's use of entertainment device <b>120</b> to determine the family member's overall viewing/playing habits. The results of the analysis may be compared with the family member's restriction rules (block <b>920</b>). For example, the analysis may determine how many more or fewer hours that the family member used entertainment device <b>120</b> relative to any quotas specified in the restriction rules.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">The results of the analysis of the family member's use of entertainment device <b>120</b> may be provided (block <b>930</b>). <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref> depicts an exemplary display window <b>1000</b> for displaying the results of the monitoring and analysis of the family member's use of entertainment device <b>120</b>.
