<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The figures are not necessarily to scale. Like numbers used in the figures refer to like components. However, it will be understood that the use of a number to refer to a component in a given figure is not intended to limit the component in another figure labeled with the same number.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">In the following description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which are shown by way of illustration several specific embodiments. It is to be understood that other embodiments are contemplated and may be made without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention. The following detailed description, therefore, is not to be taken in a limiting sense.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION</heading>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">All scientific and technical terms used herein have meanings commonly used in the art unless otherwise specified. The definitions provided herein are to facilitate understanding of certain terms used frequently herein and are not meant to limit the scope of the present disclosure.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Unless otherwise indicated, all numbers expressing feature sizes, amounts, and physical properties used in the specification and claims are to be understood as being modified in all instances by the term &#x201c;about.&#x201d; Accordingly, unless indicated to the contrary, the numerical parameters set forth in the foregoing specification and attached claims are approximations that can vary depending upon the desired properties sought to be obtained by those skilled in the art utilizing the teachings disclosed herein.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">The recitation of numerical ranges by endpoints includes all numbers subsumed within that range (e.g. 1 to 5 includes 1, 1.5, 2, 2.75, 3, 3.80, 4, and 5) and any range within that range.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">As used in this specification and the appended claims, the singular forms &#x201c;a&#x201d;, &#x201c;an&#x201d;, and &#x201c;the&#x201d; encompass embodiments having plural referents, unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. As used in this specification and the appended claims, the term &#x201c;or&#x201d; is generally employed in its sense including &#x201c;and/or&#x201d; unless the content clearly dictates otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Disclosed herein are electromechanical materials, layers, articles and devices. An electromechanical material is a material that exhibits piezoelectricity (or piezoelectric properties) or pyroelectricity (or pyroelectric properties). The generation of a surface charge in response to the application of an external stress to a material is called piezoelectricity. A change in the spontaneous polarization of a material in response to a change in temperature is called pyroelectricity. Some electromechanical materials as described herein have piezoelectric properties and some have pyroelectric properties. There is a need for new piezoelectric and pyroelectric materials. Although non-polar polymeric materials have been rendered piezoelectric, they have not yet been made controllably porous and may not offer sufficient strength for some applications.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">An exemplary method includes the steps of preparing a composite composition, forming a film of the composite composition, and heating the film of the composite composition forming a composite material. A composite composition as disclosed herein includes at least one polymer and a plurality of microspheres. A composite composition can also be referred to as a coating composition when the film will be formed using solution casting methods. The composite material formed from the composite composition includes (1) the polymer and (2) at least one microsphere, wherein the microsphere has an outer shell of a shell material and wherein the microsphere contains a gas or liquid within the outer shell of the microsphere (i.e., within the interior of the microsphere).

Exemplary optional components include additives to effect the processing of the composite composition. Exemplary processing additives include, but are not limited to, plasticizers, antioxidants, clay and UV stabilizers for example.

<p id="p-0033" num="0032">In an embodiment where the composite composition is to be solution cast into a film, the amount of polymer in a composite composition can be dictated, at least in part, on the desire to have a composite composition that can be easily and reproducibly coated onto a substrate, the solubility of the polymer being utilized, the amount of microspheres utilized, or a combination thereof. The amount of polymer and solvent can be dictated at least in part on the method of forming the film.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">The amount of microspheres included in the composite composition can vary somewhat. The greater the amount of microspheres, the larger the number of interfaces (between the polymer and the shell material) present in a final article; as the number of interfaces increases, the overall polarity of the article should theoretically increase, which can lead to larger piezoelectric or pyroelectric properties. In an embodiment, the composite composition can contain microspheres, such as polymeric microspheres, in an amount from about 0.1 wt % to about 70 wt % based on the weight of the total composite composition. In some examples, the composite composition contains at least 0.1 wt %, at least 0.2 wt %, at least 0.5 wt %, at least 1 wt %, at least 2 wt %, at least 5 wt % or at least 10 wt % microspheres based on the weight of the total composite composition. The composite composition can contain up to 70 wt %, up to 60 wt %, up to 50 wt %, up to 40 wt %, up to 20 wt %, up to 15 wt %, or up to 10 wt % based on the weight of the total composite composition. In an embodiment, the composite composition can contain from about 1 wt % to about 20 wt % microspheres, such as polymeric microspheres, based on the weight of the total composite composition. In an embodiment, the composite composition can contain from about 1 wt % to about wt 10% microspheres, such as polymeric microspheres, based on the weight of the total composite composition. In an embodiment, the composite composition can include from about 3 wt % to about 15 wt % microspheres based on the total weight of the composite composition. In an embodiment, the composite composition can include from about 5 wt % to about 10 wt % microspheres based on the total weight of the composite composition.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Once the composite composition is prepared, a film of the composite composition is then formed. Numerous methods can be utilized to form a film of the composite composition, including, but not limited to extrusion, hot pressing and solution casting for example. In an embodiment where extrusion is utilized to form a film, the components of the composite composition can be added to an extruder and an appropriate die can be utilized to form a film of the composite composition. In an embodiment where solution casting is utilized to form a film of the composite composition, the composite composition (generally including a solvent) can be applied to a substrate via one of a number of methods. A film that has been cast from solution can also be hot pressed between two plates after being cast. Exemplary methods of forming a coating include, but are not limited to, knife coating, immersion (dip) coating, gap coating, curtain coating, rotary screen coating, reverse roll coating, Gravure coating, metering rod (Meyer bar) coating and slot die (extrusion) coating for example. In an embodiment, the particular coating method chosen can depend at least in part on the amount of microspheres in the composite composition, the desired thickness of the coating, other factors not discussed herein, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">In an embodiment where the composite composition is solution cast, a dry coating thickness of the composite composition can range from about 0.1 micrometers (&#x3bc;m) to about 500 &#x3bc;m. The thickness can be at least 0.1 &#x3bc;m, at least 0.2 &#x3bc;m, at least 0.5 &#x3bc;m, at least 1 &#x3bc;m, at least 2 &#x3bc;m, at least 5 &#x3bc;m, at least 10 &#x3bc;m, or at least 20 &#x3bc;m. The thickness can be up to 500 &#x3bc;m or greater, up to 400 &#x3bc;m, up to 300 &#x3bc;m, up to 200 &#x3bc;m, up to 100 &#x3bc;m, or up to 50 &#x3bc;m. In an embodiment, the solution cast coating composition can have a wet coating thickness from about 0.1 &#x3bc;m to about 100 &#x3bc;m. In an embodiment, the solution cast composite composition can have a dry coating thickness from about 10 &#x3bc;m to about 50 &#x3bc;m. Once the composite composition has been solution cast, the solvent from the composite composition can be at least partially evaporated. This can be accomplished by drying the film in an oven or at room temperature. The temperature necessary to at least partially evaporate at least part of the solvent can depend at least in part on the amount of solvent in the composite composition, the particular solvent (or solvents), the particular polymer, or a combination thereof. In an embodiment where the polymer is P(VDF-TrFE) and the solvent is MEK, the solvent can be at least partially evaporated in an oven set at about 60&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">Once a film of the composite composition is prepared, the film is often heated to expand the gas or liquid located inside the microspheres to form an expanded microsphere. Once the microspheres have been expanded, a composite material is formed. A composite material includes (1) polymer and (2) at least one expanded microsphere. Optionally, the film can be removed from the substrate upon which it was coated before it is heated to expand the microspheres. The film can be heated using known methods. Exemplary methods include use of a convection oven, an infrared heating device or a heat gun for example. It should also be noted that part or all of the solvent can be evaporated while the film is heated to expand the microspheres. In an embodiment however, the film is heated initially to a first temperature in order to at least partially evaporate at least some of the solvent within the film; and is then heated to a second temperature to expand the gas within the microspheres. In such an embodiment, the first temperature can be less than the second temperature.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Generally, the film is heated to a temperature that affords expansion of the gas or liquid within the microsphere but does not break down the outer shell material or the polymer. The temperature to which the film is heated is dictated at least in part on the kind of polymer in the composite composition, the shell material of the microsphere, the gas or liquid within the microsphere, the extent of desired expansion of the microspheres, or a combination thereof.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">In an embodiment that utilizes polymeric microspheres such as those available under then trade designation EXPANCEL, the film can generally be heated to a temperature from about 80&#xb0; C. to about 190&#xb0; C. Technical literature that accompanies the particular polymeric microspheres (or other type of microsphere) that are utilized can also provide further information regarding the temperature at which the microspheres will begin to expand. In an embodiment that utilizes polymeric microspheres such as those available under the trade designation EXPANCEL 461 DU 20, the film can be heated to about 150&#xb0; C. When the polymeric microspheres are heated, the small amount of propellant (i.e., the gas or liquid) within the interior of the microspheres expands, while the shell material softens. The expansion of the propellant increases the pressure within the microsphere, which results in an expansion of the microspheres. The temperature at which expansion of the microspheres starts as well as the temperature at which the maximum expansion is obtained depends to some degree on the rate of heating. The time that the film is heated can dictate, at least in part, the extent of the expansion. In some embodiments that utilize polymeric microspheres, the film can be heated to about 150&#xb0; C. for about 5 minutes. In other embodiments that utilize polymeric microspheres, the film can be heated to about 190&#xb0; C. for about 5 to about 10 minutes. Once the film has been heated to the expansion temperature, it can, but need not be cooled to a lower temperature (e.g. room temperature) before further action is carried out on the film.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">The extent to which the microspheres, for example polymeric microspheres such as those available under the trade designation EXPANCEL, are heated can be used to control at least in part the extent to which they expand. For this reason, the methods disclosed herein can offer the advantage of being able to readily control the porosity of the articles formed using such methods. This can be advantageous because it offers the ability to more effectively tailor the combination of the piezoelectric properties (for example) and the mechanical strength of the film.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">After the film is heated (and optionally cooled), the film can then optionally be poled. Poling (or polarizing) the film can be accomplished as those of skill in the art know. An exemplary method of poling includes use of a corona poling process. Corona poling functions to align the charges within and around the microspheres in the film. An exemplary set up for corona poling includes a sharp needle or thin wire suspended above a larger ground plate. The distance between the wire and the ground plate can be about 1 centimeter (cm) for example. A high voltage (about 5 to about 10 kV) can be applied to the needle or wire. In an embodiment, an external field of at least about 30 MV/m can be utilized. This will cause the surrounding air to be ionized. The ionized air will then collect on an article (e.g. the film) placed between the needle and the ground plate. The charge will continue to build until equilibrium is met between the electro-forces of the plate and the environment. In an embodiment, the poling process involves heating the film, applying the poling field, and cooling the film thereby allowing the dipoles within the film to solidify while polarized. In an embodiment, thicker films (films having a thickness that is at least about 100 &#x3bc;m) can be heated during the poling process in order to achieve a relatively larger piezoelectric response. Such thick films can be heated to a temperature of about 70&#xb0; C. to about 130&#xb0; C. during the poling process. For high temperature poling the film can be heated first and the high voltage field can be applied while the film is at a high temperature. This can aid in rotating the dipole or injecting the charge. The film can then be cooled down under the field to freeze the dipole or injected charge. In an embodiment, the film can be corona charged using an electric field of approximately 20 MV/m, for about 10 minutes at a temperature of about 28&#xb0; C.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">In an embodiment, an electromechanical layer can have piezoelectric properties or pyroelectric properties without being mechanically stretched. The ability to avoid stretching can be advantageous from a processing standpoint and can also provide films having more desirable properties. For example, stretching can create anisotropic elastic modulus in the stretching or axial direction as compared to the transverse direction. The properties of an electromechanical layers as formed herein can be (but need not be) enhanced by being mechanically stretched.</p>

<p id="p-0059" num="0058">Poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene)copolymer (P(VDF-TrFE)) (obtained from Solvay and Cie, Belgium) (10-20 wt %) was dissolved in methylethyl ketone (MEK) solvent at 50&#xb0; C. Unexpanded polymeric microspheres, commercially available under then trade designation 461-DU-20 EXPANCEL from Expancel Incorporated, Duluth, Ga., USA) were added to the P(VDF-TrFE) solution at a concentration of about 10 pph (part per hundred). About 50 mL of this composition was then poured on a 20 &#x3bc;m silicon liner (CP Film Inc. Fieldale, Va.) and dried in the oven at 60&#xb0; C. to evaporate the solvent. The dried and unexpanded composite film was then removed from the liner.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The piezoelectric property (d<sub>33</sub>) of the unexpanded composite film was then measured using a PiezoTest precision piezometer system m (Piezotest, London, United Kingdom). The d<sub>33 </sub>value for the composite film was 0.1 pC/N before the polymeric microspheres were expanded.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The film was then heated to 150&#xb0; C. for about 5 minutes in order to expand the polymeric microspheres. After heating, the film was cooled down to room temperature. The film was then corona charged by passing the film, while in contact with an aluminum ground plane, through a direct current (i.e., DC) corona charger equipped with a series of stainless steel wires at a voltage of greater than 20 MV/m. The wires were positioned at a distance of 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the ground plane, and were spaced such that the corona discharge was continuous. The piezoelectric property (d<sub>33</sub>) was then measured using a PiezoTest piezometer, model number PM300 (Piezotest, London, United Kingdom).</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">Examples 2 through 33 were prepared in the same fashion as Example 1, by dissolving 10-20 wt % of poly(vinylidene fluoride-trifluoroethylene)copolymer (referred to as P(VDF-TrFE)) in methylethyl ketone (MEK) solvent at 50&#xb0; C. Unexpanded microspheres according to Table 1 were added to the solution at the concentrations given in Table 1. All the microspheres were polymeric microspheres commercially available under the trade designation EXPANCEL. Various amounts of the composition was then poured onto 20 &#x3bc;m silicon liner (CP Film Inc. Fieldale, Va.) and dried in the oven at 60&#xb0; C. to evaporate the solvent, giving the dried thicknesses shown in Table 1. The dried P(VDF-TrFE)-polymeric microsphere composite films were then removed from the liners. The films were then heated to temperatures shown in Table 1 for times shown in Table 1 to expand the polymeric microspheres. After heating, the films were cooled down to room temperature. The films then was polarized and tested as explained above.</p>
