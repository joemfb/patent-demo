<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This application represents a National Stage application of PCT/DE2009/001662 entitled &#x201c;Locking Device for the Rotor of Wind Turbines&#x201d; filed Nov. 20, 2009, pending.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The invention relates to a wind turbine comprising a tower, a nacelle that is located on the tower and a rotor that is connected to the nacelle and has a rotor shaft, a rotor hub and at least one rotor blade that is fixed to the rotor hub, the wind turbine having a locking device having a locking bolt that can be driven into a locking bolt recess in order to positively lock the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Discussion of the Prior Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">The positive locking of the rotor of a wind turbine is always necessary when it has to be guaranteed that a rotation of the rotor is ruled out, for example during repair and maintenance of wind turbines or when bringing the rotor into a parking position under extreme weather conditions.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">A method for locking the rotor is known from DE 10 2004 013 624 A1. To this end, a disc is provided that is fixed concentrically to the rotor axis and is penetrated by at least one opening into which a locking bolt that extends parallel to the rotor axis and is supported on the frame construction of the wind turbine can be driven in preferably hydraulically and locks the rotor.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">The disadvantage of this method and of the constructive design connected therewith is however that this implementation runs counter to the trend to more compact and lighter units. In particular in the case of wind turbines without a nacelle shroud the locking bolts that are arranged on the nacelle and can often be displaced hydraulically are directly exposed to the weather conditions, leading to a high susceptibility of this safety system due to the ingress of humidity and aerosols.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Integrating the locking bolt mechanism or hydraulics into the housing of the shroudless nacelle is not recommended on account of the risk that humidity and aerosols can also enter the components of the nacelle and can damage the nacelle.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A further disadvantage consists in the fact that securing the locking bolt mechanism to the nacelle is very complicated since large forces can arise in the connection area of locking bolt and nacelle that have to be transmitted in a very complicated manner into the housing and the support structure. In addition, also a large disc provided with several holes has to be introduced between the rotor shaft and the hub and as a very voluminous component complicates the assembly of a wind turbine.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">It is therefore the object of the invention to provide a locking device for a wind turbine that is largely protected against direct exposure to the elements even in the case of wind turbines without a nacelle shroud. In accordance with the invention, this object is carried out by providing a wind turbine comprising: a tower, a nacelle located on the tower and provided with a machine support, a rotor shaft bearing and a generator, a rotor with a rotor shaft and a rotor hub, at least one rotor blade that is fixed to the rotor hub, a locking device including a locking bolt driven into a locking bolt recess in order to positively lock the rotor, said locking bolt being located on the rotor hub and the locking bolt recess is located on the nacelle.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to the invention, the object is achieved by the wind turbine having the features of claim <b>1</b>. The sub-claims specify advantageous embodiments of the invention.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> shows a perspective view of an inventive wind turbine that is equipped with a double-bladed rotor in the illustrated example. The wind turbine <b>100</b> has a tower <b>10</b>, a nacelle <b>20</b> that is located on the tower <b>10</b> and is provided with a machine support, a rotor shaft bearing and a generator, and comprising a rotor <b>30</b> with a rotor shaft, a rotor hub <b>40</b> and two rotor blades <b>50</b><i>a, </i><b>50</b><i>b </i>that are fixed to the rotor hub <b>40</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">As can be seen from <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 2</figref>, <b>3</b> and <b>4</b>, according to the invention it is provided that at least one, preferably two locking bolts <b>70</b> are provided on the hub <b>40</b> of the rotor <b>30</b> and the locking bolt recess <b>90</b> on the nacelle <b>20</b>. As a result, the locking bolt <b>70</b> is largely protected against exposure to the elements by the hub <b>40</b>. The locking bolt recess <b>90</b> is likewise preferably designed&#x2014;as shown&#x2014;as a hole in the disc-shaped element <b>80</b> or (as an alternative) as a blind recess in the housing wall of the nacelle <b>20</b> so that in any case no opening has to be provided that leads into the interior of the nacelle <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">By nacelle <b>20</b> it is here understood the unit placed on the tower <b>10</b> of the wind turbine <b>100</b> and consisting essentially of the rotor bearing, possibly a transmission and generator, the locking recesses <b>90</b> being provided in that section of the nacelle <b>20</b> that borders on the hub <b>40</b>. This section can be the housing, for example the bearing housing of the rotor shaft bearing <b>25</b>, or a special structure <b>80</b> fastened to the nacelle <b>20</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In the exemplary embodiment shown, the locking bolt recess <b>90</b> is actually designed in a disc-shaped element <b>80</b> that is fastened to the nacelle <b>20</b> and is preferably formed as a component of the rotor bearing housing <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">The locking bolts <b>70</b> are preferably operated hydraulically, hydraulic actuating devices for adjusting the rotor blades <b>50</b><i>a, </i><b>50</b><i>b </i>being usually provided anyway in the hub <b>40</b> with the result that the existing hydraulic systems can possibly also be used for displacing the hydraulic bolt <b>70</b> into the locking bolt recess <b>90</b> and out of it again.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">So that the rotor <b>30</b> can be locked, it is necessary that the axis of the locking bolt <b>70</b> and the axis of the locking bolt recess <b>90</b> have an approximately flush orientation, when taking into account tolerances. To this end, a control system is provided which enables this position to be approached for example by a regulated braking of the rotor <b>30</b> into the locking position using a disc brake.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023">For safety reasons, a testing device is to be provided additionally that checks a target/actual comparison between the position approached by the control system and the actual position of locking bolt <b>70</b> and locking bolt recess <b>90</b>. To prevent damage to the plant by extending the locking bolt <b>70</b> in a rotor position in which the axis of the locking bolt <b>70</b> and the axis of the locking bolt recess <b>90</b> do not coincide, when taking into account tolerances, the locking bolt <b>70</b> is only extended if the tested position actually corresponds to that position in which the locking bolt <b>70</b> can be safely introduced into the locking bolt recess <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">Furthermore, more than one locking recess <b>90</b> can be provided that is arranged on the nacelle <b>20</b> or on the housing of the nacelle <b>20</b>. The locking bolt recesses <b>90</b> are located on the circle that is drawn by the locking bolt <b>70</b> when the rotor <b>30</b> rotates and can be designed as blind openings of the housing of the nacelle <b>20</b> or as additional, preferably annular structural elements <b>80</b> fastened to the nacelle <b>20</b>, other geometrical shapes of the recesses also being conceivable. For example, the locking bolt recesses <b>90</b> can be arranged as blind openings in the first section of the nacelle <b>20</b>, bordering on the hub <b>40</b>, that is to say the bearing housing of the rotor shaft bearing <b>25</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Finally it is also possible to provide more than one locking bolt <b>70</b> and one locking bolt recess <b>90</b>, that is to say at least two locking bolts <b>70</b> and two locking bolt recesses <b>90</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 3 and 4</figref> finally show the geometric ratios in different rotor positions each in a sectional view through the hub <b>40</b>. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, the hydraulic bolt <b>70</b> is retracted, so that the rotor <b>30</b> of the wind turbine <b>100</b> can rotate freely. In <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the rotor <b>30</b> is in the locking position, the hydraulic bolt <b>70</b> being extended from the hub <b>40</b> into the locking bolt recess <b>90</b>, so that the rotor <b>30</b> is locked and cannot rotate freely. To achieve effective positive locking, the locking bolt <b>70</b> is preferably designed as an outside cone and the locking recess <b>90</b> as a counterpart having an inside cone.</p>
