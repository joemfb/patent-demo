<abstract id="abstract">
<p id="p-0001" num="0000">Provided are a mobile communication terminal and a method capable of transmitting an image during the execution of a mobile messenger service. A host terminal acquires image data in response to a request for image transmission and creates a first transmission packet of the image data. The first packet is sent to a client terminal through a packet data communication network at a specified period. Additionally, when receiving a second transmission packet of image data from the client terminal, the host terminal decodes and displays the received second packet.</p>

<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This U.S. non-provisional application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Korean Patent Application No. 2006-36633, which was filed in the Korean Intellectual Property Office on Apr. 24, 2006, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Field of the Invention</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates generally to a mobile messenger service and, more particularly, to a mobile communication terminal and a method capable of transmitting an image during the execution of a mobile messenger service.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">With the remarkable growth of the telecommunication communication industry, Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) communication system is continuously developing toward a multicasting multimedia communication that allows transmission of high-volume data, e.g., packet data, as well as traditional voice transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">The development of mobile communication technology and the increasing use of and dependence on mobile terminals, has led to the development of an increased number of various functions in addition to talk, such as character and image transmission. Additionally, many mobile terminals now provide an address book function that includes a personal directory, and a schedule manager.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">Further to the enhanced functions available for the mobile terminals, a mobile messenger service has been recently introduced. The mobile messenger service is an instant messaging application that allows registered users to communicate in real time via text transmission over the mobile Internet. The mobile messenger service enables users to exchange memos, files and other data, and to participate in a real time chatting and group telephony.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">Such a conventional mobile messenger service may, however, use only text messages for communication between users who take part in a chatting session. That is, the conventional mobile messenger service may fail to use image transmission.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">To solve the above issue, an attempt to utilize RTP (Real-time Transport Protocol) or RTCP (Real-time Transport Control Protocol) for image transmission between mobile terminals is utilized in conventional systems. Such an attempt is not, however, practicable to the mobile messenger service since it requires the intervention of a server in the CDMA network system. A server-client system using a CDMA server not only increases complexity of the system, but also reduces transmission speed.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An aspect of the present invention is to provide a mobile communication terminal and a method capable of transmitting an image during execution of a mobile messenger service.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a mobile communication terminal includes a control unit; an image acquisition unit obtaining image data under control of the control unit in response to a request for image transmission during execution of the mobile messenger service; an transmission packet creation unit creating a first transmission packet of the image data under control of the control unit; and a packet data communication network interface unit offering an interface with a packet data communication network and sending the first transmission packet of the image data to the packet data communication network at specified periods under control of the control unit.</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">In the terminal, the image acquisition unit may include a camera lens located at the front face of the terminal or configured to be adjustable in location or direction as if located at the front face of the terminal.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">Furthermore, the transmission packet creation unit divides the image data into one-time transmittable segments and compresses the divided segments. Here, the first transmission packet of the image data preferably includes the divided and compressed image segments, an IP address of a sender, and an IP address of a receiver. The transmission packet creation unit preferably compresses the divided segments of the image data by using JPEG method.</p>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">Additionally, the first transmission packet of the image data preferably includes information about counterpart mobile communication terminal. Here, the packet data communication interface unit sends the first transmission packet to the counterpart mobile communication terminal through the packet data communication network. The specified period is preferably approximately one second.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">The terminal preferably further includes an image decoder decoding a second transmission packet of image data the packet data communication interface unit receives during execution of the mobile messenger service; and a display unit displaying the decoded image data. In this case, the display unit includes a second image display section for displaying the second packet, a dialogue display section, and a message input section. The display unit further preferably includes a first image display section for displaying the first packet. Besides, the control unit preferably receives the decoded image data from the image decoder, determines the validity of the decoded image data, and controls the display unit to display a valid image only.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">According to another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, a method for image transmission includes acquiring image data in response to a request for image transmission during execution of the mobile messenger service; creating a first transmission packet of the image data; and sending the first transmission packet of the image data to a packet data communication network at specified periods.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">In this method, the creating of the first packet preferably includes dividing the image data into one-time transmittable segments, compressing the divided segments, and creating the first packet having the divided and compressed image segments, an IP address of a sender, and an IP address of a receiver. Here, the compressing of the segments is performed by JPEG method. Furthermore, the sending of the first packet is performed at intervals of approximately one second.</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">The method preferably further includes receiving a second transmission packet of image data from the packet data communication network during execution of the mobile messenger service; decoding the second transmission packet of the image data; and displaying the decoded image data. In this case, the displaying of the decoded image data includes displaying the second packet in a second image display section of a display unit also having a dialogue display section and a message input section. Here, the method further includes displaying the first packet in a first image display section separated from the second image display section. Additionally, the method may further includes determining the validity of the decoded image data, wherein the displaying of the decoded image data includes displaying a valid image only.</p>

<heading id="h-0005" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS</heading>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025">Exemplary, non-limiting embodiments of the present invention will now be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings. This invention may, however, be embodied in many different forms and should not be construed as limited to the exemplary embodiments set forth herein. Rather, the disclosed embodiments are provided so that this disclosure will be thorough and complete, and will fully convey the scope of the invention to those skilled in the art. The principles and features of this invention may be employed in varied and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope of the invention.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026">Well-known structures and processes are not described or illustrated in detail to avoid obscuring the essence of the present invention. Like reference numerals are used for like and corresponding parts of the various drawings.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> is a schematic diagram showing a mobile communication system allowing the execution of a mobile messenger service to which the present invention is applied. Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, a mobile messenger system, i.e. a mobile communication system that allows a mobile messenger service, includes mobile communication terminals (hereinafter, mobile terminals or terminals) <b>100</b>, <b>500</b> and <b>600</b>, a Short Message Service (SMS) server <b>200</b> (hereinafter, an SMS server), a packet data communication network <b>300</b>, and a Packet Data Serving Node (PDSN) <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0028">Each of the mobile terminals <b>100</b>, <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> has a program suitable for a mobile messenger service. One terminal is a host terminal <b>100</b> that transmits an invitation message to conversation, and the other terminals are client terminals <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> that transmit an acceptance message to conversation in response to the invitation message.</p>
<p id="p-0030" num="0029">The SMS server <b>200</b> sends SMS messages through a mobile communication network, such as a conventional CDMA network. Especially, the SMS server <b>200</b> transmits an invitation message of the host terminal <b>100</b> to the respective client terminals <b>500</b> and <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0031" num="0030">The packet data communication network <b>300</b> establishes a Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) connection channel to perform a packet data communication.</p>
<p id="p-0032" num="0031">The PDSN <b>400</b> is connected to the respective terminals <b>100</b>, <b>500</b> and <b>600</b> through the packet data communication network <b>300</b>. The PDSN <b>400</b> receives acceptance messages from the respective client terminals <b>500</b> and <b>600</b>, and sends the acceptance messages to the host terminal <b>100</b>. Furthermore, after initialization, the PDSN <b>400</b> provides a mobile messenger service, i.e. real-time information transmission, between the terminals <b>100</b>, <b>500</b> and <b>600</b>. For example, the PDSN <b>400</b> transmits a message of the host terminal <b>100</b> to the client terminals <b>500</b> and <b>600</b>, and transmits a message of one client terminals <b>500</b> or <b>600</b> to the host terminal <b>100</b> and the other client terminal <b>500</b> or <b>600</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0033" num="0032"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is a ladder diagram showing an initialization procedure of a mobile messenger service executed in the system shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>. Especially, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> illustrates an example of initialization for a mobile messenger service between the host terminal <b>100</b> and the client terminal <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0034" num="0033">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, the host terminal <b>100</b>, keeping a normal operation mode for mobile communications, drives in Step <b>105</b> a mobile messenger program when receiving an input signal for the commencement of a mobile messenger service.</p>
<p id="p-0035" num="0034">Next, in Step <b>110</b> the host terminal <b>100</b> creates a buddy list based on a user's selection, and in Step <b>115</b> makes a PPP connection with the PDSN <b>400</b>. Then, in Step <b>120</b> the host terminal <b>100</b> receives an Internet Protocol (IP) address allocated thereto from the PDSN <b>400</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0036" num="0035">The buddy list is a series of persons to talk to via a mobile messenger service and is also called a conversation companion list. Preferably, the host terminal <b>100</b> creates a buddy list that includes someone selected among conversation expectants registered in the host terminal <b>100</b>. Alternatively, the buddy list is created to include someone selected from among users available for a mobile messenger service, such users being recorded in an address book of the host terminal <b>100</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0037" num="0036">In Step <b>125</b> the host terminal <b>100</b> transmits an invitation message to respective terminals corresponding to conversation expectants in the buddy list. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> provides an example of transmitting an invitation message to the client terminal <b>500</b>. After a user of the client terminal <b>500</b> is registered in the buddy list in Step <b>110</b>, the host terminal <b>100</b> sends the invitation message to the client terminal <b>500</b> in Steps <b>125</b> and <b>130</b>. This transmission of the invitation message is made via the SMS server <b>200</b>, and the IP address of the host terminal <b>100</b> received in Step <b>120</b> is included in the invitation message. In addition to the IP address, the invitation message may also include any other information about the host terminal <b>100</b> such as identification (ID), a port number, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">Receiving the invitation message, the client terminal <b>500</b> confirms that the received message is for a mobile messenger service, and in Step <b>135</b> drives a messenger program. Then, in Step <b>140</b>, the client terminal <b>500</b> extracts information about the host terminal <b>100</b>, such as an IP address, ID, a port number, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">Additionally, in Step <b>145</b> the client terminal <b>500</b> makes a PPP connection with the PDSN <b>400</b>, and in Step <b>150</b> receives an IP address allocated thereto from the PDSN <b>400</b>. Then, in Steps <b>155</b> and <b>160</b>, being based on a user's selection, the client terminal <b>500</b> transmits an acceptance message to the host terminal <b>100</b> in response to the invitation message.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">Since having already recognized the IP address of the host terminal <b>100</b> from the received invitation message, the client terminal <b>500</b> sends the acceptance message to the IP address of the host terminal <b>100</b> through the PDSN <b>400</b>. When creating the acceptance message, the client terminal <b>500</b> assigns its own IP address to a sender address and the IP address of the host terminal <b>100</b> to a receiver address, respectively. The acceptance message preferably includes such IP addresses, protocol information, port number information, certification information, etc.</p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">When the host terminal <b>100</b> receives the acceptance message from the client terminal <b>500</b>, in Step <b>165</b> the host terminal <b>100</b> updates the buddy list so that information about only the client terminal <b>500</b> that sent the acceptance message may be included in the buddy list. That is to say, the host terminal <b>100</b> deletes a user of a client terminal that fails to transmit the acceptance message in response to the invitation message.</p>
<p id="p-0042" num="0041">Next, in Steps <b>170</b> and <b>175</b> the host terminal <b>100</b> transmits the updated buddy list through the PDSN <b>400</b> to the client terminal <b>500</b> that sent the acceptance message.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">Once the buddy list is held in common between conversation parties, a mobile messenger service is commenced in Step <b>180</b>. That is, each terminal <b>100</b> and <b>500</b> makes a connection with the PDSN <b>400</b> by using the IP address of the counterpart, and therefore a mobile messenger service begins.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> is a flowchart showing a method for image transmission in a mobile messenger service in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Specifically, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an example of transmitting and receiving an image between the host terminal <b>100</b> and the client terminal <b>500</b> using a mobile messenger service after the initialization for a mobile messenger service is completed as shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>. Especially, <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> provides an example of the host terminal <b>100</b> transmitting an image and the client terminal <b>500</b> receiving the transmitted image.</p>
<p id="p-0045" num="0044">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, when a messenger connection is established between the host terminal <b>100</b> and the client terminal <b>500</b> in step S<b>205</b>, both the host terminal <b>100</b> and the client terminal <b>500</b> operate, respectively, in a text transmission/reception mode in Steps <b>210</b> and <b>305</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0046" num="0045">When receiving a request for image transmission in step S<b>215</b>, the host terminal <b>100</b> acquires an image in Step <b>220</b>. For example, a user of the host terminal <b>100</b> requests image transmission and the host terminal <b>100</b> performs an image acquisition process in response to a user's request. For this, the host terminal <b>100</b> preferably has a conventional camera module capable of acquiring a user's image.</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0046">Next, in Step <b>225</b> the host terminal <b>100</b> creates a transmission packet of image data from the acquired image. Specifically, the host terminal <b>100</b> divides the acquired image into segments proper to be transmitted, and then compresses the divided image segments. A well known JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group) method is preferably used for image compression. Furthermore, the host terminal <b>100</b> creates the transmission packet of the compressed image such that a header of the transmission packet includes the IP address of the host terminal <b>100</b>, i.e. a sender, and the IP address of the client terminal <b>500</b>, i.e. a receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0047">Thereafter, in Step <b>230</b> the host terminal <b>100</b> transmits the transmission packet of the image data to the client terminal <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0048">While receiving the transmission packet of the image data, in Step <b>310</b> the client terminal <b>500</b> determines whether the reception of the transmission packet is completed. After completing reception of the transmission packet, in Step <b>315</b> the client terminal <b>500</b> performs a predefined process on the received transmission packet to output them. For example, the client terminal <b>500</b> specifies in advance the time for receiving an image and generates output data of an image by combining the packets received during the specified time. If the received packets have image division information, the client terminal <b>500</b> decides, by using such image division information, whether all packets necessary for a single image output are completely received.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0049">After receiving and processing the transmission packet, in Step <b>320</b> the client terminal <b>500</b> determines whether an image of the processed packet is valid. Then, the client terminal <b>500</b> displays the valid image in Step <b>325</b>. If any image is non-valid, the client terminal <b>500</b> does not perform the displaying Step <b>325</b> and ignores the non-valid image. Sometimes one or more image segments may be damaged due to unexpected reasons such as abnormal communication, and such damaged segments renders an image non-valid.</p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0050">Next, in Step <b>330</b> the client terminal <b>500</b> determines whether there is a request for messenger end. If the messenger end request occurs by a user or other terminals, in Step <b>335</b> the client terminal <b>500</b> ends a mobile messenger service in response to the end request. Otherwise, if there is no end request, the client terminal <b>500</b> repeats the above-discussed Steps <b>305</b> to <b>320</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0051">On the other hand, after sending the transmission packet of the image data in the above-discussed Step <b>230</b>, the host terminal <b>100</b> determines in Step <b>235</b> whether a predefined transmission period has passed. If the period passed, the host terminal <b>100</b> repeats the above-discussed Steps <b>220</b> to <b>225</b>. Otherwise, if the period did not pass, in Step <b>240</b> the host terminal <b>100</b> waits for the period to expire. Additionally, the host terminal <b>100</b> determines in Step <b>245</b> whether there is a request for image transmission cancel during waiting. If there is a transmission cancel request, in Step <b>250</b> the host terminal <b>100</b> keeps the text transmission/reception mode to perform text transmission and reception with the client terminal <b>500</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0052">Thereafter, in Step <b>255</b> the host terminal <b>100</b> determines whether there is a request for messenger end. If the messenger end request occurs by a user or other terminals, in Step <b>260</b> the host terminal <b>100</b> ends a mobile messenger service in response to the end request. Otherwise, if there is no end request, the host terminal <b>100</b> returns to the above-discussed Step <b>250</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0053">As discussed above, the host terminal <b>100</b> acquires an image in response to the image transmission request at a specified period, e.g. one second, and transmits the acquired image to the client terminal <b>500</b>. Moreover, this image transmission is directly accomplished between the host terminal <b>100</b> and the client terminal <b>500</b> without intervention of any server. Accordingly, each user of a mobile messenger service can look at an image of the counterpart.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0054"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> is a block diagram showing a mobile communication terminal for image transmission in a mobile messenger service in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> refers to the host terminal <b>100</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1 to 3</figref>. Since the host terminal has the substantially same configuration in structure as the client terminal, the mobile communication terminal shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref> can be also applied to the client terminals discussed above.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0055">Referring to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, the host terminal <b>100</b> includes an image acquisition unit <b>110</b>, a transmission packet creation unit <b>120</b>, a PDSN interface unit <b>130</b>, an image decoder <b>140</b>, a user interface unit <b>150</b>, a control unit <b>160</b>, a wireless communication interface unit <b>170</b>, a memory unit <b>180</b> and a display unit <b>190</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0056">The image acquisition unit <b>110</b> obtains image data. Specifically, the image acquisition unit <b>110</b> captures in real time an image of a user who is utilizing the mobile messenger service, under control of the control unit <b>160</b>. For this, the image acquisition unit <b>110</b> has a camera lens configured to face toward a user. When a user looks at the display unit <b>190</b> or operates the user interface unit <b>150</b>, i.e. a keypad, the camera lens in the image acquisition unit <b>110</b> faces toward a user. Therefore, the camera lens may be located at the front face of the host terminal <b>100</b> or, at least during a mobile messenger service, be adjustable in location or direction as if located at the front face.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0057">The transmission packet creation unit <b>120</b> converts an image acquired by the image acquisition unit <b>110</b> into a proper format for transmission through the PDSN (<b>400</b> in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). For example, the transmission packet creation unit <b>120</b> divides the image into one-time transmittable segments and then compresses them by using the JPEG method. Furthermore, the transmission packet creation unit <b>120</b> creates a transmission packet of the compressed image segments such that a header of the packet includes the IP address of the host terminal <b>100</b>, i.e. a sender, and the IP address of the client terminal <b>500</b>, i.e. a receiver.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0058">The PDSN interface unit <b>130</b> performs data communication with the PDSN (<b>400</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>). For example, the PDSN interface unit <b>130</b> performs data communication with the counterpart terminal, such as the client terminal (<b>500</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>), registered in the buddy list of the host terminal <b>100</b> and is using a mobile messenger service. Especially, the PDSN interface unit <b>130</b> transmits the transmission packet of image data that the transmission packet creation unit <b>120</b> creates to the client terminal designated in the packet. In addition, the PDSN interface unit <b>130</b> receives another transmission packet of image data from the client terminal in use of a mobile messenger service.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0059">The image decoder <b>140</b> decodes the transmission packet of image data that the PDSN interface unit <b>130</b> receives. For example, the image decoder <b>140</b> decodes a JPEG compressed image contained in the transmission packet.</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0060">The user interface unit <b>150</b> offers an interface with a user to control operations of the host terminal <b>100</b>. Especially, the user interface unit <b>150</b> receives a user's action for transmitting a message, e.g. an invitation message, or transmitting an image in use of a mobile messenger service, and then sends a corresponding input signal to the control unit <b>160</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0061">In general, the control unit <b>160</b> controls the host terminal <b>100</b> according to input signals received from a user or by predefined operation programs. For example, when receiving a request for image transmission, the control unit <b>160</b> controls the image acquisition unit <b>110</b>, the transmission packet creation unit <b>120</b> and the PDSN interface unit <b>130</b> to acquire a sender's image and transmit it to a designated terminal. Especially, the control unit <b>160</b> sends the transmission packet of image data at a specified period, e.g., at intervals of one second. The control unit <b>160</b> also preferably enables the display unit <b>190</b> to display the image being transmitted.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0062">Additionally, the control unit <b>160</b> controls the image decoder <b>140</b> and the display unit <b>190</b> to process the transmission packet of image data received through the PDSN interface unit <b>130</b> and to display the processed image on a screen. Upon receiving the decoded image from the image decoder <b>140</b>, the control unit <b>160</b> determines the validity of the decoded image and only displays a valid image.

Especially, the memory unit <b>180</b> stores an address book <b>181</b>, a messenger program <b>183</b> and a buddy list <b>185</b>. The buddy list <b>185</b> is a series of persons to talk to via a mobile messenger service and is also called a conversation companion list.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0065">The display unit <b>190</b> outputs image data in a visual manner under control of the control unit <b>160</b>. For example, the display unit <b>190</b> represents an image received from a designated counterpart terminal using the mobile messenger service. The display unit <b>160</b> may include image display sections for conversation parties, a dialogue display section and a message input section.</p>
