<heading id="h-0002" level="1">FIELD OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This invention relates to an optical printing head and methods, for direct engraving of sensitive printing blocks. This is achieved by utilizing high power laser sources.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">Direct engraving of printing blocks such as flexographic plate or gravure cylinders requires carving three-dimensional (3D) images on plate material directly with a laser system. This is significantly different from two dimensional imaging techniques which require post processing steps to produce the three-dimensional features.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">This difference introduces several challenges for a laser imaging system for flexographic plates: the laser system must have sufficient power to ablate the material, and the laser spot should be small enough to achieve the fine detail required in quality printing. Although high power, high laser density does not necessary conflict with the laser focusability, from a practical perspective, these lasers have a high cost per watt ratio.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref> illustrates a flexographic printing plate. As illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>, because the flexographic plate is pressed directly on the printed media such as paper, packaging material, etc., the areas <b>10</b> which transfer ink to the printed media need to be elevated from blank areas <b>11</b> which do not transfer ink. Typically the ink transfer areas <b>10</b> require engraving at the depth of 70 microns, whereas non ink transfer areas <b>11</b> will need to be engraved to the depth of 500-700 microns. The required depth of the blank areas is such that when the flexo plate is pressed against another surface, for instance the ink carrying agent, e.g., anilox roll, and subsequently on the printed media, these blank areas will be kept out of contact with other surfaces.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">In printing, a plate is pressed firmly against another surface, such as packaging. Because a flexo plate is deformable, imaging features separated by large blank areas will be deformed more strongly. As a result, large blank areas will be pushed towards the contact surface more strongly than small blank areas. This is depicted schematically in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, where the applied pressure <b>20</b> pushes large blank area <b>21</b> more strongly than small blank area <b>22</b> towards press contact surface <b>23</b>. Therefore, large blank areas must maintain greater depth than small areas, sufficient to prevent contact with the contact surface. To summarize the above, it follows that fine blank areas can be engraved by the laser system to a shallower relief than that required for large areas.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In graphic arts large, blank areas are identified to produce large non ink areas when printed. The regions with small blank areas correspond to fine detail areas when printed. The energy required to engrave a flexographic plate area, equivalent of 1 square centimeter in a depth of 1 micron is about 0.45 Joule. Typical electrical power required for removing flexographic plate non ink transfer areas <b>11</b> will be on the order of 1000 of watts whereas, ink transfer areas <b>10</b> will need about 200 watts. The ratio of the above electrical consumption correlates to the depths of ink transfer areas <b>10</b> and non ink transfer areas <b>11</b>, 70 micron for ink transfer areas <b>10</b> and 500-700 microns for areas <b>11</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The engraving process of flexographic plate production generates large amount of debris. This creates a challenge to remove the generated debris, consisting of small residual particles and emission of gas, in an effective manner. This adds extra complexity and cost to the process. The above problems are solved by the present invention.</p>
<heading id="h-0004" level="1">SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Briefly, according to one aspect of the present invention an optical imaging apparatus for direct engraving flexographic plates comprises at least two laser sources, each emitting laser beams. A mirror or prism is placed in front of each of the laser sources to alter an optical path of each of the laser beams. The laser beams cut the flexographic plate at different depths and cut out chunks of the flexographic plate.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">The engraving by slicing system (&#x201c;EBS&#x201d;) according to the present invention takes advantage of the fact that while large solid areas need to be processed by the laser to a certain depth relief, fine detail areas can be processed to significantly shallower relief.</p>

<heading id="h-0006" level="1">DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</heading>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">The present invention describes an engraving by slicing printing head capable of engraving printing blocks, such as flexographic plates, gravure cylinders and letter press cylinders. Flexographic plates will be used in the examples and throughout the detailed description, although other types of plates may be cut according to the present invention. The present invention suggests several configurations, dependent upon the arrangement of an engraving device, described below.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">The present invention suggests using known laser engraving means to engrave in a 3D fashion all the ink transfer areas <b>31</b> of the flexographic plate as is illustrated by <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>. The removed non ink transfer chunks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> are treated in a different manner. The laser power is applied in 2D manner instead of in 3D. Laser beams <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> are applied on the flexographic plate to engrave into the plate in two directions <b>32</b> and <b>34</b> to cut a chunk of the removed non ink transfer area <b>36</b> out of the flexographic plate, while the plate is rotating on the drum in the fast scan direction <b>54</b>, with surface motion vertical to the laser beams. The laser beams are further applied at a determined delta step in the slow direction <b>55</b> to cut another chunk as is illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>, by applying laser beams <b>33</b> and <b>35</b> in order to cut out non ink transfer chunk <b>38</b>, leaving a relative small residual chunk <b>37</b>, due to the 2D engraving constraints of the suggested invention. The cut non ink transfer chunks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> will be removed in one piece from the rotating drum at which the flexographic plate is mounted, due to the drum revolution.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">This invention introduces two major advantages to the flexographic plate production. The first is a substantial saving in the energy required to ablate the whole deep non ink transfer areas of a flexographic plate, such as removed non ink transfer chunks <b>36</b> and <b>38</b>. The energy saving in engraving these areas can amount to 90%.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">The second advantage lies in the fact that non ink transfer chunks such as <b>36</b> and <b>38</b> will be removed in relatively large pieces, as opposed to the large quantities of small particles and emitted gas, which is generated by the 3D laser ablation process. The proposed method will immensely simplify the debris removal process from the engraving device.</p>
<p id="p-0024" num="0023"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 4 and 5</figref> illustrate the optical imaging apparatus <b>80</b> according to the present invention, comprising laser sources <b>43</b> and mirror or prisms <b>45</b>. Laser sources <b>43</b> emit two laser beams <b>44</b>, from two adjacent locations to form a triangle shape when the two laser beams <b>44</b> meet on the plate surface <b>48</b> or inside the plate at the deepest cut point <b>47</b>. In order to change the depth of laser beam <b>44</b> entrance into the plate <b>52</b> a glass triangular wedge prism <b>45</b> is introduced. The triangular wedge prism <b>45</b> moves in direction <b>49</b>, when beams <b>44</b> hit the wide part <b>41</b> of the triangular wedge prism <b>45</b>, laser beams <b>44</b> diffracts, thus enlarging the optical path, so the laser beams <b>44</b> will reach the plate surface <b>48</b>. When laser beams <b>44</b> hit triangular wedge prism <b>45</b> in the triangle wedge narrow part <b>42</b> of the triangular wedge prism <b>45</b>, it will propagate and enter into flexographic plate <b>52</b> into the deepest cut point <b>47</b>. Laser beams <b>44</b> that will hit triangular wedge prism <b>45</b> in between triangle wedge wide part <b>41</b> and triangle wedge narrow part <b>42</b> will enter into flexographic plate <b>52</b> in between plate contact surface <b>48</b> and the deepest cut point <b>47</b>. Beams intensity is adjusted during the process. The beams penetration into the material will be stopped, at the stage where the pair of beams will reach to the crossing point. Note, mirrors may be used as an alternative to the prisms.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0024">The triangular wedge prism <b>45</b> is placed in front of the laser source <b>43</b> at the triangle wedge wide part position <b>41</b>, prior to entering into the flexographic plate <b>52</b>. In order to perform the entrance and cut the flexographic plate <b>52</b> the wedge is moved relative to the laser source till it is placed in front of the narrow part <b>42</b> of the wedge. At the stage when the deep cut is performed, the wedge will not move to form a continuous large cut. At the stage when the laser beams should exit the plate, the triangular wedge prism <b>45</b> will be moved till the triangle wedge wide part <b>41</b> of the wedge is placed in the front of the laser source <b>43</b>. This operation will form a cut chunk <b>46</b> to be removed from the plate by the act of the rotation of the drum. An alternative method to the triangle wedge prism <b>45</b>, in order to diffract the laser beams <b>44</b> optical path can be applied by a mirror system. The optical diffraction means such triangular wedge prism <b>45</b> can be introduced just in front of a single laser source <b>43</b>, whereas the other laser source will be focused to the maximal depth in the plate material, this will result in a different shape of the cut chunk to be removed <b>46</b>. Note also that while the examples show the prisms or mirrors moving laterally with respect to each other, they may also be rotated or tilted to achieve a similar effect. Movement or rotation of mirrors or prisms <b>45</b> may be accomplished by conventional means known in the art and represented schematically by movement mechanism <b>82</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0025"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> shows the laser beam entrance position <b>61</b> into flexographic plate <b>52</b>, till it hits the deepest cut point <b>47</b>. The flexographic plate <b>52</b> mounted on the rotating drum <b>51</b> is moving in direction <b>64</b>, thus causing the laser sources <b>43</b> to cut inside the flexographic plate <b>52</b> in the direction of the plate horizontal movement <b>63</b>. At the point the cut is finalized the laser beam will exit the plate via exit position <b>62</b>. This will form a cut chunk <b>65</b>, illustrated in a 3D view.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0026"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 7 and 8</figref> show another embodiment for engraving into the flexographic plate <b>52</b>. The pair of laser sources <b>43</b> are used without triangular wedge prism <b>45</b>, the laser sources <b>43</b> are focused to the maximal depth of the plate material. This will result in cutting to the deepest cut point inside, to form main cut chunk area <b>71</b>. In addition a high power pulse laser source <b>74</b> is deployed to ablate the entrance and the exit of the chunk area <b>71</b>. The entrance and exit areas <b>72</b> will be ablated by the pulse laser beams <b>73</b> from pulse laser source <b>74</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0027">The invention has been described in detail with particular reference to certain preferred embodiments thereof, but it will be understood that variations and modifications can be effected within the scope of the invention.</p>
