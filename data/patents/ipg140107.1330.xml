<heading id="h-0001" level="1">CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION</heading>
<p id="p-0002" num="0001">This patent application is based on and claims priority pursuant to 35 U.S.C. &#xa7;119 to Japanese Patent Application No. 2011-177912, filed on Aug. 16, 2011 in the Japan Patent Office, the entire disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference herein.</p>
<heading id="h-0002" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="p-0003" num="0002">1. Technical Field</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">This disclosure relates to an image forming apparatus, and more specifically to an image forming apparatus having a carriage mounting a recording head for ejecting liquid droplets.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">2. Description of the Related Art</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Image forming apparatuses are used as printers, facsimile machines, copiers, plotters, or multi-functional devices having two or more of the foregoing capabilities. As one type of image forming apparatus employing a liquid-ejection recording method, for example, an inkjet recording apparatus is known that uses a recording head (liquid ejection head or liquid-droplet ejection head) for ejecting droplets of ink.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">Such a liquid-ejection-type image forming apparatus may have a maintenance device (maintenance-and-recovery device) to maintain and recover the ejection stability of nozzles of the recording head. The maintenance device includes, for example, a suction cap to cap a nozzle face of the recording head for sucking and discharging liquid from the nozzles, a moisture retention cap to prevent drying of ink in the nozzles and incorporation of dust into the nozzles, and a wiper member (also referred to as wiper blade, wiping blade, or blade) to wipe and clean the nozzle face of the recording head. The maintenance device performs, for example, recovery operation to form nozzle menisci by wiping the nozzle face by the wiping member after viscosity-increased ink is discharged from the nozzles to the suction cap.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">As a conventional type of maintenance device, for example, JP-09-300644-A proposes a maintenance device movable in a sub-scanning direction perpendicular to a main scanning direction between a maintenance position at which the maintenance device opposes the recording head mounted on the carriage to perform maintenance and recovery operation and a retreat position at which the maintenance device does not oppose the recording head.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">To enhance the productivity, in an image forming apparatus, recording heads for ejecting the same color of liquid droplets are arranged in an offset manner so as to be placed at different positions in the sub-scanning direction, thus increasing the printing width of the recording heads in the sub-scanning direction at which the recording heads can print an image by a single main scanning operation. For the image forming apparatus, a maintenance device includes maintenance units arranged so that the respective recording heads displaced in the sub-scanning direction can oppose the corresponding maintenance units.</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">Such a configuration increases the number of components of the maintenance device and the space in the main scanning direction, thus increasing the width of the apparatus body (the apparatus size in the main scanning direction).</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">In an aspect of this disclosure, there is provided an image forming apparatus including an apparatus body, a carriage, a first recording head, a second recording head, and a maintenance assembly. The carriage is movable in a main scanning direction. The first recording head has nozzles in a nozzle face thereof to eject liquid droplets. The second recording head has nozzles in a nozzle face thereof to eject liquid droplets. The second recording head is displaced from the first recording head in a sub scanning direction perpendicular to the main scanning direction. The maintenance assembly maintains and recovers the first recording head and the second recording head. The maintenance assembly includes a first maintenance device and a second maintenance device. The first maintenance device is held by the apparatus body. The second maintenance device is reciprocally movable between a first position to oppose the first recording head and a second position to oppose the second recording head.</p>

The carriage <b>3</b> is reciprocally moved for scanning in the main scanning direction MSD by a main scanning motor via a timing belt looped between a driving pulley and a driven pulley.</p>
<p id="p-0038" num="0037">The carriage <b>3</b> mounts recording heads <b>4</b><i>a</i>, <b>4</b><i>b</i>, <b>4</b><i>c</i>, and <b>4</b><i>d </i>(collectively referred to as &#x201c;recording heads <b>4</b>&#x201d; unless distinguished) formed with four liquid ejection heads for ejecting liquid droplets. The recording heads <b>4</b> are mounted on the carriage <b>3</b> so that multiple nozzle rows, each of which includes multiple nozzles, are arranged in parallel to the sub-scanning direction SSD perpendicular to the main scanning direction MSD and liquid droplets are ejected downward from the nozzles.</p>
<p id="p-0039" num="0038">The recording head <b>4</b><i>a </i>is displaced from the recording heads <b>4</b><i>b </i>to <b>4</b><i>d </i>by a width of one head (one nozzle row) in the sub-scanning direction SSD perpendicular to the main scanning direction MSD. Each of the recording heads <b>4</b><i>a </i>to <b>4</b><i>d </i>has two nozzle rows. The recording heads <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b </i>eject liquid droplets of the same black color, and the recording heads <b>4</b><i>c </i>and <b>4</b><i>d </i>eject liquid droplets of e.g., magenta (M), cyan (C), and yellow (Y) from respective nozzle rows.</p>
<p id="p-0040" num="0039">As a result, monochrome images can be formed at a width of two heads by a single scanning (main scanning) operation of the recording heads <b>4</b><i>a </i>and <b>4</b><i>b</i>, and color images can be formed by, for example, the recording heads <b>4</b><i>b </i>to <b>4</b><i>d. </i></p>
<p id="p-0041" num="0040">Each of the recording heads <b>4</b><i>a </i>to <b>4</b><i>d </i>has a head tank <b>5</b> to supply liquid to each recording head <b>4</b>.

<p id="p-0042" num="0041">The image forming apparatus has a conveyance belt <b>12</b> serving as a conveyance member to convey a sheet while attaching the sheet thereon by static electricity. The conveyance belt <b>12</b> is an endless belt that is looped between a conveyance roller <b>13</b> and a tension roller <b>14</b> so as to circulate in a belt conveyance direction (sub-scanning direction). A charging roller <b>15</b> charges (applies electric charges to) the conveyance belt <b>12</b> during circulation of the conveyance belt <b>12</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0043" num="0042">The conveyance roller <b>13</b> is circulated by a sub-scanning motor via a timing belt and a timing pulley, so that the conveyance belt <b>12</b> circulates in the sub-scanning direction indicated by an arrow SSD illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0044" num="0043">At one end in the main scanning direction of the carriage <b>3</b>, a maintenance assembly (maintenance-and-recovery assembly) <b>20</b> is disposed near a lateral side of the conveyance belt <b>12</b> to perform maintenance and recovery on the recording heads <b>4</b>. At the opposite end in the main scanning direction, a first dummy ejection receptacle <b>24</b> is disposed near the opposite lateral side of the conveyance belt <b>12</b> to receive liquid droplets ejected from the recording heads <b>4</b> by dummy ejection in which liquid droplets not contributing to image formation are ejected for maintenance, e.g., removal of viscosity-increased liquid or bubbles.</p>

<p id="p-0046" num="0045">In the image forming apparatus having the above-described configuration, a sheet P is fed from a sheet feed tray, attached on the conveyance belt <b>12</b> charged, and conveyed in the sub-scanning direction SSD with the circulation of the conveyance belt <b>12</b>. By driving the recording heads <b>4</b> in response to image signals while moving the carriage <b>3</b> in the main scanning direction MSD, liquid droplets are ejected onto the sheet P, which is stopped below the recording heads <b>4</b>, to form one line of a desired image. Then, the sheet P is fed by a certain distance to prepare for the next operation to record another line of the image. Receiving a signal indicating that the image recording has been completed or the rear end of the sheet P has arrived at the recording area, the recording heads <b>4</b> finish the recording operation and the sheet P is output to a sheet output tray.</p>
