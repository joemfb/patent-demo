<p id="p-0003" num="0002">This application is related to the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/112,696, filed Apr. 21, 2005, and entitled &#x201c;SYSTEMS AND METHODS FOR ADMINISTRATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS,&#x201d; which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. This application is also related to the U.S. patent application filed on the same date herewith and entitled &#x201c;GRAPHICAL PRESENTATION OF MEDICAL DATA,&#x201d; which is incorporated herein in its entirety.</p>
<heading id="h-0003" level="1">BACKGROUND</heading>
<p id="h-0004" num="0000">Electronic Messaging</p>
<p id="p-0004" num="0003">The present invention relates to the use of electronic messages to transfer data. More particularly, it involves the transfer of data in electronic messages with no loss of semantic data and/or other metadata or other meaning associated with the data, with application to the transfer of medical data.</p>
<p id="p-0005" num="0004">Electronic messaging comprises the use of computerized services to send and receive electronic data, which may comprise, e.g., text, audio, video, and/or other electronic data.</p>
<p id="p-0006" num="0005">Many forms of electronic messaging are well known, e.g., electronic mail (or email) and instant messaging. For example, depending on the system, email may comprise a system for sending asynchronous messages to one or more users. Again depending on the system, an email message may comprise a title or subject, a body that primarily comprises text, and/or one or more attachments, which may comprise computer files and/or other electronic data.</p>
<p id="p-0007" num="0006">According to the prior art, an attachment to an electronic message is often a computer file. Attaching the file comprises including a representation of the entire contents of the file and descriptive data in the representation of the electronic message. When the electronic message is received, the attachment may be extracted and possibly saved as a new file by the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0008" num="0007">In some instances, a sender may itself be a computer program or system. For example, a computer may be configured to periodically transfer a log as an electronic message. Such a message may be composed and transferred without human intervention.</p>
<p id="p-0009" num="0008">The transport and representation of electronic messages as email across the Internet <b>7</b> are well known and described in publicly-available Internet standards, which are called Requests for Comment (&#x201c;RFCs&#x201d;). Relevant RFCs comprise RFC2822 (available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2822.txt), RFC2045 (available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2045.txt), RFC2046 (available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2046.txt), RFC2047 (available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2047.txt), RFC2048 (available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2048.txt), and RFC2049 (available at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2049.txt), among others. Other ways to represent and/or transport electronic messages are also well known. As described in these RFCs, the representation of an electronic message comprises representations of the message and the content of any attachments.</p>
<p id="h-0005" num="0000">Electronic Health Records</p>
<p id="p-0010" num="0009">A number of things have driven the growth in all aspects of the health care industry of computerized systems providing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Electronic Medical Records (EMRs). (The term &#x201c;EHR system&#x201d; is used herein to refer to any computerized system that may store, maintain, and/or provide EHRs. This term may have other significance in other contexts.) For example, governmental regulation continues to move towards impelling the adoption of EHR systems. In addition, EHR systems reduce the chances of loss of patient records and mistakes in data entry and make delivery of health care more efficient, thereby offering the prospects of improving patient care while lowering its cost. Further, EHR systems may help ease the burden of paperwork that now afflicts the delivery of health care.</p>
<p id="p-0011" num="0010">An EHR system may record and aggregate any type of data associated with health care, including, e.g., data about patients, including, e.g., their names, addresses, insurance coverage and/or other financial arrangements, health conditions, allergies, procedures undergone, and/or tests performed. Other recorded data may relate to, among other things, health care providers, payers, pharmacies, and/or employers.</p>
<p id="p-0012" num="0011">Electronic data of any sort is often associated with other data that describes it, provides context for it, associates it with other data, and/or otherwise signifies the meaning, significance, and/or one or more other attributes of the electronic data. This accompanying data is often called &#x201c;metadata.&#x201d;</p>
<p id="p-0013" num="0012">For example, in the medical field, an application may display the results of a blood test for cholesterol levels. The display may include data such as the levels of total cholesterol, HDLs, and LDLs, among other data. Some or all of this data may be associated with further data, such as the date of the test, the location where the blood sample was drawn, the identity of the laboratory (&#x201c;lab&#x201d;) that analyzed the sample, the identity of the patient, and the identity of the practitioner who ordered the test, and this further data can be considered metadata. The appropriate characterization of data sometimes depends on the ways in which it is treated in computerized files, applications, and/or systems.</p>
<p id="p-0014" num="0013">A health care provider may wish to transfer data, contained in an EHR system, about one or more patients, to other providers, for example, in connection with a medical consultation.</p>
<heading id="h-0006" level="1">BRIEF SUMMARY</heading>
<p id="p-0015" num="0014">According to embodiments of the invention, data may be attached to an electronic message in the form of a reference that uniquely specifies a particular set of data, rather than including the data itself in the message. On receipt, the reference may be used to retrieve the attached data from a store for delivery to the recipient. For example, a computer file may be specified by a reference that comprises the name of a server and the path to the file on the server. When the recipient opens or views the message, the recipient's computer system may then contact the named server and request delivery of the specified file.</p>
<p id="p-0016" num="0015">An embodiment of the invention may alternatively use a reference to specify a set of data that is not a file. For example, a reference may specify a record or set of related records in a database. In a relational database management system, such as is well known, a record may exist as a row in a table or as linked rows in one or more tables. A primary key uniquely specifies a row, and an embodiment of the invention may therefore use a primary key as the reference. Alternatively, an embodiment may generate a unique identification code for use as a reference and then associate the code with the primary key of the attached data. An embodiment of the invention may also support association of more than one primary key with a single identification code, causing the system to provide multiple records when presented with the identification code.</p>
<p id="p-0017" num="0016">Similar techniques are applicable to other sorts of databases, such as object-oriented databases.</p>
<p id="p-0018" num="0017">When used to identify a set of data, a reference may specify structured data sets of varying complexity. For example, an application related to electronic commerce may in some contexts treat a customer's order as a single, atomic entity, even though the data associated with the order is stored in multiple records in a database. (Such a contextual entity is sometimes referred to herein as a &#x201c;data item.&#x201d;) But that same application may in other contexts treat the same order as a composite entity, comprising, e.g., a customer, a payment, a shipper, and one or more ordered items, each of which may itself be considered a data item in this context. These other data items may themselves be regarded in other contexts as composites that comprise more primitive data items, and so on. (The term &#x201c;hierarchical data item&#x201d; is intended to refer to data items that may also be considered as composites of more primitive data items.)</p>
<p id="p-0019" num="0018">A reference may point to data that is associated with other data that indicates meaning, context, or both. This other data (referred to herein as &#x201c;semantic data&#x201d;), may, e.g., indicate that a particular value is a price or quantity, has a particular data type, and a computer application may rely on such semantic data to be able to process the data automatically. Semantic data may be explicit, such as an explicit specification of a data type, which is linked to data. Semantic data may also be implicit: the meaning of a set of values may sometimes be inferred from the database table in which they are found. Depending on the embodiment of the invention, a reference in an electronic message may refer to data in its original context of semantic data and support access to such semantic data by the recipient of the message.</p>
<p id="p-0020" num="0019">In an embodiment of the invention, data is transferred via an electronic message that encodes a unique reference to some or all of the data. In an embodiment of the invention, sending data with an electronic message involves attaching to the electronic message unique references to one or more records that comprise the data. In a further embodiment of the invention, when the recipient saves a persistent copy of the received data, the database records that contain the data are duplicated, and further manipulation of the received data by the recipient involves the persistent copy of the data.</p>
<p id="p-0021" num="0020">In an embodiment of the invention, data associated with semantic data may be transferred and/or duplicated by receiving an electronic message that comprises at least one reference that uniquely specifies a set of data, wherein the set of data comprises one or more original data items that are associated with semantic data; presenting the electronic message to a recipient at a first computer system; in response to input to the first computer system, presenting at the first computer system some or all of the data comprised by the set of data; and, in response to further input to the first computer system, creating a persistent copy of some or all of the data comprised by the set of data; wherein creating a persistent copy comprises creating a persistent copy of at least one of the one or more original data items that are associated with semantic data, such that each copy of a data item is associated with the same semantic data that the corresponding original data item is associated with.</p>
<p id="p-0022" num="0021">In an embodiment of the invention, data associated with semantic data may be transferred and/or duplicated by receiving an electronic message that comprises at least one reference that uniquely specifies a hierarchical data item that comprises a plurality of data items; presenting the electronic message to a recipient at a first computer system; presenting to the recipient at the first computer system a user interface that comprises a display of a plurality of the plurality of data items comprised by the hierarchical data item and user interface components supporting individual selection of each data item; in response to input to the first computer system, selecting one or more of the displayed data items; and in response to further input to the first computer system, creating a persistent copy of each selected data item. In another embodiment of the invention, a reference may uniquely specify a collection of one or more hierarchical data items that each comprise a plurality of data items.</p>
<p id="p-0023" num="0022">An embodiment of the invention may be implemented in association with a computerized EHR system that comprises, among other patient care features, electronic lab test ordering, online delivery and viewing of lab results, and electronic eligibility checking and prescribing. An EHR system in association with which an embodiment of the invention can be implemented may provide patient care features that support some or all of a set of tasks comprising, among others:

<p id="p-0024" num="0040">Such an EHR system may enable access to clinical data for patients in locations that may comprise a provider's office, a hospital, and a provider's or patient's home and may provide encryption of data passed over networks comprising, for example, intranets or the Internet.</p>
<p id="p-0025" num="0041">Embodiments of the invention provide facilities for transferring electronic messages that have medical data attached. The transfer of data is done with no loss of metadata.</p>
<p id="p-0026" num="0042">For example, a physician using an EHR system may have electronic charts in the EHR system for one or more patients. Possibly in connection with referring a patient to another physician, the first physician desires to send data from the patient's chart to another physician who also uses the EHR system. Using the EHR system, the first physician creates an electronic message, selects and attaches the desired data, and then sends the electronic message. On delivery, the recipient can read the message, view the attached data, and, if desired, save some of all of the attached data to the recipient's own copy of the patient's chart.</p>
<p id="p-0027" num="0043">Depending on the embodiment of the invention, the sender of a message may attach any data that a patient's chart contains within the EHR system. Such data may comprise, e.g., one or more of the patient's medical conditions, lab tests ordered for the patient and their results, drug prescriptions, and other data typically found in health or medical records, whether electronic or otherwise.</p>
<p id="p-0028" num="0044">In an embodiment of the invention, sending data from a patient's chart with an electronic message involves attaching to the electronic message unique references to one or more database records that contain the data. In a further embodiment of the invention, when the recipient saves received data to the recipient's chart for a patient, the database record or records that contain the data are duplicated, and a reference or references to the duplicate records are stored in the recipient's copy of the patient's chart.</p>
<p id="p-0029" num="0045">In an embodiment of the invention, if the recipient of an electronic message containing patient data does not have a chart for that patient, the recipient may create such a chart before adding the received patient data to it.</p>

<p id="h-0009" num="0000">Electronic Messaging</p>
<p id="p-0047" num="0063"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a </i>depicts an example, according to the prior art, of an architecture <b>5</b> suitable for use in transferring email using the Internet <b>7</b>. A sender (not pictured) interacts with an originating system <b>10</b> to compose an electronic message. Such interaction may take place, for example, through an email application such as Eudora&#xae; or Outlook&#xae;, or through a web browser, such as Firefox&#x2122; or Safari&#x2122;, that interacts with an email service such as GMail&#x2122; or Yahoo!&#xae; Mail.</p>
<p id="p-0048" num="0064">When it is desired to send an electronic message, the message may be sent from the originating system <b>10</b> to an email server <b>12</b>. In connection with email sent via the Internet <b>7</b>, the email server <b>12</b> locates the email server <b>14</b> associated with each recipient (not pictured) and transfers the message via the Internet <b>7</b>. The recipient then interacts with the recipient system <b>16</b> to receive electronic messages from the email server <b>14</b>. The recipient's interaction with the recipient system <b>16</b> may take place similarly to the sender's interaction with the originating system <b>10</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0049" num="0065"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b </i>depicts an alternative architecture <b>20</b>, according to the prior art, that is also suitable for use in transferring electronic messages. As discussed in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a</i>, above, a sender (not pictured) interacts with an originating system <b>22</b> to compose an electronic message. When it is desired to send the message, the message may be transferred from the originating system <b>22</b> to a mail server <b>24</b>. The recipient (not pictured) interacts with the recipient system <b>26</b> to receive the email from the mail server <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0050" num="0066">The architectures depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a </i>and <b>1</b><i>b </i>may be combined in certain electronic messaging systems. For example, when one user of an Internet service provider (&#x201c;ISP&#x201d;) (not pictured) sends a message to another user of the same ISP, the message may be transferred through an architecture <b>20</b> such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>. When that same user sends a message to a user of a different ISP, however, the message may be transferred through an architecture <b>5</b> such as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>a. </i></p>
<p id="p-0051" num="0067"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c </i>depicts one possible architecture <b>28</b> (of many) upon which embodiments of the invention may exist. As in the architecture depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>b</i>, a sender (not pictured) interacts with an originating system <b>22</b> to compose an electronic message. When it is desired to send the message, the message may be transferred from the originating system <b>22</b> to a mail server <b>24</b>. The recipient (not pictured) interacts with the recipient system <b>26</b> to receive the email from the mail server <b>24</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0052" num="0068">The mail server <b>24</b> is in communication with a database <b>30</b>. A database may contain one or more records, and one or more identifiers may uniquely identify a record within a database. For example, relational database management systems, in which data are represented in tabular form, are well known. A record in such a table may be represented as a row, and a value called a &#x201c;primary key&#x201d; may uniquely identify each row within that table.</p>
<p id="p-0053" num="0069">It is well known that complex data sets and data structures may be represented by including in a row one or more references to other rows in the same and/or other tables. Associations between data sets may be represented in the same way. Such an association may, for example, link data with relevant metadata.</p>
<p id="p-0054" num="0070">The nature of the data store and the reference will depend on the embodiment of the invention. The data store need not be a database <b>30</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>, or a file server, but may be any store of electronic data from which a unique reference to data may be used to retrieve that data. For instance, the data store may be part of a distributed object-oriented application, and the reference may be a unique object reference within the system.</p>
<p id="p-0055" num="0071">The data store need not be in direct communication with the mail server <b>24</b>, as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 1</figref><i>c</i>. For example, the originating system <b>22</b> may insert a unique reference to electronic data into an electronic message. On receipt, the recipient system <b>26</b> may then use that reference to retrieve the referred-to data from a data store.</p>
<p id="p-0056" num="0072">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the architectures depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIGS. 1</figref><i>a</i>-<b>1</b><i>c </i>are just a few of many suitable for the described implementations. More than one component may be involved in performing one or more of the functions of the system, depending on the expected load and other factors. Functions depicted as being performed by separate components may in some implementations be performed by a single component, again, depending on the expected load and other needs of the system. Other configurations of servers and network topologies may work as well as those described here.</p>
<p id="h-0010" num="0000">EHR Architecture</p>
<p id="p-0057" num="0073">In the discussion that follows, the invention is discussed in connection with EHR systems. Such discussion is meant to illustrate the invention with respect to certain preferred embodiments, but it is to be understood that the discussion is illustrative and not limiting. It will be appreciated by one skilled in the art that electronic messaging according to the invention may transfer any sort of electronic data by reference, not just medical or health-related data, and not only in connection with EHR systems.</p>
<p id="p-0058" num="0074"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts an example of an architecture <b>100</b> suitable for use with an EHR system.</p>
<p id="p-0059" num="0075">An EHR system itself may comprise computer software, software components, or both, executing on one or more servers <b>102</b>. One or more interconnected local area networks <b>104</b> may connect the server <b>102</b> to one or more database servers <b>106</b>, each of which provides access to one or more databases <b>108</b>. The local area network may also contain one or more systems <b>110</b> that provide access to patients' medical histories, which may be stored in one or more local databases <b>112</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0060" num="0076">In the architecture depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, communication with other sources and consumers of information is achieved using the Internet <b>7</b>. Access to the Internet may optionally be through one or more firewalls, gateways, and/or other security arrangements <b>117</b>. Other means of communication may also be used instead of or in addition to the Internet, such as dial-up lines, dedicated leased lines, and private wide area networks (not pictured).</p>
<p id="p-0061" num="0077">As depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref>, patient medical data may be stored in one or more databases <b>108</b>, <b>112</b> and/or may be obtained from one or more external sources, such as server <b>130</b>, which itself has access to a database <b>132</b> through a database server <b>134</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0062" num="0078">Information about health insurance and other forms of payment may be received electronically from one or more sources <b>137</b>. Prescription insurance data, which may comprise formulary data and rules, may also be received electronically from one or more sources, such as RxHub&#xae; <b>140</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0063" num="0079">An EHR system may be connected to one or more medical laboratories <b>142</b>. Similarly, an EHR system may be connected to one or more pharmacies <b>144</b>, directly and/or through a prescribing hub such as SureScripts&#x2122; <b>146</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0064" num="0080">Access to the EHR system is by one or more clients <b>148</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0065" num="0081">It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the architecture depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> is just one of many suitable for implementation of the invention. More than one component may be involved in performing one or more of the functions of the system, depending on the expected load and other factors. Functions depicted as being performed by separate components may in some implementations be performed by a single component, again, depending on the expected load and other needs of the system. Other configurations of servers and network topologies may work as well as those described here.</p>
<p id="p-0066" num="0082">An EHR system may be configured to restrict access to patients' medical records so that only authorized users have access to them. Such restrictions may be implemented, for example, to comply with laws and/or regulations concerning the protection of confidential medical data. Access to a particular patient's chart may therefore be restricted, e.g., to a practitioner, or to the practitioner and the practitioner's office staff, or those practitioners associated together within a specific medical practice, among many possibilities.</p>
<p id="p-0067" num="0083">A user may be a member of one or more health care organizations, and an embodiment of an EHR system may limit users' interaction with the EHR system so that a user may be associated with only one such organization at a time. But such an EHR system may also allow a user to switch between those organizations as needed while remaining logged in to the application. If a user belongs to more than one organization, that user may have different permissions under each and may also have access to different features of the embodiment. Depending on the EHR system, if each organization maintains a separate patient population, a user may not be able to access patients that exist within one organization while that user is logged in under a different organization.</p>
<p id="p-0068" num="0084">EHR systems typically include means to authenticate the users. Well-known examples of such means include, but are not limited to, requiring a user: to log in with, e.g., a user name and password; to provide biometric information, e.g., via a fingerprint or retinal scan at the point of use; to provide a physical token or information provided by one, e.g., a temporarily valid access code; or some or all of these and/or other means. An embodiment may limit access to some or all of the functions of the embodiment, including the user interface depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> and/or other user interfaces, to successfully authenticated users or to subsets of them.</p>
<p id="p-0069" num="0085"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows an initial (or &#x201c;Home&#x201d;) screen <b>200</b> of an EHR system that may serve to allow a user to begin interacting with the system. This depicted screen <b>200</b> and those that follow may be used in connection with use of a thin client, such as a web browser. Other types of clients and/or other user interfaces (not pictured), with elements that correspond to those described herein as needed by the respective embodiments, may also be supported. EHR systems may support interaction with the user interface by well-known means for interacting with computer systems, which may comprise accepting user input via a pointing device such as a mouse and a keyboard and displaying output on a computer monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0070" num="0086">The Home screen <b>200</b> may comprise certain navigation elements and cues common to some or all other user interface screens of an EHR system. Such common elements may comprise a function-specific navigation pane <b>202</b> that contains one or more links for accessing tasks related to the functional area currently being used and a function-specific content pane <b>204</b> displays content related to the task currently being performed.</p>
<p id="p-0071" num="0087">Another such common element may be a navigation bar <b>210</b> that provides access to a number of general system functions. The navigation bar <b>210</b> displays the name of the organization or care site <b>212</b> currently associated with the user's interaction with the embodiment. If a user is associated with more than one organization or care site, the user may choose the one to associate with the interaction by clicking on this item.</p>
<p id="p-0072" num="0088">Selecting the Preferences item <b>214</b> allows selection of one of several user preference options to see and possibly change. Such options may comprise, e.g., customizing user preference settings, specifying favorite states for pharmacy searches (discussed further below under the heading &#x201c;ePrescribing&#x201d;), and changing the user's login password, among other things.</p>
<p id="p-0073" num="0089">Selecting the Support item <b>216</b> allows selection of one of several user support options. Such options may comprise, e.g., sending feedback to system administrators, downloading and installing available product updates, and composing an email to a support team, among other things.</p>
<p id="p-0074" num="0090">Selecting the What's New? item <b>218</b> causes display of information regarding new features of the system, if any.</p>
<p id="p-0075" num="0091">Selecting the Help item <b>220</b> allows selection of user documentation to be displayed. Such documentation may comprise, e.g., online help and/or a comprehensive user manual, among other things. In a particular EHR system, the selected documentation may appear in a new window (not pictured) on a computer monitor.</p>
<p id="p-0076" num="0092">Selecting the Logout item <b>222</b> logs the user out of the system. In an EHR system that provides user authentication, this may have the effect of requiring a user to authenticate anew before using the other features of the system.</p>
<p id="p-0077" num="0093">An EHR system's user interface may comprise functional tabs <b>240</b> that provide direct access to functional areas of the system. In the system depicted, the Home tab <b>242</b> causes redisplay of the Home screen <b>200</b>, which may be updated to display the latest information available. Selecting the Clinical tab <b>244</b> provides access to patient-related services, which may comprise, e.g., patient management, lab orders, lab results, and prescription orders. Selecting the Admin tab <b>246</b> provides access to administrative functions. In typical EHR systems, not all users have permission to use administrative functions.</p>
<p id="p-0078" num="0094">Some or all navigation discussed in connection with the navigation bar <b>210</b>, the functional tabs <b>240</b>, and/or the links displayed in the function-specific navigation pane <b>202</b> may be provided or duplicated by hyperlinks elsewhere in the screen <b>200</b>. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref> shows one example of such duplication in the form of a cluster <b>248</b> of hyperlinks in the function-specific content pane <b>204</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0079" num="0095">The Home screen <b>200</b> may provide access to the most commonly used facilities and information provided by the system. The function-specific content pane <b>204</b> displays a snapshot <b>250</b> of many of the activities occurring within the system that relate to the user and associated patients. Such a snapshot may comprise a count <b>252</b> of the new lab results that have been received, which may be further be broken down by whether those results are final <b>254</b> or partial <b>256</b>, and may also show whether any of the results are abnormal. The snapshot may comprise the number <b>260</b> of new user messages in the user's inbox, the number <b>264</b> of prescriptions that are pending approval, and/or other information.</p>
<p id="p-0080" num="0096">A user interface to an EHR system may allow direct return from other user interface screens to the Home screen <b>200</b>, displaying snapshot <b>250</b>, through clicking on the Home tab <b>242</b>. When the Home screen <b>200</b> is already displayed, clicking on the Home tab <b>242</b> may, in some systems, cause the content to be updated to the latest information available.</p>
<p id="p-0081" num="0097">The Home screen <b>250</b> may provide means to navigate the information and functions provided by an EHR system. Searching for a patient, for example, may be done by entering a name in Search field <b>270</b>. Upon submission of the search, the system may cause information to be displayed regarding one or more matching patients or notification that no matches were found. Such information may appear in the function-sensitive content pane of Home screen <b>200</b>, or it may appear in part of another screen such as patient selection screen <b>290</b>, which is discussed below in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0082" num="0098">Other navigational facilities may exist. The function-specific navigation pane <b>202</b> links to other facilities and information provided by an EHR system. Depending on the system and the information currently available to the user, the links may include, for example, a &#x201c;New Results&#x201d; link <b>275</b> that causes the system to display new lab results, if any, and a &#x201c;Messages&#x201d; link <b>277</b> that provides access to user messaging functionality. Other links may be present for any other information and/or facility provided by the system.</p>
<p id="p-0083" num="0099">Navigational facilities may also exist within the function-specific content pane <b>204</b>. For example, in the Action Items area <b>264</b>, there may be links to various items that require attention. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 2</figref> depicts such a link to ePrescribing functionality, which is discussed below.</p>
<p id="h-0011" num="0000">Patient Management</p>
<p id="p-0084" num="0100">Use of an EHR system may be organized conceptually around one or more aspects of EHRs or their management. For example, parts of the following discussion and the accompanying figures describe EHR systems that organize access to data around individual patients and the respective records that are associated with them. (Following historical practice, a collection of records for a single patient in an EHR system is sometimes referred to as that patient's &#x201c;chart.&#x201d;) It will be obvious to one skilled in the relevant arts that EHR systems may be organized differently, e.g., around practitioners singly or in groups, payers, hospitals, or pharmacies without affecting the substance of the systems implemented or methods performed. It will be equally obvious that EHR systems may be organized around one or more such aspects and that such organization may or may not depend on a particular user's activity at the time of use.</p>
<p id="p-0085" num="0101">EHR systems typically maintain EHRs for patients. In that regard, an EHR system may provide functionality comprising some or all of adding new patients, accessing patient charts, viewing patient data, and editing patient data.</p>
<p id="p-0086" num="0102">EHR systems may vary in the way they provide for access to patient data and related functionality. From screen <b>200</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), a user may select the Clinical tab <b>244</b> (or the Clinical hyperlink <b>283</b>), which give access to functionality associated with clinical practice. Depending on the configuration of the system, that selection may lead directly to <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, which displays a patient selection screen <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0087" num="0103">Some EHR systems may instead be configured to lead to different functionality upon selection of the Clinical tab <b>244</b> or hyperlink <b>283</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 3</figref>), and that functionality may then comprise links to screen <b>290</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>). For example, a system may cause a link entitled &#x201c;Find a Patient&#x201d; <b>295</b> to appear in the function-sensitive navigation pane <b>202</b> when the Clinical tab <b>244</b> is selected. Selection of that link <b>295</b> then leads to display of screen <b>290</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0088" num="0104">Interfaces to one or more facilities for selecting a patient may comprise displays that appear in the function-sensitive content pane <b>204</b>. One such display is an area <b>300</b> containing a drop-down list <b>303</b> of the current user's most-recently-viewed patients. (An EHR system may let an administrator set a maximum number of patients that may appear in drop-down list <b>303</b>.) Once the desired patient is selected, clicking the button labeled &#x201c;Go&#x201d; <b>305</b> then leads to display of records associated with that patient.</p>
<p id="p-0089" num="0105">Another such interface is a search area <b>310</b> containing one or more controls that support searching for one or more patients. Depending on the system, one or more of the controls may comprise text entry controls that let a user specify, e.g., a patient's name <b>313</b>, Social Security number <b>315</b>, patient identification number <b>317</b>, and birth date <b>319</b>. Some EHR systems may permit searching based on partial matches, e.g., returning all records that merely begin with the text entered by the user or allowing &#x201c;wildcard&#x201d; characters in one or more search criteria that can be matched by any character or string of characters.</p>
<p id="p-0090" num="0106">The search area <b>310</b> may comprise other types of control. For example, a drop-down list <b>322</b> may list one or more medical practices or health care sites or facilities with which a user has relationships (collectively referred to as &#x201c;care sites&#x201d;). Selecting a care site from the drop-down list <b>322</b> limits the search results to patients affiliated with that care site.</p>
<p id="p-0091" num="0107">An EHR system may allow a user to execute a search after entering fewer than all possible search criteria. For example, an EHR system may support searching after the user has entered only the name &#x201c;Johnson&#x201d; in the Name text entry control <b>313</b>. Other systems may require entry of data into some or all specific text entry controls before a search can be done.</p>
<p id="p-0092" num="0108">After search criteria have been selected, the search may be executed by clicking the button labeled &#x201c;Search&#x201d; <b>325</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0093" num="0109">The search results area <b>330</b> lists patients whose records match the search criteria. Hyperlinks <b>332</b>, <b>334</b> lead to display of records related to a selected patient. EHR systems may also provide means by which a user may proceed directly from the display of matching patients to one or more activities involving a selected patient, e.g., writing a prescription, ordering lab tests, or modifying a patient's medical history, among many possible options.</p>
<p id="p-0094" num="0110">It may be desired to limit the number of matching patients that are displayed at once. In that case, a partial list may appear in the search results area <b>330</b>, and a control <b>340</b> such as the one displayed may be provided to support moving backward and forward through the list.</p>
<p id="p-0095" num="0111">In response to selection of a patient, e.g., via a hyperlink <b>332</b>, <b>334</b>, an EHR system may display a summary of data related to that patient, such as the summary screen <b>360</b> shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>. In such a system, the summary screen is a &#x201c;collapsed&#x201d; or summarized view of the patient's complete chart. The summary screen <b>360</b> may initially list only the latest patient data that is available for quick access and review. Viewing a more detailed history for the patient can be done by clicking individual items within each section of the summary screen <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0096" num="0112">The summary appears in the function-sensitive content pane <b>204</b> of the summary screen <b>360</b>. The summary comprises basic information <b>370</b> that identifies the patient, including, for example, the patient's name <b>372</b>, DOB (Date of Birth) <b>374</b>, age <b>376</b>, gender <b>378</b>, and PID (Patient ID) <b>380</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0097" num="0113">The summary also comprises a display of patient problems and/or conditions, illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> as an editable text area <b>385</b> labeled &#x201c;Patient Problems.&#x201d; This text area <b>385</b> may display any problems or other notes that have been recorded for the patient. Some EHR systems allow the user to type notes directly into this control.</p>
<p id="p-0098" num="0114">An area labeled &#x201c;Recent Tests&#x201d; <b>390</b> displays one or more lab tests <b>392</b> that have been ordered for the patient. The details of a result may be viewed by clicking on the name of the test <b>394</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0099" num="0115">Some EHR systems may allow viewing of tests by requisition (order). To support this functionality, the user interface screen illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> displays a options (not shown) when the user moves the pointer over the triangle <b>396</b> in the title bar <b>398</b>. For example, in response to a click on the option marked &#x201c;Requisition&#x201d; (not shown), tests will be presented, grouped by requisition. Other systems may support other or additional options for viewing lab tests, with appropriate user interface elements to support such options.</p>
<p id="p-0100" num="0116">Lab tests are discussed in more detail below under the heading &#x201c;Lab Orders and Results&#x201d;.</p>
<p id="p-0101" num="0117">An area <b>400</b> labeled &#x201c;Active Medications&#x201d; displays one or more medications <b>402</b> that have been prescribed for the patient (using ePrescribing, described below under that heading) and are still active. Details may be viewed by clicking the name <b>404</b> of a medication <b>402</b> appearing in this area. The user interface screen illustrated in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref> allows viewing of all medications prescribed for the patient&#x2014;including those that are currently inactive or that have been added from other sources&#x2014;in response to moving the pointer over the triangle <b>406</b> in the title bar <b>408</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0102" num="0118">An area <b>410</b> labeled &#x201c;Allergies&#x201d; displays any allergies that have been recorded for the patient.</p>
<p id="p-0103" num="0119">An area <b>420</b> labeled &#x201c;Related Messages&#x201d; displays user messages <b>422</b> that have been sent that contained a reference to the patient. As displayed in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, a user message <b>422</b> may contain a hyperlink <b>424</b> to more information associated with the message, comprising, for example, the text of the message and some or all data attached to the message. User messages are described in more detail below under the heading &#x201c;Messaging&#x201d; below.</p>
<p id="p-0104" num="0120">Each title bar <b>430</b> is a hyperlink or control that gives the user access to further details about the named area. For example, clicking on the &#x201c;Related Messages&#x201d; title bar <b>432</b> leads to more information about messages. The new information appears in the function-specific content pane <b>204</b> of user summary screen <b>360</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0105" num="0121">An EHR system may support searching for patients from the user summary screen <b>360</b>. For example, the search entry area <b>435</b> in the function-dependent navigation pane <b>202</b> may comprise one or more controls <b>438</b> for entering partial or complete search criteria. A search may be executed by selecting the button <b>440</b> labeled &#x201c;Search&#x201d;. An EHR system may provide a means to reach other searching facilities, such as the search screen <b>290</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, and an example of such means is the hyperlink labeled &#x201c;Find a Patient&#x201d; <b>442</b> in the function-specific navigation pane shown in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>.</p>
<p id="p-0106" num="0122">EHR systems may also provide user interfaces (not pictured) for adding and/or deleting patients and adding, removing, and/or modifying information associated with patients. Such interfaces may use user interface components that are well known in the relevant arts.</p>
<p id="h-0012" num="0000">ePrescribing</p>
<p id="p-0107" num="0123">EHR systems may comprise an electronic prescribing function, referred to as &#x201c;ePrescribing.&#x201d; ePrescribing may automate some or all aspects of prescription writing and renewal. In preparing a prescription, ePrescribing may retrieve patient benefit information from an information source such as RxHub&#xae; and its participating Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), which information may then in some embodiments be displayed to the person writing the prescription.</p>
<p id="p-0108" num="0124">ePrescribing may receive prescription renewals and submit prescriptions electronically or as faxes through an electronic prescribing network such as SureScripts&#x2122;. Implementations of ePrescribing may support submitting a prescription electronically to the patient's pharmacy of choice, and/or printing the prescription for hand delivery to a pharmacy. Some or all prescriptions written for a patient using ePrescribing may be stored in the patient's medication history, which may be part of the patient's chart maintained by an EHR system. The medication history can be used to store information about inactive medications as well as any additional prescription history retrieved from PBMs.</p>
<p id="p-0109" num="0125">An embodiment of ePrescribing may provide various different functions that comprise some or all of: displaying information regarding insurance coverage of medications and, depending on the embodiment, possible alternatives; checking for drug-to-drug interactions per prescription, and across the patient's medication history; and drug-to-allergy interactions per prescription. ePrescribing may comprise other functions related to medications, prescriptions, insurance, and/or billing besides or in addition to those specifically named.</p>
<p id="p-0110" num="0126">An embodiment of ePrescribing may comprise functions related to prescription drug formularies. A formulary is a list of drugs based on a specific payer and a specific payment plan. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 6</figref> illustrates the relationship between payers, plans, and formularies. The <figref idref="DRAWINGS">figure 460</figref> shows four payers <b>462</b>. Payer <b>1</b> (referenced by <b>464</b>) offers six different plans <b>466</b>. If, for example, Payer <b>1</b> is an employer, it may offer its employees six different plans <b>466</b>, each offering different benefits and requiring a different contribution from the employee. Each of these plans <b>466</b> is associated with its own distinct formulary.</p>
<p id="p-0111" num="0127">Similarly, Payer <b>2</b> (referenced by <b>470</b>) offers six different plans <b>472</b>, and each plan is associated with its own distinct formulary.</p>
<p id="p-0112" num="0128">Embodiments of ePrescribing may maintain an Active Medications list for patients. When used to create a prescription for a patient, ePrescribing may automatically save a record of each prescribed medication to the patient's Active Medications list, which may be accessible from the patient's summary, displayed in the patient summary screen <b>360</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). Medications can also be added manually to a patient's Active Medications list by activating previously inactive medications for which ePrescribing has a record and/or by adding them from a list of prescriptions maintained by one or more PBMs.</p>
<p id="p-0113" num="0129">Embodiments of ePrescribing may support user-specified rules that govern the contents of an Active Medications list. For example, a rule may set the maximum time that a prescription may be considered &#x201c;active.&#x201d; After that time, a prescription may be removed from the patient's Active Medications list, but may or may not be retained in other records. ePrescribing may also support manual addition to and/or removal from the Active Medications list.</p>
<p id="p-0114" num="0130">An embodiment of ePrescribing may provide several different ways to display information about a patient's medication history or subsets of it. For example, the Active Medications list and/or the list of all medications on the patient's chart may be displayed and may be sorted according to one or more criteria.</p>
<p id="p-0115" num="0131">When displaying details of a particular medication, an embodiment of ePrescribing may permit the user to view and/or print a copy of the prescription.</p>
<p id="p-0116" num="0132"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 7</figref> illustrates how a new prescription may be written <b>500</b> in association with an ePrescribing. At block <b>505</b>, a patient's chart is accessed, possibly as described in connection with <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>, above. Once the patient has been selected, the user may begin <b>507</b> creating the prescription.</p>
<p id="p-0117" num="0133">At block <b>509</b>, the identity of the health care provider who is writing the prescription is selected or confirmed. In some EHR systems, the user's login information may serve to identify a default provider, who may be the user. Some systems may permit overriding the default choice. Some may limit the choice of provider to one or more providers who have previously been associated with the user.</p>
<p id="p-0118" num="0134">A destination may be assigned <b>511</b> to a prescription. Depending on the embodiment of ePrescribing, possibilities may comprise one or more of, e.g., sample or handwritten prescriptions, prescriptions sent to pharmacies electronically or by fax, and prescriptions sent electronically to mail-order prescription sellers.</p>
<p id="p-0119" num="0135">Sample prescriptions may represent drugs dispensed directly by the provider, which may be samples provided to the provider by drug makers or distributors. Handwritten prescriptions may, for example, be printed by an embodiment of this application and then manually signed by the provider or manually written in their entirety by the provider. Handwritten prescriptions may be used, for example, where a pharmacy is not equipped to receive prescriptions electronically or by fax, or where applicable law or regulation requires a paper prescription bearing an authorized provider's original signature.</p>
<p id="p-0120" num="0136">If the prescription is to be sent directly to a pharmacy, block <b>511</b> may comprise selection of the recipient pharmacy.</p>
<p id="p-0121" num="0137">In block <b>513</b>, a medication is selected for prescribing. Once the medication and the patient are selected, one or more checks may be performed against one or more databases. Depending on the embodiment of ePrescribing, such checks may comprise, for example, one or more of checking the formulary <b>515</b> applicable to the patient; checking the drug against the patient's known allergies <b>517</b>; and checking for interactions <b>519</b> between drugs that the patient is known to be taking. Block <b>521</b> represents presentation to the user of the results of some or all of these checks.</p>
<p id="p-0122" num="0138">After reviewing any results of any checks, the provider may confirm <b>523</b> the selected drug or to go back choose another medication <b>513</b>. Once the provider confirms a selected medication, other details of the prescription may be provided <b>527</b>. Depending on the embodiment of ePrescribing, such details may comprise one or more of, for example, the dosing frequency, the amount of the medication to be dispensed, the length of time that the patient ought to take the drug, the number of refills allowed, and whether a brand-name drug, if prescribed, may be replaced by its generic equivalent, if any.</p>
<p id="p-0123" num="0139">An embodiment of ePrescribing may support prescriptions that comprise one or more medications. In such embodiments, block <b>529</b> represents the choice to add a medication to the prescription that is in progress.</p>
<p id="p-0124" num="0140">Following selection of desired medications, block <b>531</b> represents disposition of the prescription. Depending on the embodiment of ePrescribing and/or the options associated with the prescription, possible dispositions may comprise, for example, printing a prescription for manual signature, transmitting the prescription to a pharmacy electronically or by fax, and/or storing the prescription for possible future action, possibly comprising, among other things, electronic review by a payer. Block <b>533</b> represents addition of a prescription to a patient's chart.</p>
<p id="p-0125" num="0141">Embodiments of ePrescribing may support the association (not pictured) of notes with a prescription and/or some or all of the medications contained in it.</p>
<p id="p-0126" num="0142"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 8</figref> elaborates a possible implementation <b>550</b> of checking a formulary. Formularies exist because formulary management may benefit payer organizations. The payers make available the different formulary options to meet both the financial needs of an employer and the benefit needs of employees. But since there are thousands of payers and each payer can have several plans, there are thousands of plans and formularies, all of which may need to be managed.</p>
<p id="p-0127" num="0143">In block <b>552</b>, the patient's eligibility for a particular plan is checked against one or more databases. If the patient is eligible, then the appropriate formulary for that plan is retrieved in block <b>554</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0128" num="0144">From one or more databases, from the formulary, or both, a list of drugs similar to the prescribed drug is retrieved in block <b>556</b>. A &#x201c;similar&#x201d; drug here is a drug with some or all of the same indications as the prescribed drug, or a drug that is prescribed in similar circumstances.</p>
<p id="p-0129" num="0145">In block <b>558</b>, the validity of the prescription is checked against the formulary. Finally, in block <b>560</b>, the results of the other blocks are returned. In some implementations of ePrescribing, the provider will be told that the prescribed drug is or is not on the formulary and will also be shown the list of the similar drugs that were identified in block <b>556</b>. If the information is available to the electronic prescribing system, the provider may also be told what co-payment will be required for the drug.</p>
<p id="p-0130" num="0146">Other ways (not pictured) exist to check formularies. For example, all relevant formulary data may be obtained at the commencement of an ePrescribing operation. Then, before any information regarding a drug is presented, that drug is checked against the applicable formulary, and the displayed information reflects he formulary status of the drug.</p>
<p id="p-0131" num="0147"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 9</figref> depicts an example of prescription writing screen <b>580</b> that may be used in association with embodiments of ePrescribing.</p>
<p id="p-0132" num="0148">As in other example screens, the prescription-writing screen <b>580</b> displays basic information <b>370</b> that identifies the selected patient.

Also in the medication selection area <b>605</b> is a hyperlink <b>611</b> that leads to a display (not pictured) of one or more &#x201c;favorite&#x201d; medications, the contents of which depend on the embodiment. Selection of a medication may cause display (not pictured) of one or more forms and/or dosages in which that medication may be dispensed.</p>
<p id="p-0136" num="0152">Any display of information related to a medication may comprise information regarding the formulary status of that medication. Many ways of conveying such information are well-known, and may comprise, e.g., arranging names of medications in a display; providing textual labels; visually associating one or more icons with the displayed medication; and/or varying the typeface, size, style, color and/or other attributes of the text used; among other indications.</p>
<p id="p-0137" num="0153">In addition to or instead of the preceding, any display of information related to a medication may comprise information regarding interactions between that medication and a patient's allergies and/or other medications that a patient is known to be taking. Display of such information may take varying forms as above.</p>
<p id="p-0138" num="0154">Display of information related to a medication may comprise display of information regarding other medications, comprising, for example, generic equivalents to a medication and/or possible alternatives to a medication.</p>

For example, an EHR system may restrict the ability to order lab tests to physicians, and such a system may support use of the ordering physician's Medicare Unique Physician Identification Number (&#x201c;UPIN&#x201d;) to uniquely identify that physician.</p>
<p id="p-0152" num="0168">An EHR system may support entry <b>688</b> of billing information for the associated patient and/or verification of such information already provided. Such information may comprise, for example, the name of the person who bears financial responsibility for the patient and/or information regarding the patient's insurance or other payment arrangements. An EHR system may use this information in conjunction with one or more facilities for automating payment, billing, and/or collection.</p>
<p id="p-0153" num="0169">In block <b>690</b>, one or more diagnoses associated with the patient may be entered. Diagnoses may be represented by one or more codes, e.g., codes from the standard International Classification of Disease (ICD). An EHR system may accept locally-defined codes in addition to or instead of standard codes. Similarly, an EHR system may accept textual specifications of diagnoses in addition to or instead of codes of any sort.</p>
<p id="p-0154" num="0170">One or more specimens may be subjects of lab tests. Block <b>692</b> represents entry of information regarding a specimen associated with a test order. Such information may comprise, for example, the date and time the specimen was collected, the volume of the specimen, and/or whether the patient fasted. An EHR system may vary the information collected depending on which test is selected and/or may refuse to accept an order that omits some or all information.</p>
<p id="p-0155" num="0171">In block <b>694</b>, depending on the system, one or more lab tests may be selected. Also depending on the system, a user may select from tests offered by one lab or from a plurality of labs.</p>
<p id="p-0156" num="0172">An EHR system may provide access to one or more tests that require additional information before a lab can perform the tests. In block <b>696</b>, such Ask at Order Entry (&#x201c;AOE&#x201d;) information can be obtained and added to the order information.</p>
<p id="p-0157" num="0173">An EHR system may use entered patient, payment, diagnosis, order, and/or AOE information to verify (not pictured) that a test order will be covered by the patient's payment plan. Such a system may indicate coverage status visually.</p>
<p id="p-0158" num="0174">Block <b>698</b> depicts review of entered order information. In some EHR systems, creation <b>680</b> of a lab order may be interrupted (not pictured) at this point, with the order information stored for future use. In such a system, such stored information may be retrieved and the order completed. Once the information is believed correct, the order may be sent in block <b>700</b> to, depending on the embodiment, one or more labs for processing. In block <b>702</b>, a sent order may be stored, possibly in association with the patient's chart.</p>
<p id="p-0159" num="0175">Sending an order as depicted in block <b>700</b> may comprise sending the order to a lab electronically, by fax, and/or other means, depending on the EHR system and/or its configuration.</p>
<p id="p-0160" num="0176">Following creation <b>680</b> of a lab order as depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 10</figref>, an EHR system may arrange automatically for retrieval (not pictured) of the physical specimen or specimens associated with one or more ordered tests. Such arrangements may comprise, for example, adding the location of the health care provider's office to the route of a courier who picks up such specimens. In some EHR systems, an order may request that a technician be dispatched to the patient's location (e.g., home or office) to obtain a sample. Another possible arrangement may involve automatic generation of shipping orders and documents for a common carrier such as UPS&#xae; or FedEx&#xae;. It will be appreciated that many other such arrangements are possible.</p>
<p id="p-0161" num="0177">An EHR system may support variations of lab order creation <b>680</b> in addition to or instead of creation <b>680</b> as depicted. For example, information entered as described may serve to create a standing lab order, which may be repeated as specified by the user. A previously-entered order may serve as a template for creation of a new order. Many other variations are possible and may be supported by an EHR system.</p>
<p id="p-0162" num="0178">Test results may be provided electronically to an EHR system. An EHR system may accept result in other forms, e.g., results printed on paper may be accepted via optical scanning or manual data entry. Other ways to provide and accept test results are apparent. An EHR system may accept test results regardless of whether a test was electronically ordered.</p>
<p id="p-0163" num="0179">An EHR system may receive one or more test results that lack information sufficient to match the results with a requisition or a patient. A system may thus provide one or more facilities for matching such orders with the corresponding records.</p>
<p id="p-0164" num="0180"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 11</figref> depicts the test result screen <b>730</b> that may appear in an EHR system. An EHR system may provide one or more ways to reach test results, and one way that the depicted screen <b>730</b> may be reached is from the patient summary screen <b>360</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>). The test result screen <b>730</b> comprises basic information <b>370</b> that may identify the patient associated with a test. The test result screen <b>730</b> may comprise other information about the test results and the associated requisition, e.g., a requisition number <b>740</b>, the prescriber's name <b>742</b>, the patient's name <b>744</b>, the date and/or time when the tested sample was obtained <b>746</b>, and/or a summary <b>748</b> of the test results, among other things.</p>
<p id="p-0165" num="0181">Test details <b>756</b> may be presented. A title bar <b>758</b> indicates the name <b>759</b> of the test and/or panel of tests. Below the title are the results <b>760</b> of one or more tests.</p>
<p id="p-0166" num="0182">As illustrated in the test result screen <b>730</b>, a test result <b>760</b> comprises the name <b>762</b> of a substance or property (either may be called an &#x201c;analyte&#x201d;) for which a test was performed. The result <b>760</b> may also comprise a short description <b>764</b> of the test or analyte; a number representing the value <b>766</b> of the analyte; and/or the units <b>768</b> of the measurement. For reference, a range <b>770</b> of typical values for the analyte may be provided, as well as one or more visual indications <b>772</b> that a measured value is abnormal.</p>
<p id="p-0167" num="0183">For example, the test result screen <b>730</b> illustrates the results of a panel of tests called a &#x201c;Basic Metabolic Panel.&#x201d; One test in the panel is a test for potassium <b>774</b>. The reference range <b>770</b> for potassium is between 3.5-5.3 millimoles per liter, but the test measured only 1.0 millimoles per liter <b>766</b>. A &#x201c;&#x3c;&#x201d; character <b>772</b> thus appears to the right of this abnormal result, indicating that measurement was below a range that may be considered normal. A user interface screen may comprise other indicia of abnormal test results, e.g., symbolic icons and/or text coloring.</p>
<p id="p-0168" num="0184">Test results over time may be presented. For example, graphs and/or charts (not pictured) may depict the values of one or more tests over time. A report may present the same information textually. Other ways of presenting test results will be apparent, and an EHR system may comprise any or all such presentations.</p>
<p id="p-0169" num="0185">An EHR system may comprise search, retrieval, and/or report generation facilities (not pictured). Such facilities may, depending on the system, comprise manipulation of one or more test results for one or more patients, individually or collectively. For example, an EHR system may allow a user to search for results of all glucose tests given in the past month to male patients between the ages of 45 and 59, in which the test detected an abnormal level of glucose. Such facilities may serve, for example, to identify clusters of abnormal test results, which may in some circumstances signal a spreading health problem. An EHR system may comprise tools for creating graphical and/or textual reports of such searches.</p>
<p id="h-0014" num="0000">User Messaging</p>
<p id="p-0170" num="0186">An EHR system may comprise an electronic messaging facility that embodies this invention. According to such an embodiment of the invention, users can communicate with other users whether they reside in the same organization or care site, reside in a separate physical office location, or are members of a separate organization. An embodiment of the invention may make it possible to refer, within the user message, to specific clinical acts for a patient, including, for example, lab reports, medications, and/or allergies. This function may be desirable for purposes related to patient care, including, for example: patient referrals; answering of patient questions; and providing care instructions to other clinicians.</p>
<p id="p-0171" num="0187"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 12</figref> depicts composing and sending <b>800</b> a message in accordance with an embodiment of the invention. An EHR system may support one or more means to begin <b>802</b> composing a message. For example, in the patient summary screen <b>360</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>), the function-dependent navigation pane <b>202</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) may contain a hyperlink <b>446</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) to a user interface that supports composing a message.</p>
<p id="p-0172" num="0188">In block <b>804</b>, the user may specify one or more message recipient(s). EHR systems may differ on how recipients are specified. For example, an embodiment provide a control (not pictured) in which a name or address of a recipient may be entered. An EHR system may provide the names of one or more known users, from whom one or more recipients may be selected. These and other ways of selecting recipients are well known in connection with electronic messaging, and EHR systems may support one or more such ways.</p>
<p id="p-0173" num="0189">Other information may be entered; for example, an embodiment of the invention may support entry of a message subject <b>806</b>, a reason for disclosure of patient information <b>808</b>, and/or the content of the message <b>810</b>. An embodiment may, for example, support entry of a reason for disclosure of information to track the distribution of health information that is required by law to be kept confidential.</p>
<p id="p-0174" num="0190">If desired, clinical information from a client's chart may be attached <b>812</b> to the user message. The user message may then be sent <b>814</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0175" num="0191">The message composition screen <b>830</b> of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 13</figref> depicts a user interface display adapted to composing and sending a user message. A text box <b>832</b> contains the names of one or more recipients. Depending on the embodiment of the invention, recipients' names may or may not be directly entered in text box <b>832</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0176" num="0192">Recipients may also be entered by following the hyperlink <b>834</b> labeled &#x201c;Search Recipients.&#x201d; The hyperlink <b>834</b> may lead to a display (not pictured) allowing entry of one or more criteria to be used to search for potential recipients of the message. The hyperlink <b>834</b> may lead also, depending on the embodiment, to a display (not pictured) of the names of one or more recent recipients of user messages. Depending on the embodiment of the invention, one or more recipients may be added though either means or both. Embodiments of the invention may provide other ways to add recipients in addition to or instead of the ones described here.</p>
<p id="p-0177" num="0193">Text areas support entry of a subject <b>836</b> for the message and the message body <b>838</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0178" num="0194">The hyperlink <b>840</b> labeled &#x201c;Search and attach a patient chart&#x201d; may serve to attach chart data to a message. When followed, the hyperlink <b>840</b> may lead to a user interface that supports selecting a patient, such as, for example, the patient selection screen <b>290</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 4</figref>. In some embodiments, if message composition was initiated from a screen associated with a patient, such as, e.g., the patient summary screen <b>360</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>, searching for and/or selecting a user may be skipped.</p>
<p id="p-0179" num="0195">Depending on the embodiment of the invention, once a patient has been selected, a screen such as the patient summary screen <b>360</b> (<figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 5</figref>) may be displayed. That screen, in turn, may be used to access that patient's chart data. Individual items of data may be selected. Once desired items have been selected, a hyperlink (not pictured) or other means may enable return to the message composition screen <b>830</b>. Upon return to the message composition screen <b>830</b>, the selected data items will have been attached to the message. Embodiments of the invention may support removal of attached data from a draft message and/or attachment of further data.</p>
<p id="p-0180" num="0196">The button <b>842</b> labeled &#x201c;Send&#x201d; allows sending the message, including any attachments. The button <b>844</b> labeled &#x201c;Cancel&#x201d; allows cancellation of a pending message. An embodiment of the invention may also provide means (not pictured) by which a draft of a message may be saved and then sent later, possibly after further revision.</p>
<p id="p-0181" num="0197">In an embodiment of the invention, the message composition screen <b>830</b> may comprise a control <b>846</b> for entry of one or more reasons for disclosure of patient information. Such reasons may be legally required or otherwise desirable.</p>
<p id="p-0182" num="0198"><figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> is a partial representation of an electronic message <b>862</b> with attached chart data according to an embodiment of the invention. The representation uses the eXtensible Markup Language (XML), which is a well-known tool for representing structured data for storage, processing, and/or transfer.</p>
<p id="p-0183" num="0199">The representation of the message <b>862</b> comprises three top-level components. The first top-level component is the header <b>864</b>, which, depending on the embodiment of the invention, may comprise information relevant to handling the message, e.g., the sender <b>866</b>, the recipient <b>868</b>, and/or the subject <b>870</b> of the message, among other things.</p>
<p id="p-0184" num="0200">The second top-level component is the body <b>874</b>, which in this illustration contains only the text of the message.</p>
<p id="p-0185" num="0201">The third top-level component is the attachment element <b>880</b>, which may comprise zero or more attachments <b>882</b>. The illustrated representation does not directly represent attached chart data, but instead contains a reference <b>884</b> (often called a &#x201c;pointer&#x201d;) that uniquely refers to a specific entry on a specific patient's chart. The meaning and resolution of references depends on the embodiment. One possible meaning (of many) is that the reference <b>884</b> is a unique identifier that is part of the record of the chart item that appears in one or more tables in a relational database management system. The existence of a unique identifier called a &#x201c;primary key&#x201d; is well known in the relevant arts, and some embodiments may use a representation of a primary key as a reference <b>884</b> to chart data.</p>
<p id="p-0186" num="0202">The XML fragment of <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 14</figref> serves primarily to illustrate the data that a message may in some embodiments comprise, by depicting certain aspects of data associated with a message and one possible representation of those aspects. It will be appreciated that different and/or additional data may be associated with a message and that many other representations are possible, including, for example, differently-structured XML documents and/or representations other than those using a markup language such as XML. For example, an embodiment of the invention may store data associated with a message in one or more fields of one or more tables in a relational database management system.</p>
<p id="p-0187" num="0203">An embodiment of the invention may use the reference <b>884</b> to identify the item of chart data referred to. This process may be called &#x201c;dereferencing.&#x201d; Dereferencing a pointer reveals an item of chart data, which the recipient may view. If the item is saved to a patient's chart, an embodiment of the invention may duplicate the item and then save the new copy in association with the recipient's version of that patient's chart. Instead of duplicating an item of chart data, an embodiment of the invention may give the recipient direct access to the item on the sender's chart.</p>
<p id="p-0188" num="0204">Some embodiments of the invention may support both options, choosing one or the other based on circumstances. For example, if the sender and recipient are in practice together, they may have access to the same charts. In that case, viewing an attached item of chart data may comprise accessing the shared chart. If the sender and receiver are not in practice together, the recipient may lack privileges to access the sender's chart directly, and the attached chart item may then be duplicated, and the copy saved, as already described.</p>
<p id="p-0189" num="0205">After an electronic message has been delivered, it may be viewed, and, in some embodiments of the invention, some or all attached data may be viewed and/or saved to a patient's chart. <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> depicts a user interface display <b>890</b> that an embodiment of the invention may use to present a message and attached data and to allow the recipient to view attached chart data and possibly to save it.</p>
<p id="p-0190" num="0206">The message display may be divided into three areas. A header area <b>895</b> may display information about the message itself. In an embodiment of this invention, this information may comprise, e.g., the recipient <b>897</b> and sender <b>898</b>; a subject, title, or summary of the message <b>899</b>; the reason <b>900</b> for disclosing the attached patient records (if any) to the recipient; and the time <b>901</b> when the message was sent. The header area <b>895</b> may display other information in addition or instead of the depicted information.</p>
<p id="p-0191" num="0207">A body area <b>905</b> displays the body <b>907</b> of the electronic message. In an embodiment of the invention, the body <b>907</b> comprises text. In other embodiments of the invention, the body <b>907</b> may comprise images and/or other multimedia content (not pictured) and/or hyperlinks to other data (not pictured).</p>
<p id="p-0192" num="0208">An attachments area <b>910</b> displays information associated with attachments <b>912</b>, if any, to the electronic message. In the depicted embodiment of the invention, each line comprises a summary of information about a single attached chart item. For example, the first displayed chart item is a prescription <b>913</b>. The display is a summary that comprises an item number <b>914</b> that uniquely identifies the chart item within the EHR system, the name <b>915</b> of the prescribed drug, the form <b>916</b> of the drug, and the date of the prescription <b>917</b>. One or more of the components of the summary of the prescription <b>913</b> may act as hyperlinks to further data (not pictured) related to the chart item.</p>
<p id="p-0193" num="0209">The next displayed chart item is a panel <b>920</b> of laboratory tests. The display is a summary that in the depicted embodiment of the invention comprises an item number <b>906</b>, the name and date <b>922</b> of the test panel, and a code <b>924</b> indicating the status of the panel <b>920</b>. The codes and their meanings depend on the embodiment of the invention, but in the depicted embodiment, the code &#x201c;F&#x201d; indicates that the status of the test panel <b>920</b> is &#x201c;final,&#x201d; which means that results are available for all tests <b>928</b> comprised by the panel <b>920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0194" num="0210">A panel comprises one or more laboratory tests. The panel <b>920</b> depicted in <figref idref="DRAWINGS">FIG. 15</figref> comprises blood tests for glucose <b>930</b> and urea nitrogen <b>932</b>, among others. In the depicted embodiment of the invention, the information for each test comprises the name <b>936</b> of the analyte, the value <b>938</b> detected by the laboratory, a &#x201c;reference range&#x201d; <b>940</b>, which may represent a range of typical values for the analyte, and the units <b>942</b> of measurement in which the data are presented.</p>
<p id="p-0195" num="0211">The panel <b>920</b> may be regarded as a single data item, as may be the prescription <b>913</b>. But it comprises several tests <b>928</b>, each of which may itself be regarded as a data item. The panel <b>920</b> may therefore be described as a hierarchical data item, and may be viewed either on a single line as a single data item or on multiple lines as an object comprising multiple data items. The triangle <b>936</b> is a control that toggles between the two views of the panel <b>920</b>.</p>
<p id="p-0196" num="0212">If, as in the depicted user interface display <b>890</b>, full display of information about the attachments would exceed the available space in the attachments area <b>910</b>, the attachments area <b>910</b> may contain a control <b>946</b> supporting scrolling through the displayed list of attachments.</p>
<p id="p-0197" num="0213">Each data item in the attachments area <b>910</b> is associated with a checkbox control <b>938</b>, by which a user may choose to save that chart item to a chart managed by that user. In an embodiment of the invention, selecting a checkbox control <b>938</b> next to a hierarchical data item may cause selection of each data item that it comprises. In such an embodiment, the user may then deselect individual data items to exclude them from the chart.</p>
<p id="p-0198" num="0214">Once the user has selected one or more attached data items, the user may then select the save button <b>940</b>, causing the system to save a persistent copy of each selected data item to a chart managed by the user. In such a case, an embodiment of the invention may first check that the recipient has a chart for the associated patient, and, if not, permit the recipient to create one. Creation of a patient chart by the recipient may in an embodiment rely on some or all demographic information present in the sender's version of the patient chart.</p>
<p id="p-0199" num="0215">The copy is considered a persistent copy because it resides in nonvolatile storage and is not regarded by the system as a temporary file that may be subject to routine deletion.</p>
<p id="p-0200" num="0216">In creating copies of attached data, an embodiment of the invention may not be limited to the one or more data sets that the reference directly specifies. An embodiment may follow references to associated data to create a copy or copies of related data, including data providing semantic data, and to associate these copies with the copy of the directly-referenced data. The embodiment may follow such links to copy associated records to any desired level of indirection. For some associated data, copying the reference to the associated data may suffice.</p>
<p id="p-0201" num="0217">For example, data for a single test result may be associated with a set of data describing the data sample, a set of data describing the test panel, and/or a set of data related to payment for the test, among many other things. The result data may also be associated with information describing the vendor of laboratory services and/or the specifications for the particular test, again, among many other things. In an embodiment of the invention, copying the chart item containing such a test result may therefore comprise, e.g., copying all records specific to the test and/or patient, but copying only references to data that does not vary from test to test and/or is not specific to the particular test, panel, and patient.</p>
<p id="p-0202" num="0218">In making such a copy, an embodiment of the invention has access to all data and metadata, including semantic data, that the sender has access to. Such an embodiment may thus preserve any or all such data when copying the data for the recipient.</p>
<p id="p-0203" num="0219">Embodiments of the invention may comprise facilities for managing user messages. Such facilities are well known and may comprise, for example, one or more of: viewing sent or received messages; filtering messages according to one or more criteria; deleting messages, replying to messages, forwarding messages to other users; sending messages via fax; searching and/or retrieving stored messages; and/or other facilities.</p>
